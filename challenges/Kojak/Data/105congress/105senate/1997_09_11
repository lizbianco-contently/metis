That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time then on each side?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifteen minutes on each side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank Senator \nKennedy.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1081, as amended\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we had an extensive discussion on the \nNickles amendment last time. I just want to speak for a very brief \nperiod of time about it this morning.\n  Pending before a Federal court in New York, scheduled to be \nconsidered next Friday, is a motion by the election officer of the 1996 \nTeamsters election. A judge will make a decision then. And the problem \nwith this amendment, Mr. President, is that it essentially tells the \njudge what to do.\n  I would like to say this morning that in many ways this reminds me of \nyesterday. This is an overreach. I think we are getting a little bit \ncarried away with our power here.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma is a fine Senator. But he is not a judge. \nIt is Senator Nickles. It is not ``Judge Nickles.'' We don't really \nhave the right to tell a judge what kind of decision he should make \nregarding the 1989 consent decree. That is for the judge to decide next \nweek.\n  Mr. President, it is true that we had an election, and it is true \nthat it was not satisfactory. And, indeed, the investment that we made \nto make sure it was a clean and fair election lead to a report, and the \nelection officer essentially saying there has to be a rerun; that this \nhas to be done again. That is the way it is supposed to be. An election \nwhich is not a fair election means that you have to have another \nelection. That is where we are heading.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Oklahoma has said that the consent \ndecree was neutral as to whether there would be any more money spent on \nthe election--silent on that matter. If so, on the Kennedy amendment, \nwhat my colleague from Massachusetts has talked about is right on the \nmark; that we make a commitment that we will not do anything here that \nwill overturn, or essentially contradict, that consent decree.\n  The judge makes the decision in New York next week. What are we as a \nU.S. Senate doing trying to tell that judge how he should decide? That \nis an overreach. That is not our business. I think it raises \nconstitutional questions. But I also think it raises another set of \nquestions. I said this last time. I will repeat it in the last minute \nor two that I have.\n  Whatever the intentions of my colleague--and I know they are good \nintentions--the fact of the matter is that there is a whole lot of \npeople in the country who find the timing of the Nickles amendment to \nbe suspect. I mean it comes in a relatively short period of time after \na very successful justice struggle by UPS workers and by the Teamsters. \nIt just looks like payback time. That is, I am sure, not his intention.\n  But the point of it is the timing is off. It doesn't look good for \nthe U.S. Senate to be coming out on the floor of the Senate with an \namendment like this short on the heels of this great victory for \nworking people. And, in addition, it is an overreach. I mean we should \nnot be telling the judge what kind of decision a Federal district judge \nin New York makes next week. I don't think it is constitutionally the \nright thing to do. I think it is probably unconstitutional. I don't \nthink it is appropriate, and I hope that there will be a very strong \nvote against the Nickles amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, whether it is the intention \nor not the intention of those that propose this amendment, one can \nreach no other conclusion that this amendment is on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate because of the success of the Teamsters in the recent UPS \nstrike. For the first time in many years, the Nation focused on the \nparticular needs of part-time workers--their future, their security, \nand their well-being.\n  During that UPS strike, one of the key points that was made--and \nwhich I think resonated across the country--was that part-time workers \ndon't have part-time mortgages, don't have part-time bills when they \nare feeding their children, don't have part-time bills when they are \ntrying to work for their families, and bring up their families, and \nthat in this Nation with our growing and expanding economy--and with \nthe strongest economy that we have had in many years--part-time workers \nshould not be excluded. That is the key issue. There are many of those \nthat fought that issue. But, nonetheless, as a result of collective \nbargaining, part-time workers' needs were recognized. I think America \nunderstood this issue much better. Pension issues were resolved to try \nto ensure that we are not going to only have Social Security to rely on \nwhen they retire but at least have some benefit in terms of their \npensions for men and women that work hard over a long period of time.\n  Those were the negotiations. Now there are many, and many in this \nbody, that do not like the outcome of that particular measure. They \nhave put this measure that is before us, which I think is really a \nreflection of that success.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, if we accept this amendment of Senators \nNickles and Gregg, we will be directly interfering with a consent \ndecree that was agreed to by a Republican administration, agreed to by \na Republican Attorney General, Attorney General Thornburgh, and it was \nheralded at that period of time as a great success by Republicans in \ntrying to clean up corruption in a particular union. The fact is that \nwhen the Teamsters have a Teamster Union election, the Teamsters pay \nfor it. But under that consent decree, if there are going to be Federal \nsupervisors involved in this, and the Federal Government is going to be \ninvolved in ensuring that the election is going to be fair, then the \nFederal Government is going to be paying for this and participating.\n  We are not saying now and in the future when this matter is before \nthe courts what the future is going to be, or whether there is going to \nbe another election and who ought to pay for it. All we are saying is \nlet the consent decree that is in place now continue to be respected \nand not be undermined by actions by the legislative body which is a \ndirect interference into the separation of powers and into the judicial \ndecision to have a consent decree by which the executive body agreed \nto.\n  That is the issue, Mr. President, and there are many important \nscholars that agree that, if we do have this kind of interference in a \nconsent decree, we are going to subject this body to a contempt action \nbecause we will be interfering in a consent decree.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that we ought to follow the regular \norder. This overall agreement consent decree is before the Southern \nDistrict Court in New York. Briefs are being required by the middle of \nthis month. There will be a judgment to be made by the judge in that \ndecision. And we ought to respect that particular decision which has \nbeen agreed on and it is now a matter of consent decree. We should not \ninterfere with a consent decree with a legislative intrusion. There are \nno funds in this appropriations affecting that particular settlement. \nAnd we have no business, as the Senator from Alaska has pointed out, a \nRepublican, to be adding these kinds of extraneous issues into an \nappropriations bill. It makes no sense.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in listening to my colleagues, I heard, \n``Well, the reason why this amendment is offered is because the \nTeamsters strike against UPS was a phenomenal success.'' I have never \ncommented on that. But I don't know that I could consider success that \nthey have 15,000 fewer workers today after the strike than they had \nbefore the strike.\n  I know that some people characterize it. But I will tell my \ncolleagues, you can question my integrity or not, that is not the \nreason I am offering this amendment. I am offering this amendment \nbecause I read that taxpayers\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\npaid $22 million for it. I don't know who won that strike. With strikes \nI think basically everybody loses. I think the company loses, and the \nworkers lose. And if you have 15,000 fewer jobs, that is a loss. And \ncertainly the company loses lots of money and lots of customers. So \nthat is a loss.\n  But that is not the purpose of my amendment. The purpose of my \namendment is that I didn't know that the taxpayers were paying for that \nelection.\n  I thought, why did we pay for that election? Well, there was a \nconsent decree order in 1989 that said we will have a couple of \nelections to deal with, 1991 and 1996. And they agreed in the consent \ndecree to supervise all future Teamsters elections. It is in the \nconsent decree. They said, in 1991, the Teamsters will pay for it. They \nsaid, in 1996, the taxpayers will pay for it. They were silent on any \nsubsequent elections.\n  I want to make sure that we do not pay for it. I do not think we \nshould have paid for the one in 1996. I did not know about it until \nafter the fact. So if anybody wants to question my motives, I almost \ncould put out--I am not questioning other people's motives. I have not \nraised the fact the Teamsters put in so much money in these elections, \nand so on. I have never said people are out here defending this because \nthey received support. I am not going to do it. I am not questioning \nother people's motives.\n  I am a little sensitive to that statement because it was made last \nweek, and I did not respond to it earlier this week and now it is \nrepeated. That is infringing, or very close to infringing on Senate \nrules.\n  We have a right to say how money is appropriated in this body. My \ncolleague from Minnesota said, well, maybe in this institution a \nconsent decree overrides the Constitution. I do not think so. In the \nConstitution of the United States, article I, section 9 says, ``No \nmoney shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of \nappropriations made by law.''\n  That is by Congress. Article I of the Constitution says, under \ncongressional powers, Congress has the right to appropriate money. We \nhave the right basically not to appropriate money, and that is what \nthis amendment says. This amendment says we do not want to spend \nanother $22 million. We can supervise the election. Frankly, we have to \nsupervise the election. The consent decree says we will supervise the \nelection.\n  What happened in the last election? According to the report that was \ndone by the election officer of the Teamsters' last election, ``The \nviolation of the rules described above were not merely''--this is a \nquote from her report, and I will put it into the record. ``The \nviolations of the rules described above were not merely technical but \nproducts of schemes to funnel union and outside money into the election \nand thus change the outcome. These were egregious violations by high \nlevel functionaries who believed that winning at all costs was more \nimportant than abiding by the rules and the law. Members cannot have \nconfidence in their union or its leaders if they see that their choice \nof officers has been manipulated by outsiders. The election officer has \nsearched for means of properly remedying the violations while at the \nsame time avoiding the burden on the union and its members inherent in \nholding a new election. Unfortunately, no such path is apparent.''\n  Mr. President I will ask unanimous consent that at least these two \npages of the report of the election officer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Election Officer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\n\n       In re: Jeraldine Cheatem; Robert H. Spearman; Jim Hoffa--No \n     dues increase--25 and out slate; Jerry Halberg; James P. \n     Hoffa.\n\n\n                          decision correction\n\n       The first full paragraph on page 130 should read as \n     follows:\n       An order of the Election Officer, unless otherwise stayed, \n     takes immediate effect against a party found in violation of \n     the Rules.

Spearman; Jim Hoffa--No \n     dues increase--25 and out slate; Jerry Halberg; James P. \n     Hoffa.\n\n\n                        summary of decision \\1\\\n\n       The Election Officer for the International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters (``IBT'') was appointed by the U.S. District Court \n     for the Southern District of New York to supervise and \n     conduct the rank-and-file election for International officers \n     to ensure a free, fair and informed process. Her duties arise \n     from the 1989 Consent Decree approved by the District Court \n     in a case brought by the government under federal \n     racketeering laws. The ballot count in the 1996 International \n     officer election concluded on February 27, 1997. This \n     decision follows the investigation of numerous post-election \n     protests.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ This summary has been prepared by the Office of the \n     Election Officer for the convenience of the parties and the \n     general reader. The summary is not part of the decision and \n     may not be cited before the Election Appeals Master, the \n     District Court, or any other tribunal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Part I of the decision addresses several protests which \n     challenged the fairness and accuracy of the ballot count. \n     Following a detailed explanation of the receipt, processing, \n     and count of the ballots, those protests are denied.\n       Parts II and III of the decision address allegations that \n     non-IBT members made $221,000 in improper contributions to \n     Teamsters for a Corruption Free Union (``TCFU''), a \n     fundraising committee of the Ron Carey Campaign. The Election \n     Officer concludes that the contributions violated the \n     Election Rules' prohibition against employer and IBT \n     contributions.\n       The TCFU contributions were used by the Carey Campaign to \n     fund approximately 40% of a direct mail get-out-the-vote \n     program. Given the small margins between the winning \n     candidates on the Carey slate and the losing candidates on \n     the Hoffa slate, the * * *\n       * * * in their attacks on the positions, records, and \n     integrity of the opposing candidates. One may question \n     whether such campaigns are the most effective in winning \n     votes or even building democratic institutions, but no one \n     can question that this campaign was as open and competitive \n     as any undertaken in an American labor union in recent \n     history.\n       Preserving the new open spirit within the IBT requires some \n     sacrifice. Certainly the hardship on the candidates and the \n     members of rerunning so massive an election is a factor to \n     weigh in this decision. A rerun election inevitably affects \n     the Union as an institution, as many of its leaders, at both \n     the local and national level, become diverted from the \n     central work of bargaining and enforcing contracts and \n     organizing new members. Many members of this Union want \n     nothing more than to return to the basic tasks of trade \n     unionism and have looked forward to a respite from the almost \n     ceaseless campaigning of the past two years. However, there \n     are even greater dangers if strong action is not taken when \n     employers secretly attempt to influence the election of IBT \n     officers. The violations of the Rules described above were \n     not merely technical, but products of schemes to funnel Union \n     and outside money into the election and thus change the \n     outcome. These were egregious violations by high level \n     campaign functionaries who believed winning at all costs was \n     more important than abiding by the Rules and the law. Members \n     cannot have confidence in their Union or its leaders if they \n     see that their choice of officers has been manipulated by \n     outsiders. They cannot have confidence in the Consent Decree \n     if Court officers do not take effective action to prevent and \n     remedy such misconduct.\n       The Election Officer has searched for a means of properly \n     remedying the violations while at the same time avoiding the \n     burden on the Union and its members inherent in holding a new \n     election. Unfortunately, no such path is apparent. The \n     election of International officers is the clearest expression \n     of the control of members over their union; it is also the \n     key to insuring that organized crime, employers, or any other \n     outsiders do not use the Union for their own purposes. To \n     avoid a rerun because of the disruption it brings could allow \n     this union to lose its most valuable resource: the support, \n     participation, and confidence of its membership. Such a \n     result cannot be allowed.\n       Because the violations of the Rules described above may \n     have affected the outcome of the election and further \n     threatened the integrity of the process, the Election Officer \n     hereby orders a rerun election for all International officer \n     positions except Central Region Vice * * *\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who seeks the floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 6 \nminutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the other side?\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes and fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nNickles amendment. This represents an unjustified intrusion by the \nCongress into the decades-long effort by Federal prosecutors to rid the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters of corrupt influences.\n  That is what is involved here, it is the effort to drive corrupt \ninfluences out of the Teamsters Union. Now, that effort has been \nvigorously pursued by both Republican and Democratic Departments of \nJustice. It culminated in litigation and ultimately a consent decree \nbetween the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United \nStates. This was a consent decree entered into by the Bush \nadministration and Attorney General Thornburgh, who hailed this as a \nmajor achievement, which I concede it was. And now Congress, with this \namendment, is seeking to interfere in that law enforcement effort at a \nvital moment.\n  In the 1989 consent decree, the Federal Government effectively \nentered into a contract to pay for the supervision of the 1996 \nelection. In fact, the consent decree is very clear in stating, ``The \nunion defendants consent to the election officer at Government expense \nto supervise the 1996 elections.'' And the rerun election we are \ntalking about is the 1996 election, which has not been certified. It is \nnow back before the court.\n  Now, this amendment breaches that agreement. It in effect violates \nthe consent decree.\n  It is asserted that unions typically pay for their own elections. \nThat is quite true. But in those elections they do not have election \nofficers, and they do not have Federal supervision of the election. \nWhat the consent decree said was that the union would pay for the 1991 \nelection and that the 1996 election would be supervised under the \nconsent decree at Government expense.\n  Now, the Teamsters already pay $3 to $4 million annually for consent \ndecree activities related to the effort to prevent corruption. Between \n1990 and 1995, they incurred costs in excess of $40 million in \ncomplying with its obligations and responsibilities under the consent \ndecree.\n  The danger with this amendment is that if the Government goes back on \nits undertaking to pay for the supervisory costs of the 1996 election, \nyou will take the Teamsters out from under the necessity of having an \nelection officer. You do not ordinarily get election officers to \nsupervise union elections.\n  My colleagues on the other side will say, well, what did we get out \nof it? What we got out of it was the continued supervision of the union \nelections into the 1996 election to help ensure that corrupt influences \nwould not creep back into the union and affect its legitimate \noperations. The executive branch agreed to this consent decree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is embodied in a court order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And this amendment blatantly violates that court order. \nI urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks the floor?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard the comments of my colleague from \nMaryland, but he is incorrect. The consent decree that was agreed to in \n1989 stated that the Teamsters would pay for the election. I will just \nread it. ``The union defendants further consent to U.S. Department of \nLabor''--this is from the consent decree, page 16--``supervising any \nIBT''--that is the Teamsters, International Brotherhood of Teamsters--\n``elections or special elections to be conducted after 1991 for the \noffice of President, Secretary, Treasurer, Vice President and \nTrustee.''\n  They have agreed to supervision. And the Federal Government \nsupervised the 1991 and 1996 elections. What was unique about the 1996 \nelection, we paid for it as well. We conducted it. We paid $22 million. \nI hope all my colleagues understand that. We paid $22 million, the \nFederal taxpayers paid $22 million for the 1996 election. It was the \none that was determined to be corrupt. We did not do that in 1991.\n  What was the difference? I think people are a lot more willing to \ncheat maybe if it is somebody else's money. And they did. There was \ncorruption with the taxpayers' money.\n  We will still have supervision. My amendment does not prohibit \nsupervision. It does not abrogate the consent decree. The consent \ndecree, frankly, was silent on who would pay for any subsequent \nelections. I even called the former Attorney General and asked him. No, \nwe did not say anything about that. I read this section. It is not \nthere.\n  Now, some people would like to interpret it as, oh, the taxpayers \nwill pay for this forever. If there is corruption in the next election, \nthe taxpayers will pay for it. If there is corruption in the next \nelection, we are going to continue having taxpayers get stiffed. In \nthis case, the Teamsters got hurt. I am talking about members of the \nTeamsters. Union members got hurt because they had a fraudulent \nelection. They have to have it again. And the taxpayers got hurt. I am \ntrying to say it wasn't the taxpayers' fault there was fraud last time. \nWe should not have taxpayers getting ripped off again.\n  What is the cost of this? Twenty-two million dollars. Every other \nunion in the country pays for their own election. Every other union in \nthe country. This is not a group that is not doing well. Senator \nKennedy and Senator Wellstone have been bragging how well they did in \nthe contract. I do not know what kind of improvements they got. I did \ncheck; I think the average wage is about $27 an hour, wages and \nbenefits. That is pretty good. That is $50,000-some a year. In the last \nelection, the taxpayers paid $22 million; there are 1.4 million \nTeamsters; a little less than 500,000 voted. That is a cost to the \ntaxpayers of about $45 a vote. That is pretty high. If the Teamsters \nhave to pay for this themselves, I calculate it is about $15 a member. \nThat is about a half-an-hour's pay. But they should have to pay for it. \nWhen any other union has an election, when the Teamsters have an \nelection, they pay for it. The taxpayers should not have to pay for \nthis.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment is consistent with the consent \ndecree. We are just trying to make it perfectly clear we are not going \nto pay for the next one. And for anyone to say, well, wait a minute; we \ndon't have the right to do that, they are not reading the Constitution. \nThe consent decree does not say anything about a future election. Maybe \nthey would like to have the discretion, and if the Teamsters have a \ngood attorney they can convince some judge, well, maybe this will be a \ncontinuation and therefore taxpayers should pay for it, but that is not \nin the consent decree. And frankly that should not happen.\n  By passing this amendment--and I am optimistic that we will pass this \namendment--we say we are not going to pay for it again. We got ripped \noff once. We paid $22 million for a fraudulent election. We, being the \ntaxpayers, paid $22 million for a fraudulent election last time. We \nshould not do it again. Frankly, we are not going to do it again.\n  Do we have the right to do this? Somebody said the consent decree \nsupersedes law. No way in the world. I will read a memo that came from \nDeputy U.S. Attorney Jamie Gorelick. This is dealing with the \nAntideficiency Act, but she said, ``You should be particularly mindful \nof this restriction if you are contemplating entering into any consent \ndecree. Please ensure the terms of the consent decree do not obligate \nthe government to spend funds beyond your office litigation budgets or \nbeyond the current fiscal year.''\n  They know that. The CRS did some study on the 1989 consent decree, \nand this was dated May 18, 1995. ``Legislation enacted by Congress \nlimiting or restricting funds for the 1996 election would be Federal \nlaw and Government parties would be bound to take appropriate action in \nreliance of that law.''\n  That would be if we had denied funding for the 1996 election. We \ndidn't do that. What this amendment will do is say we are going to deny \ntaxpayers' subsidy to the 1998 election. We can\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nstill have supervision. As a matter of fact, there will be supervision. \nThere will be supervision on any subsequent election, but it will not \nbe paid for by the taxpayers. Let the Teamsters pay for it. They are \nthe ones who engaged in this corruption. And if anyone looks at the \nreport of the election observer, she talks about ``outside money into \nthis election and thus change the outcome.'' She said there ``were \negregious violations by high level campaign functionaries who believed \nwinning at all costs was more important than abiding by the rules and \nthe law.''\n  I do not want to repeat that. If we allowed the opponents of this \namendment to prevail, we could have the exact same thing happen again. \nWe could have another election. We could have more corruption, and they \nwould be coming back to say, oh, we want you to pay for it again.\n  There is no end to what they say would be the outflow of Government \ndollars. I do not think it is needed. I do not think it is necessary. \nWe got ripped off once. We should not be ripped off again. And so I \nurge my colleagues to adopt the Nickles-Jeffords-Gregg amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Nickles \namendment to prohibit Federal funding to the Teamsters election an \namendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I believe this \namendment is a clear violation of the 1989 consent decree entered into \nby the Department of Justice and the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters.\n  The consent decree required, among other things, that the 1996 \nTeamsters' election be subject to the supervision of a court-appointed \nelection officer, at Government expense. Due to problems uncovered \nrelated to the campaign of the elected president, however, the court-\nappointed election officer has refused to certify the 1996 election and \nhas asked a Federal court in New York to formally order a new election. \nInasmuch as any court ordered election is a continuation of the 1996 \nelection, it seems clear that the rerun election must also be subject \nto the terms of the consent decree--including the portion of the decree \nwhich provides ``The union defendants consent to the election officer, \nat Government expense, to supervise the 1996 elections.''\n  I think it is important to recognize that this is not, or at least \nshould not, be a partisan issue. It was a Republican administration and \nthus, a Republican-controlled Department of Justice, that obligated the \nFederal Government to the financial obligations outlined in the 1989 \nconsent decree--not a Democratic administration. Rather, the Democratic \nadministration, under President Clinton, is simply living up to the \nobligations of the consent decree. If the Nickles amendment passes, the \nGovernment would be prohibited from paying for the rerun election and \nthus, could be held in contempt of court for failing to adhere to the \nterms of the consent decree. Again, this rerun election is not a new \nelection; rather, it is necessary to complete the 1996 election, and \nthus is subject to the 1989 consent decree.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment and to \nsupport this very important consent decree to which the Government \nobligated itself in 1989. Thank you Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what is the situation on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 2 minutes \n45 seconds; the Senator from Massachusetts controls 2 minutes and 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have been listening very carefully to \nmy colleague from Oklahoma. I am beginning to wonder, what is happening \nto this tremendous effort to drive corruption out of the Teamsters \nunion? The Senator quoted a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General \nJamie Gorelick, which is dated after the 1989 consent degree. I say to \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, you cited this memorandum of Deputy \nAttorney General Gorelick which comes after the 1989 consent decree. \nThe consent decree was entered into by Attorney General Thornburgh and \nthe Bush Administration. So, now we are told that a later memorandum is \ngoing to vitiate the earlier consent decree. How is that for undoing \nthe law?\n  The Senator is playing with fire. If this rerun is not the 1996 \nelection, then the results of the 1996 election ought to hold and there \nshould not be a further election. This is not a new election. This is a \nrerun of the 1996 election.\n  The Senator selectively quotes from the consent decree. The consent \ndecree is very clear. It says, ``The union defendants consent to the \nelection officer, at Government expense, to supervise the 1996 IBT \nelection.'' He omitted that part of the consent decree. My colleague \nthen quotes, ``The union defendants further consent to the Department \nof Labor supervising IBT elections.'' That supervision, I say to my \ncolleague, by the Department of Labor, does not encompass an election \nofficer and it does not encompass the severe degree of supervision that \ncomes with an election officer. What is the objective here? Is the \nobjective to get the Teamsters out from under the consent decree so \nthey don't have to use an election officer in doing this rerun of the \nelection? If that is the objective, I strongly disagree with it. Having \nan election officer serves a public interest.\n  Then we are told every other union pays for its own elections. We \nhave heard that time again and again, but they don't have an election \nofficer to supervise their elections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1070\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 1070.\n  Who seeks the floor? The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are debating, here, under this limited \ntime agreement, an issue that has received considerable discussion. \nThere is considerable controversy over the issue of national testing. \nIt has received enormous attention.\n  When the issue was first raised in the context of this appropriations \nbill, Senator Gregg and I offered an amendment expressing our concern \nthat we were going forward, here, with an issue of considerable \ncontroversy, without it being authorized and without hearings and \nwithout discussion as to the implications of this. We felt it deserved \na full public discussion because there was great controversy over the \nidea of national testing.\n  Unfortunately, the decision that was made on the part of the \nadministration was to go forward with this initiative without \ncongressional authorization. We attempted to address that issue with \nour amendment. But last August, without congressional approval or \nstatutory authority, the Department of Education announced that it \nwould develop a national test to be implemented in the spring of 1999, \nand went forward and awarded a $13 million contract to a consortium of \ntesting companies. Instead of turning the proposed test program over to \nthe National Assessment Governing Board, an entity with 10 years of \nexperience in this area, the administration intended to bypass this \nprocedure. Senator Dorgan spoke on the floor. We raised the issue. \nSenator Dorgan responded by saying he agrees with us that we would be \nfar better off getting this out of the hands of the Department of \nEducation and into the hands of an independent assessment agency to \naddress some of this controversy about the Federal direction of how the \ntest is derived and how it is administered and so forth.\n  The President, in his radio address a week ago, stated that he would \nconcede to the argument that many were posing, that this would be \nbetter if not designed and directed by the Federal Government. That, \nthen, opened the door to our trying to find a way to constitute an \noutside independent agency to write the test and administer the test. \nMany of us, even with that, expressed real concerns about the whole \nconcept of a national testing program versus allowing these decisions \nto be made at State and local levels. But it was clear that the issue \nwas going forward. So, in response to that, what we attempted to do was \nnegotiate with the administration, with our Democrat colleagues and \nothers, to comply, essentially, with what Senator Dorgan was suggesting \nwe do and what the President was suggesting we do. The initial proposal \nthat the President had outlined maintained what we thought was\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\na link with the Harvard education administration, which simply fueled \nthe controversy.\n  So, over the last several days we have had considerable discussion \nand negotiation with the administration on this, attempting to improve \nthis process and really to reserve further debate, on whether there \nought to be national testing or not be national testing, for the \nconference committee and for this body. There is a division of opinion \non that, a division all along the ideological spectrum. Former \nSecretary of Education Bill Bennett said national testing can be \nbeneficial if done the right way, if not manipulated to achieve a \ncertain result or to drive a curriculum, but as an assessment tool.\n  I quote from an article written by his former assistant, Chester \nFinn, Jr., who says:\n\n       Properly done, standards-based national tests would provide \n     useful information to students and their parents and put \n     pressure on schools to improve.\n\n  Congress, which created the National Assessment Group, NAGB, could \neasily design a program which would achieve the goals of national \ntesting, being a useful tool in improving public education.\n\n       The crucial questions [he says] about any test are who \n     decides what's on [the test] and who sets the standards by \n     which student performance is judged.\n\n  We have set out to do that. I am pleased to announce that late last \nevening we were able to achieve agreement with the administration on \nthe conditions upon which this would go forward. Under the agreement, \nand I will briefly explain it, no school or school district will be \nforced to use the national test if they don't want to. It is strictly \nvoluntary.\n  We also have provided that no school not using the test will in any \nway be denied the Federal funds that come to that school for various \npurposes. So, receipt of Federal funds is not conditioned on their \nusing or not using the test.\n  Further, we have provided that no private or parochial school or \nhome-schooled individuals are forced to take a test without their \nconsent. That was a legitimate response to some questions raised by \nhome-schoolers and private and parochial schools. This is a key \nprovision. Currently, States are using a variety of testing instruments \nto determine how their students are performing. Yet, according to many \nexperts, this patchwork of tests does not provide a common yardstick by \nwhich parents and educators can compare results. And while it is true \nthat testing won't help children learn more, it is equally true that \ntesting can give us valuable information about how we are doing, and \nwill ultimately be useful in providing tools for parents to use in \nholding schools accountable for their results.\n  Second, the changes that we have made allow the National Assessment \nGoverning Board the exclusive authority over all policies, directions, \nand guidelines for establishing voluntary national tests for fourth-\ngrade English reading and eighth-grade mathematics. To assure NAGB's \nindependence, the amendment provides that NAGB shall have the sole \nauthority to award grants and contracts and otherwise operate \nindependently of the Department of Education. The compromise which we \nreached gives NAGB 90 days to review and make substantial changes, if \nneeded, in the contract negotiated by the Department of Education.\n  Third, we have directed NAGB to ensure that the content and the \nstandards for the national test are the same as those for the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress test, the NAEP tests. The President \nhas stated on numerous occasions his intention to have voluntary \nnational tests based on the well-respected, high standard of the NAEP \ntest, and this amendment accomplishes that.\n  Fourth, we have made numerous changes to the composition of the 25-\nmember board, NAGB, to ensure bipartisanship and a new focus on locally \nelected officials rather than the so-called Washington experts. These \nchanges include the addition of a current or former Governor, bringing \nthe total number of Governors on the board to three; the addition of a \nnew category, allowing participation of two mayors; two additional \nrepresentatives of business or industry, bringing the total of that to \nthree; and the elimination of five curriculum or testing experts who \nwere employed by the board but should not have had voting privileges, a \npotential conflict of interest there. We have also increased the length \nof the terms on the board from 3 to 4 years in order to provide for \nmore continuity.\n  Fifth, the amendment returns to NAGB the authority it had prior to \n1994 to nominate individuals to fill vacancies which occur on the \nboard. Under this process, the Secretary must select from candidates \nnominated by NAGB. The amendment provides a 30-day transition, so that \ncurrent vacancies and newly created positions are filled by the \nSecretary after consultation with the House and the Senate.\n  These changes are critical to ensuring that national testing is under \nthe supervision of an independent, bipartisan agency and not the \nFederal Department of Education.\n  There is no doubt that standardized tests assess performance, but \nthey do not generate it. Yet I am increasingly convinced that giving \nparents a better and possibly more accurate picture of their child's \nacademic performance will help them obtain the best education for their \nchild. These tests are simply another tool for parents to use in \nholding local schools and local systems accountable for providing the \nkind of opportunities for educational achievement that all children in \nAmerica deserve.\n  Mr. President, I have other Members who wish to speak on this. I \nreserve my time at this particular point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me start by complimenting the \nSenator from Indiana for the compromise that we have worked out here. I \nam pleased to cosponsor that compromise amendment with him. I do think \nthe essential point to be made here is that through this amendment, \nthis compromise amendment, we transfer control of the development of \nvoluntary national tests over to this independent governing board that \nis referring to as NAGB, the National Assessment Governing Board. This \nis essentially the same approach that was suggested by Secretary Riley \nand proposed by myself, Senator Dorgan, Senator Harkin, and offered in \nthe amendment 1115 which we offered last week. More important, the \namendment will allow the test development process to continue without \nany undue delay.\n  Let me say a word about what NAGB is, because it would now be the \norganization or the entity with this responsibility. The governing \nboard that now will oversee the development of these tests is the \nNational Assessment Governing Board. It was established in 1988 by the \nCongress. It is bipartisan. It is independent. As Senator Coats \nindicated, it contains Governors, legislators, superintendents--now it \nwill contain some mayors, business people, experts in education as \nwell; and the core responsibility of this group has been to oversee the \ndevelopment and execution of NAEP, the National Assessment for \nEducational Progress. This test that we are talking about here, which \nwill be available on an individual student basis, is to be an outgrowth \nof that National Assessment of Educational Progress test, which is well \nrespected and has been for a long time.\n  Let me point to two charts here, and then I know Senator Kennedy \nwishes to speak, Senator Wellstone and Senator Dorgan. I want to defer \nto them.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains, and is the time controlled or \nis it uncontrolled at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is equally divided. The Senator from New \nMexico has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes, and then I will \ndivide the remaining 6 minutes among the three Senators I indicated \nbefore.\n  Let me first point to this chart which I think makes the case for \nthese tests that the President is talking about and that many of us \nhave supported. At the present time, we have a hodgepodge of tests that \nhave been developed around the country that are given to students and \nthen the results of which are given to parents, and they are told that \nthis is an accurate description of how their child is doing in school.\n  The reality is that some parents and some students are led to believe \nthat\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\nthey are performing at acceptable levels and are led to believe that \nthe education they are receiving is an appropriate education. They \ndon't find out the reality until they apply to college or get in the \nworkplace and find they do not have the skills or the training they \nneed.\n  This chart shows a comparison between the standards that have been \nadopted by many States and the standards set by this National \nAssessment for Education Progress, or NAEP. You can see the dramatic \ndifference. For example, in the case of Wisconsin, 35 percent, \naccording to the National Assessment for Education Progress, which is \nthe standard we are trying to give people information on, 35 percent of \ntheir students were performing at acceptable levels. According to the \nstandard used by the State of Wisconsin, 88 percent of the students \nwere performing at acceptable levels.\n  In the case of Louisiana, the disparity is even greater. The State of \nLouisiana indicated that 88 percent of their students are doing fine. \nWhen you look at what the National Assessment for Education Progress \ngiven to students in Louisiana indicates, only 15 percent of their \nstudents were doing fine. So there is a dramatic disparity there.\n  What we are trying to do is get good objective information to parents \nthroughout the country.\n  This is strictly voluntary. No State needs to use this test. No \nschool district needs to use this test. No individual student needs to \ntake this test. And if parents want to ignore the results of the \ncomparison, they can, but it needs to be available to those who want to \nuse it.\n  This other chart I want to show is a listing of the States that have \nalready chosen to use this voluntary test once it is developed. There \nare several States listed here: Alaska, Kentucky, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and West Virginia. There are \nmany other States, including my own, which are thinking seriously about \nit. They have not taken any formal action to commit themselves to use \nthis test, but they are looking at it and they are very interested.\n  There are 15 school districts in our major urban areas that have \nindicated they wish to have the advantage of the benefit of taking this \ntest or using it in their schools.\n  All this amendment will do is to allow the development of the test, \nallow us to go forward with the development of the test so that it will \nbe available to these States and to these school districts to the \nextent that they choose to use it.\n  I believe this is a very good course to follow. I think this is the \nright thing to do for our students, it is the right thing to do for the \nparents of these students so that they can show with some accuracy \nwhether their children are getting the kind of education that they are \ngoing to need in later life.\n  I very much support the effort the Senator from Indiana has made \nhere. I hope we can adopt this amendment with a large margin.\n  Mr. President, I defer to the Senator from Massachusetts for a couple \nof minutes for him to make his statement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate Senator \nCoats, Senator Gregg, and our Republican friends for working with the \nadministration and working with concerned Members in fashioning this \ncompromise.\n  I think there are basically two fundamental approaches that we ought \nto be doing for our children. One is we ought to have support systems \nand, secondly, we ought to have accountability.\n  What we are trying to do with this testing program is empower \nparents, empower parents so that they know how their children are \ndoing, and then to ensure that we are going to have support systems to \nhelp those parents.\n  We are seeing an expansion, hopefully, of our literacy program. We \nhave an expansion of our basic skills program with the math and \nscience, with the title I programs. We have seen the support for our \ntechnology program. Under Senator Jeffords, we are going to see an \nexpansion of teacher training. Under our Goals 2000 program, 90 percent \nof the money goes locally to help the local schools meet these \nstandards.\n  So what we are trying to do is have the support systems for our \nchildren, but on the other end we want to have accountability for \nparents and for children so they know how they are doing. If children \ndo not know how to read, as 40 percent of them do not at the fourth \ngrade level, they are going to be in trouble in terms of continuing \ntheir education, the problems of dropping out and all the other \nchallenges which they are going to face.\n  This is really an enormously important effort to try and address that \nvery considerable concern for every family in this country. We welcome \nthe strong bipartisan effort we are seeing reflected on the floor at \nthis time.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, can I inquire how much time is available on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes to each side.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. I rise \nto indicate my opposition to a national individualized testing system \nthat could lead to a one-size-fits-none curriculum dictated from \nWashington. Once you let Washington decide what kids should know, it \nwill effectively control what and how they are taught.\n  President Clinton's initiative for a federally funded testing system \nalready is headed down this slippery slope--work on the tests is \ncurrently underway. Here is what we know about them:\n  First, there is the eighth grade math test. Instead of measuring \ncompetence in basic computational skills directly, the test under \nconstruction would allow students to use calculators at all times. Some \nlocal parents, organizations, and States might decide they don't want \nto be controlled by a curriculum that only has reference to \ncalculators. They might really want their young people to learn how to \ndo mathematics absent calculators.\n  Furthermore, the content being tested, which ignores algebra, would \nnot promote higher achievement or hold up to international competition.\n  Hundreds of mathematicians, teachers, school board members, parents \nand others recently signed a letter to President Clinton protesting the \nfailed design of this math exam.\n  In testing reading, when you have a national uniform test, one size \nfits none. The proposed fourth grade reading test is predicated on the \nsame philosophy of reading that drives what is known as whole language \ninstruction. Under this philosophy, it is not as important for children \nto learn the difference between nouns and verbs as it is for students \nto analyze an author's feelings about what is written.\n\n  If a national test imposes a whole language approach to reading and \nrejects the phonics approach, what are we saying to parents about the \npotential for local control if those parents don't have a capacity to \nsay we want our kids to learn reading by using phonics and we want a \ntest that reinforces that kind of learning? Parents at the local level \nneed to be able to decide if they want their fourth graders to learn \nthe basics of the English language, not merely get in touch with an \nauthor's feelings.\n  I understand that the Nation needs to know where we are academically \nas a nation. However, we already have a capacity to assess student \nperformance on a national level. Since 1969, the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress has tested a representative sample of students in \n4th, 8th, and 12th grades in reading, U.S. history, geography, math, \nand science. NAEP has provided the Nation an understanding of overall \nstudent performance while allowing decisions on appropriate tests for \nindividual students to be made at the local level. While NAEP allows a \nmeasure of student performance by sampling, an individualized testing \nsystem threatens local control substantially.\n  In my judgment, national uniform individualized testing will \nultimately direct curriculum, curriculum which will become nationalized \nand uniform. This will take from the system the energy of the kind of \ncurriculum that can be developed to suit local needs and will involve \nparents in education.\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\n  The real test before us today is whether or not the President is \nwilling to trust parents and teachers at the local level to determine \nwhat their children should learn. The single most important factor in \neducational achievement is parental involvement. It is more important \nthan computers, than blackboards, than teacher salaries, than the \nnature of the school facility. Whether parents are actively engaged \nmeans a lot.\n  If we nationalize our system of education for elementary and \nsecondary students, we will have made it far less likely that parents \nwill be actively involved. Parents can and should get good information \nabout the progress of their children. That is possible at the State and \nlocal level. However, national, individualized tests would seriously \nthreaten parental involvement and control and lead to more Washington \nintermeddling in our schools.\n  I just want to indicate that I think nationalizing the testing \nprocess for our schools will drive us to a national curriculum and \ndrive us to national teacher certification. I believe States ought to \nhave the authority to certify teachers and develop a just curriculum, \nparticularly as it relates to trying new methods of teaching.\n  Many of America's schools are failing; they are failing to teach our \nkids how to read, write, and count; they are failing to offer them the \nskills to compete effectively in the information age; they are failing \nto teach them what America is and what she represents in the long \nhistory of the world.\n  Involved parents controlling and directing schools that teach basic \nacademic skills have been, and should always be, the foundation of our \neducational system. These are the building blocks that made America's \nschools the envy of the world. They are the standards upon which we \nmust base their return to greatness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nVermont. Before I do, let me just say that I recognize the legitimate \nconcerns that the Senator from Missouri has raised, and that is why we \nnegotiated a totally voluntary process and exemption for any school, \nany individual, any school district that does not want to participate \ndoes not have to participate without any jeopardy of losing any funds.\n  So whether it is a home school, private school, parochial school, \nindividual school district, whatever, if they agree with the Senator \nfrom Missouri--and I believe he raises some legitimate concerns--they \ndon't have to participate in this at all.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise only to commend those who have \nbrought about this very reasonable compromise. This could have been a \nvery divisive issue, but Senator Bingaman, especially Senator Coats and \nSenator Gregg have worked very long and hard to make this into a \nreasonable compromise which will be of assistance to us rather than \nsomething that could have been detrimental. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I congratulate my colleagues. I am going to vote for this, but it is \na close call. I have some sympathy for the comments made by the Senator \nfrom Missouri. I would like to, in the midst of people feeling good \nabout this work, sound a cautionary note. There are different ways of \nmeasuring accountability rather than just standardized tests. If \nteachers have to use the standardized tests, it will be educationally \ndeadening, and I worry about the worksheets becoming the primary way we \nare teaching.\n  The second point I want to make, I say to my colleagues, is it is \ntrue, we have to have standards in accountability, but if we don't do \nanything to dramatically transform the concerns and circumstances of \nthese children's lives, we already know which children are going to do \nwell on these tests and which children are going to fail. If I had a \ncriticism to level, it would be more at my party and more at the \nadministration.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are investing not anything in \nrebuilding crumbling schools. Where is the President and the \nadministration on this? The fact of the matter is, we are not even \nreaching 1 million Head Start students. I was out here on the floor \nyesterday talking about that. The White House did not even ask for \nenough money to cover 1 million. Why can't we do more by way of Head \nStart, early childhood development, reinvest and build schools as \nopposed to having these dilapidated crumbling schools in this country? \nWhat did we do when we cut food stamps, which is the major food \nnutrition program for children, 20 percent by 2002?\n  In all due respect, these tests are a small move in the right \ndirection, but they are use just a technical fix and are just symbolic \nand do not do much until we finally make a commitment to make sure \nthere is equal opportunity for every child in this country. We are a \nlong, long, long way away from that in the U.S. Senate or the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. I call on the President to show much more \nleadership when we are talking about children and education.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Senators \nDorgan and Harkin added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from North Dakota \nhas 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while I agree with my colleague, the \nSenator from Minnesota, on the entire discussion about deteriorating \nschools and equal opportunity and a range of other things, this issue \nis very simple. This issue is about national testing. It is not about a \nnational curriculum. It is not about investing in schools. It is \nnational testing.\n  The reason I support this is we can either decide as a country to \nfigure out what we are getting from this educational system and have \nsome kind of national testing to determine are we reaching achievement \nlevels in the fourth grade and eighth grade or we can have no such \napproach.\n  The other body is passing legislation that would prohibit any \napproach of this point. ``We don't want to evaluate what is \nhappening,'' they say. That is a very strange position.\n  It seems to me you ought to evaluate if children can read \nsufficiently at the fourth-grade level because these are gateways to \nthe rest of their educational life. If you can't read sufficiently at \nthat level, you are not going to do well the rest of your educational \nlife. So we are talking about can children read in fourth grade. Do \nthey have a mastery of the mathematics principles in the eighth grade \nthey need? This is what this is about: national testing to evaluate in \nthese two areas.\n  It is voluntary. Any child may opt out. Any school may opt out. Any \nState may opt out. It is purely voluntary, but it does say, as a \ncountry, we aspire to reach achievement levels and aspire to give our \nparents across this country the opportunity to understand what are we \ngetting for the education dollar we are spending, where are the \nproblems and how do we fix them. That is what you get with this kind of \nnational testing opportunity.\n  Again, it is not about national curriculum. It is not about a \nnational requirement. It is a voluntary approach to national testing to \ndetermine whether our children can read sufficiently in the fourth \ngrade and perform the basic tests of mathematics in the eighth \ngrade. To the extent we do that as a country, we will aspire to better \nunderstand our education system, better understand what we are getting \nfor our education dollar, and in that way I think will be able to \nimprove the system of education in this country.\n\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation of the Senator from Indiana, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, and others, and especially the \nleadership of the Senator from New Mexico. Doing this today I think is \na step forward for the American people and is in marked contrast to \nwhat we are going to see come\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nfrom the other body. I hope when we go to conference we will accept the \nSenate provision because it is moderate, thoughtful and the right thing \nfor this country and its children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. He raised the issue, and in a sense extended the \noffer to make the adjustments necessary to make this truly an \nindependent effort and a constructive effort. His support in all of \nthis is much appreciated, along with the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1070, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Gregg and myself, I \nsend a modification to the desk. I ask for its modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is modified.\n  Mr. COATS. Do I need to ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nmodified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1070), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Office of Educational Research and Improvement shall \n     submit to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a \n     spending plan for activities funded under this title under \n     the heading ``Education Research, Statistics, and \n     Improvement'', prior to the obligation of the funds.\n       (b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     National Assessment Governing Board established under section \n     412 of the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 (20 \n     U.S.C. 9011) (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Board'') shall hereafter have exclusive authority over all \n     policies, direction, and guidelines for establishing and \n     implementing voluntary national tests for 4th grade English \n     reading and 8th grade mathematics: Provided, That the tests \n     shall be made available to a State, local educational agency, \n     or private or parochial school, upon the request of the \n     State, agency, or school, and the use of the tests shall not \n     be a condition for receiving any Federal funds: Provided \n     further, That within 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Board shall review the national test \n     development contract in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and modify the contract as the Board determines \n     necessary: Provided further, That if the contract cannot be \n     modified to the extent determined necessary by the Board, the \n     contract shall be terminated and the Board shall negotiate a \n     new contract, under the Board's exclusive control, for the \n     tests.\n       (2) In exercising the Board's responsibilities under \n     paragraph (1) regarding the national tests, and \n     notwithstanding any action undertaken by the Department of \n     Education or a person contracting with or providing services \n     for the Department regarding the planning, or the development \n     of specifications, for the tests, the Board shall--\n       (A) ensure that the content and standards for the tests are \n     the same as the content and standards for the National \n     Assessment;\n       (B) exercise exclusive authority over any expert panel or \n     advisory committee that will be or is established with \n     respect to the tests;\n       (C) ensure that the tests are linked to the National \n     Assessment to the maximum degree possible;\n       (D) develop test objectives, test specifications, and test \n     methodology;\n       (E) develop policies for test administration, including \n     guidelines for inclusion of, and accommodations for, students \n     with disabilities and students with limited English \n     proficiency;\n       (F) develop policies for reporting test results, including \n     the use of standards or performance levels, and for test use;\n       (G) have final authority over the appropriateness of all \n     test items;\n       (H) ensure that all items selected for use on the tests are \n     free from racial, cultural, or gender bias; and\n       (I) take such actions and make such policies as the Board \n     determines necessary.\n       (c) No State or local educational agency may require any \n     private or parochial school student, or home-schooled \n     individual, to take any test developed under this Act without \n     the written consent of the student or individual.\n       (d) Section 412 of the National Education Statistics Act of \n     1994 (20 U.S.C. 9011) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(1)--\n       (A) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows:\n       ``(A) three Governors, or former Governors, of whom not \n     more than 1 shall be a member of the same political party as \n     the President;'';\n       (B) by amending subparagraph (B) to read as follows:\n       ``(B) two State legislators, of whom not more than 1 shall \n     be a member of the same political party as the President;'';\n       (C) in subparagraph (H), by striking ``one representative'' \n     and inserting ``three representatives'';\n       (D) by amending subparagraph (I) to read as follows:\n       ``(I) two mayors, of whom not more than 1 shall be a member \n     of the same political party as the President;'';\n       (E) by striking subparagraph (J); and\n       (F) by redesignating subparagraphs (K), (L), and (M) as \n     subparagraphs (J), (K), and (L), respectively;\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and may not exceed a \n     period of 3'' and inserting ``and shall be for periods of \n     4''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``consecutive'' after \n     ``two'';\n       (3) by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Vacancies.--As vacancies on the Board occur, new \n     members of the Board shall be appointed by the Secretary from \n     among individuals who are nominated by the Board after \n     consultation with representatives of the individuals \n     described in subsection (b)(1). For each vacancy, the Board \n     shall nominate at least 3 individuals who are qualified by \n     experience or training to fill the particular Board \n     vacancy.''; and\n       (4) in subsection (e) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Independence.--In the exercise of its functions, \n     powers, and duties, the Board shall be independent of the \n     Secretary and the other offices and officers of the \n     Department.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, at this point, \nnow that the modification is pending at the desk, that myself, Senator \nDorgan and Senator Harkin be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1122, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senate now is the amendment by the \nSenator from Washington, amendment No. 1122. The time limit is 2 \nminutes to be equally divided.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms \nand Senator Coats be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the issue involved in this amendment is \nextremely simple. If you believe that the regulation of our public \nschools is best conducted through hundreds of pages of detailed \nregulations, imposed by the Department of Education in Washington, DC, \non all school districts alike, you will vote against this amendment.\n  If you believe that teachers, parents, principals, and elected school \nboard members in the thousands of school districts across the country \ncan best determine how money coming from the Federal Government ought \nto be spent to advance their children's education, you will vote for \nthe amendment.\n  No State will lose money under the terms of this amendment. Every \nState will gain money under the terms of this amendment, because the \nadministrative costs, amounting to more than a billion dollars, will no \nlonger be withheld by the Department of Education in Washington, DC, \nbut will be transferred to the local school districts.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. This amendment goes under the presumption that the Federal \nGovernment controls these programs. The fact that the author of the \namendment has already taken three-quarters of the money out of his \namendment and continues to give it to the States recognizes that.\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\n  The additional funds that would go for these programs will no longer \ngo to these programs, but will go directly to local governments--Goals \n2000; school-to-work; technology; reading, school improvement programs \nlike ``Reading is Fundamental''; arts education; magnet schools; \nwomen's equity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Drug-free schools will just go to local governments. Indian \neducation, bilingual education, vocational rehabilitation--50 percent \ngoing to rehab will instead go to local governments to do with as they \nwant. Vocational education, they will do the same. Yes, it goes to \neducation, but there is no maintenance of effort here, therefore, the \nlocal governments may well decide to replace their present educational \nmoney.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton amendment \nwhich would give the States more flexibility and resources to create \nquality education reform plans that address the specific needs of their \nparticular students.\n  As reported recently by the Heritage Foundation, the Federal \nGovernment annually spends $100 billion in direct and indirect \neducation costs, of which only $13.1 billion makes it to local school \ndistricts. If the majority of these funds went to the States and local \nschool districts, I believe the concerns of parents about the quality \nof their children's education would be more effectively addressed than \nby the faceless bureaucracy in the Department of Education.\n  Polls taken in Arizona and across America consistently demonstrate \nthat Americans consider the quality of education to be their most \nserious concern. Further, a survey reported in the Washington Post in \nSeptember 1996 shows that Americans consider the decay of the public \nschools to be the country's most pressing problem. A surprising 62 \npercent of those surveyed felt that ``the American educational system \nwill get worse instead of better.'' In my view, nothing is more \nimportant to the future of our country than whether our children are \nacademically well-prepared.\n  We fail the fundamental tests of parenthood and good citizenship if \nwe let our children down by failing to impart to them the skills and \nvalues they need to govern themselves and this country, and to compete \nin the global marketplace of the 21st century. Yet, poll after poll \nshows that Arizonans and Americans alike are concerned about the \ndumbing down of the politically correct education their children are \nreceiving, the safety of the schools they attend, the general lack of \ndiscipline meted out in those schools, and parents' inability to choose \nto send their children to the school that best fits their kid's \nindividual needs.\n  The State of Arizona has taken some important steps to address these \nconcerns and to come up with solutions. For instance, Arizona, using a \ncreative legislative approach, recently enacted a law creating an \nincome-tax credit available for donations to private schools. The \nprivate schools will pool the tax credit money in a scholarship fund to \nbe used to finance full or partial scholarships for any students on a \nfirst-come, first-served basis.\n  The Gorton Amendment, by giving states even more control over their \neducation resources, would allow States more latitude to implement \ncreative education reform plans specifically tailored to their \nparticular needs.\n  What the Gorton Amendment would do, with some exceptions, would \nbundle all funds from the Federal Government which go to support K-12 \neducation and send those funds directly to school districts.\n  Why do we need the Gorton Amendment? There are too many Federal \neducation programs. So many in fact, no one seems to be able to agree \non exactly how many there are. One count discovered 760 education \nprograms totaling several billion dollars. With such a large number of \nprograms funded by the Federal Government, it's no wonder there is such \na concern about undue Federal influence over the operation of local \nschools, or whether they are being administered in an efficient way.\n  The people best equipped to make decisions regarding the education of \nour children are the parents, teachers, principles, school board \nmembers and administrators of our local schools. It's not that Members \nof Congress don't have an interest in the education of children. It's \njust that we don't have the best information upon which to base \ndecisions.\n  Congress is simply not close enough to the problems school districts \nface to be able to dictate through Federal mandates how they should \naddress their concerns. This is not to say the Congress does not have a \nresponsibility assisting in the education of America's children. \nHowever, we also must see to it that those who are closest to our \nstudents have the resources they need.\n  Also, we must ensure that they are not hamstrung by the rules and \nregulations set by a group of individuals who have never set foot in \ntheir school.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the Gorton amendment would empower States, \nschool districts, and parents to take a more active role in the \neducation of their children.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the passage of \nthe Gorton amendment today. This amendment, which gives approximately \n$12 billion directly to local school districts in the form of a block \ngrant, threatens to undermine some of the most valuable educational \nprograms in existence.\n  I am a strong supporter of creative school reform, and I believe in \ngetting rid of programs that do not work. But this amendment is an \nattack on programs that do work. I have worked with these programs \nfirsthand, and I know they work. Through my extensive involvement in \nNebraska with early-childhood programs such as Head Start and school-\nto-work programs such as Careers 2000, I have seen effective programs \nin action.\n  Many of us in Congress have worked hard over the years to help build \nand sustain programs such as vocational education, education \ntechnology, Goals 2000, adult literacy, and safe and drug-free schools. \nAs a result, millions of students have benefited from the opportunity \nto improve their achievement levels and enhance their skills \nportfolios. With the concerted effort of teachers, school \nadministrators, parents, State governments, and Congress, we have been \nable to ensure that these opportunities remain available to all \nstudents, regardless of their particular school district. Under the \nGorton amendment, only the lucky would benefit. For example, under this \nprovision, money that once would have been designated for technological \ntraining in an inner-city high school could be used instead to build a \nnew basketball court if local administrators saw fit. As we move toward \nthe 21st century, the demand for technological skills in the \nmarketplace is increasing rapidly. Therefore, it is crucial that all \nstudents have the skills necessary to compete for jobs once they leave \nschool.\n  In bypassing the State entirely and giving funds directly to local \nschool districts, the Gorton amendment is analagous to amputating the \nwhole head in order to cure a headache. In doing so, it harms the very \npeople it claims to help, America's children. Federal taxpayers deserve \nto know that a sufficient portion of their tax dollars is being used to \nsupport effective educational programs. State governments are equipped \nto make sure this happens.\n  Mr. President, I voted for passage of this bill today because, for \nthe most part, it represents a good bipartisan effort to ensure the \nwell-being of American citizens. But because I believe strongly that we \nmust continue the work of education reform in an effective and \nmeasurable way, I will strongly oppose the bill if it comes back from \nconference with this provision intact. I will not stand by and watch \nAmerican children suffer the consequences of poor legislation.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are the yeas and nays requested?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to lay on the \ntable the amendment No. 1122, as further modified. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining votes in this series of three votes be limited to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment that I have before the \nSenate, cosponsored by myself, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Craig \nbasically would say that the taxpayers would not have to pay for a \nsubsequent Teamsters election. The last one cost $22 million, and only \n500,000 people voted.\n  My amendment does not prohibit supervision. There can still be \nsupervision. My amendment says that if the President certifies to \nCongress that the Teamsters don't have the money for the election, \ntaxpayers could pay for it, but the Teamsters would have to pay it \nback, and pay it back with interest.\n  I might mention, in 1991, there was an election that the taxpayers \ndidn't pay for, supervised by the Government, and it was fair, it \nworked. In 1996, the election was supervised and paid for by the \ntaxpayers, and there was corruption. It was a mistake and we should not \nrepeat that mistake. This would protect taxpayers and, in my opinion, \nthe Teamsters as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is an incredibly mischievous \namendment. The Teamsters are operating under a court order. This would \nviolate the consent decree. The reason the Government pays for the \nelection is so they can have an election officer supervise the election \nin order to ensure that we drive corruption out of the Teamsters Union.\n  This consent decree was entered into by Attorney General Thornburgh \nin the Bush administration and heralded at the time as a great and \nsignificant accomplishment.\n  The Nickles amendment violates the consent decree and it carries with \nit the very severe risk of resulting in an unsupervised election. Now, \nit is asserted that other unions pay for their own elections. That is \nquite true, but they don't have an election officer to supervise the \nelection. The agreement in the consent decree provided for this \npayment.\n  I urge a vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment, which we are now \nconsidering, is one which has been discussed already. It is something \nthat has been worked out by the various parties involved. And certainly \nSenator Coats from Indiana has been the lead in trying to design this \nsettlement of the matter.\n  It essentially resolves the matter by making sure that the testing \nwill be done by a totally independent organization, and it will in no \nway be influenced monetarily--by the monetary involvement of the \nFederal Government--by the Department of Education, or those forces in \nthe Department of Education who are pushing for a national curriculum. \nIt is, therefore, a totally voluntary effort, and something which I \nbelieve deserves our support as an attempt to try to move forward on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Indiana for working in bringing this \ncompromise together. I support it. I think it is important to give \neffective information. It is purely voluntary. It is a step forward. I \nurge very much that the Senate adopt this with a large margin so that \nwe can stick to this position in conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as always, we are sometimes called on to be \ntwo places at one time with two or three committee meetings going on. I \nwas recorded--and it was my fault. It was not the clerk's fault. It was \nmy fault because I thought it was a tabling motion when it was not. In \nany case, on rollcall vote No. 234, I voted ``yea,'' and it was my \nintent to vote ``nay.''\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my \nvote, which will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1115, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1115 to S. 1061 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1115) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1122\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed the Gorton \namendment to the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Act. This amendment seeks to block-grant \ncertain Federal education funds and send them directly to school \ndistricts across the country. I appreciate my colleague Senator \nGorton's intent to pass as much responsibility as possible for making \neducational and funding decisions to those levels closest to the \nclassroom. This is also a goal of mine.\n  However, with all due respect to my colleague, this is one issue \nwhere we fundamentally disagree. His amendment, like many ideas, sounds \ngood in theory because it oversimplifies the practical reality in our \nschools and communities.\n  As a former school board member, I agree with my Republican \ncolleagues that our local elected school officials and educators are \nfully capable of deciding what their local needs and priorities are, \nand directing funds to those areas.\n  But those local school board members and superintendents and \nprincipals and educators will tell you that the Federal Government does \nindeed have a role in education in this country--in setting priorities \nand assuring equity.\n  Despite the occasional difficulties of writing a grant or filling out \na form, Federal programs such as School-to-Work, or Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools, or STAR schools or other Federal technology programs, have \nmade very real differences in the lives of students in schools across \nthis Nation.\n  They will tell you that equity protection efforts, such as providing \nfunds for magnet schools, funds for Indian education, or funds for \nbilingual or migrant education, should continue to be uniquely within \nthe purview of the Federal Government. This is because despite the best \nintentions, we all know that some school districts in this country have \nnot always been able to do best by all the students all of the time. \nEquity funds must continue to go to the students and school districts \nwhich need them, and must not be watered down and spread across all \nschool districts, regardless of need, as it appears the Gorton \namendment would require.\n  My problem with the Gorton amendment is that it may cost \nsignificantly more to educate one student than another, but this \namendment will send them both the same Federal allocation--and ignore \nthe intent of the Federal education program set up to recognize the \nspecific needs associated with the higher cost.\n  Every child deserves an effective, relevant education. Not all \nchildren have the same opportunity to get it. This amendment will \nassure that we increase the disparities between the haves and have-nots \nin our Nation's schools.\n  Federal education funds leverage State and local money, as they do in \nmy State, in the area of technology funding. Federal programs include \ncaps on administrative expenditures, and maintenance of effort \nrequirements--so we do not allow States to supplant or misuse funds. \nFederal education efforts safeguard equity concerns important to the \nNation, and set important national goals priorities.\n  The Gorton amendment is bad policy. It uses a meat-ax approach to \neducational reform when what is needed is the precision of a scalpel \nand a careful ear listening to what local people are really saying. No \none likes bureaucracy. Everyone believes our schools can be improved. \nBut educators and tax-payers across the country will grumble more \nloudly about the potential ill-effects of the Gorton amendment than \nthey ever have over redtape.\n  Local control is the goal; the Gorton amendment is fundamentally the \nwrong way to go about reaching it.\n\n\n               FUNDING FOR THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to commend the committee and subcommittee \nfor their hard work on the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. I am \nparticularly pleased that the committee has seen fit to honor the \nadministration's request for funding of the efforts of the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics [BLS] with respect to its review of the Consumer Price \nIndex.\n  However, I am concerned about the level of funding provided in the \nLabor-HHS bill for the remainder of the BLS budget, which is $6.8 \nmillion below the administration's request.\n  BLS has suffered substantial funding reductions in past years, and \nconsequently has had to eliminate or reduce the scope of several \nimportant programs--programs which produced valuable information on the \nNation's labor markets and economy as a whole. It would not serve the \nnational interest for BLS to have to undertake similar reductions as a \nresult of the funding level in this appropriations bill.\n  For example, high school guidance counselors around the country who \nhelp young graduates find work in growing sectors of the economy rely \non Occupational Outlook Handbook, Occupational Outlook Quarterly, and \nother special reports produced by the BLS Employment Projections \nProgram. The proposed cuts in this bill, however, may make the \ncontinued publication of these important materials less likely in the \nfuture.\n  Similarly, to excel in the increasingly competitive global economy \nAmerican businesses and trade officials need reliable international \ncomparison statistics on employment, labor costs,\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nand productivity. The proposed level of funding in this legislation \njeopardizes our ability to receive such information.\n  Finally, another consequence of the committee's proposed BLS funding \nlevel could be a delay in the implementation of the new industrial \nclassification system--the so-called NAICS--that BLS has been working \non. Updating the current system, which dates back to the 1930's, to \nreflect an economy approaching the 21st century is critical to the \nability of our business leaders and policymakers to understand the \nchallenges our economy will be facing in the upcoming years.\n  I understand that the House funds all BLS activities at a level \nconsistent with the administration's request. Would the Senator from \nPennsylvania, as ranking member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee, be willing to accept the House funding levels in \nconference?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The concerns of the Senator from Maryland are well \nfounded. I will look closely at fully funding BLS programs as we move \nto conference with the House.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and appreciate \nhis attention to this important matter.\n\n\n                             aids programs\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the distinguished chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be pleased to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. Many of us have been reading the excellent series in the \nWashington Post this week about the changing face of the AIDS virus. \nThe article on Monday, if I am correct, highlighted the dramatic gains \nthat have been made with new AIDS therapies, particularly the so-called \ntriple drug therapy or cocktails which seem to have so much promise, at \nleast in the short term. We are all keeping our fingers crossed.\n  Could you tell me how the bill addresses this issue?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Funding for the Ryan White AIDS programs was a priority \nfor the committee this year, and I worked very hard to make sure that \nwe provided an adequate level for the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration service programs, as well as, I might add, for research \nat the National Institutes of Health.\n  I am pleased to assure you that S. 1061 contains $1.077 billion for \nthe Ryan White AIDS programs, which is $41 million above the \nadministration's request, and over $80 million higher than the current \nyear's level. That includes $469.9 million for HIV health care and \nsupport services, of which $217 million is dedicated to AIDS \nmedications under the State AIDS drug assistance program [ADAP]. That \n$217 million figure for ADAP compares to $167 million in fiscal year \n1997, so it is a substantial increase in an atmosphere of budget \nconstraints.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the original author of the Ryan White CARE Act with \nSenator Kennedy in 1990, I am extremely pleased to hear of the \ncommittee's action to provide such a high level of support for the CARE \nAct. There is no doubt we have come a long way in the past 7 years. A \ngood deal of that progress has been made because you, Senator Specter, \nhave had the foresight and the courage to provide the funding HHS needs \nto operate the program. And I hope all of our colleagues recognize that \nfact.\n  But, despite our best efforts at both research and services, AIDS is \nstill a serious problem in the United States. The most promising \ndevelopment we have had in years are the protease inhibitors and the \ncombination therapies which are giving thousands of people literally a \nnew lease on life. In fact, as you have noted, we are now seeing lower \nmortality rates for individuals for the first time in the history of \nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  Let me ask you one final question. Are you satisfied that the \ncommittee's recommendation for the ADAP program will be sufficient?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not sure we will ever have enough money in the \nLabor-HHS bill. It is a constant struggle. I have to say that one thing \nwhich alarmed the committee is the high cost of these new AIDS \nmedications. Pharmaceutical research, as you well know, is extremely \ntime intensive and costly, and this is especially true for AIDS drugs.\n  The committee was very concerned about the lack of timely national \ndata available to estimate the demands for AIDS medications funded by \nthe ADAP program, and also, I might add, about the wide variation in \nState Medicaid policies on individual eligibility, benefits, and drug \navailability. We have asked the Secretary to develop benchmarks to \nmeasure progress in this area and to increase data collection and \ninformation sharing, and so we hope to have a better guideline in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for this information. It is clear that \nwe are all going to have to work harder--both the government and the \nprivate sector--in making AIDS medications available to those who need \nthem. It is one of the modern paradoxes that the new AIDS drugs can \ndefer an HIV infected individual's progression to disability. Yet, it \nmay only be that the individual can get financial assistance when \ndisabled, a situation we would clearly like to prevent.\n  I am aware of a Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \nstudy which indicated that, as of December 1, there were 122 medicines \nin testing for AIDS. The cost, which the Senator alluded to, is \nastounding. One company spent more than $1 billion over a 10-year \nperiod to develop a protease inhibitor. American technological gains \nare nothing short than miraculous, but we all have to recognize they \nare expensive as well.\n  I am heartened by the Senator's remarks about funding for the State \nADAP programs. I am fully supportive of your efforts and I thank you \nfor your substantial interest in this area.\n\n\n                     rural health transition grants\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to clarify the intent of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and the \nfull Appropriations Committee, with respect to the Rural Health \nTransition Grant Program. This program provides small, 3-year grants to \nassist financially troubled small rural hospitals as they attempt to \nadjust to changes brought on by new medical technology, changing \npractice patterns, and replacement of cost-based reimbursement with \nprospective, or fixed, payments. Last year Congress discontinued \nfunding for rural health transition grants, but several facilities \naround the country were already in their grant cycle, having received \ntheir first or second year grants. These small hospitals were promised \n3-year grants, and had relied on those grants, when the funds were cut \noff.\n  Is it the intention of the Appropriations Committee to urge the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to provide, from the funds \nappropriated for program management, continuation grants to those rural \nhospitals which have received first or second year grants?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I respond to the Senator from Montana that it is the \nintention of the committee to urge the Secretary to provide, from the \nprogram management account, continuation grants to those rural \nhospitals which have received first or second year grants. The \ncommittee believes that an undue hardship could be brought upon these \nhospitals if their 3-year grants are not completed as promised. I thank \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the subcommittee chairman for his clarification.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 1098\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I share the interest of my colleague from \nGeorgia in enhancing food safety not only for children but for all \nconsumers. I note that several provisions in my colleague's amendment \nappear to be related to the types of research efforts that are \nundertaken by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Based on those ongoing efforts, I suggest that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services should consult and coordinate with the \nSecretary of Agriculture in carrying out the provisions of this \namendment. I ask my colleague from Georgia if this is his expectation \nas well.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes; I agree that the Department of Agriculture has \nspearheaded efforts in this area, and that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services should consult and coordinate with the Department of \nAgriculture so that these funds are utilized in the most effective and \nefficient manner.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank my colleague from Georgia for both his interest \nin ensuring and improving the safety of\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\nour food and for agreeing that the two Departments should work together \nin implementing the provisions of his amendment.\n\n\n               STUDY ON IODINE-131 RELATED THYROID CANCER\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention the recent National Cancer Institute recommendation that \nfollowup studies be conducted regarding American's exposure to \nradioactive iodine-131. During the 1950's and 1960's the Nevada test \nsite conducted a number of atomic tests. The radioactive fallout from \nsuch tests was significant. I believe that a number of Utahns were \nexposed to this radioactive fallout.\n  The University of Utah has conducted several studies to assess the \nimpact of this fallout. In doing so the University of Utah collaborated \nwith the Public Health Service, the National Cancer Institute, and the \nDepartment of Energy. Although these studies concluded that there is an \nincrease in the incidence of thyroid cancers among the examined group \nand that further research was needed. Many of those exposed are just \nnow coming to the age where thyroid cancer is manifested. As a result, \nI believe it is important that Congress fund the next phase of this \nstudy.\n  I would like to ask Chairman Specter if he would work with me to find \nthe necessary resources to fund the next phase of this study. I am well \naware of the limited resources available to this subcommittee. I also \nunderstand that there are many competing needs and important programs \nand projects. However, I am hopeful that we can work together to find \nthe necessary resources to fund this study.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Utah that I am \naware of his concerns with regard to atomic tests performed at the \nNevada test site and the fallout of radioactive iodine-133. I also \nunderstand that the University of Utah has done some outstanding \nresearch in this area. I would like to ask Senator Bennett what \nresources would be required to complete this phase of the study?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am told that this would be a 5-year study that would \nrequire about $1.9 million per year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Bennett is correct that resources are limited. \nHowever, I would be pleased to work with Senator Bennett to try to find \nthe resources necessary to fund this important study.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Specter for his \nwillingness to work with me on this important and I look forward to \nworking with him on this matter.\n\n\n FUNDING FOR RURAL DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS FOR DISTRESSED YOUTH\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, during a recent visit to rural South \nDakota, I had the profoundly moving experience of meeting with a heroic \nindividual who is working to keep deeply distressed kids off alcohol \nand drugs. Durein Chase works to build opportunities for distressed \nchildren by providing them with drug-abuse prevention counseling in a \nsafe, drug-free recreation center. My hope for these children and \nexcitement about the Crow Creek Four Winds Youth Center Program were \ncut short when I learned that Federal funding for this program was \nabruptly terminated because Congress ended its authorization in fiscal \nyear 1996. The Homeless and Runaway Youth Drug Abuse Prevention \nProgram, known as DAPP, had previously supported as many as 184 local \nprograms around the country at an annual cost of $15 million. When DAPP \nlost its appropriation, the program was incorporated into a new \ncomprehensive program for homeless youth. Unfortunately, the new \ninitiative does not help those programs, like the one on Crow Creek \nReservation, that do not run residential facilities. Simply put, the \nchildren of Crow Creek have slipped through the cracks. Dureine's \nheroic effort to help particularly vulnerable kids avoid drugs will \ndisappear without our support. Fortunately, the Appropriations \nCommittee has included in its fiscal year 1998 bill $10 million for \nSAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \nto support youth drug prevention programs. It is my understanding that \nthe Crow Creek Four Winds Youth Center and facilities like it are \neligible for a portion of the $10 million provided to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and it is my hope that the Department will \nseriously consider funding the Crow Creek Youth Center in fiscal year \n1998. With adequate funding, the Crow Creek Youth Center will be able \nto provide help for isolated and distressed youth who come from areas \ndistinguished by historically high rates of teen suicide.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I join my colleague from South Dakota in recognizing the \nimportance of drug prevention efforts in rural America. It is my \nunderstanding that the Crow Creek Youth Center would be eligible for \nthese funds and I encourage the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto give serious consideration to funding such efforts out of the money \nappropriated under this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is our intention to support programs which provide \nsuch essential drug abuse prevention services to youth. It strikes me \nthat the Crow Creek Youth Center meets that criteria, and I join with \nmy colleagues in encouraging the Secretary to identify funding for the \nSouth Dakota program and similar programs in rural and isolated areas \nplagued by high rates of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\n\n                 FLUORIDATING COMMUNITY WATER SUPPLIES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I note with pleasure that both the Senate \nand House reports accompanying the Labor/HHS appropriations bills \nreflect strong support for community water fluoridation in preventing \ntooth decay among children. These reports clearly state that we can \nboth save money and improve children's health through fluoridation. \nTooth decay remains the single most common disease of childhood and is \nhighest in low-income children. Millions of Medicaid dollars currently \nused to repair these children's teeth could be saved through \nfluoridation. After 50 years, water fluoridation remains the hallmark \npublic health preventive intervention. In my own State of South Dakota, \nwater supplies for communities as small as 500 persons are fluoridated. \nIt is my hope to extend similar benefit to children throughout the \ncountry.\n  Both the House and Senate reports direct the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to support implementation plans for additional community \nwater fluoridation. The House provides $1,000,000 for this effort while \nthe Senate directs the Department to fund this effort at a level no \nless than last year. Unfortunately, last year the Department allocated \nonly $200,000 for this purpose, which did not meet the need.\n  It is my hope that the conferees will be able to provide sufficient \nresources in the conference report to address this serious problem. The \nHouse level of $1,000,000 for community water fluoridation strikes me \nas a reasonable amount to accomplish this important purpose. Anything \nthe Senate conferees could do to work with the House conferees to \nachieve this level in the final conference report would be enormously \nappreciated by beneficiaries of this program throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The benefits of fluoridated water to our Nation's \nchildren are well known and appreciated. I will work with my colleagues \non the House and Senate conference to provide the resources to \nimplement this program more broadly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The National Institutes of Health reports that more than \nhalf of 6 to 8 year olds already suffer tooth decay. There are few \nthings that the Federal Government can do directly to decrease this \ndisease in children. Fluoridation is one of them. I, too, will work \nwith my colleagues to provide the necessary funding in the conference \nreport.\n\n\n                   funding for breast cancer research\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I note the committee is recommending a \nsignificant increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health \nas a whole, and for the National Cancer Institute in particular. I \napplaud the committee for its dedication to tapping the full potential \nof medical research. Such research represents hope for millions of \nAmericans with cancer and other devastating illnesses, and in that \nsense it is far more valuable than any dollar figure we may attach to \nit.\n  I understand that in its report, the committee stated that breast \ncancer research is among its top priorities, and asserted that the \nNational Cancer Institute should strengthen its budgetary commitment to \nbreast cancer. In light of these statements, I believe it is the \ncommittee's expectation that the substantial increase in NCI funding\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\nshould be reflected in additional funding for breast cancer research. \nIt is reasonable that NCI would increase its funding commitment to \nbreast cancer research in order to respond to the committee's concern \nthat more research is needed to better understand the underlying \nmechanisms of breast cancer and to improve the ability to detect, \ndiagnose and treat this pervasive, life-threatening disease.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with your interpretation of the committee's \nreport. Our intent was to convey the need to redouble our efforts to \nsuccessfully prevent, detect and treat breast cancer. Sufficient \nfunding to push the boundaries of breast cancer research is essential \nif we are truly committed to these goals. Increased funding for the \nNational Cancer Institute should indeed be reflected in a larger \nfinancial commitment to breast cancer research.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I, too, fully concur with Senator Daschle's assessment. \nNCI must not forsake this important opportunity to expand its breast \ncancer research agenda. I anticipate that NIH and NCI will give this \ncritical avenue of research every consideration as they make their \nfiscal year 1998 funding decisions.\n\n\n  fulfilling the promise of the breast and cervical cancer mortality \n                     prevention act (p.l. 101-345)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am grateful that this bill provides an \nincrease in funding for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's \nNational Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. The \nprogram was implemented in accordance with the Breast and Cervical \nCancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 to reduce morbidity and \nmortality from two cancers that will claim the lives of an estimated \n500,000 women during the 1990's. It is structured as a State and \nFederal partnership to provide screening and diagnostic help and assure \nfollowup care for low-income uninsured women.\n  Under the 1990 act, Federal funding is restricted to screening and \ndiagnostic services. To ensure that women diagnosed with cancer receive \ntreatment, States are expected to arrange access to treatment through \nwhatever means they have at their disposal. The CDC's National Breast \nand Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is now active in all 50 \nStates, and as of January 1997, the program has screened more than 1.5 \nmillion American women. Unfortunately, too many women are not being \nprovided the screening, disgnostic help, and treatment they need to \nsave their lives.\n  At the current level of funding, the program can provide screening to \nonly 15 percent of the eligible low-income population, meaning that \nroughly 10 million low-income uninsured American women are not provided \naccess to critical screening services. Moreover, as in many other \nStates, the program in my home State of South Dakota faces another \ncritical resource constraint: Insufficient resources to provide \ndiagnostic services for women who have been screened by the program and \nrequire additional diagnostic treatment. It is tragic to think that \nsome women are told they may have breast or cervical cancer, and then \ninformed that their diagnosis cannot be confirmed. Additional funding \nfor this program is critically needed to complete the task of \ndiagnosing women as early as possible so that they can receive \npotentially life-saving treatment, and to fulfill the promise of the \n1990 bill for all eligible women, not just a small fraction of them.\n  In addition to our inability to provide screening and diagnostic \nservices to all low-income women, we have not yet been able to \nestablish a program to ensure the necessary treatment for those who are \ndiagnosed with cervical or breast cancer. When you consider that the \nfundamental goal of the 1990 act is to prevent mortality, it becomes \nclear that we need to take greater steps to secure treatment for \naffected women. Since passage of the 1990 act, CDC and the States have \nbeen working diligently to ensure that all women diagnosed with breast \nor cervical cancer receive appropriate treatment. However, the \nresources that are available to fulfill this task--often an uneven \npatchwork of free clinics, charity care from hospitals, and pro bono \nservices donated physicians--makes the job extremely difficult.\n  To meet this challenge, it is essential that we determine accurately \nthe extent to which women diagnosed with cancer under the CDC Program \nlack access to the care they need and how we can overcome the remaining \nbarriers to providing all women with care they need. I understand that \nthe CDC is conducting a comprehensive study of State-level efforts to \nprovide appropriate treatment. Based on the results of that study, \nwhich should be available within the next few months, Congress and the \nadministration have a responsibility to determine whether additional \nmeasures are necessary to help States ensure proper treatment for women \nwho are diagnosed with cancer through the CDC screening program. It is \nmy hope that when the results of the CDC study become available, the \nadministration will evaluate them and make recommendations to Congress \non ways the Federal Government can better help States ensure that women \ndiagnosed with cervical or breast cancer obtain the treatment they \nneed.\n  Additionally, it is my hope that the Department of Health and Human \nServices will utilize whatever unexpended or discretonary funds that \nare available in fiscal year 1998 to expand the number of women who are \nprovided screening or diagnostic assistance for cervical or breast \ncancer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. Providing crucial \nearly detection and diagnostic screening services to uninsured women is \na high priority for me. It is essential that women who are diagnosed \nwith breast cancer through our efforts are not abandoned without hope \nof appropriate treatment. I know that our committee, with the \nchairman's support, will work hard to support CDC's National Breast and \nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program and strongly encourage the \nadministration to develop recommendations to Congress to ensure broader \naccess to followup treatment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I very much agree. I recognize the \nimportance of providing early detection and diagnostic screening \nservices to as many uninsured women as possible, and agree that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services should consider providing the \nscreening and diagnostic program with any unexpended or otherwise \navailable funds under this bill in fiscal year 1998. Also, Congress and \nthe administration should take a close look at the current program and \nbe willing to consider further efforts to provide followup treatment \nfor all women diagnosed with cancer through the screening program.\n\n\n   RESEARCH AIMED AT DETECTING, PREVENTING, AND TREATING OSTEOPOROSIS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is estimated that up to 50 percent of \nthe women alive today will experience at least one serious \nosteoporosis-related fracture during the remainder of their lives. \nApproximately 25 percent of men alive today will also experience a \nserious fracture related to osteoporosis. It is clear that osteoporosis \nis becoming a greater and more expensive public health problem with \neach passing year. Medicare and other publicly funded health care \nprograms are spending an estimated $28 billion per year to treat \nosteoporosis-related conditions.\n  Osteoporosis is both preventable and treatable. There are a number of \nFDA-approved therapies that have been demonstrated to be effective in \npreventing the disease in those at risk, as well as treatments that can \narrest or retard the progress of the disease in individuals who already \nhave it. Good nutrition, including sufficient calcium, has also been \nshown to help protect against the illness. If programs can be put into \nplace soon that will help detect and combat this illness, we can make a \ntremendous difference in the quality of life of seniors, and \neffectively reduce the spiraling cost of osteoporosis-related health \nproblems.\n  I understand that in its report, the committee has encouraged the \nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases \n[NIAMS] and the Agency for Health Care Policy Research [AHCPR] to use \ncompetitive grants and other mechanisms to plan and carry out \ndefinitive studies, including epidemiological studies, that will enable \nus to better understand the nature and scope of osteoporosis and design \nmore effective prevention and treatment programs. I commend the \ncommittee for its action, and would like to reinforce the urgency of \nmoving forward with the planning\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nand execution of such studies and the importance of using competitive \ngrants as appropriate to tap the skills and expertise of the Nation's \nacademic and research communities. I would also like to emphasize the \nimportance of including, as part of this effort, an analysis of \npolicies and programs that should be pursued to prevent osteoporosis in \nthe future. It is critical that we have an accurate sense of the \ndimensions of this widespread health problem and take every possible \nstep to lessen its destructive impact.\n  I hope the committee's well-articulate views, which clearly recognize \nthe value of a comprehensive assessment of osteoporosis, and \nacknowledge the important contribution NIAMS and AHCPR can make to that \neffort, are incorporated into the conference report.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree that osteoporosis should be the focus of \naggressive detection, prevention and treatment activities. We owe it to \nour own and future generations to tackle the root cause of so much \ninjury and debilitation in later life, and to reduce the growing \nfinancial burden it imposes on individuals and the public alike. I \nagree that NIAMS and AHCPR should pursue, within the funds provided, \nstrategies to detect, prevent, and treat osteoporosis in both women and \nmen, and I look forward to working with the conferees to include such \nlanguage in the conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also recognize the value of a comprehensive research \nstrategy aimed at detecting, preventing and treating osteoporosis, and \nI encourage NIAMS and AHCPR to give this research every consideration \nas they make their fiscal year 1998 funding decisions.\n\n\n                 aging research and alzheimer's disease\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, for his \nleadership in crafting what is arguably one of the most difficult and \nperhaps the most complex appropriations bills Congress must deal with \neach year.\n  I share his concerns that while there are so many worthwhile programs \ncovered by this legislation, we are unfortunately constrained by \nlimited resources.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am especially \nconcerned about one item in the bill--the recommended appropriation for \nthe National Institute on Aging.\n  As baby boomers shoulder their way into the 21st century, nearly 35 \nmillion Americans will be age 65 or older, compared to just 3.1 million \nat the start of this century. This tremendous growth is due in large \npart to better living standards as well as this Nation's commitment to \nmedical research. As a result of past research investments we now have \nnew and more effective treatments for arthritis, high blood pressure, \nstroke, and other diseases.\n  But as you know, many critical challenges remain--not the least of \nwhich is the scourge of Alzheimer's disease.\n  Alzheimer's disease and related disorders present one of the greatest \nthreats to the health and economic security of the generation that will \nenter retirement in the 21st century. It has already stricken 4 million \nAmericans. And if left unchecked, 14 million will fall victim to \nAlzheimer's by the middle of the next century. It will defeat all of \nour best efforts in Congress and as a nation to control health care \ncosts and assure the quality of health care in general.\n  I know that the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee shares my \nconcern. As in my State of Iowa, his home State has a high proportion \nof elderly.\n  I note that this legislation recommends $520.7 million for the \nNational Institute on Aging. While that represents an increase over \nthis year's funding and the House level, the rate of increase is below \nthe average increase to NIH as a whole.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished chairman that he keep in mind \nthe importance of adequate funding of the National Institute on Aging. \nThe challenges, and the opportunities, surrounding our aging population \nhave never been greater.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like to thank Senator Grassley, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Aging Committee for his leadership on \nthis important issue. The Senator can be certain that I understand the \nimportance of maintaining adequate funding for the National Institute \non Aging. I will certainly keep this in mind as the appropriations \nprocess continues.\n\n\n                        early head start program\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the pending legislation increases funding \nfor Head Start by $324 million and directs that 10 percent of the \nfiscal year 1998 increase be dedicated for further expansion of the \nEarly Head Start Program which serves children from 0-3 years of age. \nThe appropriations bill does not amend the underlying Head Start \nstatute, therefore, there is no change to the 5 percent set-aside for \nthe Early Head Start Program as prescribed by that law for fiscal year \n1998.\n  I would ask the chairman if he could clarify the intent of the \nlegislation with respect to the Early Head Start Program. It is my \nunderstanding that the 10 percent from the fiscal year 1998 increase is \nin addition to the 5 percent set-aside already provided by law.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct. The pending legislation does not \nchange the 5 percent set-aside for the Early Head Start Program \nprovided by current law for fiscal year 1998 and the 10 percent \nprovided by the bill is additional funding to expand programs for \nchildren from 0-3 years of age.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for clarifying this point.\n\n\n                            music education\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the past the Senate has supported, \nthrough the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, music training as an \neducational tool. I support the continuation of support for this type \nof program.\n  I urge the Department of Education, through its fund for the \nimprovement of education, to give favorable consideration to a proposal \nthat will stimulate students' interest in and attention to music by \nairing the work of young and gifted student performers and which will \nalso involve the public through supplemental educational tools. A young \nperformance series, which affords 6-18-year-old musicians the \nopportunity to publicly demonstrate their talents would be especially \nsuited to carry out such a demonstration.\n  If we are to encourage innovation and talent, we must foster that \ntalent by recognizing the developing skills of our Nation's youth. \nPublic broadcasts of a quality young performance program will encourage \nyouth involvement in classical and other serious music.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I note the Senator's support for music programs for \nyoung people with interest and agree that we should encourage education \nand learning through the use of the arts. I would also encourage the \nDepartment of Education to consider this proposal.\n\n\n                     student/parent mock elections\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, every Member of Congress understands the \nimportance of elections. The votes cast on election day determine the \nleadership and direction of communities across the country, and of the \nNation as a whole. We know that informed voters are the essence of our \ndemocracy.\n  The National Student-Parent Mock Election helps young students learn \nabout the importance of the election process. It also offers parents \nand teachers across the country an opportunity to help students learn \nabout democracy, make decisions about key issues, and understand the \nmeaning of the citizen responsibility on which democracy thrives.\n  On October 30, 1996, millions of students and parents across the \ncountry cast their votes for President, Vice President, Senators, \nRepresentatives, Governors, and local officials as part of the National \nStudent-Parent Mock Election. Every State called in its votes on who \nwould win the elections and its recommendations on key national issues \nto the National Mock Election Headquarters, while over 20 million \nviewers watched on television.\n  The National Student-Parent Mock Election is an on-going project that \nreceived $125,000 in Federal funding in fiscal year 1997.\n  I understand that it is the intention of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee to fund \nthe National Student-Parent Mock Election at $225,000 for the fiscal \nyear 1998 so that it can continue to educate students on key issues and \nthe principles of democracy.\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is true. It was our intention to include in report \nlanguage that the National Student-Parent Mock Election be funded at \n$225,000 this fiscal year. I, too, believe that this is an important \nand worthy program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also agree that it was our intention to fund the \nprogram at $225,000 this fiscal year, and I comment the National \nStudent-Parent Mock Election program of its continued success.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for the clarification. The lessons \nthat students and their parents learn in the mock elections will \nbenefit American politics for years to come. If the next generation of \nAmericans is well prepared for the challenges of democracy, our \nliberties will be in good hands.\n\n\nfunding for the centers for disease control and its suicide prevention \n                              initiatives\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to direct the attention of \nmy colleagues to the work of the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] \nlocated in Atlanta, GA. As you all are aware, the CDC is dedicated to \nthe public health--providing valuable resources for disease research \nand prevention from cancer and infectious disease research to diabetes \ncontrol to suicide prevention.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I think our colleagues will all agree that the CDC \nperforms valuable public health services. There is widespread support \nfor the CDC and its missions, and I believe it is a worthwhile use of \nFederal funds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his remarks. \nLet me add that a number of my constituents have contacted me regarding \nCDC funding, particularly in regard to the National Center for Injury \nPrevention and Control's research on suicide prevention.\n  While both the House and Senate bills provide funding for the CDC \nabove the administration's request, my constituents fear that the CDC's \nresearch potential will not be attained under the Senate's lower \nappropriation level. As you may know, I joined with several of my \ncolleagues in sponsoring S. Res. 84 which recognizes suicide as a \nnational problem. I share my constituents' interest in promoting \nefforts to prevent suicide, and as deliberations on S. 1061 continue, I \nrespectfully request that the Chairman consider my constituents' \nrequest to fund the CDC at the House level.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia's comments \nregarding fiscal year 1998 CDC funds. Let me assure him that the \nsubcommittee will take his comments into careful consideration.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Once again, I would like to thank the Senator for his \nand his subcommittee's support. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Georgia \nbringing to the attention of this Senate his interest in the valuable \nwork of the CDC. I will ensure that the conference committee considers \nthe Senator's interest in these important public health programs.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the distinguished chairman for his attention \nto my interest in these matters.\n\n\n               department of labor job search initiative\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee in a dialog about an item in the House \nversion of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, the House Appropriations Committee has approved $3 \nmillion within the Employment and Training Administration to support a \ntelephone-access job search system. These funds are provided as part of \nthe $71.8 million approved in the House bill for other federally \nadministered programs. Through the labor market information activity, \n$3 million would be used to support the installation of a telephone \naccess labor market exchange network for searching America's Job Bank \nby telephone. This service has the potential of providing access to job \ninformation to persons with disabilities, including individuals who are \nblind.\n  I would ask the chairman if he would review the House proposal and \ngive it serious consideration for inclusion in the final version of the \nLabor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. I understand that the $3 \nmillion would most appropriately go to assist states in meeting the \nfirst-year costs of joining a labor market exchange network for \nproviding job seekers with access to America's Job Bank by telephone. \nWith the innovative use of computer technology, this proposal could be \nof significant assistance to those who are disabled and in search of \nemployment opportunities.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for bringing this \nmatter to my attention. I am familiar with the recommendation of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee to encourage a telephone-access job \nsearch initiative. I can assure my friend from New Mexico that I will \ngive this proposal serious consideration for inclusion in the \nconference report accompanying the final bill.\n\n\n       WHITE HOUSE INITIATIVE ON TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to speak \nin support of a new Office of Tribal Colleges and Universities that has \nbeen created by Executive order, and to clarify language in the Senate \nCommittee Report 105-58 that accompanies the legislation currently \nunder consideration. This Executive order began as Senate Resolution \n264, a Sense-of-the-Senate Resolution urging the President to issue an \nExecutive order to promote and expand Federal assistance for Indian \ninstitutions of higher education. I am proud to be one of the \ninitiators of this resolution, and I was very pleased when the \nPresident responded by issuing Executive Order 13021 pertaining to \ntribal colleges and universities in October 1996, in which he created \nan Office of White House Initiative in the Department of Education. The \norder also directed the Department of Education to ``provide \nappropriate administrative services and staff support for the Board and \nthe Initiative.''\n  This issue was raised in two separate sections in the Senate \ncommittee report. Support for the Initiative Office was mentioned in \nthe section pertaining to the Department of Education's Office of \nIndian Education, and then again in the section pertaining to the \nOffice of Vocational Education. I ask my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, if it was the committee's intent to provide the White \nHouse Initiative Office with adequate support from the Department of \nEducation's increased funds for general departmental management, and \nnot from the limited funds allocated to the Office of Indian Education?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this \nopportunity to clarify the committee's recommendation regarding the \nDepartment of Education's White House Initiative Office on tribal \ncolleges and universities. It was, indeed, the committee's intent that \nthe Office receive adequate support for its mission, and that \nadministrative funds be allocated for this purpose from the Department \nof Education's general management funds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague for this clarification. The 30 \nTribal Colleges and Universities in this country provide the best \nopportunity for many Native Americans to attend college. The Carnegie \nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching recently published its \nsecond report on Native American colleges, pointing out the critical \nrole they play. I believe that the office created under the White House \ninitiative will have an opportunity to work across Federal agencies to \nstrengthen tribal institutions of higher education and can help to \nimplement the recommendations made in the Carnegie Foundation report.\n  I know that my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, shares my \nconcern for the support of tribal colleges and universities, and I \nwould ask for his thoughts on this issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for \nhis leadership in urging the creation of this White House Office on \nTribal Colleges and Universities. Like Senator Bingaman, I supported S. \nRes. 264 and was among the Senators that subsequently urged the \nPresident to issue the Executive order. It was at my request that the \ncommittee included language for increased funding support for this \noffice, and I am most grateful to the chairman for his help on this \nmatter and for clarifying the committee's intent.\n  North Dakota is home to five tribal colleges, and these institutions \nare an\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\nimportant part of the higher education community in my State. It is my \nbelief that the White House initiative has the potential to galvanize \nFederal support for these institutions, and in so doing will open the \ndoor to college wider for many Native Americans.\n\n\n                        national mediation board\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As the chairman knows, this bill includes funding for the \nNational Mediation Board [NMB] which is responsible for mediating \nlabor-management disputes in the railroad and airline industries under \nthe Railway Labor Act [RLA]. To help meet this responsibility section 3 \nof the RLA requires the arbitration of certain disputes that arise \nbetween employee and their employers in the rail industry.\n  Unfortunately, there is a serious need to help the NMB fulfill its \nsection 3 responsibilities. Delays in care processing cause uncertainty \nand hardship for both rail workers and the carriers. I want to thank \nthe chairman for recognizing this problem and for including an \nadditional $500,000 to the budget of the NMB. It is my understanding \nthat it is the intent of the chairman and the committee that the NMB \nshould use this extra money to deal with the section 3 cases. Is this \nalso understanding of the chairman?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I want to thank the Senator from Iowa for raising this \nissue. In appropriating an additional $500,000 over the \nadministration's request it is indeed by intent that the NMB will use \nthese funds to more quickly process the section 3 cases that are \ncurrently pending. There are now a few thousand unresolved cases \naffecting workers and employers in Pennsylvania and throughout the \nNation who deserve to have these cases decided as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to again thank the chairman for his interest and \nhelp in addressing this problem.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am concerned that the Community Schools Program has not \nbeen funded within the fiscal year 1998 HHS appropriations bill. The \nelimination of this program means the cutting of funds for grants in \nover 35 States, midcycle, including programs in Vermont and \nPennsylvania.\n  Senator Jeffords and I have been working to find an acceptable way to \nensure that the Community Schools programs which work well will \ncontinue to be funded.\n  I understand the fiscal constraints faced by the committee. I \nappreciate the willingness of the chairman to add language to this bill \nthat would give priority funding through the high-risk youth grant \nprogram to currently running Community Schools grants that are \nsuccessful.\n  The program in Vermont is called CITYSCAPE. This grant has allowed \nBarre City to develop partnerships between the schools, the community \nand other key service providers to target assistance to youth who are \nat risk of abuse and neglect, at risk of substance abuse and at risk of \nteen pregnancy. The program seeks to increasing community and school \nconnection to these youth, decrease youth violence and to decrease \nyouth use or potential use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my colleague for his remarks. We share a \ncommitment to ensure that effective Community Schools programs like \nCITYSCAPE in Vermont are given priority in funding within the new \nprogram for at-risk youth.\n  I would also add to my colleague from Vermont's remarks that a key \ncomponent of the Barre City Program is the development of community \nownership and a volunteer base that will ensure the continuation of \nthis program beyond the end of the grant cycle.\n  Our intention is to work with the committee to make sure that \nCITYSCAPE and other good programs reach the point that they can stand \non their own with community support.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senators from Vermont for bringing their \nconcerns about the elimination of this program to me. I certainly want \nprograms that are successful to continue. I and will work with the \nHouse during the conference to make sure that programs that are meeting \nthe needs of high-risk youth can continue.\n\n\n aids drug assistance program and other program funding under the ryan \n                             white care act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman for \nhis continued leadership in providing substantial support for the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act, research through the National Institutes of Health, and \nvarious prevention and education programs seeking to discover new \ntreatments and a cure for the HIV/AIDS virus. Each of these areas \ndeserves the full attention from congressional leaders if we are to \nfinally win our struggle with this dreaded virus.\n  However, I am particularly concerned that the level of funding for \nthe AIDS Drug Assistance Program [ADAP] under title II of the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act will fail to meet the needs of those suffering from this \nterrible disease. With some of the recent advances in HIV/AIDS drug \ntreatments, many seem to believe that the pressure imposed by this \ndisease upon our society has been relieved. However, I believe the \nSenate must increase the ADAP funding level for fiscal year 1998 to the \nHouse level of $132 million in order to protect our citizens from this \ncontinued deadly disease.\n  As with every State, in my State of New York many working people \nliving with HIV/AIDS must rely on the ADAP Program for their only \naccess to the new effective combination therapy AIDS medications which \nwere discovered and produced through our public and private investment \nin research at the National Institutes of Health and in private \nindustry. These newly approved drugs offer real hope for continued life \nto hundreds of thousands of Americans living with HIV/AIDS. With \nmillions of Americans lacking health insurance with adequate \nprescription benefits, the ability to access these treatments has \nliterally become a matter of life and death for thousands of these \nAmericans.\n  Currently, the ADAP Program in New York State provides treatment \nopportunities to nearly 17,000 people with many, many more projected to \nseek treatment in the future. Congress has the ability to lead the way \nto assure access to these therapies and the hope they provide against \nthe inescapable progression to an untimely death. We must seize this \nopportunity. No one wants to be in the position of telling a \nconstituent that they are out of luck this year and that maybe next \nyear we can do something. Every State will face intolerable choices in \ndeciding who shall have the opportunity to receive these life-saving \ntreatments without an adequate ADAP funding level. I ask the chairman \nto leave no stone unturned in obtaining the funds so desperately needed \nfor us to offer a chance for life to every American living with HIV/\nAIDS in the United States. I know my colleague from California would \nlike to provide further emphasis to this statement.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York and I \nappreciate his comments on the Ryan White CARE Act. This vital program \nis literally a life line for people living with HIV and AIDS.\n  AIDS continues to be the leading cause of death for Americans between \nthe ages of 25 and 44. Over a half million Americans have been \ndiagnosed with AIDS, and over 360,000 have died of the disease. In the \ncoming year, HIV will infect some 40,000 Americans, half of them under \nthe age of 25.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act demonstrates our commitment to providing \nnecessary health care services to these individuals and families with \nHIV, and to assisting communities hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic.\n  Recent advances in research have provided us with new and effective \ncombination therapy AIDS medications. These newly approved drugs offer \nthe first real hope to the hundreds of thousands of people living with \nHIV and AIDS.\n  Under title II of the CARE Act, the ADAP program provides access to \nthese essential, life-saving drugs to the people who desperately need \nthem. It literally makes the difference between life and death for tens \nof thousands of Americans. It is because of this new hope that new \nclients are coming to get the treatment they need to survive, and that \nis why increased funding for this program is vital.\n  We have the ability and the responsibility to make these drugs \navailable to people who need them. I don't believe anyone in this room \nwould want his or her State to be in a position of having to cut \npatients off life-saving drugs because funding is inadequate.\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\n  Given that the number of individuals with HIV continues to escalate, \nour commitment to providing AIDS care must remain firm. Therefore, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues in conference to adopt the highest funding \nfor the Ryan White CARE Act. I urge support of the House funding levels \nfor title I and title II and the Senate levels for title III, IV, and \nV.\n  In addition, I would like to reiterate my strong support for AIDS \nprevention and education programs through the Centers for Disease \nControl. These programs are key to stopping the spread of HIV infection \nand saving lives, and I urge the highest funding level possible.\n  Individuals living with this disease and their loved ones known that \nthese programs are saving lives, enabling patients to live life to the \nfullest, and preventing new infections. It is our obligation to provide \nthe highest level of funding possible for these critical \nappropriations.\n\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New York and the chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee for their tireless work on behalf of people \nwith HIV and AIDS.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator from California for providing \nfurther perspective on this issue. Mr. President, we again thank the \nchairman for his leadership and support of the Ryan White CARE Act in \nthe past. We hope to secure your continued support for Senate \nappropriations for titles III, IV, and V of the Ryan White CARE Act, \nand at least the House funding levels for titles I and II in conference \ncommittee. In particular, the ADAP funding level affects every State in \nour great Nation and, therefore, I look forward to working with him and \nour colleagues to ensure that every American will have access to any \nHIV/AIDS treatment he or she may require.\n\n\n                     community employment alliance\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof the Senator the Community Employment Alliance [CEA], which is \nsponsored by the Enterprise Foundation. It is my hope that the \nDepartment of Labor may identify the CEA as a project for full \nconsideration under research, demonstration, and pilot program funds \nbeing made available to the Department in the 1998 Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education Appropriations Act.\n  CEA is working in eight cities nationwide, including San Antonio and \nDallas in my home State, to develop an effective job opportunity system \nfor low-income individuals, particularly those on public assistance. \nCEA offers a new, comprehensive model for developing job opportunities \nfor low-income citizens based on the utilization of community-based \norganizations, in conjunction with private sector and Government \nresources.\n  CEA's approach envisions the development of compacts involving city \nand State governments, local and regional business leaders, and \ncommunity-based organizations. Each local alliance will formulate \nstrategies and implement programs for creating an effective job \nopportunity system for welfare recipients. The ultimate goal of the \nCEA, therefore, is to improve job prospects for unemployed and \nunderemployed residents of distressed inner-city neighborhoods through \nwell-coordinated, high performance economic and work force development \nactivities. I believe that it is this type of integrated approach that \nwill help move more Americans from welfare to work.\n   Mr. SPECTER. I thank Senator Hutchison for bringing this important \nproject to my attention and the attention of the committee. There is \nmuch work to be done in assisting those on welfare to gain a better \nlife. Approaches to this problem which fully integrate business, civic, \nand community leaders are in my view the most likely to succeed. \nTherefore, I believe that the Department of Labor should, in fact, give \nfull consideration to the request for funds made by the Community \nEmployment Alliance for this purpose.\n\n\n                       BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\n  MR. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the integral parts of a classical \neducation includes a knowledge and appreciation of music. Studies have \nshown that there is a direct correlation between children with an early \nexposure to music and high achievement in mathematics. Music provides a \nuniversal language that knows no boundaries, and heightens a person's \nawareness and sensitivity to the world around them.\n  Boston Symphony Orchestra, one of the world's leading symphonies, has \ndeveloped in collaboration with area schools a model youth concert \nprogram which contributes to a student's understanding and appreciation \nof music. It annually conducts 15 youth concerts for approximately \n40,000 elementary, middle and high school students from over 120 \ncommunities throughout Massachusetts. BSO also provides training for \nmusic teachers and manages a resources center for educators in New \nEngland.\n  The House fiscal year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Committee report contains language that \nencourages the Department of Education's fund for the Improvement of \nEducation to support the operation and evaluation of such a program as \nthe Boston Symphony Orchestra's model youth concert program. I urge the \nfinal conference report to adopt this language, which will broaden the \nhorizons of our children's education.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and the third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take just a minute before the \nfinal passage of this bill to comment upon an amendment that was just \nadopted here, the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington \nState. I am concerned about the impact of that amendment and what it is \ngoing to do to education.\n  I do not know how many people understand what we have just done here. \nWhat we have just said in adopting this amendment on such a narrow vote \nis that many education programs including vocational education, \nbilingual education, education technology, immigrant education, safe \nand drug-free schools, and Goals 2000--some you may like, some you may \nnot like, but all of these programs are now part of a block grant. This \nmoney now goes to local education agencies in the form of a block \ngrant. All of the things that we have worked so hard on, on a \nbipartisan basis, in terms of technology, safe and drug-free schools, \nvocational education, all of these are gone under this amendment.\n  Mr. President, $4 billion of that money now goes out to local \neducation agencies in the form of a block grant. There will be no \nrequirements on how this money is to be spent--none whatsoever. In \nother words, they can take the money and build a swimming pool and say \nthe heck with education technology or safe and drug-free schools or \nvocational education. There is no limitation. We have had in the past \nlimitations on how much of this money could be used for administrative \ncosts, to pay for superintendents and all the administrative people who \nmake up our schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Two minutes equally before the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And the other side, too, get an additional minute.\n  Mr. President, we have had requirements in the past that no more than \na certain amount of this money could be spent for administration \nbecause we wanted it to get to the kids and we wanted it to get to \nvocational education and technology.\n  These requirements are done away with in this amendment. So now they \ncan use this money to pay superintendents or other school personnel \nmore money.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Would my colleague not disagree with me, Mr. President, if \nthis bill comes back from conference with this measure, we ought to \nfilibuster this bill; it ought not to pass?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I just have a sense that some people \nmay\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\nhave voted on this and not understood exactly what was going on in \nterms of stripping away all of these measures and taking away the \nprohibition that we had in the past to limit how much could be spent on \nadministration. That is all taken off.\n  I heard time and time again from people on both sides of the aisle \nhow we should cut down on how much money we put into administration. I \nagree with that. We all agreed with that. Now those restrictions are \ngone. They will be able to use this money for whatever they want. I \njust think it is a terrible mistake on the part of the Senate to have \nadopted this amendment.\n  I appreciate the time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I find it regrettable but not surprising \nthat the expressions against the amendment which we just adopted are \nbased on the proposition that all knowledge with respect to educational \npriorities is lodged right here among the 100 Members of this body, \nand, if not here, certainly no closer to our students than the \nDepartment of Education's bureaucrats here in Washington, DC; that if \nwe are to allow local school board members, teachers, and parents to \ndecide how they would like to spend the money on the education of their \nchildren setting different priorities in different school districts, \nthey will, of course, waste the money, ignore our children, and use it \nto build swimming pools.\n  Well, Mr. President, I wonder why it is that the voters are so wise \nwhen they pick us and so foolish when they pick local school board \nmembers. That is the real issue here. Do we trust the people who are \nrunning our schools to run them properly, to care for the education of \ntheir children and to do a better job than Washington, DC, bureaucrats?\n  Fifty-one of you voted that we trust our educators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the vote now is on \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 92, nays 8, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 235 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--92\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--8\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Coats\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n  The bill (S. 1061), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1061\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments of \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and \n     for other purposes, namely:\n\n                      TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\n\n                 Employment and Training Administration\n\n\n                    training and employment services\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Job Training Partnership Act, \n     as amended, including the purchase and hire of passenger \n     motor vehicles, the construction, alteration, and repair of \n     buildings and other facilities, and the purchase of real \n     property for training centers as authorized by the Job \n     Training Partnership Act; the Stewart B.

(a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as \n     the ``Comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n     mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n       (2) each year, up to 12,000 infants are born in the United \n     States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering irreversible \n     physical and mental damage;\n       (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects, which are lesser, though still serious, \n     alcohol-related birth defects;\n       (4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a \n     significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1000) \n     than children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per \n     1000);\n       (5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects are \n     national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n     community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is especially alarming;\n       (6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n     dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n     newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects are up to 30 times greater than national averages;\n       (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n     their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, \n     including the costs of health care, education, foster care, \n     job training, and general support services for affected \n     individuals;\n       (8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     was approximately $2,700,000,000 in 1995, and over a \n     lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     child are estimated to be at least $1,400,000;\n       (9) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n     giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects increases in proportion to the amount and \n     frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n     stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n     reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of \n     alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n       (10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women \n     drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose \n     of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink \n     during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the \n     Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role in \n     encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     establish, within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects nationwide. Such \n     program shall--\n       (1) coordinate, support, and conduct basic and applied \n     epidemiologic research concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and \n     Fetal Alcohol Effects;\n       (2) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n     community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n     programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects; \n     and\n       (3) foster coordination among all Federal agencies that \n     conduct or support Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects research, programs, and surveillance and otherwise \n     meet the general needs of populations actually or potentially \n     impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects.\n       (d) Establishment of Program.--Title III of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n          ``PART O--FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 399G.

(a) The Secretary of Education shall conduct a \n     study that examines--\n       (1) the economic, educational, and societal costs of--\n       (A) the increase in enrollments of secondary school \n     students during the period 1998 through 2008;\n       (B) the creation of smaller class sizes for students \n     enrolled in grades 1 through 3; and\n       (C) the increase in enrollments described in subparagraph \n     (A) in relation to the creation of smaller class sizes \n     described in subparagraph (B); and\n       (2) the costs to States and local school districts for \n     taking no action with respect to such increase in enrollments \n     and smaller class sizes.\n       (b) The Secretary of Education shall report to Congress \n     within 9 months of the date of enactment of this Act \n     regarding the results of the study conducted under subsection \n     (a). Such report shall include recommendations regarding what \n     local school districts, States and the Federal Government can \n     do to address the issue of the increase in enrollments of \n     secondary school students and the need for smaller class \n     sizes in grades 1 through 3.\n       Sec. 309. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal Pell Grants are a crucial source of college aid \n     for low- and middle-income students;\n       (2) in addition to the increase in the maximum Federal Pell \n     Grant from $2,700 to $3,000, which will increase aid to more \n     than 3,600,000 low- and middle-income students, our Nation \n     should provide additional funds to help more than 250,000 \n     independent and dependent students obtain crucial aid in \n     order to help the students obtain the education, training, or \n     retraining the students need to obtain good jobs;\n       (3) our Nation needs to help children learn to read well in \n     fiscal year 1998, as 40 percent of the Nation's young \n     children cannot read at the basic level; and\n       (4) the Bipartisan Budget Agreement includes a total \n     funding level for fiscal year 1998 of $7,600,000,000 for \n     Federal Pell Grants, and of $260,000,000 for a child literacy \n     initiative.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that prompt action should \n     be taken by the authorizing committees to--\n       (1) make the change in the needs analysis for Federal Pell \n     Grants for independent and for dependent students; and\n       (2) enact legislation and authorize the funds needed to \n     cover the cost of the changes for a $260,000,000 child \n     literacy initiative.\n       (c) It is the sense of the Senate that the maximum level \n     possible of fiscal year 1998 funding should be achieved in \n     the appropriations conference committee.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Department of Education \n     Appropriations Act, 1998''.\n\n                       TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                      Armed Forces Retirement

Sense of the Senate on Compensation for Tobacco \n     Growers as Part of Legislation on the National Tobacco \n     Settlement. \n       (a) Findings.-- (1) On June 20, 1997, representatives of \n     tobacco manufacturers, public health organizations, and \n     Attorneys General from a majority of the States announced \n     that an agreement had been reached on a national tobacco \n     settlement;\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\n       (2) the national tobacco settlement was intended to provide \n     a comprehensive framework for dealing with several issues \n     relevant to the tobacco industry, including youth smoking \n     prevention, legal liabilities, and the sales and marketing \n     practices of the industry;\n       (3) implementation of the national tobacco settlement \n     requires the enactment of Federal legislation by the Congress \n     and the President;\n       (4) there are more than 125,000 farms in the United States \n     which derive a substantial portion of their income from the \n     cultivation and sale of tobacco;\n       (5) representatives of tobacco growers were completely \n     excluded from the negotiations on the national tobacco \n     settlement, and were poorly informed, or not informed at all, \n     of any details of the settlement negotiations by any \n     participants in those negotiations;\n       (6) the national tobacco settlement includes compensation \n     for several adversely affected groups, including NASCAR, \n     rodeo, and other event sponsors, but includes absolutely no \n     compensation whatsoever or other provisions relating to the \n     impact of the settlement on tobacco growers;\n       (7) no other group has their livelihoods affected by the \n     national tobacco settlement as adversely as tobacco growers;\n       (8) the local economies of tobacco growing communities will \n     be adversely affected by implementation of the national \n     tobacco settlement;\n       (9) the national tobacco settlement contemplates \n     $368,500,000,000 in payments from tobacco manufacturers over \n     the next 25 years, and not all of this amount has been \n     specifically earmarked by the agreement; and\n       (10) the Federal tobacco program was designed to operate at \n     no net cost to the Federal taxpayer, the national tobacco \n     settlement does not contemplate any changes to the operation \n     of this program, and even many critics of the national \n     tobacco settlement, including representatives from the public \n     health community, have expressed support for the continued \n     operation of a Federal tobacco program which operates at no \n     net cost to taxpayers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) tobacco growers should be fairly compensated as part of \n     any Federal legislation for the adverse impact which will \n     follow from the enactment of the national tobacco settlement;\n       (2) tobacco growing communities should be provided \n     sufficient resources to adequately adjust to the impact on \n     their local economies which will result from the enactment of \n     the national tobacco settlement;\n       (3) any compensation provided to tobacco growers and \n     tobacco growing communities as part of Federal legislation to \n     implement the national tobacco settlement should be included \n     within the $368,500,000,000 in payments which are to be \n     provided over the next 25 years; and\n       (4) No provisions should be included in any Federal \n     legislation to implement the national tobacco settlement \n     which would restrict or adversely affect the continued \n     administration of a viable Federal tobacco program which \n     operates at no net cost to the taxpayer.\n       Sec. 521. Nothing in this Act may be construed to interfere \n     with, or abrogate, any agreement previously entered into \n     between any State and any private attorney or attorneys with \n     respect to litigation involving tobacco.\n       Sec. 522.

Each \n     local educational agency shall submit the number to the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) The Secretary shall determine the amount awarded to \n     each local educational agency under subsection (a) as \n     follows:\n       (1) First, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine a per child amount by \n     dividing the total amount of funds described in subsection \n     (b), by the total number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students in all States.\n       (2) Second, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine the baseline amount for \n     each local educational agency by multiplying the per child \n     amount determined under paragraph (1) by the number of \n     kindergarten through grade 12 students that are served by the \n     local educational agency.\n       (3) Lastly, the Secretary shall compute the amount awarded \n     to each local educational agency as follows:\n       (A) Multiply the baseline amount determined under paragraph \n     (2) by a factor of 1.1 for local educational agencies serving \n     States that are in the least wealthy quintile of all States \n     as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the per capita \n     income of individuals in the States.\n       (B) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.05 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     second least wealthy such quintile.\n       (C) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.00 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     third least wealthy such quintile.\n       (D) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .95 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     fourth least wealthy such quintile.\n       (E) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .90 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     wealthiest such quintile.\n       (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the Secretary shall \n     compute the amount awarded to each local educational agency \n     serving the State of Alaska or Hawaii by multiplying the base \n     line amount determined under paragraph (2) for the local \n     educational agency by a factor of 1.00.\n       (e) If the total amount of funds described in subsection \n     (b) that are made available to carry out subsection (a) is \n     insufficient to pay in full all amounts awarded under \n     subsection (d), then the Secretary shall ratably reduce each \n     such amount.\n       (f) If the Secretary determines that a local educational \n     agency has knowingly submitted false information under \n     subsection (c) for the purpose of gaining additional funds \n     under subsection (a), then the local educational agency shall \n     be fined an amount equal to twice the difference between the \n     amount the local educational agency received under subsection \n     (d), and the correct amount the local educational agency \n     would have received if the agency had submitted accurate \n     information under subsection (c).\n       (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Education shall award the total amount of funds \n     made available under this Act to carry out title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for fiscal \n     year 1998 directly to local educational agencies in \n     accordance with paragraph (2) to enable the local educational \n     agencies to support programs or activities for kindergarten \n     through grade 12 students that the local educational agencies \n     deem appropriate.\n       (2) Each local educational agency shall receive an amount \n     awarded under this subsection that bears the same relation to \n     the total amount of funds made available under this Act to \n     carry out title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 for fiscal year 1998 as the number of children \n     counted under section 1124(c) of such Act for the local \n     educational agency for fiscal year 1997 bears to the total \n     number of students so counted for all local educational \n     agencies for fiscal year 1997.\n       (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     the total amount awarded to local educational agencies in \n     each State under this section shall not be less than the net \n     dollars that States would have received absent the provisions \n     of this section.\n       (i) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``local educational agency'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Education;

Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin, for his cooperation on this bill and the outstanding \nstaff: Bettilou Taylor, Craig Higgins, Jim Sourwine, Jack Chow, Dale \nCabaniss, for the majority, and the outstanding work on the minority \nside by Marsha Simon and Ellen Murray. I thank the leadership of \nSenator Lott--who is right here--and has been here at all times.\n  I believe the passage of this bill is noteworthy. We had great \nproblems passing a separate appropriations bill on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education for fiscal year 1996. We were not able to \nget floor action on a bill until April 1996. It should have been \nfinished on September 30, 1995. We finally broke that logjam with an \namendment, which Senator Harkin and I had offered, for an additional \n$2.6 billion for education and training programs. That legislation was \nthen folded into the omnibus appropriations bill. So we did not have a \nregular Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1996.\n  Then the fiscal year 1997 bill was not considered separately by the \nSenate. Instead, funding was included in an Omnibus appropriations bill \nthat was significantly written by the administration and leadership. I \nsaid at that time that I thought the process was inappropriate. Our \nconstitutional system is to have Congress deliberate and pass the bills \nand then submit them to the White House for approval or veto.\n  This year we were able to complete it the regular Labor, HHS and \nEducation appropriations bill. It took a fair amount of time. We \nstarted on September 2. Senator Lott brought us back at 11 o'clock the \nday after Labor Day. We now mark its conclusion. I am delighted. I also \nthank the distinguished minority leader, the Democratic leader. We have \nconcluded action on an important bill. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, my chairman, \nSenator Specter, in commending, first of all, the staff for all the \nwonderful work they did in pulling this bill together. I especially \nwant to thank Craig Higgins, Bettilou Taylor, Jack Chow, Jim Sourwine \nof Senator Specter's staff. And our staff on our side: Ellen Murray and \nMarsha Simon.\n  This is a very complex, very big bill. It took us a long time to get \nit through. The Senate worked its will, and we did finish action on the \nbill. For the most part, I think it is a good bill, and I think it does \nmove us in the right direction. There is a lot of good stuff in there \nfor children's health, preventive health care measures. There are good \nprovisions in there dealing with human services. For the most part, \nthere are a lot of good items in there that will advance the cause of \neducation in this country.\n  However, I must once again, Mr. President, for the record state that \nthe adoption of the Gorton amendment basically does away with all the \ntargeted programs that this Congress has supported on a bipartisan \nbasis for so long; things like vocational education, bilingual \neducation, education technology, and some of the newer ones, like Goals \n2000. These are all done away with by the Gorton amendment.\n  What it says is we are going to take all this money and it goes to \nthe local education agencies without any restrictions whatsoever. I am \nconcerned that this was not widely known by a number of Senators when \nthe vote was taken, and what also was not widely known, I don't \nbelieve, is that we have always had a cap, a limitation on how much \nmoney could be spent for administration.\n  That has been even more heavily supported on the Republican side than \nthe Democratic side, and yet that is removed. So the money that we have \nsaid should go out to States for vocational education will now go to a \nlocal education agency, and they can do whatever they want with it. \nThey can build\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\na swimming pool. They can pay their superintendents whatever they want. \nThey can take, not the 5-percent cap we have on administration, they \ncan say we want to use 20 percent for administration.\n  Also, we have said in the past that these moneys should be used to \nsupplement, not supplant, State efforts. That is taken away. So what \ncan happen is all the money we put out to an area now that normally \nwould go for vocational education or education technology or safe and \ndrug-free schools, all of that money now doesn't have to be used for \nthat, and the State can say, ``OK, we're not going to put the money in, \nwe'll just use the Federal dollars and we'll take our money for roads, \nbridges'' and whatever else the State wants to do with their money, \nthus downgrading the amount of funds that actually go into education.\n\n  I know it was said by the Senator from Washington, ``Well, not all \nknowledge resides in Washington; do we know what to do best in local \nschool districts? The answer to that, obviously, is no. Keep in mind \nthis money is not forced on the States. We are just saying this is \nFederal tax money that we vote to collect. And, yes, we do have a right \nand an obligation under the Constitution of the United States to decide \nhow that money is to be spent.\n  We don't have the obligation or the right to decide how States spend \ntheir own State tax dollars, but we certainly do have the right and the \nconstitutional obligation to decide how we spend Federal tax dollars. \nAnd that's what we said. We want it spent on vocational education. We \nwant it spent on safe and drug-free schools. Those programs have been \nsupported widely on both sides of the aisle.\n  We have also said we don't want more than 5 percent of that money to \ngo to administrative costs, which has been widely supported on both \nsides of the aisle. That is all taken away by the Gorton amendment.\n  Mr. President, I talked with a number of my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle--certainly not all of them--but a great number of them \nprior to the vote on final passage. While I voted for final passage of \nthe bill, because there is a lot more good than bad in it, I must state \nfor the record that if, in fact, this provision is not dropped in \nconference, if we don't have the votes to drop it in conference, if it \ncomes back from conference, as the minority manager on this bill, I am \ngoing to vote against it.\n  I hope that the President will send strong signals that he will veto \nthis bill if this provision remains in the bill because it would do \naway with years and years of what we have done to focus attention on \nareas of education, like vocational education, safe and drug-free \nschools, education technology and others, that we thought were so \nnecessary in order to move this country forward. I just hope this \nprovision will be dropped in conference and that we can come back and \nsupport the bill out of conference with the same strong vote that we \nhad here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information then of all Senators, \nthat is three judicial nominations that have been cleared on both sides \nof the aisle, although recorded votes will be required, and then two \nU.S. attorneys that have been on the calendar for some time, U.S. \nAttorney Sharon Zealey of Ohio and U.S. Attorney James Hurd of the \nVirgin Islands. We also have two nominees for the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting that we are able to confirm.\n  With these nominations moving forward, I think it is very positive \nfor the Senate. I want the Senators to be aware that there will be \nthree back-to-back votes beginning at 2 p.m. today.\n  Also, I am very pleased we are going to be able to get clearance for \nall committees to meet during the afternoon hours and the rest of this \nmorning.\n  I believe, Mr. President, we will momentarily be prepared to go to \nopening statements with regard to the Food and Drug Administration \nreform. Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy are here ready to proceed.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the comments made by Senator Harkin, \nthe fundamental difference in his position and our position with regard \nto education funds is that we just believe that the people at the local \nlevel and people at the State level want good education in their \nschools. I am a big advocate of vocational education, but I just happen \nto believe that if the State of Mississippi had more discretion in how \nthose funds are to be used, they probably would put more money in \nvocational education in our State and less money in some of the \nprograms they are mandated to do by the Federal Government.\n  We want good vocational education. We want safe schools. The \ndifference is we just think that parents and teachers at the local \nlevel would do a better job of deciding how to educate their children \nthan dictates from Washington, DC, and the Federal bureaucracy. It has \nnot worked. We spent billions of dollars on education, and the test \nscores and the quality of education and the safety of the schools and \nparental involvement has gone down, down, down, down.\n  It is time we try something else to really improve education in \nAmerica. That is what we are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9133-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9133-S9157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk is \na modification of the committee amendment, and it is the amendment we \ndesire to move forward on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1130 is a modification of the \ncommittee substitute, and cloture has been filed on that amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, filing a cloture motion sort of indicates a serious situation \nwhich requires its action. I am pleased to report that I am more \noptimistic now than I have been at any time that a vote will not be \nnecessary to have cloture and that we are all working very long and \nhard upon resolving the remaining questions. The most difficult one \nthat we were facing appears to be resolved. So it is my firm belief \nthat by the time we come before this body again, other than today's \ndebate, we will have an opportunity to expeditiously pass an FDA bill \nfor the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that we have it passed \nin time to prevent the problems which might occur by failing to do so.\n  Legislation to reform and modernize the Food and Drug Administration \nhas been under consideration by Congress for over 3 years. At least six \nhearings have been held over the past 2 years in the Senate.\n  Last year, our measure was reported out of committee but never \nreached the floor for full consideration. This year, we have held \nhearings and worked through months of negotiations with my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts and with the administration.\n  S. 830 passed out of the Labor Committee on a vote of 14-4, a strong \nstatement as to the bipartisan support this moderate measure enjoys. \nLast week we had a vote on the motion to proceed, and the vote was 89-5 \nthat we begin consideration of this measure. We are here today to do \nthat. The Senate spoke loud and clear last week: ``Let's move on the \nbill. Let's consider amendments. And let us vote.'' We have now had \nover 15 hours of debate on this measure stretching back to before the \nAugust recess.\n  Most recently, we spent a good part of Friday and Monday debating \nessentially 6 pages out of the 152-page bill. The time to move forward \non this measure is now. I urge Senators to examine this measure, and I \nbelieve they will agree with me that it provides moderate, incremental \nbut important improvements to the FDA while continuing the agency's \n``gold standard'' of public safety.\n  I have never worked harder on a bill, and I say the same for the \nmembers of the committee, than we have on this one. The number of hours \nthat have been spent bringing about consensus is incredible. I thank my \nranking member and our staff for their cooperation and for placing us \nin a position where I believe we can expeditiously pass this next week \nwithout the necessity of having to invoke cloture.\n  So at this point, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I have on other occasions, I pay \ntribute to my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, who \nhas been shepherding this very complicated but enormously important \nhealth policy issue through the Senate. As he has correctly stated, \nthere has been broad agreement on a number of the very important \naspects of the bill that relate to the drug and medical device \nprovisions.\n  We have made considerable progress on one other aspect of the \nlegislation, and that deals with an amendment which was added by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, which I will address momentarily. There are \nstill some very important issues that are still being considered by \nMembers. All of us are hopeful that we will have a positive outcome, \nbut we are not quite there yet.\n  Mr. President, just on another item, I want to identify myself with \nthe excellent remarks of my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin, on the vote that was taken just an hour or so ago about the \nblock granting of various education programs.\n\n  I think all of us have understood that the role of the Federal \nGovernment is very limited in terms of its help and assistance to local \ncommunities in terms of education. We have a much more profound \nresponsibility in the areas of higher education. But our \nresponsibilities in the elementary and secondary education respects \nthat education is a local function but also an important State \nresponsibility.\n  That is why for every dollar that is expended, only about 6 cents of \nthat dollar really comes from the Federal Government. The targeting of \nthose programs has been in the areas where there has been, as he \npointed out and others have recognized, general recognition nationwide \nof very important national objectives, and that is with the most \ndisadvantaged students, primarily in the areas of basic skills--basic \nskills--math and science programs in the title I programs across this \ncountry, the neediest children in the most disadvantaged areas. It is a \nvery important program. It has been evaluated, has had broad support. \nThat is one of the very important areas.\n  There have been adjustments about what programs will be in and what \nprograms will be out, but you cannot get away from the fact that these \nprograms that have been included are targeted and by and large go to \nlocal communities where there is wide discretion. If you take the Goals \n2000, 90 percent of that fund is spent at the local level. You can't \nget any more in terms of local control than what we have at the present \ntime.\n  You find that there is 2 percent administrative costs by the \nDepartment of Education in the overall programming, 6 percent at the \nState level of all of these various programs. A great percent of that 6 \npercent is technical assistance, goes to local communities that are \ntrying to deal perhaps with special-needs children. Maybe it is a small \ncommunity that has two or three members of a class that have special \nneeds. They do not develop a whole program, but there are other \nschools, other school districts that have similar kinds of needs.\n  This technical assistance helps and assists those local communities: \nthe School to Work Program has had strong bipartisan support--we still \nremember the strong Republican support to try to help young people move \nfrom school into the employment programs and into employment--the drug-\nfree schools to try to do something about the problems of drug \naddiction and violence in our various school districts.\n  Now, we do not know. There is no accountability in this particular \nprogram. There is no requirement for reporting on how the money is \nexpended. It bypassed even the States, so the States will not have an \nunderstanding of how these resources are going to be spent. We do not \nknow which States\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\nare going to be advantaged, which disadvantaged or communities \nadvantaged or disadvantaged.\n  So I join in expressing strong reservations. I want to say very \nclearly that if this comes back, this particular provision, we are \ngoing to take some time on the floor of the U.S. Senate to really make \nsure that not only every Member of this body understands it but all \nAmericans understand it. If the local States want to expend additional \nresources, let them go out and tax their local communities to do so. If \nthey want it, let them do it. But if we are going to commit ourselves \nto trying to raise resources to meet targeted needs for the neediest \nchildren in this country, we ought to be able to do it. If you are \ngoing to take that and block grant it and send it back to the States \nand just use the Federal tax system to raise these funds, that ought to \nbe done in a different forum. We will have a longer time to debate it \nif it comes back. But we should not permit a vote in support of the \ngeneral appropriations to go by without some comment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am pleased that we have achieved an important \ncompromise on one of the most important issues in the FDA reform \nlegislation, the issue of Federal preemption of State regulation of \nover-the-counter drugs and cosmetics.\n  I compliment Senator Gregg, Secretary Shalala, and others involved in \nworking out this responsible agreement. It will assure that States have \nthe ability to step in to protect consumers from cosmetics when \nnecessary while also providing companies reasonable guarantees that \nwhen the FDA has acted effectively to protect consumers, they will not \nbe subjected to conflicting and potentially duplicative labeling \nrequirements.\n  Under the agreement, the Federal Government will not preempt State \nregulation of the safety of a cosmetic. This is appropriate. If a State \nfeels strongly enough about a particular ingredient or a product to ban \nit or to take similar actions, it should be free to do so. States \nvirtually never use this authority. But even though it is rarely used, \nit should be preserved.\n  In the critical realm of packaging and labeling where States have \nbeen most active in ensuring consumers receive the information they \nneed to protect themselves, this amendment strikes a fair balance. The \nreason preserving States' ability to act is so important is that FDA \nregulation has been weak. Under this agreement, States would continue \nto have the ability to act to protect their consumers except in those \ncases where the FDA has already taken appropriate action in a specific \narea.\n  The compromise reached in section 762, which relates to the \npreemption of the State regulation for the packaging and labeling of \ncosmetics, will assure that the States retain full authority to \nregulate cosmetics in those circumstances when the FDA has not acted. \nAs you know, I think it is essential for the States to be able to \nregulate the labeling and packaging of cosmetics whenever the FDA has \nnot acted. This is especially important because there is so little FDA \nregulation in the area of cosmetics.\n  Section 762 would preempt a State labeling and packaging requirement \nonly when FDA has specifically acted on the same aspect of the labeling \nor packaging of that cosmetic. Thus, if FDA issues a regulation that \nrequires cosmetic manufacturers to include a specific warning about an \naspect of an ingredient in a cosmetic, a State cannot require a \ndifferent warning about the same aspect of that ingredient.\n  For example, if the FDA required a warning label for a particular \nproduct regarding its use by pregnant women, the State would be \nprohibited from requiring a different warning label for the same hazard \nand product. On the other hand, where the FDA has not taken action, the \nStates would be free to fill the gap. So, if we are going to breathe \nnew life into the FDA to take on more and more kinds of \nresponsibilities to assure the public in terms of some of these health \nhazards, as a result of the debates we have had in the past days, they \nare free to do so.\n  On the other hand, if a State wants to require a warning on a \ncosmetic and FDA has not acted, the State can require that warning. For \nexample, Minnesota has required a caution statement on flammable \nproducts. This provision would not preempt that requirement because FDA \nhas not acted.\n  Similarly, if FDA requires a warning about a specific ingredient \ncontained in a cosmetic, ingredient A, and a State wants to require a \nwarning about another ingredient in the same cosmetic, ingredient B, \nthe State would not be preempted. Likewise, if FDA requires a warning \nabout a certain aspect of an ingredient for example, ingredient A \ncauses cancer, a State can require a warning about a different aspect \nof the same ingredient for example, ingredient A causes birth defects. \nThe bottom line is that the States are preempted only when FDA has \nacted on the same ingredient and the same health concern.\n  Finally, this provision does not in any way affect the State's \nability to regulate the safety of cosmetics. Thus, if FDA has a \nspecific labeling requirement for a cosmetic ingredient about a \nparticular concern, the State may take additional steps, such as a ban \non the ingredient, to protect the public health, although the State \ncannot require additional labeling about the concern for that \ningredient.\n  This may very well be an invitation to give the FDA the authority and \nthe resources to adequately regulate cosmetics, but if they do not do \nit, which is the condition today, we are not going to be interfering \nwith the States. That is very, very important.\n  The debate on this issue has highlighted the potential hazards that \ncosmetics pose to consumers, especially women, which are too often \nunderestimated.\n  A study by the respected, nonpartisan General Accounting Office \nreported that more than 125 ingredients available for use in cosmetics \nare suspected in causing cancer. Other cosmetics may cause adverse \neffects on the nervous system, including convulsions. Still other \ningredients are suspected of causing birth defects. And a carefully \ncontrolled study found that 1 in 60 users suffered a cosmetic-related \ninjury identified by a physician.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, there are enormous numbers of new \ncompounds, an enormous expansion of the use of various products, \nincluding toxic products, that are being utilized in cosmetics. We want \nto make sure that the States, through their own public health agencies \nor through various studies or through their research, are going to be \nable to raise health concerns necessary to protect their consumers.\n  Mr. President, we have outlined at other times on the floor various \nitems which raise some important concerns--alpha-hydroxy acid, feminine \nhygiene products, and talcum powder. We have heard from Dr. Wallinga, a \nphysician at the Natural Resource Defense Council. He points out the \ndangers of these products citing studies in prestigious medical \njournals.\n  We have in this compromise preserved the right of the States to \nprotect the public.\n  We have seen recently the impact of State laws on public health. In \nCalifornia, for example, action has been taken against Grecian Formula \nand toluene in nail polish.\n  We also know of other States that have introduced legislation aimed \nat further regulation of cosmetics. New York, for example, is pursuing \nexpiration dating of certain cosmetics. Ohio and Texas are also \nconsidering additional regulation of cosmetics. My own State of \nMassachusetts is pursuing a consumer right-to-know law similar to that \nin California.\n  Nothing in this legislation will infringe upon these or similar \nactivities by the States to protect the public.\n  The agreement we have reached today is a very reasonable one. I \ncommend Senator Gregg for his hard work in making it a reality. The \nfact is neither the Food and Drug Administration nor the States are \ndoing enough to protect women from the dangers posed by cosmetics. This \nissue deserves to be a high priority. I intend to see that it is.\n  Mr. President, regarding remaining issues in the legislation, I hope \nwe can have the same hard work and accommodation in addressing these \nissues before we turn to the legislation. They deal with important \nquestions about the procedures of the Food and Drug Administration in \nreviewing medical devices. We want to make sure that the medical \ndevices that are going to be used on the American public are safe\n\n[[Page S9148]]\n\nand effective. We want to make sure that FDA reviewers look at data on \nthe use of a medical device that is clearly indicated by the technical \ndesign of the device--whether or not it is on the label. Under the \ncurrent language, FDA would be unable to make a complete review of the \ndevice. The public would be deprived of assurances they have today that \ndevices are truly safe and effective. We talked about this previously \non the floor of the U.S. Senate. We will have further opportunity to \naddress this issue. It is an extremely important one.\n  A second item we hope to address is ensuring that FDA can consider \ncertain manufacturing practices that produce an unsafe product in \nclearing a medical device for marketing. The language requires FDA to \nallow a new device on the market even if the manufacturer is producing \ndefective devices. This provision endangers the public health by \nputting unsafe products on the market. It also requires the Food and \nDrug Administration to spend its resources chasing after unsafe medical \ndevices already on the market rather than simply requiring that the \ndevice be produced safely in the first place.\n  These are important items and in my full statement, to a considerable \ndegree, I expand on them.\n  There are environment considerations, the effective removal of the \nenvironmental impact statements under NEPA. I do not remember \nconsidering this provision as part of our hearings on this legislation. \nI do not feel that we should start taking various agencies and \nexempting them from considering the environmental impact of their \nactions. I think this is an issue that we should address.\n  My colleagues have raised other questions in terms of the ethical \nissues that surround the payment of third party reviewers. These \nindividuals are going to be reviewing products that are manufactured by \nthe same companies that are paying them. This raises important ethical \nissues. I will have an opportunity to debate and take action on some of \nthose.\n  I thank very much, Mr. President, the chairman of the committee, for \nhis continued cooperation, and the other Members for their help and \nassistance. I am particularly grateful to Senator Gregg for his \ncooperation in helping us work out a satisfactory resolution of the \namendment on cosmetics.\n  Consumers have suffered painful, permanent injuries from hair \ntreatment products that have caught fire. They have suffered serious \nurinary tract infections from bubble bath. They have suffered life-\nthreatening allergic reactions to hair dyes, and severe chemical burns \nfrom skin creams and sun tan lotions. The GAO concluded that \n``cosmetics are being marketed in the United States which may pose a \nserious hazard to the public.''\n  And these are only the acute injuries that require immediate medical \ncare. The poisons in cosmetics can also cause long-term injuries and \nillnesses that do not develop for years after exposure.\n  Three specific products highlight the risks consumers face. Alpha-\nhydroxy acid is one of the hottest selling cosmetic products on the \nmarket, with sales of roughly a billion dollars a year. It is sold to \nerase fine lines and tighten the skin. FDA has received numerous \ncomplaints of adverse effects from the use of these products. Alpha-\nhydroxy acids have been linked to severe redness, burning, blistering, \nbleeding, rash, itching, and skin discoloration. Most troubling, there \nis concern that alpha-hydroxy may promote skin cancer by increasing \nsensitivity to sun exposure. Yet these products are in the \nmarketplace--with no warning labels and no limits on the concentrations \nthat may be sold. Under this bill, every State would be prohibited from \nrequiring these sensible warnings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may put a fact sheet laying the issues \non alpha-hydroxy in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWho Will Act to Protect the Public From Hazardous Products in Cosmetics \n                     If S. 830 Passes? No One Will!\n\n(Statement of David Wallinga, MD, MPA, Senior Scientist, Public Health \n    Program, Natural Resources Defense Council, September 10, 1997)\n\n       People often assume that government is there to protect \n     them. They figure that if a consumer product is sold at the \n     corner drug or department store, it must some passed some \n     sort of regulatory scrutiny. People would especially like to \n     believe that cosmetics--the products they put on their hair, \n     lips, faces and underarms each day--have been adequately \n     tested and found to be safe.\n       They couldn't be more wrong. As a physician, I couldn't \n     believe it when it first learned how powerless the Food and \n     Drug Administration is to regulate cosmetics in a way that \n     ensures their safety. FDA's lack of regulatory authority is \n     based on a law from 1938--a time when scientists knew very \n     little about the potential health effects of the chemicals \n     found in cosmetics. This law only lets FDA act if a cosmetic \n     has been adulterated or misbranded. What's even more amazing \n     is that the law has absolutely no requirement that cosmetic \n     products be tested for safety.\n       That means the thousands of chemicals currently found in \n     cosmetics: Do not have to be tested to see if they are \n     absorbed through the skin and in the blood; do not have to be \n     tested to see if the cause cancer; do not have to be tested \n     to see if they cause allergies or infections; do not have to \n     be tested for effects on the brain or nervous system; do not \n     have to be tested to see if they affect fertility or the \n     reproductive organs; and do not have to be tested for their \n     effects on infants and children, who can be more susceptible \n     to the toxic effects of certain chemicals.\n       It is outrageous that products which people put on their \n     faces, their underarms and other parts of their body each day \n     are not even adequately tested for safety. Testing of the \n     pesticide in your dog's flea collar is more extensive than \n     that for cosmetics. This, despite the fact that cosmetics are \n     often used by pregnant women, and women of reproductive age. \n     Since many chemicals in cosmetics are fat-soluble, or are \n     organic solvents, it means they can penetrate the skin--and \n     possibly enter the fetus where they may cause reproductive \n     harm.\n       It gets worse. The Senate is now proposing to strip the \n     states of much of their regulatory authority over cosmetics \n     as well. In particular, the Senate would limit the states \n     ability to provide consumers with product warnings and other \n     information, including adequate labeling. This will extend \n     FDA's ignorance about potentially-toxic cosmetic products to \n     consumers. It will also strip consumers of their only \n     conceivable protection against these products. In this \n     regulatory magic act, science will have been frozen solid. \n     FDA is already frozen into the science of the 1930s; now, we \n     are freezing out states from acting on any new scientific \n     information. This might be great news for a $20 billion \n     dollar-a-year industry, but its pretty lousy news for public \n     health.\n       Each year, around 1000 new cosmetic products enter the \n     consumer market. In perfumes and fragrances alone, there are \n     at least 1500 different chemicals. How many of these are \n     safe? No one knows. But because of the FDA's impotence, it is \n     certain that the vast majority have not been broadly tested \n     for health effects, and are not well understood from a \n     scientific standpoint.\n       There are some cosmetics, however, whose safety we already \n     have good reason to question. Skin-peeling creams, for \n     example, are extremely popular. But they contain alpa-\n     hydroxyacids which have been shown to greatly increase the \n     skin's susceptibility to ultraviolent light. Someone who has \n     used one of these creams recently would want to be careful \n     about sun exposure, to prevent sunburn and avoid the \n     increased risk of skin cancer. How will the consumer know to \n     use sun screen or avoid sun exposure after using these \n     creams? The short answer is, they won't.\n       FDA not only lacks the authority to require safety testing, \n     it also has very weak authority to require product labels \n     that reflect health and safety concerns about cosmetics. Even \n     worse, the proposed bill would deny individual states the \n     authority to require such labels. It doesn't seem like much \n     to ask: a label that would tell people to avoid sun or use \n     sunscreen. It's not a product ban, it's not changing the \n     formulation . . . it's just an advisory label. But it will be \n     forbidden by this law. We will instead just have to hope that \n     industry voluntarily labels its products so that people use \n     them correctly.\n       There's more. In medicine we know about a disease called \n     ``talcosis'' which occurs from inhaling talcum powder. \n     Mostly, that's a problem in talc workers. But what about a \n     recent study from Yale University, a study that confirmed \n     earlier research finding an association between the use of \n     talcum powder on the genital region and ovarian cancer in \n     women? Scientists have shown that talc particles can enter \n     the body and accumulate in ovarian tissue. There, they are \n     associated with a 40% increased risk of ovarian cancer. \n     Ovarian cancer is hard to diagnose, hard to treat \n     effectively, and is often fatal. It is something which is \n     much better to prevent than to try and treat once it occurs. \n     Yet if a state wanted to notify women that talcum powder \n     should not be used regularly in the genital region, that \n     would be illegal under this new law.\n       These are only two examples of the many, many potential \n     hazards from the thousands of chemicals in cosmetic products. \n     There are more: hair dyes and shampoos which contain coal \n     tars which are known to cause cancer; feminine hygiene \n     products associated with infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and \n     an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease; lipstick \n     and hair dyes which contain lead,\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\n     used by pregnant women, and particularly dangerous for \n     fetuses; and numerous products which contain immune system \n     sensitizers, such as cinnamates, which can cause severe \n     allergic reactions, skin rashes, or asthma.\n       Currently, we have an empty law regulating these cosmetics, \n     a law directing the FDA into empty regulation. Until we have \n     a better system in place at the federal level, we should \n     certainly not interfere with the right of states to act on \n     these hazards, and to protect the health of their citizens, \n     independently. Our best hope as consumers, as patients, and \n     as health care professionals, is to let states fill this \n     regulatory gap.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Fact Sheet: FDA Reform Bill and Preemption of Cosmetic Regulation by \n                               the States\n\n       The regulation of health and safety has traditionally \n     rested in the hands of the States.\n       Cosmetics pose substantial threats to the health and safety \n     of consumers.\n       There is no substantial Federal regulatory presence in \n     cosmetics (see below), but proposed cosmetic preemption would \n     completely bar the States from exercising their traditional \n     regulation of cosmetic labeling, packaging and consumer \n     information and would severely limit states ability to \n     regulate these products in other ways.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Traditionally, preemption only takes place in areas where \n     the Federal government has a strong presence, or has \n     ``occupied that field.''\n       FDA currently employs less than 30 people to regulate the \n     $20 billion cosmetics industry. Only 2 employees actually \n     regulate cosmetic packaging and labeling.\n       FDA has no authority to approve cosmetic products or review \n     ingredients, require companies to register, or to even report \n     cosmetic-related injuries.\n       Nor can FDA require products be tested for safety or the \n     results of safety testing be made available to the FDA or the \n     public. It has no legal access to manufacturers' records. Nor \n     can it require a product recall--cosmetic recalls are \n     voluntary.\n       The basic Federal law regulating cosmetics has not been \n     amended since 1938.\n       A 1978 General Accounting Office (GAO) study found that \n     more than 125 cosmetic ingredients were suspected of causing \n     cancer. Twenty ingredients were believed to cause central \n     nervous system disorders, ranging from headaches and \n     drowsiness to convulsions. Twenty-five were believed to cause \n     birth defects The industry adds approximately 1,000 new \n     chemicals annually, with no requirement to show that these \n     chemicals are safe.\n       The GAO concluded that ``cosmetics are being marketed in \n     the United States which may pose a serious hazard to the \n     public'' and recommended that additional Federal authorities \n     be granted to FDA to protect the public.\n\n\n                      S. 830 and state preemption\n\n       There is no public record, hearings, testimony, studies or \n     otherwise, from the 104th or 105th Congresses which \n     substantively addresses the issue of cosmetic preemption.\n       The cosmetics preemption provision was not in the \n     Chairman's original mark, nor was it subject to hearings.\n       States will be completely barred from regulating cosmetic \n     labeling and packaging under S. 830. States will also be \n     barred from establishing any requirements for communicating \n     the safety and effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic to the \n     public.\n       States will also be barred from other forms of safety \n     regulation if the Federal government has acted in that area, \n     even if the Federal regulation is outdated, narrow, or vague.\n       The industry cannot cite one example of a burdensome state \n     regulation that this law preempts.\n\n\n             others opposed to s. 830 preemption provision\n\n       The Administration position states, ``if the bill were \n     maintained in its present form, and the outstanding issues \n     were not addressed, I would be forced to recommend to the \n     President that he veto this legislation.''\n       A broad coalition of state officials, women's \n     organizations, environmental advocates, and others concerned \n     about public health opposes this provision (see attached \n     letters)\n\n\n                     examples of cosmetic injuries\n\n       A six year old girl in Oakland, California had her mother \n     apply a hair product to her head, which resulted in second \n     degree burns to the child's ears and neck.\n       A 59-year old California woman almost died from an allergic \n     reaction to hair dye.\n       A 47-year old woman had her cornea destroyed by a mascara \n     wand.\n       Still another woman's hair caught fire as the result of an \n     inflammable hair treatment gel.\n       In fact, a carefully controlled three month study found \n     that one in 60 users of cosmetics experienced adverse \n     reactions.\n\n\n                    dangers of widely used products\n\n       The attached fact sheets highlight possible dangers from \n     three widely used cosmetic products: skin creams containing \n     alpha-hydroxy products--skin irritation and burns, long-term \n     risk of skin cancer associated with greater sun sensitivity; \n     feminine hygiene products--pelvic inflammatory disease, \n     ectopic pregnancy, and infertility; and talc and talcum \n     powder--ovarian cancer.\n\n\n                        international standards\n\n       The European Union requires full ingredient listing on \n     packaging, documentary proof of good manufacturing practice \n     and similar proof that extensive testing has been carried \n     out.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Fact Sheet: Hazards of Skin Care Products Containing Alpha-Hydroxy\n\n\n                     what are alpha-hydroxy acids?\n\n       Alpha-hydroxy acids are naturally occurring acids that have \n     recently been included in skin care products. Alpha-hydroxy \n     products promise to erase wrinkles and acne, restore skin \n     elasticity and firmness, and produce younger-looking, \n     smoother skin. They are used both in skin creams intended for \n     daily use and ``skin peels'' that are sometimes described as \n     chemical face lifts.\n       Products containing alpha-hydroxy acids working by \n     penetrating the upper-layer of skin, breaking apart the bonds \n     that hold the skin cells together. The skin then sloughs off \n     these cells.\n       Alpha-hydroxy products include Avon Anew Face Cream, Ponds' \n     Age Defying Complex, Alpha Hydrox Face Cream, Murad, and \n     MDForte.\n       Products containing alpha-hydroxy acids are among the \n     hottest-selling cosmetics, used by millions of women, with \n     sales of roughly a billion dollars a year.\n\n\n what are the concerns about cosmetics containing alpha-hydroxy acids?\n\n       There is very little data on the effects of alpha-hydroxy \n     acids. Researcher suggests that they can cause skin \n     irritation and increased sensitivity to UV radiation, with \n     the potential for increasing risk of skin cancer. There have \n     been no long-term studies of the safety of the product.\n       FDA reported that between 1989 and 1996, there were likely \n     ``many thousands'' of complaints associated with alpha-\n     hydroxy acids, including ``severe redness, swelling \n     (especially in the area of the eyes), burning, blistering, \n     bleeding, rash, itching, and skin discoloration. Many of the \n     products involved are the lower concentration, mass market \n     products.'' (February 23, 1996 letter from Dr. John E. Bailey \n     (Acting Director, Office of Cosmetics and Colors, FDA) to Dr. \n     F. Alan Andersen (Scientific Coordinator and Director, \n     Cosmetic Ingredient Review). At least one major manufacturer \n     has discontinued one of its alpha-hydroxy products because of \n     the high volume of complaints.\n       In fact, FDA was sufficiently concerned about alpha-hydroxy \n     acids that it designated them as their highest priority for \n     review by the National Toxicology Program--a rare occurrence \n     for a cosmetic.\n       A June 1997 report sponsored by the cosmetics industry \n     found that more study is needed to determine if the use of \n     alpha-hydroxy acids to remove the epidermis causes the skin \n     to be more UV sensitive and increasingly susceptible to skin \n     cancer. In the meantime, the report noted that ``some steps \n     should be taken to minimize the potential that use a alpha-\n     hydroxy acid ingredients would result in increased sun \n     sensitivity. Accordingly, the Expert Panel admonished \n     producers of leave-on cosmetics containing alpha-hydroxy acid \n     ingredients to either formulate to avoid increasing sun \n     sensitivity or to provide directions for use that include the \n     daily use of sun protection.'' (Final Report: June 6, 1997 \n     Cosmetic Ingredient Review, pg. 131). The report also made \n     safety recommendations regarding maximum acceptable levels \n     for alpha-hydroxy acids in both products for daily use and \n     products used for skin peels by cosmeticians or health \n     professionals.\n       There are no binding requirements assuring that \n     manufacturers abide by the safety recommendations of the \n     advisory committee with regard to tolerance levels or provide \n     any safety information on the product. Manufacturers' \n     packaging typically includes no warnings on the need to use \n     sunscreen in conjunction with use of the product, no warning \n     on the potential danger of skin cancer from use of the \n     product, no information on risks of skin damage or \n     irritation. Nor are the manufacturers required to list on the \n     package the concentration of alpha-hydroxy acids in the \n     product, or inform users if the other ingredients strengthen \n     or weaken its effectiveness.\n       Under S. 830, States would be prohibited from requiring \n     warning labels or other consumer information about alpha-\n     hydroxy acids.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Fact Sheet: Adverse Health Effects of Feminine Hygiene Products\n\n       Over one third of all women regularly use feminine hygiene \n     products--generating roughly $100 million a year in sales.\n       These products have been shown to cause upper reproductive \n     tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic \n     pregnancies and infertility in women.\\1\\\n       Analyses has shown that use of these products increased the \n     overall risk of pelvic inflammatory disease by 73% and the \n     risk of ectopic pregnancy by 76%.\\2\\\n       The current literature also suggests an increased risk in \n     cervical cancer.\\3\\\n       Researchers at University of Washington, Brigham and \n     Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Mount Sinai School \n     of Medicine and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     have all published data regarding the adverse effects of \n     feminine hygiene products.\\4\\\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\n       The National Women's Health Network testified that the FDA \n     needs to do more to educate women and recommended that \n     feminine hygiene product labeling information on their severe \n     adverse effects.\\5\\\n       Under S. 830, States would be prohibited from requiring \n     warning labels or other consumer information on feminine \n     hygiene products.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     1.

Mr. President, a critical point is that an industry-\nappointed panel itself set out safety tolerance levels for use of the \nproduct with regard to short-term effects and warned that the product \nshould not be used without sunscreen. Yet, there is absolutely no \nbinding requirement that manufacturers follow these recommendations--\nand virtually none of the products carry the information or warnings \ndeveloped by the industry's own committee that would enable consumers \nto help protect their own safety. And, in point of fact, there has been \nno truly independent evaluation of the work of the industry panel. In \nfact, the FDA is so concerned about the safety of alpha-hydroxy acid \nthat it has chosen it has its top priority for review by the \nprestigious National Toxicology Program.\n  A second example is feminine hygiene products, which have sales of \n$100 million a year. More than one-third of women use them--but they \npose serious health hazards. They have been shown to cause upper \nreproductive tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic \npregnancies, and infertility. They may place women at additional hazard \nfor cervical cancer. Women using these products should have the right \nto warning labels informing them of these hazards. But the FDA has done \nlittle to protect or warn women against these dangers.\n  There are a substantial number of studies on the safety of these \nproducts. The evidence that they are dangerous seems incontrovertible--\nbut this legislation would prevent States from acting to simply warn \nwomen of the dangers. How outrageous it is that women should face \nillness and sterility without being warned of the danger of a seemingly \nharmless and beneficial product.\n  A third example is talc, or talcum powder is widely used in popular \nbath and cosmetic products. But it is chemically similar to asbestos, \nand it has long been suspected of causing cancer. A number of studies \nhave suggested the possibility of a link to ovarian cancer, which \nafflicts 26,000 women annually--but there are no warning labels on \nthese products. American women deserve better protection from their \nGovernment.\n  These three issues have been carefully analyzed by Dr. David \nWallinga, a physician and the senior scientist at the Natural Resources \nDefense Council. He points out the dangers of each of these three \nproducts based on studies in prestigious medical journals from \nresearchers at institutions like Yale and the Mount Sinai Hospital in \nNew York. I ask unanimous consent to enter his comments in the Record, \nalong with the articles analyzing these issues.\n  Federal oversight of this $20 billion industry today is extremely \nlimited. The basic Federal law regulating cosmetics has not been \nupdated since 1938. The FDA has less than 30 employees overseeing this \nhuge industry--and only two employees dealing with the critical issues \nof packaging, labeling, and consumer warnings. The FDA has no authority \nto require manufacturers to register their plants and products. It \ncannot require manufacturers to file data on the ingredients in their \nproducts. It cannot compel manufacturers to file reports on cosmetic-\nrelated injuries. It cannot require that products be tested for safety \nor that the results of safety testing be made available to the agency. \nIt does not have the right of access to manufacturers' records. It \ncannot require recall of a product.\n  In the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act there are 126 pages \ndevoted to the regulation of drugs and devices; 55 pages are devoted to \nfoods regulation. A full eight pages of the act is dedicated to \ndefinitions. But less than two pages are devoted to cosmetic \nregulation.\n  In 1938, there was no requirement that industry show safety of drugs, \nmedical devices, food additives, or cosmetics before they were \nmarketed. Today, the public demands higher standards of protection, and \nthey have been established for drugs, for medical devices, and for food \nadditives--but not for cosmetics.\n  The agreement we have reached today is a highly reasonable one. I \nespecially commend Senator Gregg for his hard work to make it a \nreality. But the fact is that neither the FDA and the States are doing \nenough to protect women from these dangers. This is an issue that \ndeserves a higher priority, and I intend to do all I can to see that it \ngets it.\n  There are important remaining issues in this legislation, and I hope \nthat with the same hard work and spirit of accommodation we can reach \nagreement on these issues before we return to consideration of this \nlegislation on Tuesday.\n  Two changes in the regulation of devices in particular put consumers \nat unacceptable and unnecessary risk. They should be removed in this \nbill before it goes forward--and the administration has made it clear \nthat they put the whole bill at risk of a veto.\n  A great deal of negotiation has taken place on the medical device \nprovisions of this bill, and I compliment Senator Jeffords, Senator \nCoats, and my other colleagues on the committee for resolving most of \nthe device provisions in a way that is consistent with protection of \nthe public health. But there are at least two medical device provisions \nin the bill which still raise substantial concerns. They could be \ncorrected very simply and with negligible effect to the basic purpose \nand intent of this bill. Yet these corrections have not been made and \nmy colleagues deserve a clear description of the hazards they pose.\n  A brief explanation of how the FDA regulates and clears medical \ndevices for marketing may first be in order. Under current law, \nmanufacturers of\n\n[[Page S9151]]\n\nnew class I and class II devices can get their products onto the market \nby showing that they are substantially equivalent to devices already on \nthe market. For example, the manufacturer of a new laser can get that \nlaser onto the market if it can show FDA that the laser is \nsubstantially equivalent to a laser that is already on the market.\n  Similarly, the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get that \nbiopsy needle onto the market by showing that it is substantially \nequivalent to a biopsy needle already on the market. And the \nmanufacturer of new patient examination gloves can get those gloves \nonto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to \npatent gloves already on the market.\n  Mr. President, these manufacturers are obliged to demonstrate \nsubstantial equivalence to the FDA by showing that the new product has \nthe same intended use as the old product and that the new product has \nthe same technological characteristics as the old product. If the new \nproduct has different technological characteristics, these \ncharacteristics must not raise new types of safety and effectiveness \nquestions in order for the product to still be substantially equivalent \nto the older product.\n  The logic of this process for bringing medical devices onto market is \nquite simple: if a product is very much like an existing product, it \ncan get to market quickly. If it raises new safety or effectiveness \nquestions, those questions should be answered before the product can be \nmarketed.\n  This process for getting new medical devices on the market, commonly \nknown as the 510(k) process, is considered by most to be the easier \nroute to the market. Devices that are not substantially equivalent to a \nclass I or class II device already on the market must go through a full \npremarket review. Thus, device manufacturers have an incentive to get \nnew products on the market through the 510(k) process. And in fact, \nwell over 90 percent of all new devices get on the market through the \nsubmission of a 510(k) application.\n  This legislation seriously compromises the FDA's ability to protect \nthe public health through its regulation of medical devices that are \nmarketed through the 510(k) process. Of the dozens of provisions that \nwe have negotiated and discussed which affect medical devices in this \nbill, these two still raise fundamental public health problems. \nAlthough few in number, these provisions raise substantial risks to the \npublic health which simply cannot be ignored.\n  The first problem raised by this bill relating to medical devices is \nits prohibition on the FDA from considering how a new device will be \nused if the manufacturer has not included that use in its proposed \nlabeling.\n  You may think that this approach makes sense--why should the Agency \nconsider the use of a device if the manufacturer has not specified that \nuse on the label? I'll tell you why--because that proposed label may be \nfalse or misleading. How would the FDA know that? Because the design of \nthe new device may make it perfectly clear that the new device is \nintended for a different use.\n  Let me provide my colleagues with a few examples. Let's talk about \nthe biopsy needle I mentioned before, which is used on breast lesions. \nMost biopsy needles for breast lesions currently on the market take a \ntissue sample that is about the size of the tip of pencil lead. Let's \nassume the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle comes to the FDA with a \n510(k) submission. But this new biopsy needle takes a tissue sample \nthat is 50 times as big--the size of a 1-inch piece of a hot dog.\n  The manufacturer of this new needle has proposed labeling that says \nthat the needle will be used like the old, marketed needles to biopsy \nbreast lesions. But FDA knows that the chunk of tissue being biopsied \nwill usually exceed the size of the lesion. This makes it clear to \nFDA--and to any impartial observer--that the new needle will in most \ncases be used to remove the lesion.\n  Under these circumstances the FDA should be able to ask the \nmanufacturer to provide information on this new use. Is it safe to \nremove lesions? Does it really work? The bill, however, categorically \nbars FDA from asking these essential questions. This means that the FDA \nwould be unable to make a complete review of the device and the public \nwould be deprived of existing assurances that devices are truly safe \nand effective.\n  The proponents of this provision have argued that the FDA could \nsimply say that the change in device design or technology--such as the \nchange in size of the biopsy needle--renders the new product \nunequivalent to the old product. But that is not always true. The \nmanufacturer could argue that there are no new questions of safety or \neffectiveness for the purpose claimed on the label. In the case of the \nbiopsy needle, Mr. President, there are times where a large sample is \nneeded--a sample larger than a pencil tip.\n  So long as the larger needle is safe and effective for removing a \nsample, FDA would still be barred from obtaining data about the new use \nof removing lesions--and to the extent the needle is used for the new \nuse, women could be put at risk for an effective or unsafe treatment of \nbreast cancer.\n  Another good example is surgical lasers. Lasers have been used for \ndecades to remove tissue. Several years ago, a manufacturer added a \nside-firing mechanism to their laser to improve its use in prostate \npatients. While the manufacturer did not include this specific use in \nits proposed labeling, it was transparently clear that the new side-\nfiring design was intended solely for this purpose of treating prostate \npatients.\n  As a result, FDA required the manufacturer to submit data \ndemonstrating the laser's safety and effectiveness in treating prostate \npatients. This is precisely how the device review process should work. \nManufacturers must prove their devices live up to their claims, while \npatients and doctors receive all of the information needed to make the \nbest possible treatment choices.\n  But under this bill, FDA would be prohibited from getting adequate \nsafety data on the laser's use on prostate patients--even though that \nwould be the product's primary use. This defies common sense yet this \nis the result of one troubling and indefensible provision.\n  Other examples in the way that this provision could allow unsafe and \nineffective devices abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for \ngallstones could be modified in a way that clearly was designed to make \nit a treatment for blockages of the carotid artery.\n  Without adequate testing, it could put patients at risk of stroke or \ndeath. But under this bill, the FDA would be prohibited from looking \nbehind the label to the actual intended use of the device. A laser to \nuse to excise warts could have its power raised so that it was also \npossible to use it in smoothing facial wrinkles. But without FDA's \nability to assure adequate testing, the use of the laser for this \npurpose could lead to irreversible scarring.\n  Most companies, of course, will not try to bypass the process in this \nway. But some bad actors will. And this legislation should not force \nthe FDA to fight those bad actors with one hand tied behind it. This \nprovision is like asking a policeman to accept a known armed robber's \nassurance that the only reason he is wearing a mask and carrying a gun \nis that he is going to a costume party.\n  The second way this bill undercuts the FDA's ability to protect the \npublic health and adequately regulate medical devices is the way it \nforces the FDA to clear a new device for marketing even if the Agency \nknows that the manufacturer cannot manufacture a safe device.\n  Let me repeat that statement. It sounds frankly preposterous but it \nis true. One of the bill's provisions actually requires the FDA to \nallow a new device onto the market even if the manufacturer is \nproducing defective devices. Surprisingly, the proponents of this \nprovision freely admit that this is true.\n  Under current law, let's assume that a maker of new examination \ngloves submits a 510(k) to the FDA and claims that the new gloves are \nsubstantially equivalent to gloves already on the market. If the FDA \nknows for a fact from its inspectors that the company uses a \nmanufacturing process that often results in these gloves having holes, \nFDA would simply not clear the gloves for marketing. FDA would find\n\n[[Page S9152]]\n\nthat these gloves are not substantially equivalent to gloves on the \nmarket because gloves on the market don't have holes. That's common \nsense, and fortunately, that's also the law.\n  In contrast, this bill would force FDA to clear the gloves for \nmarketing. At this point, these defective gloves would be sold to \nhospitals, clinics, and HMO's, where they will be used routinely by \ndoctors, nurses, paramedics, and other health professionals every \nsingle day. Every single glove would expose these professionals \nneedlessly to the risk of fatal blood-borne diseases like AIDS and \nhepatitis.\n  Here is the response of the provision's supporters. They argue that \nonce these defective gloves are in the market and being used by health \nprofessionals, FDA can simply institute an enforcement action to remove \nthem from the market. But when hundreds or thousands of defective \ndevices have been distributed, and when dozens or hundreds of \nfacilities may be using these devices, an enforcement action entails \nfar more than blowing a whistle or picking up the phone to place a \nsimple call.\n  In reality, the FDA must coordinate with the U.S. Attorney's office, \nthe U.S. Marshal's Service and persuade the court of jurisdiction to \nissue the appropriate papers. As any attorney or law enforcement \nprofessional can tell you that this takes precious time. And in the \ncase of a defective device which is exposing people to unnecessary \nrisks, time is absolutely critical. The sooner a defective glove is \npulled from the market, the sooner the public is protected.\n  But all this makes absolutely no sense when the FDA today can prevent \nthis situation from ever arising. If this provision becomes law, the \ndebater's point distinguishing between different forms of FDA authority \nwill ultimately be paid for in the health and safety of American \nconsumers placed at needless risk of death and injury. In fact, even \nthe regulated industry is willing to compromise on this provision, \nbecause they recognize that it is so unreasonable.\n  So I hope we can continue to work to compromise these important \ndevices issues over the weekend. We have been successful on so many \nother issues in this bill. These should be resolvable as well.\n  The last unacceptable element of this bill is an assault on basic \nenvironmental protections contained in the National Environmental \nProtection Act. The National Environmental Protection Act of 1969 is a \nkey Federal environmental statute which regulates the Government's own \nactions through environmental impact statements. Under NEPA, Federal \nagencies must undertake a comprehensive environmental planning process \nfor every major action they take. This law is a crucial statutory \nassurance that the work of the Government and the actions of regulated \nindustries are consistent with the guiding principle of environmental \nprotection.\n  Section 602 of the bill broadly exempts the FDA's activities from \nenvironmental impact assessments under NEPA. In fact, the provision \neven precludes the FDA from taking environmental considerations into \naccount in its work. The administration unequivocally opposes this \nprovision. This week, I spoke with the Vice President, who expressed \nhis serious personal concerns about this provision. In just a few \nsentences, this bill opens the door to weakening our environmental \nprotections and lays a welcome mat down for future exemptions and \nfuture attacks on an effective and essential environmental statute.\n  This is a terrible precedent, but it also directly affects the \nenvironment. The FDA regulates products which constitute a quarter of \nour gross domestic product. When it makes decisions on food containers, \nor manufacturing plant approvals, or handling and disposal of medical \nsupplies, it can have an immense impact on the environment.\n  Ironically, this antienvironmental extremism is not even demanded by \nthe regulated industry, which regards the reforms of the NEPA process \nrecently announced by the Clinton administration as fair and balanced.\n  We all agree on the importance of FDA reform. The reauthorization of \nthe Prescription Drug User Fee Program is tremendously important to \nassure that the FDA will have adequate resources to review new drugs \nand biological products quickly and effectively. This legislation \ncontains many significant reforms that can streamline the regulatory \nprocess and codify improvements that FDA has already taken \nadministratively. I compliment Senator Jeffords, the chairman of our \ncommittee, and many other colleagues who have worked hard on this bill \nand have been willing to work together to eliminate many other \ntroublesome provisions in the bill as originally introduced. Let us now \nmove to complete this work by fixing the remaining contentious issues \nincluded in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this legislation is the result of a \nwell-considered process to consult with all points of view and to \nbenefit from the expertise needed to craft legislation on this complex \nmatter. The substitute before us today stands on the shoulders of four \nhearings and a committee markup of a comprehensive Food and Drug \nAdministration reform bill in the 104th Congress.\n  This year we held two more hearings, taking testimony from Food and \nDrug Administration, industry experts, physicians, and consumer \ngroups--and I emphasize ``and consumer groups.'' Staff held dozens of \nmeetings with Food and Drug Administration, experts and patient groups, \ndiscussing in detail every issue of this bill. The negotiation process \nwith Food and Drug Administration, and the minority started in the \ndrafting phase of the bill and continued up to and right through the \nmarkup, and has continued right up to this moment. This has been a \nprocess marked by openness and consultation.\n  The philosophy of this bill is to codify recent efforts of the self-\nreform of the Food and Drug Administration, and a great deal of that is \nself-reform which we are codifying, and to provide the Food and Drug \nAdministration with the tools to do even better in certain areas.\n  We recognize that Congress cannot micromanage an agency like the Food \nand Drug Administration, nor do we want to. But we must set realistic \nperformance goals to ensure the public is protected and well served and \nthat the industry is fairly treated. In an era of flat or declining \nresources, we must give the Food and Drug Administration the management \ntools it needs to manage an increasing workload without the expectation \nof ever-increasing appropriations to assist them.\n  The first title of S. 830 establishes in statute that the mission of \nthe Food and Drug Administration is to protect the public health, \npromptly and efficiently review clinical research, and take appropriate \naction on the marketing of regulated products in a manner that does not \nunduly impede innovation or product availability.\n  From the 1906 Food and Drugs Act through the 1990 Safe Medical \nDevices Act, food and drug law has emphasized the duty of the Food and \nDrug Administration is to protect the public against unsafe or \nineffective products. This legislation, as reflected in the mission \nstatement, strengthens protection of the public from unsafe or \nineffective products and provides a better balance in the law by \nensuring timely access to safe and effective products. It is simple: \nSafe and effective products can be made available more quickly--and \nthey should be. That is what this bill does.\n  The legislation reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of \n1992, commonly referred to as PDUFA, to allow the continued collection \nof user fees from prescription drug manufacturers for 5 additional \nyears. PDUFA I represented a consensus among the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the prescription drug industry, and Congress that the \nindustry would pay user fees to augment the resources of the Food and \nDrug Administration devoted to the review of human drug applications. \nPDUFA I has succeeded in substantially reducing review times for human \ndrug applications, bringing those drugs to the market sooner than \nbefore.\n  At some point in the debate I would like to engage a colloquy with \nSenator Mikulski, a cosponsor of S. 830, to discuss the importance of \nthe performance enhancements that PDUFA will bring to the drug review \nprocess. We have all\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\nbenefited from Senator Mikulski's determination to bring the Food and \nDrug Administration into the 21st century for the benefit of her own \nconstituents who work at the FDA, for the betterment of the burgeoning \nbiotechnology sector in Maryland, and for the parties throughout \nAmerica who are served by the technologies developed by those \ncompanies.\n  Title VII of S. 830, or PDUFA II, would build on the \noriginal legislation by codifying new commitments from FDA to implement \nmore ambitious and comprehensive improvements in the regulatory \nprocess. PDUFA I focused on reducing the length of time taken by FDA in \nreviewing an application. The committee commends FDA for successfully \nmeeting, and at times exceeding, the performance goals established at \nPDUFA I. However, while review times for submitted applications have \nimproved, the period of time taken to get the drug through the drug \ndevelopment phase has recently increased from 5 to 7 years. \nAppropriately, PDUFA II will focus on shortening overall development \ntime.\n\n  It will streamline interaction with the FDA during the highly \nregulated drug development phase and also establish new performance \nlevels and procedures for FDA that are designed to reduce the time \nrequired to show that a drug is ready for FDA review.\n  The bill provides improved access to new treatments and important \ninformation needed by patients. Section 102 establishes a statutory \nright for any person, acting through a physician, to request an \ninvestigational drug, biological product, or device for diagnosis of a \nserious disease or condition. This provision builds upon current FDA \nprograms that have proved so successful for aids and cancer drugs, and \nthis is an area that is critical to all of us.\n  This section of the bill includes modifications urged by the FDA and \npatient groups, that codify important patient protections. These \nprovide patient access under their physician's supervision, to \nunapproved therapies, under the existing emergency use, and \ninvestigational device and drug treatment exemption programs.\n  Another important provision advocated by the patient groups as one of \ntheir top priorities is section 808, which establishes a registry of \nclinical trials, both publicly or privately funded, of experimental \ndrugs and biological or serious life-threatening medical conditions.\n  Registry information must be understandable to the general public and \ninclude the purpose of experimental protocol, trial eligibility \ncriteria, and sites and contact points for people wishing to enroll in \na clinical trial. It is critical that those people who are suffering \nfrom the diseases of this nature be able to find out how they can get \ninvolved and be able to take part in a program which is designed to \nbring them back to health. Patients, health care providers, \nresearchers, and the public would access the registry through toll-free \ntelephone communications and other informational systems. This \nprovision was included in the bill as an amendment offered by Senator \nDodd, based on legislation introduced by Senator Snowe and Senator \nFeinstein. We are all grateful for their leadership in this area. I \nshould add that Senator Dodd, who is a cosponsor of S. 830, must be \nrecognized for his early and unflagging support for enacting broad-\nbased reform this year. He has worked incredibly hard and has been one \nof the most steadfast leaders in bringing forth a bipartisan bill.\n  Yet another provision designed to speed new drugs to patients who \nneed them is section 613. The FDA currently has a number of mechanisms \naimed at streamlining the development and approval process for new \ntherapies for serious and life-threatening conditions. Section 613 \nestablishes a statutory mechanism for identifying breakthrough drugs \nearly in the product development phase. It provides sponsors of such \ndrugs a reasonable opportunity for early interaction with the agency to \nfurther help streamline the development and approval process for such \ndrugs.\n  This provision is intended to clarify and to coordinate some of FDA's \nmechanisms for new drugs and biological products that are intended for \nthe treatment of serious and life-threatening conditions and that \ndemonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such \nconditions. It defines and clarifies a process pursuant to which \nsponsors of these drugs may interact with the FDA, and includes \nprovisions that will ensure that these processes are well known and \nwell understood.\n  I want to mention other changes made in the substitute that have been \nthe subject of discussion between the committee markup and floor \nconsideration.\n  I want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to know what we \nwill be voting on and that they will have an opportunity to review this \nand, hopefully, fully understand it. Certainly, my staff, and I am sure \nSenator Kennedy's staff is available to enlighten them if they have \nquestions. I urge all members to take a look at the bill that is now \nbefore the Senate.\n  The third-party review provision has undergone substantial revision \nsince its was first debated in the 104th Congress. This provision has \nbeen developed under the leadership of Senator Coats, who has played an \nimportant role in advancing FDA modernization throughout this process. \nThis year, he has played a special role in the development of S. 830 \nfrom its inception and provided wise counsel on how to achieve the best \npossible reform at the FDA. The third-party review pilot in this bill \nmoves important expansion to the current FDA third-party review program \nfor medical devices.\n  I should mention that two amendments to the provision on third-party \nreview for medical devices offered by Senator Harkin in committee, \nwhich were not agreed to, did form the basis for subsequent compromise \nreflected in the substitute now before the Senate. To meet the \nSenator's concerns and the concerns of others, the bill sponsors have \nagreed to statutory language establishing the right of FDA to review \nrecords related to compensation arrangements, and excluding from third-\nparty review class III products, products that are implanted for more \nthan 1 year, products that are life sustaining or life supporting, and \nproducts that are of substantial importance in the prevention of \nimpairment to human health.\n  This was an important provision which brought peace of mind to many \nand allowed us to come forward with the bill in the form we have \nnow. These changes in scope and the additional safeguards to protect \nagainst conflict of interest broaden public confidence in this pilot \nand provide FDA with a needed tool to manage an increasing workload of \nmedical device reviews.\n\n  Two other critical provisions to improve the medical device review \nprogram will make the review process more efficient and collaborative \nfor high-technology products--those which offer the greatest benefit \nfor patients and which also experience the longest review times at FDA. \nSenator Wellstone is the sponsor of legislation to reform the medical \ndevice approval process that includes these two provisions and others \nin S. 830, and I applaud his leadership on these issues. Section 301 \ncreates the opportunity for a manufacturer to meet with FDA to \nestablish the type of scientific evidence necessary to demonstrate \neffectiveness for a device. FDA had earlier concerns about binding \ndeterminations of device data requirements needed to show efficacy. In \nresponse to the FDA, the provision has been modified to ensure that the \nagency will receive sufficient information to make such a determination \nand is provided authority to modify the determination where \nappropriate.\n  Manufacturers should not have to spend months wondering if their \napplication is still on track in the review process. Section 302 \nrequires the agency to meet with manufacturers 100 days after a \npremarket approval application is submitted to discuss deficiencies and \nany additional information required for approval. This provision, too, \nwas modified to address FDA's concerns that the agency only be required \nto identify deficiencies known at the time of the 100-day meetings. And \nFDA would only be required to identify information needed to correct \nthose deficiencies.\n\n  In recognition that the mandatory postmarket surveillance authority \nestablished in the 1990 Safe Medical Devices Act was overbroad and \ninconsistently applied, S. 830 made the current mandatory postmarketing \nsurveillance discretionary and limited surveillance to a 24-month \nperiod, unless FDA\n\n[[Page S9154]]\n\nshowed that longer time is needed to track device after marketing.\n  Concerns of the FDA and patient group are further addressed in the \nsubstitute by striking the portions of the provision establishing new \nduration and scope limitations on postmarket surveillance--under the \nagreement the only change to the existing surveillance authority is to \nmake it discretionary, allowing FDA the flexibility to impose \nsurveillance requirements as appropriate without leaving itself or \ncompanies in technical violation of the law.\n  Another area of disagreement prior to markup was the manner in which \nS. 830 proposed to handle certain types of manufacturing changes for \nmedical devices. Senate bill 830 proposed to allow these changes to \nproceed on the basis of a notification rather than a full supplemental \napplication.\n  The substitute modifies the provision in the manufacturing changes \nsection so that FDA may in some cases still require the submission of a \nsupplement for a manufacturing change, and such supplement must be \napproved prior to implementation of the change. These manufacturing \nchange supplements shall be reviewed in 135 days. This compromise will \nstill allow many, if not most, manufacturing changes to proceed under a \nstreamlined process.\n  Senator Gregg, who worked very, very hard on this bill, has been \ncertainly one of those who deserves a great deal of credit for bringing \nit to the body in the form it is in, which I believe is most \nsatisfactory. He is to be also commended for his proposals to \nstreamline the FDA process for the consideration of health claims based \non Federal research and his amendments to establish uniformity for \nover-the-counter [OTC] drugs and cosmetics.\n  He has modified this provision to exempt California's proposition 65 \nand allow States to regulate cosmetic labeling and packaging issues \nwhere FDA has not acted. Senate bill 830 authorizes truthful, \nnonmisleading health claims for food products that are based on \npublished authoritative statements of scientific bodies of the U.S. \nGovernment such as the National Institutes of Health. FDA expressed \nconcern regarding the length of time the agency had to assess these \nproposed claims and the mechanism by which they might prevent a \nparticular claim from going forward. Agreement with FDA was reached on \nthe basis that FDA is given 30 additional days to review a health claim \nunder the provision, for a total of 120 days to review a health claim. \nFDA is able to prevent the claim from being used in the marketplace by \nissuing an interim final regulation. FDA may also block a claim from \ngoing forward, if the conditions established under the provision \ngoverning claims are not met. Again, I thank the Senator for his \nexcellent work in crafting this provision and reaching agreement with \nthe FDA.\n  The committee adopted an amendment by Senator Frist which conforms \nthe statute with FDA's current practice and today's science with regard \nto the quality of data required to show drug efficacy. I am especially \ngrateful to Dr. Frist, a cosponsor of the S. 830, whose medical \nexpertise has lent credibility to the decisions we have made in the \ncomplex area of medical technology regulation.\n  Senator DeWine, joined by Senator Dodd, offered an important \namendment to establish incentives for the conduct of research into \npediatric uses for existing and new drugs.\n  The bill was improved by Senator Hutchinson's amendment, to establish \na rational framework for pharmacy compounding, which respects the State \nregulation of pharmacy while allowing an appropriate role for FDA. I \nlook forward to participating in a colloquy with the Senator and the \nranking minority member on this topic.\n  The ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, has played a vital role \nin bringing this compromise to the floor. In markup, he offered two \nimportant amendments adopted by the committee. One amendment, developed \nin consultation with Senator Gregg, improved a provision from last \nyear's legislation governing the regulation of radiopharmaceuticals. \nThe second improved the bill's provision setting forth a streamlined \nprocess for the review of supplemental applications for new uses of \napproved drugs.\n  I commend the Senator for his hard work and willingness to compromise \non a number of issues which threatened to hold up proceeding on the \nbill. We reached agreement on the distribution of health care economic \ninformation. This data is the essential information ingredient in the \ndrug selection process in the growing managed care sector of the health \ninsurance marketplace. We agreed to require pharmaceutical companies to \nreport annually on their efforts to comply with postapproval studies. \nThis is essential information needed to provide the assurance that \nthese studies will in fact be completed. Again, I thank the Senator for \nhis willingness to work out these and other compromises.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on the involvement of patient and \nconsumer groups: They testified at one of our committee hearings. Also, \nour staff met a dozen times with representatives of these groups to \ndiscuss their proposals, share our ideas and drafts, and debate policy \nissues. Representatives of these groups were in key meetings with \nindustry, FDA, and bipartisan staff to discuss the resolution of issues \nthey identified as critical--pharmacoeconomics and the requirement of \ndrug companies to comply with postapproval, or phase four, study \nrequirements are examples of where we relied heavily on their advice \nand were pleased to have their information.\n  The bill reflects changes to address their concerns: Companies must \nreport on their compliance with phase four studies; FDA is given \nexpress authority to inspect compensation records of third-party \nreviewers; patients will have access to a registry of clinical trials \ninformation; and additional safeguards were built into the provision \nallowing expanded access to products under clinical investigation. It \nis clear that these groups have played an active and important role in \ndrafting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I stand before the body today with a sense of relief \nbecause, for the first time, I feel we are really, without any further \ndelays, coming toward completion. It is also still my purpose and my \ngoal to ensure that all Members will still have an opportunity to \nexpress themselves, and that when we come back next time, I hope that \nwe will have an agreement or unanimous consent that we can proceed \nwithout the necessity of invoking cloture, and have amendments \nestablished to be considered in reasonable lengths of time, so that \nthis bill can move forward. Certainly, I ask those who are desiring to \npropose amendments, when we come back here next week, to get in touch \nwith us today, tomorrow, and during the weekend and the first of the \nweek so we can try to accommodate all Members who desire to have \namendments that they desire to have expeditiously considered.\n  I urge all of the body to recognize that this is an important piece \nof legislation. It has to be acted upon yet by the House. They are \nanxiously awaiting us to move, so hopefully the bills can be as close \ntogether as possible, so that we can have the bill signed into law \nexpeditiously, within a month.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about S. \n830, the FDA Modernization Reform Act of 1997.\n  I guess there are a couple of things I would like to say about this \npiece of legislation.\n  First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues who have worked \nvery hard on this. Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Coats, \nSenator Gregg, Senator Harkin, and many others as well.\n  I also would like to thank Linda Degutis, who is going to be on the \nfloor with me who has been a fellow with our office. These fellow \nprograms are wonderful programs. I think many of us are always looking \nfor additional support and expertise. She has done a marvelous job.\n\n[[Page S9155]]\n\n  This bill has traveled an interesting journey. It was in committee \nmarkup about maybe a year ago, or thereabouts. I voted against it then. \nThat was a difficult vote for me because it never really came to the \nfloor. But I said then that there was much in this bill that I \napproved. I wanted to see some changes. But I thought the bill went too \nfar.\n  It was frustrating because on the medical device part of this bill \nour office had put much work into it. We spent about a year and a half, \nand I think other Senators know what this is like--writing a lot of the \nprovisions. But I thought the legislation went too far.\n  There were a number of things in it that are technical sounding. I \nwill not go into all of it. But it was an overreach. It went too far \ntrying to privatize FDA. The one thing you don't want to do is throw \nthe baby out with the bathwater. I really have to keep the consumer \nprotection part. It is quite one thing to say that you want more \npredictability and more timeliness and more focus in the regulatory \nprocess. I am all for that. It is one thing to say that we have to get \nthese products to the market in a timely fashion. I am all for that. \nBut they have to be safe and effective.\n  Then we came back to committee. The second time around it was close \nagain because there were some provisions in the bill that I did not \nagree with. I voted for it. I have tried to work real hard with lots of \ndifferent people here. I don't think I need to talk about myself \nbecause that is not important. I think this has been a pretty darned \nimportant collaborative effort.\n  We are almost there. I thank Senator Gregg for his cooperation. I \nthink the provisions dealing with cosmetics and preemption of State \nstandards, which would have affected my State in a very negative way, \nwas a mistake. I think that has been worked out. We still may have some \nwork to do yet with NEPA in terms of how this affects environmental \nimpact statements. I believe that will be worked out. There are a \ncouple of other problems that I think we are working on right now.\n  But, Mr. President, let me just say that it is my belief that we can \ndo better--that we can provide medical products to consumers in a more \ntimely manner through the provisions in this bill while retaining \nsignificant consumer protection. It is my belief as a Senator that this \nlegislation would improve the predictability and the timeliness and the \nfocus of the regulatory process for medical products.\n  Mr. President, next week when we bring this bill up, I am going to \ntalk about what all of this means in specifics because this has been \nabout 2\\1/2\\ years of work for me as a Senator from Minnesota. But as \nlong as we are just kind of setting the stage here, if you will, I \nthink the mood here in the Senate is very positive.\n  I say to Senator Jeffords again, Senator Jeffords has done a really \nfine job of bringing people together. I actually think that we brought \ntogether not only Democrats and Republicans but others, a lot of people \nwho have been involved with this. I will give full credit to a lot of \nthe consumer organizations who have not agreed with everything in the \nbill, and they have been fighting hard and they continue to fight hard. \nThey certainly have let me know when they have not agreed with \npositions I have taken, but they have done it with class, and they have \nbeen tough. They should be tough, and they should be critical. And they \nhave been.\n  By the same token, I want to make it clear that I think the business \ncommunity, the industry has been very responsible. At one point in time \nwhen the Congress first started talking about FDA reform, I think there \nwere some--this now goes back probably 2 years or so--who really looked \nat this as an opportunity to privatize FDA, roll back the really \nimportant consumer protection provisions.\n  I think that is over. It is over for a lot of different reasons. It \nis over because I think people now in the Congress hopefully understand \nthat people in the country are not interested in not having strong \nconsumer protection. They view FDA as extremely important to them and \nthe regulation that FDA does as being very important to their lives and \nto their children's lives.\n  I also think people have pulled back from that because the of \nindustry--and I want to give a lot of credit to the industry. There are \na lot of people in the industry--and I know more about the medical \ndevice industry--who have basically every step along the way made it \nclear that, no, this goes too far; we are willing to compete with the \ngold standard; we are just asking to get our products to the market in \na more timely fashion, but we don't want to give any ground. These \nproducts have to be safe and effective.\n  To say that there ought to be more predictability, to say that when \nyou have a protocol and you have waited for a year or you have waited \nmore than a year and then all of a sudden you are told the protocol is \nno good, you had a right to learn about that earlier, you would like to \nat least have conversation with the agency, is very reasonable.\n  Now, we had some provisions in the bill, including when I voted for \nit in the committee, that I thought still needed to be worked on, \nchanges needed to be made. Again, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, \nand a number of people worked very hard and I think we have really \nworked very diligently, and a lot of those problems I think we have \ndealt with.\n  So what we have here, Mr. President, I think is an important piece of \nlegislation. We will undoubtedly have that, when we bring this bill to \nthe floor--I say to my colleague, Tuesday, probably, is that correct?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There will be discussion. Some of us are still working \non improvements. But overall what this piece of legislation does, I \nwill summarize--and I will talk about it in specifics later. I will \ntalk about it in a fairly technical way next week. But if I had to \nsummarize, I do believe now after tough negotiation, after a lot of \npeople in the country being involved with this on all sides, after \nDemocrats and Republicans I think pulled together on this, with Senator \nJeffords--and I am not just saying this because he is in the Chamber--\nreally providing key leadership, Senator Kennedy being in there \nfighting, with Senator Coats as well, being willing to negotiate; I am \nproud of our office's roll and other people as well, what we have is a \npiece of legislation which says essentially, look, there will be more \npredictability, there will be more timeliness, more focus on FDA's \nregulatory action, we can get products to the market in a timely \nfashion, which is important to families and consumers, but we can do it \nin such a way that we do not sacrifice consumer protection.\n  We are almost there, and I think this is going to be a very important \nreform bill, and I am very proud to be a part of it.\n  I thank my colleague for his work.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will yield on my time. I thank the \nSenator for all the work he has put into this bill. I know he is \nprobably one of the strongest consumer advocates this Senate has ever \nseen. I would like to chat with the Senator just a bit because there is \nsome concern of consumer advocates in my State who say how come we are \ngetting all these editorials? And I would have to say in fairness to \nthis committee they are based upon information which may have been true \na month or 2 months or 3 months ago, but we have gone out of our way to \nput on the web pages--in fact, the most recent agreement which we have \nreached on cosmetics is now, or will be this afternoon, on the web \npages so that all they have to do is tune in and they can see the exact \nwording.\n  So I urge those who are still nervous about what is in the bill to \nfind out. It is available. In the modern age of being able to have \ninformation available, it is available instantly around the country. I \nhope that we would continue to work on the basis of what the bill is \ninstead of what it used to be.\n  I acknowledge the Senator's contribution to this effort entirely. The \nSenator has been instrumental in proposing innovative ideas and finding \nsolutions. He has done an outstanding job in helping myself and Senator \nKennedy bring this bill to where it is. The Senator is looked upon by \nmany as a person they can trust to protect the interests of the \nconsumer. So I thank the Senator for his very active participation in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I think he is \nright about the time lag on information that has gotten to people. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S9156]]\n\ncontinued to be in tough negotiations and a good number of these \nproblems have been resolved. I guess my style would be to say to the \nstrong consumer organizations, keep on pushing hard to the very end. I \nthink this is emerging as a real solid piece of work, and I am proud to \nbe a part of it.\n  I thank the Senator very much for the very gracious remarks. Linda \nDegutis, again, I thank very much for her help. She has been helpful in \nthis in a big way.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues \nfor their overwhelming support last week for cloture on the motion to \nproceed with this bill. Some 89 Senators very loudly and very clearly \ntold us last week that they were ready to move forward to reauthorize \nPDUFA and to begin debating the other critical reforms this bill \ncontains.\n  There is no Federal agency with a more direct and significant impact \non the lives of the American people than the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The foods we serve our family, the medicines we take \nwhen we're sick, even the drugs we give our pets, are all approved and \nmonitored by the FDA.\n  We must not lose the opportunity that we have before us now to enact \nlegislation that ensures the FDA has the authorities it needs to bring \nsafe and effective products to the American people quickly and \nefficiently.\n  I would like to again thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy \nfor their perseverance on this issue. Time after time they have been \nwilling to return to the bargaining table after many others would have \njust walked away. With open minds and in good faith, they've \nextensively negotiated this bill, line by line.\n  We have come to a point where issues on which Members were previously \ncompletely polarized--third party review of medical devices, off-label \ndissemination of information, health claims for food products, the \nnumber of clinical trials needed for drug approval, and just today \nnational uniformity of cosmetics--we've now reached agreement.\n  I don't know that any of us would have thought unanimity possible on \nthese provisions even 2 months ago--yet here we are with full agreement \non all but a handful of issues.\n  I know we have a better bill for all of the arduous negotiations that \nhave occurred.\n  Just as an example of how far we've come, let's talk about third \nparty review of medical devices. The bill would expand the pilot \nprogram currently administered by the FDA.\n  This is a program, I should note, that is supported by the FDA as a \nway to make more efficient use of its resources.\n  In last years debate, which many of you will remember as being much \nmore acrimonious, we were told this provision was a nonstarter, no room \nto compromise, subject closed.\n  This year, I am pleased to say, a spirit of bipartisanship and \ncompromise prevailed. Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and Senator \nCoats worked diligently to draft language that ensures that higher risk \ndevices aren't inappropriately included in this pilot program and that \nstrong conflict of interest protections are in place.\n  And just last night, again on an issue that appeared unresolvable--\nnational uniformity for cosmetics, we have reached agreement. Senator \nGregg has offered what I think is a very reasonable compromise. In the \narea of safety requirements, States can continue to regulate where the \nFDA has not acted.\n  Conflicting State requirements that could confuse consumers will be \nremoved. But where the FDA has not chosen to act, where it does not \nhave either the manpower or the authority to protect the public, States \ncan contain to play their historic role in regulating cosmetics.\n  This is the kind of effort made over and over again on this bill--\nsome 30 times just since markup 2 months ago we have made improvements \nto this bill. A great many of us take pride in the product that has \nbeen created--a bill that will speed lifesaving drugs and devices to \npatients and that clearly retains the FDA as the undisputed arbiter of \nthe safety effectiveness of these products.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about some of the \npositive reforms contained in this bill.\n  At the heart of this bill is the 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act--a piece of legislation remarkable for \nthe fact that there is unanimous agreement that it really works.\n  PDUFA has set up a system of user fees which drug companies pay to \nthe FDA. These fees have enabled the Agency to hire more staff. As a \nresult, drug approval times have been cut almost in half, getting new \nand life-saving therapies to patients more quickly.\n  In addition, by improving the certainty and clarity of the product \nreview process, S. 830 encourages U.S. companies to continue to develop \nand manufacture their products in the United States. The legislation \nemphasizes collaboration early on between the FDA and industry during \nthe product development and product approval phases. This will prevent \nmisunderstandings about Agency expectations and should result in even \nquicker development and approval times.\n  In addition, S. 830 establishes or expands upon several mechanisms to \nprovide patients and other consumers with greater access to information \nand to life-saving products.\n  For example, S. 830 will give individuals with life-threatening \nillness greater access to information about the location of on-going \nclinical trials of drugs.\n  Based on a bill originally championed by Senators Snowe and \nFeinstein. I offered an amendment in committee, which I was pleased to \nsee adopted, to expand an existing aids database to include trials for \nall serious or life-threatening diseases.\n  Experimental trials offer hope for patients who have not benefited \nfrom treatments currently on the market. Currently, patients' ability \nto access experimental treatments is dependent upon their spending \nlarge amounts of time and energy contacting individual drug \nmanufacturers just to discover the existence of trials.\n  This is not a burden that we should place on individuals already \nstruggling with chronic and debilitating diseases. This database will \nprovide ``one-stop-shopping'' for patients seeking information on the \nlocation of and eligibility criteria for studies of promising \ntreatments.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates \nthe Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, legislation originally \nintroduced by our former colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and \nnow cosponsored by myself and Senator DeWine, along with Senators \nKennedy, Mikulski, Hutchinson, Collins, and Cochran.\n  This provision addresses the problem of the lack of information about \nhow drugs work on children, a problem that just last month President \nClinton recognized publicly as a national crisis.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth of \nall drugs on the market have been tested for their safety and \neffectiveness in children. This legislation provides a fair and \nreasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort \nneeded to test their products for use by children. It gives the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to request \npediatric clinical trials for new drug applications and for drugs \ncurrently on the market. If the manufacturer successfully conducts the \nadditional research, 6 extra months of market exclusivity would be \ngiven.\n  I recognize that there are few matters still unresolved on this bill \ndespite the best efforts of all involved. And those we will need to \nsimply address though the traditional process of holding votes on the \nissues.\n  One issue, which I plan to discuss further when we debate the bill on \nTuesday involves section 404 of the bill, which relates to the FDA's \nreview of medical devices. This provision, the so-called labeling \nclaims provision clarifies current law by stating that when reviewing a \ndevice for approval, FDA should look at safety and efficacy issues \nraised by the use for which the product was developed and for which it \nwill be marketed.\n  Again, this is current law. Unfortunately, in a few instances, the \nFDA has inappropriately expanded the scope of its review by requiring \nmanufacturers to submit data on potential uses of product.\n  Some have raised concerns that under this provision a manufacturer\n\n[[Page S9157]]\n\ncould propose a very narrowly worded label for a device and that the \nFDA would be barred from asking for information on other obvious uses.\n  This is simply not the case. The FDA retains its current authority to \nnot approve a device if based on a fair evaluation of all material \nfacts, the labeling is false or misleading. Clearly, if a bad actor \ndevice manufacturer attempted to get a misleading label past the FDA, \nthe Agency would have full authority to disapprove the product.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Jeffords as the first Democratic \ncosponsor of this bill. I would thank him again for the hard work and \nlong hours that he and his staff, as well, as Senator kennedy, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Wellstone, Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, and others, \nhave contributed.\n  I look forward to further debate on and to joining my colleague next \nweek in enacting this legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present and ask unanimous consent that it be evenly divided between \nthe minority and majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The minority representative and myself are sitting \nhere. There is some time left. However, we also want to move the \ncalendar forward as best we can. I just want to alert all Members, \nminority and majority, if we do not receive a communication from a \nMember or staff within 10 minutes, it is our intention to yield back \nthe remainder of our time in order that we may move the process of the \nSenate forward. I just let everyone know that. We will be sitting here, \nawaiting the news.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, speaking on behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the cloture vote with respect to FDA occur at 10 \na.m. on Tuesday, September 16, the mandatory quorum call under rule \nXXII be waived, and the time between 9:30 and 10 a.m. be equally \ndivided for debate, prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Therefore, under rule XXII, all first-degree amendments \nmust be filed at the desk by 1 p.m. on Monday, September 15. I ask \nunanimous consent that all second-degree amendments may be filed up to \nthe time of the vote on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, at this time, and I have the permission \nof the minority, I will yield back the remainder of our time, both \nminority and majority time; and I so do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Mother Teresa, truly a saint, died last \nweek at age 87. I think we have all talked about her and the fact she \ndedicated her life to helping the poor and the sick, the dying around \nthe world, particularly in India. But I remember so well a morning on \nFebruary 3, 1994. It was a National Prayer Breakfast. We had invited \nMother Teresa to come and be our speaker. She did not reject. She just \nsaid, well, if the Lord is willing, I will be there. And we said, do \nyou think he will be willing? And she wasn't too sure.\n  Nonetheless, she did show up and we had an audience of 3,000 people \nin the hotel, including the President and his wife, and the Vice \nPresident and Mrs. Gore, and congressional leaders, people from all \nover the Hill and from all over America. Every State was represented, \nalmost every country was represented, and, of course, in addition to \nthat there was a television audience of millions.\n  Mother Teresa gave really an extraordinary speech. It was referred to \nby columnist Cal Thomas as ``the most startling and bold proclamation \nof truth to power I have heard in my more than 30 professional years in \nWashington.''\n  I think a lot of us know Peggy Noonan. She was the speech writer for \nRonald Reagan. She called it ``a breathtaking act of courage.''\n  In describing it she said Mother Teresa was introduced and spoke of \nGod and love and families. She said, ``We must love one another and \ncare for one another.'' And she described it that there were ``great \npurrs of agreement'' from the audience. And I remember that so well \nbecause I was one who was purring.\n  But the speech became more pointed at that moment.\n  Mother Teresa--and I am quoting now, Mr. President--said:\n\n       I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is \n     abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct \n     killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. \n     And if we accept that a mother can kill her own child, how \n     can we tell people not to kill one another?\n\n  She said:\n\n       By abortion, the mother does not learn to love but kills \n     even her own child to solve her problems. And, by abortion, \n     the father is told that he does not have to take any \n     responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the \n     world. That father is likely to put other women into the same \n     trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion.\n\n  Then she said:\n\n       Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its \n     people to love, but to use any violence to get what they \n     want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is \n     abortion.\n\n  Mrs. Noonan described the scene:\n\n       For about 1.3 seconds there was complete silence, then \n     applause built up and swept across the room. But not \n     everyone: the President and the First Lady, the Vice \n     President and Mrs. Gore looked like seated statues at Madame \n     Tussaud's, glistening in the lights and moving not a muscle.\n\n  I remember when Mother Teresa then looked over at President and Mrs. \nClinton and she said:\n\n       Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give \n     me the child. I am willing to accept any child who would be \n     aborted and to give that child a married couple who will love \n     the child and be loved by the child.\n       From here, a sign of care for the weakest of weak--the \n     unborn child--must go out to the world. If you become a \n     burning light of justice and peace in the world, then really \n     you will be truest to what the founders of this country stood \n     for.\n\n  Mr. President, we must revere Mother Teresa for what she was, the \nsaint that she was, and we must remember her. But I think most of all \nwe must listen to her. I repeat: ``Any country that accepts abortion is \nnot teaching its people to love but to use any violence to get what \nthey want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is \nabortion.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, the President has sent to the Congress a \ndetermination that he would like Congress to provide what is called \nfast-track trade authority with which he could negotiate additional and \nnew\n\n[[Page S9158]]\n\ntrade agreements with other countries. It is my hope that in the coming \nweeks, this request will result in a significant, new and interesting \ndebate about this country's trade policies.\n  I know as I begin this discussion that we will almost retreat \nimmediately into two camps. The one camp is ``We're for free trade, \nwe're for, therefore, what is called fast-track trade authority.'' The \nother side is somehow a bunch of know-nothing protectionists, a bunch \nof xenophobes who just don't understand the world, and all they want to \ndo is create walls around our country.\n  That is the thoughtless way that most trade debate has been conducted \nin this town and in Congress. I hope, however, that this time, when we \ndiscuss fast-track trade authority, we will have an opportunity to \nevaluate trade policy.\n  The issue for me is not fast track. That is a procedural issue. Yes; \nI will want to evaluate the underlying law from 1974 on fast track, and \nI am going to do that to see whether that fast-track approach might be \nchanged. However, I am much more interested in the question of what \nwill be the results? What kind of trade agreements and what kinds of \ntrade policies are they seeking under fast track?\n  We had fast track most recently for something called NAFTA, a set of \ntrade agreements with the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Just prior \nto fast track, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Now we \nhave a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Can anyone believe that \nshould be described as a success? I think not. Just prior to this trade \nagreement, we had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. Now we have \na $23 billion trade deficit with Canada. Can that be described as a \nsuccess? I think not.\n  Our trade problems go and on. There is China, Japan, and more. We \nwill have a trade deficit with China of well over $40 billion a year. \nOur trade deficit with Japan has hovered between $50 and $60 billion a \nyear as far as the eye can see.\n  No one wants to talk about the central question we ought to debate \nwith respect to trade, and that is, what about enforcing the trade \nagreements that already exist?\n  I want to give my colleagues an example of one of the things that \nbothers me so much about where we go in this trade discussion. Right at \nthis moment we have an ongoing discussion with Japan on the issue of \nthe United States aviation industry's access to the Japanese markets. \nIn trade with Japan, in the arena of airline passenger service, we have \na net surplus with Japan of a couple billion dollars. We have better \ncarriers in terms of being able to compete. They are better able to \ncompete with the Japanese, and we actually do quite well. We have a \nsurplus in that area.\n  If we had completely open skies and unlimited competition and \nunfettered competition with the Japanese with respect to airlines, we \nwould have an even larger surplus with Japan. But we have trade \nagreements with Japan that we made previously with respect to passenger \naviation and with respect to hauling freight on airlines, and so on.\n  What has happened is the Japanese have not abided by the previous \nagreements. We have had a freight agreement with them that they simply \nhave ignored, and have not abided by. Now we are back into negotiation \nwith the Japanese, and the Japanese have done a couple of things. For \none, they said, ``We don't like the fact that you have a surplus with \nus on hauling airline passengers.''\n  Think of the arrogance of that. Here is a country that has a $50 \nbillion trade surplus with us--and has had such a surplus every year, \nyear after year after year--complaining about one little sector where \nwe have a surplus with them, and then they want to get us into a \nnegotiation. Instead of going to open skies where you have free and \nopen competition, they want to get this administration--and I think \nthis administration is headed in that direction--to reach an agreement \nthat is not in our interest.\n\n  That is an example of what is wrong with trade policy. We ought to \nsay to the Japanese that on aviation and other issues that we believe \nthat our trade policy ought to result for this country, for the United \nStates, increased economic opportunity and increased trade and, yes, \nbalanced trade. This country cannot and should not countenance long-\nterm trade deficits with countries like Japan of $50 and $60 billion a \nyear.\n  We ought to say to China, for example, that you have a $40 billion \ntrade surplus with us. We have become a cash cow for your hard currency \nneeds in China, and we will no longer stand for it. If you want to send \nus all the goods from China into the United States, then we say to you, \nyou have a responsibility and an obligation to buy more from us.\n  Why is all this important? Because it represents economic vitality \nand jobs. It is interesting. I hear people talk about trade and they \nsay, ``Gee, we've done so well in trade. We've doubled our exports to \nthis country or that country.'' That is the first thing they will point \nout in a press release.\n  So the headline is ``U.S. Doubles Export of Goods to Country X.'' \nWhat they didn't say was that imports from that country increased 10 \ntimes during the same time period, which means that our trade deficit \nwith that country skyrocketed.\n  So the whole story, the rest of the story, would describe failure, \nbut the press release describes success--``We've doubled our exports.''\n  In sectors where you have tradable goods, we actually have had a net \njob loss in this country as a result of all the trade agreements. The \njob gains which are often trumpeted as being the result of exports \nactually come from areas in the nontradable sectors of our economy, \nparticularly in services.\n  The point I am making about all of this is we are going to have a \ndebate about fast-track trade authority. I want the debate to be about \ntrade policy. Is our trade policy working for this country or isn't it?\n  I happen to believe in expanded trade. I believe in free trade to the \nextent that it is fair. I also believe in trade agreements to the \nextent that we negotiate trade agreements that are in this country's \ninterest. But, for a change, I would like the negotiators who negotiate \ntrade agreements to start wearing the jersey of our side. It is our \nteam that we are worried about.\n  Is that economic nationalism? Well, I don't know about all those \nterms they throw about. Do I care about the long-term economic \nopportunities in this country? Yes. Do I want economic growth here? \nYes. Do I want jobs in this country? Yes.\n  So when a country like China says to the United States, ``We want to \nship you all of these goods and run a very large surplus with you or \nhave you run a large deficit with us,'' and then China says, ``By the \nway, we want to buy some airplanes,'' and they say, ``We don't want to \nbuy airplanes made in America, we want you to have your American \ncompany produce these airplanes in China,'' we ought to say that's not \nthe way a trade relationship works.\n  A bilateral trade relationship works in a way that says, ``When you \nhave goods our consumers need, we will buy them from you and you have \naccess to our marketplace, but when you need what we produce, when you \nneed what our workers and our companies produce, we expect you to buy \nthem from us.'' That is the way a trade relationship works in a manner \nthat is mutually beneficial to both parties.\n  Our country has been satisfied to have a trade policy that has \nproduced trade deficits, net trade deficits for 36 out of the last 38 \nyears. You show me one CEO of one American company who has had 167 \nsuccessive quarters of losses, quarter after quarter after quarter \nforever, who isn't going to stop and say, ``Gee, I think there's \nsomething wrong here. Something is out of whack.'' That is exactly what \nis wrong with our trade policy. Yet, Republicans and Democrats will \ntell us on the floor of this Senate that our trade policy is working \nvery well. What a terrific policy, they tell us.\n\n  I want for us to have greater access to foreign markets. For example: \nIf China wants to send us goods that exceed the amount of goods they \nwill accept from us by $40 billion a year, I want us to say to China, \n``You have an obligation to buy much, much, much more from the United \nStates of America to have a balanced trade relationship.'' I want us to \nsay the same thing to Japan, the same thing to Mexico, the same thing \nto Canada and others\n\n[[Page S9159]]\n\nwith whom we have large, abiding trade deficits. We need to say that \nbecause those deficits weaken this country. Those deficits detract from \nour economic growth and fundamentally weaken the American economy.\n  There are those who, I guess, believe that whatever the interests of \nthe largest corporations in the world are, that they are also in the \ncommon interests of the United States. Things have changed. We do, \nindeed, have a global economy, but the largest corporations in the \nworld now are not national citizens. They don't get up in the morning \nand say, ``Well, you know, I'm an artificial person, I'm a corporation, \nwhat in law is described as an artificial person; I can sue and be \nsued, contract and be contracted with; I'm an artificial person and, \ntherefore, I have allegiance to this country.'' That's not what they \ndo.\n  We are not talking about American corporations anymore. We are \ntalking about international corporations that do global business that \nare interested in profits for their shareholders.\n  How do you maximize profits for your shareholders? You access the \ncheapest kind of production that you can access in the world, produce \nthere at a dime-an-hour, a-quarter-an-hour, or a half-a-dollar-an-hour \nwages and then ship the products to Pittsburgh, Toledo, Los Angeles, or \nFargo and sell it on a shelf in a store in one of those cities. Produce \nwhere it is cheap and then access the American marketplace.\n  The problem with that strategy is that while it presents increased \nprofits for international corporations it tends to undermine the \nAmerican economy. I am not saying the global economy and the growth of \nthe global economy is wholly bad; it is not. It provides new \nopportunities and new choices for the consumers, and in some cases \nlower-priced goods for the consumers. The question we have to ask \nourselves is: what is fair trade and what advances this country's \neconomic interests?\n  If deciding that you can produce something that you used to produce \nin Akron, OH, in a factory in Sri Lanka or Indonesia or Bangladesh and \nyou can get 14-year-olds, pay them 24 cents an hour, working 13 hours a \nday--if you decide that is in your company's interest--is that in this \ncountry's interest? I don't think so.\n  Is it in this country's interest to see that kind of manufacturing \njob flight from this country to a low-wage country so that the same \nproduct can be produced to be shipped back into this country, and the \nonly thing that's changed is the corporation has more profit and the \nUnited States has fewer jobs? Is that in this country's interest? I \ndon't think so.\n  I was on a television program 2 days ago. When I asked this question \nthe moderator said the conditions under which goods are produced in \nother countries is none of our business. If another country wants to \nhire kids and pay them dimes an hour, if another country wants to \nproduce by dumping chemicals into the water and pollution into the air, \nif another country wants to produce having no restrictions on those \ncompanies and allows them to pollute the air and water, hire kids, pay \na dime an hour, if that's what they want to do, is that none of our \nbusiness? And if the production from that factory--hiring kids and \npolluting the air and polluting the water--if that production comes \ninto this country and goes on the grocery store shelves, is that all \nthe better for the American consumer because it is going to be cheaper?\n  I think that is a catastrophe to have that kind of attitude. This \ncountry spent 60 years debating the question of what is a fair wage? \nThis country spent decades debating whether we ask polluters to stop \npolluting, and whether we demand that polluters stop polluting in order \nto clean our air and water. This country spent a long while debating \nthe question of child labor and whether we should allow factories to \nemploy 10-year-olds and 12-year-olds.\n  This country has debated all those issues. Yet, in the so-called \nglobal economy, fashioned in the interest of those who want to \naccelerate profits from it, there are those who would tell us that they \ncan just pole vault over all of those issues. They don't have to worry \nabout minimum wages. They do not have to worry about pollution control. \nThey do not have to worry about any of that because they can move their \nfactories elsewhere and ship their products back into the United \nStates. That is not fair trade. That is not something that advances the \neconomic interests of our country and ought not be allowed.\n\n  What we do is we pass trade agreement after trade agreement, and we \ndon't enforce any of them. When someone hears me speak they say, ``Gee, \nthis is just another protectionist that wants to put walls around this \ncountry.'' I do not; not at all. I am very interested in saying to \nother countries, first of all, you have an obligation. There is an \nadmission price to the American marketplace. The admission price is \nthat you must abide by certain standards with respect to clean air and \nclean water, and you can't hire kids, and you can't pay a nickel an \nhour. Yes, that is the admission price to compete in our domestic \nmarket.\n  And, yes, there is a requirement with other countries with whom we \nhave a trade relationship. That requirement is if they want to access \nthe American marketplace and dump tens of millions of dollars of \nproducts into that marketplace, then they have a responsibility to \nAmerica. That responsibility is that their marketplace must be open to \nus. If our workers and our producers want to go to Japan and go to \nChina to sell our goods in their marketplace, they must have their \nmarketplace open for that. And to the extent you don't, it is unfair \ntrade.\n  To the extent any country is involved in unfair trade, this country \nought to have the will and the nerve to say that we're not going to put \nup with it.\n  Mr. President, one final point. This advent of a global economy post-\nSecond World War has been an interesting kind of development. The first \n25 years after the Second World War we could compete with anybody in \nthe world with one hand tied behind our back. It did not matter much. \nOur trade policy was almost all foreign policy. Whatever we did or had \nwith another country had to do with foreign policy. For the first 25 \nyears we could do that easily. We did that and our incomes kept rising \nin this country.\n  The second 25 years we have had to deal with competitors who are \nshrewd, tough economic competitors. We now must insist on trade \nrelationships and trade agreements that are fair to this country's \ninterests. The conditions of trade must be conditions with rules that \nare fair to our workers and producers. The absence of that means that \nthis country is the economic loser. This ought not be what we aspire to \nachieve in trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, I have more to say, regrettably, for my colleagues who \ndo not like this message. I will say it often in the coming weeks as we \ndiscuss the trade issue. For now I will yield the floor. I see the \nminority leader has come to the floor. I know he is going to talk about \nanother topic of great interest. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I give extraordinary credit to our two \nleaders on this issue, Senators McCain and Feingold, for their \npersistence and diligence in the manner in which they have conducted \nthemselves as they have sought resolution of this issue.\n  I have indicated on occasions, both publicly and privately, that I \nthink Senator McCain deserves great credit for having taken the \ninitiative this year and worked as diligently as he has to bring us to \nwhere we are. Certainly the same could be said for our colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold.\n  The two of them have spent countless hours and an extraordinary \neffort to bring us to a point where for the first time in recent modern \nhistory, Democrats and Republicans can join together in the passage of \ntruly meaningful comprehensive reform.\n  What I think this letter does is to reaffirm the new math on this \nissue, to reaffirm how close we really are to passage of a \ncomprehensive bill. I'm not suggesting that all 48 Senators who have \nsigned the letter have agreed to every provision in the legislation. \nRather, I firmly believe this letter demonstrates that we are committed \nto enacting real campaign finance reform this Congress.\n  There have been suggestions that all we really have to do is to strip \naway all but a soft money ban, and perhaps we can pass something this \nyear if it is only that. But what this letter indicates is that we have \n48 Senators, 2 shy of a majority, who are willing to do a lot more than \nthat, who are willing to take a comprehensive approach to meaningful \ncampaign finance reform, not next year, the year after, but this year, \nthis fall.\n  So I just hope that everybody understands the ramifications of a \nletter like this. This is unprecedented. I have looked back and our \nstaffs have investigated the matter. We have never had an occasion \nwhere every single member of the Democratic caucus has signed on to one \npiece of legislation that is bipartisan, that is a direct intention or \nrepresents a direct intention to pass comprehensive campaign finance \nreform. It has never happened before.\n  So this is an unprecedented and an extraordinarily strong statement \non behalf of a lot of Senators who want to see something happen this \nyear, who believe it can happen this year, who want to deal with \nspending limits, who want to deal with soft money, who want to ensure \nthat somehow we are able to deal effectively with independent \nexpenditures and these growing problems with ``issue'' ads, who want to \nsee stronger enforcement of disclosure rules, who want to ban foreign \ncontributions, who want to further limit the effort to put some end to \nthe madness in campaigns today when it comes to financing.\n  How tragic, how ironic it would be if, after all that we have read \nand all the print and all the time on television about investigations \nand speeches and intentions for change, and all the things that are \ngoing on currently in the Governmental Affairs Committee, after all \nthat we said, our response is to do nothing at all, our response is to \nignore the overwhelming evidence that something has to be done.\n  One does not have to go through campaign cycle after campaign cycle \nto come to the conclusion that something is wrong in the system and \nsomething needs to be done in a comprehensive way to address the \nsystem, all of the difficulties we have, in a much more constructive \nand effective way than we have on the books today.\n  That is why what Senators McCain and Feingold are doing is so \nlaudatory. That is why what they are doing deserves not only Democratic \nbut strong Republican support. That is why we cannot lose the momentum \nand let this opportunity pass us by. That is why we wrote the letter \nand why it is important now that we commit to an opportunity to resolve \nthese issues this year, before we leave.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very hopeful that this will add renewed \nmomentum to the effort that I know is already underway in a very \ndiligent manner by our colleagues and by others who have worked on this \nissue for as long as they have.\n\n  Our history on campaign finance reform is not a good one. There have \nbeen too many lost efforts. There have been too many lost \nopportunities. There have been too many partisan divisions and \nextraordinarily confrontational fights on the floor in an effort to \nmove something in the past.\n  At various times we actually did move a bill through the Senate, at \none point all the way to the President's desk, only to have it vetoed. \nLet us not have that happen again. President Clinton has said he will \nsign the McCain-Feingold bill if it gets to his desk.\n  I have no doubt in my mind, if we ever got to a debate on the Senate \nfloor, an overwhelming number of Senators, Republican and Democrat, \nwould support something like this. Let us work our will. Let us come up \nwith amendments. Let us try to find ways in which to come together \nrather than to be split apart on this issue in the future.\n  Will we have unanimity? No. But can we achieve a meaningful, \noverwhelming consensus on this issue? My guess is, absolutely, yes, we \ncan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is quite a remarkable day. I am \nenormously gratified by the announcement. We have 45 members of our \ncaucus, every single member of our caucus, who signed a letter saying \nwe support the comprehensive campaign finance reform bill called \nMcCain-Feingold. There are three cosponsors, I think, on the other \nside. That brings to 48 the\n\n[[Page S9161]]\n\nnumber of people who have signed up to say, ``We will vote for \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform.''\n  There are some around this town who I think are quitters on this \nissue. This is not a time to quit. They say, ``Well, it's clear you \ncan't get much done. Just do a little piece over here.'' This is the \nwrong time to quit. We have 45 people in our caucus who have said they \nwill vote for comprehensive campaign finance reform of our campaign \nfinance system and at least three other cosponsors. We are at 48 votes \njust with that. And the question is, are there two other votes out \nthere? Are there two other votes? I think there are.\n  So, those who say this cannot be done, I think what we are \ndemonstrating here with this letter is a substantial reservoir of \nsupport to say this system is broken, this system needs fixing, and it \nought not be done with a niche over here. Let us do it with \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform that is embodied in the McCain-\nFeingold proposal.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota--I noticed we have had 3,361 \nfloor speeches on campaign finance reform. So that is 3,362, and mine \nis 3,363, and we will have a couple more, I reckon. We have had 446 \nlegislative proposals on campaign finance reform. If ever there was a \ndemonstration of this statement that when all is said and done, more is \nsaid than done, it must certainly be on campaign finance reform.\n  Isn't it the case that with this news that we have one caucus with 45 \npeople who have signed up and with several others already cosponsoring, \nthat we are within striking distance of having the opportunity to pass \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. You do not have to be a \nmath whiz to count the numbers, to figure out what it takes to get us \nto 50. Because if we had 50, of course, the Vice President would be \nthere to break a tie. God forbid we would have to call upon him to do \nso. My guess is, as I said a moment ago, there would be an overwhelming \nvote.\n  But to get us to 50, we just need 2 more votes, two more people. If 2 \nRepublican Senators would come forth and indicate their support \npublicly, that would be 50 votes. That would be, with the Vice \nPresident should he be needed, the majority necessary to pass it this \nyear. In fact, this afternoon.\n\n  So, there is absolutely no question that we are now within striking \nrange, within reach, of an opportunity to pass it in the not too \ndistant future. It really is an extraordinary opportunity, one that I \nwould not have guessed we could have reached at this point, but we \nhave, in large measure because of the unanimity of our caucus and \nbecause of the courage and leadership of some of our Republican \ncolleagues to date.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for taking the floor on this issue. \nIt is a very timely issue.\n  I am a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and we have been \nengaged in months of preparation and weeks of deliberation on the \nquestion of campaign finance. Over $4 million will be spent on this \ninvestigation. Seventy lawyers have been hired. We have issued hundreds \nof subpoenas for documents, and we have brought before our committee \ndozens of witnesses, most under oath, and some with grants of immunity, \nand yet it does not seem what we are doing has resonated.\n  I think what it suggests is that, if this committee had started off \nwith the premise that when their deliberations had been completed we \nwould come forward with campaign finance reform, the 1998 election \nwould look different to the American voters and I think the public \ninterest would have been heightened in our effort.\n  Unfortunately, if we just find ourselves recapitulating the sins of \nthe past instead of talking about real reform, it does not strike a \nresonant cord. The recent vote in the primary in New York City, which \nwas very low, and the vote last November, the lowest percentage turnout \nfor a Presidential election in 72 years, should be a signal to us and \nto every politician: The more money we spend on campaigns, the fewer \nvoters turn out to vote.\n  Now, that is a message, unfortunately, of a growing cynicism about \nthis system. Those of us who believe in this democracy and believe in \nthis Government and believe that we as a democracy have the capacity to \nchange in the right direction, have to move forward in a positive way.\n  I want to congratulate the minority leader, Senator Daschle. Forty-\nfive Democrats coming together behind us, with three Republican \nsponsors, puts us within striking distance. Within hours--within \nhours--we could have two Republican Senators this afternoon say, \n``That's it, we have decided we will join.''\n  It is time for campaign finance reform. We could achieve it before we \nleave at the end of this year. If we do not, I suggest that it is only \ngoing to add to the public's cynicism. I certainly hope that is not the \ncase.\n  I salute the Senator for his leadership and thank him for bringing \nthis matter to the forefront.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his eloquence and \nhis comments. He is absolutely right. I think this failure, should we \nexperience it again, would add to the cynicism. On the other hand, if \nwe could pass it, it would do so much to instill new confidence and new \nadmiration for the legislative process, and I think restore hope in \ndemocracy itself.\n  This is a rare opportunity. We have the momentum. We have \ndemonstrated the votes now are there. I think it is simply a matter of \ncontinuing to ensure that we strike an agreement with regard to \nscheduling this legislation in the not too distant future. We can do it \nthis week. We can do it within a very short period of time. We do not \nneed a lot of time for debate. We can make this happen. We just need a \ncommitment that we will make it happen. I do not know that the country \ncould be any more pleased with the results of what I would consider to \nbe one of the most consequential accomplishments of this session of \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from South Dakota, \nour Democratic leader, for this initiative.\n  I think you have to understand that the momentum is there because \npeople are concerned, Senators are concerned, politicians are concerned \nwith the turnout, with the cynicism, with all the problems we are \nfacing in this political arena.\n  In 1974, when I ran for the U.S. Senate the first time, the average \ncost of a Senate race in this country was $425,000. In 1996, it was \n$4.4 million. The race in Kentucky would probably be a $5 million race \non each side--$10 million or more, to run for the U.S. Senate from a \nsmall State like Kentucky.\n  There is not a Senator that I know of, not a Senator, that enjoys \nraising money--enjoys raising money--making calls, calling people they \nhave never heard of before. Some group organized to help with a \nfundraiser gives you a list to call. These are what we referred to as \n``cold calls'' when I was growing up. A cold call is calling somebody \nyou never heard of and asking for money so that you can run your race.\n  I think we ought to take the M and M's out of politics--money and \nmeanness, money and meanness. The more money you have, the meaner you \ncan become. I listened to a Senator who was defeated who had a lot of \nmean ads run against him. He said by the end of the campaign he did not \nlike himself. It gets pretty rough, so we need to take the money out.\n  We hear a lot about free speech. I understand it. I can go outside \nand start talking. That is free speech. I can go over to Courthouse \nSquare in my hometown and make a speech to nobody. That is free speech. \nI can do all of those things. But what we are talking about here is \npaid speech, paid speech. The more money you have, the more speech you \nhave, but it is paid speech. It is television, it is radio, it is \nnewspapers. Why, some places they make more money off of a political \ncampaign--they want one every year, every 6 months, because we will \nraise the money to be competitive. Let's be competitive as individuals. \nLet's be competitive on the issues. Let's be competitive by seeing \npeople and convincing them that your position and what you want to do \nis right, that you represent a party of principles--families first. Get \nout there and talk to people.\n\n[[Page S9162]]\n\n  In Kentucky, we had our first election last year in the Governor's \nrace where you had a limited amount of money you could spend. With all \nof its warts, the two candidates stayed on the road. They did not fly \nin airplanes because it cost too much. They were looking for every \nKiwanis Club, every Rotary Club, every Jaycees, every Lion's Club they \ncould get to. There were an unprecedented 41 joint appearances. We used \nto have a joint appearance on television. It was on Kentucky \neducational television. It was a night Kentucky played for the \nchampionship of the NCAA basketball. They even sent the cubs out there \nto cover it, so no one really watched it. But when we limited the \namount of money and limited what they could do, they had to see people, \nthey had to talk about issues, they had to believe in what they were \nsaying.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to say to this country, ``Let us get \nback to the people. Let us get back to issues. Let us get back to \nshaking hands and saying, `I want your vote.''' Look them in the eye \nand they can ask you questions. That is the way we ought to run \npolitical campaigns. That is the kind of political campaign I like to \nrun.\n  Now we have that opportunity. We can touch it with our fingernails. \nWe can touch it with our fingernails. If only two more Republicans will \njoin, we will have the 50 votes necessary to say we have a \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform bill that will be so important \nnot only to the American people but to us as representatives of the \nAmerican people. We will not be beholden to people we have never known.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will join together now and give the American \npeople what I believe they want--less money in politics, more personal \ncontact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me briefly commend our leader, the Democratic leader, \nfor soliciting the support of the 44 others of us who make up this \ncaucus, the Democratic caucus. There are 45 members of this caucus, and \nall 45 members have signed this letter urging the adoption of the \nlegislation introduced by our colleague, John McCain, from the \nRepublican side and Russ Feingold from our side.\n  I think, as the leader has said, this is not a perfect bill. I have \ndisagreements with it. I do not applaud every single dotted ``i'' and \ncrossed ``t,'' nor do I assume anyone else does, but it is a common \nvehicle to embrace most of the positions we would like to see adopted \nas campaign finance reform. The fact that 100 percent of those of us on \nthis side have joined in this letter, I think, is a strong indication \nof our commitment to this issue.\n  It would not have happened had it not been for our leader on this \nside. I want to commend him publicly for his leadership on this issue \nas he has demonstrated in so many other areas and urge that his words \nbe heeded and we try to get some additional sponsors here and see if we \ncannot bring this up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9159-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NOMINATIONS OF JANET HALL AND CHRISTOPHER F. DRONEY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to briefly say to my colleagues, we \nwill vote in a few minutes on two nominees for the Federal district \ncourt bench, Janet Hall and Christopher Droney.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have appeared before the Judiciary Committee \non their behalf. I see our colleague from Alabama here on the floor, \nwho is a member of that committee and who very graciously heard the two \nnominees.\n  They are two very highly confident, very qualified nominees. Janet \nHall has superlative work experience, both in government service and in \nprivate practice. She has worked in the Antitrust Division of the \nJustice Department from 1975 to 1979. She later joined one of the \nfinest law firms in the State of Connecticut, Robinson and Cole, where \nshe has been a partner since 1982. She has appeared before Federal, \nState, and appellate courts, and even the U.S. Supreme Court, and her \nwork has focused primarily on complex commercial litigation. In short, \nshe is a very, very fine nominee.\n  She is a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and the New York \nUniversity School of Law. She has received numerous awards and \nrecognitions including Mount Holyoke's Alumnae Medal of Honor, and she \nhas served on the Board of the Connecticut Bar Foundation since 1993. \nShe also serves on the Parents' Advisory Committee of her hometown high \nschool and has volunteered in numerous other activities in her \ncommunity.\n  She is a very fine lawyer, a very fine person, very community \noriented, and she brings wonderful legal knowledge and expertise to \nthis nomination. I am confident that my colleagues across political \nlines here will be very proud of their vote in casting it this \nafternoon for Janet Hall to be a district court judge in Connecticut.\n  The other nominee is Christopher F. Droney. Some of our colleagues \nknow Christopher Droney. He has been our U.S. attorney in Connecticut \nfor the last 4 or 5 years and a very successful one. He is known as one \nof the leading U.S. attorneys in the country for his anticrime efforts, \nand in particular for fighting juvenile crime.\n  I might point out that he also knows something about what it is like \nto be in elective office. He served as the mayor of West Hartford, CT, \nand did a wonderful job there. He is a graduate of the University of \nConnecticut Law School, where he was on the Law Review. He was named \nCitizen of the Year by the Connecticut District of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, and he received the Distinguished Law Enforcement Award from \nthe Hartford Police Union. He also received special recognition award \nfrom the Spanish-American Merchants Association. He is very community-\noriented and very successful in his community activities. He is a \nmember of the Federal Bar Council, a member of the St. Timothy Roman \nCatholic Church in his community, and very involved in the YMCA and \nYWCA in our State, as well.\n  Again, given his background experience as a U.S. attorney, I think my \ncolleagues can feel very, very proud, Mr. President, in casting a vote \nthis afternoon to confirm the nomination of Christopher Droney, as \nwell, to be a district court judge in Connecticut. I urge support for \nthese nominees. I think they will do us all proud. The Senate can be \nproud of the work they will perform on behalf of all of us. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9162-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just rise to offer my strong support for \nJoe Bataillon, a man who I have known for a number of years, and the \nChair does as well. He served in the Judge Advocate Corps. He has been \na lawyer in Omaha. He has gotten high marks from anybody who has \ninterviewed him, on both sides of the aisle. The judges like him. He is \na crucial appointment. I appreciate very much the majority leader \nscheduling this vote. I encourage my colleagues to vote for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DRONEY, OF CONNECTICUT, TO BE UNITED \n         STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Christopher F. Droney, \nof Connecticut, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. President, I understand that we have a minute on each side.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Chair to call the Senate to order before my time \nbegins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not intend to start until the Senate \nis in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we will confirm three judges this \nafternoon.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the chart, which indicates the \nshameful lack of progress of this Senate in considering judicial \nnominations. We still have approximately 100 judicial vacancies. When \nwe adjourned last year there were 64 vacancies and when we began this \nCongress there were about 74 vacancies. We are confirming judges far \nslower than the vacancies are occurring through death, attrition, \nretirements, and so forth. Even with the three judges we are confirming \ntoday, there has been a net increase in vacancies of over 30 in the \nlast year. In fact, vacancies on the federal courts around the country \nhave increased by more than 50 percent over the last year.\n  I ask, as I have many, many times, that the majority leader, whose \ncaucus has held back these judges, allow them to go forward. We see \nwhat happens when we have a vote on them. It is unanimous. You keep \nhearing that there are concerns about these judges, and then no Senator \nvotes against them.\n  Let us bring them forward. I ask that one of the first we proceed to \nconsider be Margaret Morrow, who seems to be held up only because she \nis a woman--only because she is a woman. There is no reason to hold up \nthat judicial nomination. Let it be voted. If people do not want her, \nvote against her. If they want her, vote for her. But let's have a vote \non this.\n  We are not helping the independence--in fact, we are diminishing the \nindependence--of the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate is taking up three of \nthe six judicial nominations from the Executive Calendar.\n  I am delighted to see the Senate confirm Joseph F. Bataillon to be a \nU.S. District Judge for the District of Nebraska. He served as deputy \npublic defender for Douglas County, NE before entering private practice \nas a trial attorney in Omaha. He is supported by Senator Kerrey and \nSenator Hagel. The ABA found him to be qualified for this judicial \nappointment. Mr. Bataillon's nomination was first received by the \nSenate in March 1996 over 17 months ago. Unfortunately, this was one of \nthe nominations caught up in the election year slowdown last year. I \ncongratulate Mr. Bataillon and his family and look forward to his \nservice on the district court.\n  I am also delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to \ntake up the nomination of Christopher F. Droney to be a U.S. District \nJudge for the District of Connecticut. The nominee has served as U.S. \nAttorney in Connecticut since 1993. The ABA has unanimously found him \nto be qualified for this judicial appointment. With the strong support \nof Senator Dodd and Senator Lieberman, this nomination has moved \nthrough the Committee and now to confirmation. I congratulate Mr. \nDroney and his family and look forward to his service on the district \ncourt.\n  Likewise, I am delighted to see the Senate moving forward to consider \nJanet C. Hall to be a U.S. District Judge for the same district. Since \n1980, this nominee has practiced law in Hartford and prior to that she \nhad served as a special assistant U.S. attorney and trial attorney for \nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. The ABA \nunanimously found her to be well qualified, its highest rating. This \nnomination also has the strong support of Senator Dodd and Senator \nLieberman. I congratulate Ms. Hall and her family and look forward to \nher service on the district court.\n  In spite of the progress we have made over the last week in \nconfirming six judicial nominations, we still have some 40 nominees \namong the 65 nominations sent to the Senate by the President who are \npending before the Judiciary Committee and have yet to be accorded even \na hearing during this Congress.\n  Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day \nof this session, having been renominated by the President. Several of \nthose pending before the Committee had hearings or were reported \nfavorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, \nwhile the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago \npersist. The committee has 12 nominees who have been pending for more \nthan a year, including seven who have been pending since 1995.\n  So, while I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with \nthe longstanding nomination of Joseph Bataillon and those of Chris \nDroney and Janet Hall, there is no excuse for the committee's delay in \nconsidering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as \nProfessor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard \nA. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki \nMollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all \nbeen pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher \nand Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported last year. Judge Paez \nand Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far \nthis year.\n\n[[Page S9164]]\n\n  Thus, even with the increased activity of the last week in which the \nSenate has confirmed six nominees and raised by 67 percent the number \nof judges confirmed all year, we continue to lag well behind the pace \nestablished by the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, the Senate \nhad confirmed 36 Federal judges. With today's actions, the Senate will \nhave confirmed only 15 judges. We still face almost 100 vacancies and \nhave 50 nominees yet to consider.\n  For purposes of perspective, let us also recall that by August 1992, \nduring the last year of the President Bush's term, a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate had confirmed 53 of the 65 nominees sent to us \nby a Republican President. That, too, is a far cry from this year's 15 \nout of 65.\n\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock \nup criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil \nand criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, \nare growing taller by the day.\n  I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the vacancies \nthat are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At \nthe rate that we are going, we are not keeping up with attrition. When \nwe adjourned last Congress there were 64 vacancies on the Federal \nbench. After the confirmation of 15 judges in 9 months, there has been \na net increase of 33 vacancies. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \nhas called the rising number of vacancies ``the most immediate problem \nwe face in the federal judiciary.''\n  The Courts Subcommittee heard on Thursday afternoon from second and \neighth circuit judges about the adverse impact of vacancies on the \nability of the Federal courts to do justice. The effect is seen in \nextended delay in the hearing and determination of cases and the \nfrustration that litigants are forced to endure. The crushing caseload \nwill force Federal courts to rely more and more on senior judges, \nvisiting judges and court staff.\n  Judges from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals testified, for \nexample, that over 80 percent of its appellate court panels over the \nnext 12 months cannot be filled by members of that Court but will have \nto be filled by visiting judges. This is wrong.\n  We ought to proceed without delay to consider the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to the second circuit and move promptly to fill \nvacancies that are plaguing the second and ninth's circuits. We need to \nfill the 5-year-old vacancy in the Northern District of New York and \nmove on nominations for judicial emergency districts.\n  In choosing to proceed on these three nominees, the Republican \nleadership has chosen for the third time in a week to skip over the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. I, again, urge the Senate to consider \nthe long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district court \njudge for the Central District of California.\n  Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year but May \nof 1996. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, \nthus, first pending before the Senate more than a year ago. This was \none of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown.\n  She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her \nsecond confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the \njudiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When \nshe was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported \nwith the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar for more 3 months and has been passed over, \ntime and again without explanation or justification.\n  This is an outstanding nominee to the district court. She is \nexceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one \ncontend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial \nwringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she \nvoted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years.\n  The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert \nBork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that \nwhat is required to be confirmed to the district court in this \nCongress?\n  With respect to the issue of judicial activism, we have the nominee's \nviews. She told the committee: ``The specific role of a trial judge is \nto apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.' '' \nShe also noted: ``Given the restrictions of the case and controversy \nrequirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the \ncourts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our \nsociety, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the \nlegislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure.''\n  Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar \nAssociation and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is \ncurrently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. \nShe is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and \nby Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nadministration. Representative James Rogan attended her second \nconfirmation hearing to endorse her.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive \nand responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. \nHer public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve \nthis treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away. The \npresident of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the \nPresident of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association, the President of the National \nConference of Women's Bar Association, and other distinguished \nattorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in \nsupport of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: \n``Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and \ncommunity leaders of both parties'' and she ``is exactly the kind of \nperson who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an \nexample to young women across the country.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and \nconfirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii and Katherine Hayden \nSweeney to be district court judges.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hear these cries of hysteria all the time \non judges. Let's be honest about it.\n  So far this year we processed out of committee 24 nominees. Fifteen \nhave been confirmed. Three will be left after this, and six are pending \nin the committee. We will have another hearing within a week on another \nfive or six, and another hearing after that. So we are moving ahead \nquite well.\n  Let's understand something. There are more sitting judges today than \nthere were throughout virtually all of the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, as of right now. As of August 10, we had 742 active \nFederal judges.\n  Let's just be honest about it. In the 101st Congress and the 102d \nCongress by contrast, when a Democrat controlled Congress was \nprocessing President Bush's nominees, there were only 711 and 716 \nactive judges. The fact of matter is that we have not had a White House \nprocessing these people very fast. And there are some who have \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, we received 13 new nominees just before the August \nrecess, and a few more just a short while ago. They have not even been \nprocessed yet.\n  We are doing our best. All I can say is that there is room here to \nrealize that we are doing a fairly good job. We can do a better job. \nBut the White House has not been doing its job in a full effect. And, \nfrankly, we still have something like 53 total pending out of the 98 \nvacancies.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I consider my role in making recommendations \nto the President on judicial nominees to be one of the most important \nparts of my job as a Senator. It is imperative that we fill these \nlifetime positions\n\n[[Page S9165]]\n\nwith the most able and talented individuals available. That is why I am \nvery pleased that President Clinton chose to nominate Mr. Droney to \nserve on the Federal bench.\n  Chris Droney is a man of strong character, and I believe that his \nskills and intellect will enable him to serve the country with honor \nand integrity as a Federal judge. Since 1993, Mr. Droney has served as \nthe U.S. attorney for Connecticut. During his tenure, he has been well-\nreceived by the judiciary and law enforcement agencies and has played a \nkey role in the State's crackdown on street gangs. The Justice \nDepartment's last evaluation of his office concluded that Mr. Droney \nis, and I quote, ``strongly committed to the Department's law \nenforcement priorities and has demonstrated significant leadership in \nthe law enforcement community, as witnessed by the remarkable \ncooperation among the law enforcement agencies through the District.'' \nWe are proud that the Justice Department has recognized what we in \nConnecticut already know: Chris Droney is an outstanding lawyer and \npublic servant.\n  Prior to becoming U.S. attorney, Mr. Droney was in private practice \nin Hartford specializing in civil litigation. He also served as mayor \nof West Hartford from 1985 to 1989, where he did an excellent job.\n  He has been very active in a number of charitable organizations, and \nhis community service has earned him several honors and awards. In \nparticular, he was named Citizen of the Year by the Connecticut \ndivision of the Boy Scouts of America, and he received the \nDistinguished Law Enforcement Award from the Hartford Police Union.\n  Christopher Droney is an honest, forthright, and intelligent \nindividual, who is highly qualified to serve on the Federal bench. I am \nconfident that he will serve Connecticut well as a district judge for \nmany years to come, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support \nhis nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Christopher Droney, of Connecticut, to be \nU.S. District Judge for District of Connecticut. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

HALL OF CONNECTICUT, TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Janet C. Hall, \nof Connecticut, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support this judge. I would like to make \na comment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nshould be allowed to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I noted several of my colleagues, a number \nof my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, signed a letter this \nmorning concerning campaign finance reform and a number of them came \nand spoke about the urgency of the issue. Obviously, we welcome that \nactivity. But I want to point out, and point out in the strongest \npossible terms, that this issue has to be brought up in a bipartisan \nfashion. It is not 51 votes that are necessary in order to pass any \nlegislation through this body on an issue of this importance, it is \ngoing to be 60 votes.\n  I have been working with the majority leader in a most cooperative \nfashion on this issue. I believe that we can reach an agreement which \nwould be satisfactory to all parties. I do not believe it will be \nhelpful, in any way, to divide up on party lines on this issue.\n  I again thank the majority leader but I also thank my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. I am confident we can move forward on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, A question has been raised about \nstatistics. I would point out that during President Bush's last year, \nwith the Democrats in the control of the Senate, by August we had \nconfirmed 53 of the 65 nominees sent to us by the Republican President, \nnotwithstanding the ``Thurmond rule'' which calls for a slowdown in \nconfirmations during a Presidential year--53 out of 65.\n  In this the first year of President Clinton's second term, the \nRepublican-controlled Senate confirmed only 9 out of 61 judicial \nnominees sent by the President to the Senate by August. So the relevant \nstatistical comparison is 53 out of 65 when Democrats were helping \nRepublicans, but when Republicans are in control and there is a \nDemocratic President, only 9 out of 61.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. President, while I am pleased that we are voting today on three \njudicial nominees and I am supporting them, I am concerned about those \nwhom we are not voting upon--in particular two fine nominees from \nCalifornia.\n  I am also concerned about what appears to me to be a plan to force \nthe splitting of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by \ncrippling its ability to do its work.\n  Ten of the twenty-eight judgeships on that court are now vacant--36 \npercent of the bench.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that a table showing the status of each \nvacancy within the ninth circuit be place in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  I believe that proponents of the ninth circuit split wish to keep \nthese seats vacant as long as possible, so that the vacant judgeships \ncan then be transferred to the new twelfth circuit, and filled by \njudges who they hope will be more in line with their own political \nphilosophy.\n  Unfortunately, this plan is substantially impairing the ability of \nthe ninth circuit to do its job, and impeding justice for the millions \nof Americans who live within the ninth circuit --creating what the \nHonorable Proctor Hug, chief justice of the ninth circuit, has called a \nvacancy crisis.\n  The time has come for the Senate to end this death by attrition, and \nact upon these nominations, so that the ninth circuit can get on with \nits work.\n  These votes we are taking today will clear out all the judicial \nnominees who remain on the executive calendar, except for three, two of \nwhom, as I have mentioned, are from California\n  These two nominees, Margaret Morrow and Anthony Ishii, have had their \nnominations pending longer, both in the Senate and on the floor of the \nSenate, than have two of the three nominees upon whom we are voting \ntoday.\n  Margaret Morrow was first nominated almost a year and a half ago, on\n\n[[Page S9166]]\n\nMarch 18, 1996. She was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee \non June 27, 1996, but the Senate failed to take further action upon her \nnomination before we adjourned.\n  She was nominated again in the beginning of this year, and favorably \nreported by the committee again on June 12, 1997.\n  Anthony Ishii was nominated on February 12, 1997, and has been on the \nfloor since July 10.\n  In contrast, Christopher Droney and Janet Hall were nominated on June \n5, 1997, and have only been on the floor since July 31.\n  So while I am happy that we are acting upon their nominations, I hope \nthat we will soon act upon the older nominations of Margaret Morrow and \nAnthony Ishii.\n  Let's bring their nominations up, debate them if necessary, and vote \nthem up or down.\n  I urge the distinguished majority leader to do this, I thank the \nchair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a table regarding the ninth \ncircuit vacancies be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Vacancy                               Nomination\n   Court and vacancy created by--            Reason              date               Nominee              date   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           NINTH CIRCUIT                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                \nCCA:                                                                                                            \n  Breezer, Robert R................

Mr. President, Ms. Hall is one of the premier litigators in \nthe State of Connecticut, and I know that her impressive work \nexperience, both in Government service and in private practice, along \nwith her intelligence and character, will enable her to become an \nexcellent Federal judge.\n  After working in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department \nfrom 1975 to 1979, Ms. Hall joined the Hartford law firm of Robinson & \nCole, where she has been a partner since 1982. Since returning to \nprivate practice, she has handled numerous matters before both Federal \nand State appellate courts, and her work has focused primarily on \ncomplex commercial litigation.\n  Ms. Hall is respected throughout Connecticut's legal community for \nher intelligence and sense of fairness, but she is best known for her \ndedicated work ethic. More than one associate at her firm described her \nas the hardest working, most prepared lawyer that they had ever known. \nNot only does Ms. Hall push herself, but she also expects a lot from \nthose around her. Her former secretary said that the only time that she \nwas bored during 14 years of working with Ms. Hall was when she was on \nmaternity leave with her third child. However, while Ms. Hall can be \ntough on others, she always demanded even more from herself.\n  Part of me is actually relieved that I'm no longer an attorney in \nConnecticut, because I anticipate that trying a case before Ms. Hall \nwould not be an easy day's work.\n  Janet Hall is unquestionably an excellent attorney, but she is also a \nperson of great character and integrity. While Ms. Hall always worked \nhard to fulfill her responsibilities at her firm, she always managed to \nkeep her career in perspective, and her family was always her top \npriority.\n  After successfully arguing a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, she \nwas discussing the case with a group of associates. When asked to \ndescribe what was the most important thing to remember about arguing \nthe case before the highest Court in the land, she said, ``The most \nimportant thing was to bring my family.''\n  In closing, Janet Hall is an honest, forthright, and intelligent \nindividual, who is highly qualified to serve on the Federal bench, and \nall of my colleagues should be proud to vote in support of her \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Janet C. Hall, of Connecticut, to be \nUnited States district judge for the District of Connecticut? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nHutchinson] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bruce Evans, \nGinny James, Anne McInerney, Hank Kashdan, and Martin Delgado of the \ncommittee staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of the \ndebate on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, before I begin my opening statement on \nthis bill, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nBryan] be heard in order to introduce a bill and briefly to discuss it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bryan pertaining to the introduction of S. 1163 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased, together with my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd, to bring before the Senate the fiscal \nyear 1998 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill.\n  This bill provides $13.755 billion in net budget authority for the \nagencies and programs under the jurisdiction of the Interior \nsubcommittee--a reduction of $46 million from the administration's \namended budget request. In spite\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\nof this reduction, I believe that this bill protects the high \npriorities of the administration, while also reflecting the priorities \nof this body.\n  The Interior bill, Mr. President, is a fascinating mix of 91 \nappropriations accounts covering more than 40 individual bureaus in \nfour different Cabinet Departments and numerous independent agencies.\n  When I first became chairman of the subcommittee, I asked the staff \nto break down the bill into its major components so that I could \nunderstand better the competing demands within the bill. What we came \nup with was this chart behind me, Mr. President.\n  The chart breaks this bill into six functional categories--land \nmanagement programs, Indian programs, science and minerals programs, \nenergy programs, cultural programs, and the operation of the Interior \nDepartment office itself.\n  Though many of the individual programs within these categories are \nsmall in simple dollar terms, most of them have direct and tangible \nimpacts on the lives of average Americans. As such, they tend to have \nvocal constituencies.\n  You will see, Mr. President, that within each of these six major \nfunctions, we have shown some of the breakdowns. The largest amount of \nmoney goes into land management programs. Those programs, in turn, fall \ninto two separate departments. As the Forest Service, the largest \nsingle one of these programs, is within the Department of Agriculture, \nthe others are within the Department of the Interior. They are in green \non the left side of this chart. The second largest, by all odds, of the \nelements that are in this bill are Indian programs, primarily the \nIndian Health Service, and the general programs of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. Smaller amounts fall within the science and minerals programs. \nThe most significant there is the United States Geological Survey. \nEnergy programs within the purview of that Department include fossil \nenergy research and development and energy conservation research and \ndevelopment.\n\n  Finally, the cultural programs which may well occupy more of the \npassionate debate time on this floor than any of the others, include \nmuseums and the two national endowments.\n  Finally, the very small graph line on the right is for the operation \nof the Department of Interior itself. An indication of how vocal the \nconstituencies for this bill are is the fact that we on the \nsubcommittee received more than 1,800 individual requests from \nSenators. Mr. President, 100 Senators and 1,800 requests for items in \nthe Interior bill, the vast majority of which were for additions to the \nPresident's budget request. Within a subcommittee allocation that is \nactually somewhat smaller than the President's request, it has \nobviously been impossible to satisfy more than a fraction of these \nrequests while still pressuring the ongoing base programs of the \nindividual agencies shown in that chart.\n  So the task of putting together the fiscal year 1998 bill was \ncomplicated by the completion of the balanced budget agreement.\n  First, I need to report something that I have said frequently on the \nfloor that I am a strong supporter of that agreement, from the very \nbeginning of negotiations through the deliberations of the Budget \nCommittee, through its final passage and implementation. I also \nrecognize that the agreement makes available more discretionary \nspending for the Interior bill than I think we would have had in its \nabsence.\n  That said, the agreement explicitly provided that four programs in \nthe Interior bill be funded at the request level that the President \nmade for the budget: The operation of the National Park System, the \nPark Service land acquisition program and State assistance, the \nrestoration of the Everglades, and tribal priority allocations within \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  In the absence of a budget agreement I would only be honest to say I \nwould not have recommended that all of these programs be funded at the \nbudget request level. Personally, I believe there are other programs \ncovered by the bill that are of at least that degree of priority or of \na higher priority. Even so, the bill before you does fund these \nprograms at levels consistent with the budget agreement. Having reached \nthe agreement, having voted for the agreement in principle, Mr. \nPresident, it seems appropriate to me that we keep the promises that \nwere included within it. I intend to do so to the best of my ability. \nNevertheless, the effect of protecting these programs is that there was \nless funding available for other agencies and activities funded in the \nbill.\n  The budget agreement also created a $700 million reserve fund for \npriority land acquisitions. That amount has been included in the bill \nand is in addition to the $242 million provided for specific land \nacquisition projects in the regular acquisition accounts.\n  The budget agreement made no provision for the carrying costs of the \nlands to be acquired with the $700 million, nor for the payments in \nlieu of taxes that likely must be paid on these lands. While I believe \nthat the $700 million might better be spent reducing the huge \nmaintenance backlogs that already exist on Federal lands, essentially \ntaking care of what we already have, my strong support for the budget \nagreement compelled me to include the $700 million in this bill. The \nHouse did not do so. Knowing how strongly Chairman Regula feels about \nthis issue, I anticipate our discussion in conference on the subject \nwill be a lively one, to say the least.\n  Of the $700 million provided for land acquisition in title V, $250 \nmillion is set aside for the acquisition of the Headwaters Forest in \nCalifornia and $65 million is set aside for the acquisition of the New \nWorld Mine in Montana. Both of these appropriations remain subject to \nenactment of specific authorizing legislation. I have included the \nauthorizing clause due to the magnitude of these two acquisitions, the \ncomplex structure of the acquisition agreement, and the fact that the \nagreements themselves were struck with very little congressional \noversight or involvement. The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], \namong others, has expressed to me a number of serious concerns and \nquestions about each of these acquisitions. As chairman of the relevant \nauthorizing committee, it is appropriate that he be given the \nopportunity to have his questions answered by the administration. I am \nconfident he will work in good faith to draft appropriate authorizing \nlegislation, and I understand that he intends to hold a hearing on this \nissue in the near future.\n  The administration and many Members on the other side of the aisle \nwish to avoid the authorizing process entirely. The House of \nRepresentatives, on the other hand, made no such appropriation at all.\n  It seems to me where we stand in this bill for the purposes of \ndebating this bill here in the Senate, we are at the right stage. We \nshould appropriate the $700 million. We should allow the authorizing \ncommittee to do its work on these two expensive, complicated, and \nvitally important acquisitions.\n  Of the $700 million, an additional $100 million is provided \nspecifically for the ``stateside'' grant program. As some of my \ncolleagues may be aware, this is a program that was essentially \nterminated by the Appropriations Committee in the fiscal year 1996 \nbill. The Interior subcommittee's allocation was cut sharply that year \nand it was simply not possible to continue the stateside program while \nprotecting the core Federal programs included in the bill. Furthermore, \nI suspect that continued funding constraints and the growing cost of \nmaintaining Federal land and facilities make it unlikely that the \nstateside program will be resurrected in the context of any annual \nappropriations bill in the near future.\n  I hope this one-time appropriation of $100 million, to be allocated \nover a 4-year period, will enable the authorizing committee to identify \na permanent funding source for that stateside program.\n  The remaining $285 million provided in title V of the bill is for \nFederal acquisition projects. The specific acquisition projects to be \nfunded would be determined through discussions between Congress and the \nadministration but no funds would be available until the project list \nis approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. This \nprocess will enable us to target these funds for acquisitions that \nprotect the most critically threatened resources and that reduce the \ncost of\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\nlands management by eliminating problematic inholdings. I do not intend \nto use these funds to create new parks, forests or refuges.\n  Now, for the land management agencies themselves, the bill includes a \nnumber of positive features. For the National Park Service, the bill \nfully funds the administration's budget request for operation of the \nNational Park System. This results in a 1 percent across-the-board \nfunding increase for all park units. In addition, the bill includes a \n$24.8 million increase for special needs parks, an increase of $8.1 \nmillion over the budget request. These funds will be used to staff new \nparks, address critical operating shortfalls at park units with high \nvisitation and protect threatened park resources.\n\n  For the Fish and Wildlife Service, the bill includes an increase of \n$33.2 million over the fiscal year 1997 level for the operation and \nmaintenance of our Nation's fish and wildlife refuges. This amounts to \na $20 million increase over the budget request. The increase will \nenable the service to make a dent in its growing maintenance backlog \nand to address critical operating shortfalls at selected refuges.\n  The bill provides $1.135 billion for the Bureau of Land Management, \nan increase of more than $40 million over the comparable fiscal year \n1997 funding level. The amount provided includes increases over fiscal \nyear 1997 of $12.5 million for wildland fire preparedness, and $18.2 \nfor fire operations and for payments in lieu of taxes.\n  Total funding for the Forest Service is $2.495 billion, an increase \nof $133 million above the comparable fiscal year 1997 enacted amount. \nFunds have been provided to produce 3.8 billion board feet of timber, \nconsisting of 2.525 billion board feet from ``green'' sales, and 1.275 \nbillion board feet from salvage. The funding provided also includes a \n$33.4 million increase over the administration's request for forest \nhealth-related programs, including $21 million to reduce the severe \npotential for catastrophic fire on our national forest lands. Through \nlanguage in the bill and report, the committee has taken steps to \neliminate needless duplicate planning processes, and to increase Forest \nService accountability for land management planning and implementation \nof the Columbia Basin ecosystem assessment and other ecoregion \nassessments.\n  Within the area of programs for Native Americans, the bill provides \n$2.1 billion for the Indian Health Service. This funding level is $72.7 \nmillion over the fiscal year 1997 level and 4.7 million over the \nPresident's request. The committee's recommendation includes $35 \nmillion for uncontrollable fixed costs related largely to hospital and \nclinic personnel, an increase of $15 million over the budget request. \nThis increase will allow the Indian health service to maintain current \nlevels of service.\n  As I already noted, it fully funds the President's request for tribal \npriority allocations at $757.4 million, consistent with the budget \nagreement. This represents an increase of $76.5 million over fiscal \nyear 1997 levels. Tribal priority allocations now make up 49 percent of \nthe bureau's operating budget.\n  Within those tribal priority allocations, approximately 30 percent is \ndistributed by formula based on tribes meeting criteria for the \nfollowing programs: The Indian Child Welfare Act, new tribes, Johnson \nO'Malley education assistance, housing improvement, road maintenance, \ncontract support, and welfare assistance.\n  The committee has included report language directing the continued \nallocation of these funds based on qualification with specific \ncriteria.\n  The committee has also included language in section 118 of the bill \nthat directs the Bureau of Indian affairs to develop and present to the \nCongress by January 1, 1998, its recommendations for the allocation of \nthe tribal priority allocations funding based on tribal economic wealth \nand need. Currently, TPA funds are distributed to the tribes based on a \nhistorical methodology dating to the 1930's when we had many fewer \nrecognized tribes and when circumstances were very much different for \nboth the tribes and the Federal budget. This old funding plan was \nfurther corrupted in the 1960's through the 1980's when the base TPA \nfunds for certain tribes were increased significantly. This provision \nand a revised version that will be offered as an amendment will be the \nsubject of extensive debate during the consideration of the bill unless \nagreement on the provision can be reached, an agreement which now seems \nto be within the range of possibility.\n  It is, however, based on the very simple premise in an area of severe \nfiscal constraints, the distribution of scarce funds for tribal \ngovernments should be based upon an objective assessment of relative \nneed, not the political power of individual tribes or the arbitrary \naccumulation of individual funding decisions over past years.\n  The committee has included language in section 120 of the bill \npursuant to which tribes that receive tribal priority allocation \nfunding for this fiscal year must waive a claim of immunity, be subject \nto the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts, and grant original jurisdiction \nof all civil actions involving the tribe to U.S. district courts. This \nprovision will also be the subject of extensive and sometimes complex \ndebate during the consideration of the bill. At its core, section 120 \nis an attempt to preserve the right of all Americans to have their \ngrievances heard and decided in neutral courts.\n  The Interior bill continues the Federal investment in key energy \nresearch and development programs. Fossil energy research and \ndevelopment is funded at $363.9 million, comparable to the fiscal year \n1997 enacted level. Increases above the budget request are provided to \nsustain critical technology development programs intended to produce \nenvironmental benefits while improving energy efficiency.\n  Mr. President, $627.4 million is provided for energy conservation \nprograms, an increase of $58 million over the fiscal year 1997 level. \nIncreases over current year levels include $17 million for \ntransportation programs, $20 million for building research and \ndevelopment, and $16 million for industry programs. The bill provides \n$129 million for the weatherization program and $31.1 million for the \nState grant program, respective increases of $8 million and $2.1 \nmillion over current year levels.\n  The bill does include a sale of $207.5 million worth of oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve to finance operation of that reserve.\n  Though I had hoped not to sell oil to finance reserve operations in \nfiscal year 1998, the constraints of the subcommittee's 602(b) \nallocation, the precedent set in the President's budget request, and \nthe funding expectations raised by House action made it impossible to \navoid the sale. While I remain open to alternatives to oil sales, it is \nwith the recognition that any such alternative will likely have an \nadverse impact on other programs funded in this bill.\n  Within the grouping of programs that I have identified as cultural \nlies the one agency that probably receives more attention per \nappropriated dollar than any other funded in this bill--the National \nEndowments for the Arts. The bill reported by the committee provides \njust over $100 million for the NEA, roughly the same as the fiscal year \n1997 level. The fact that the committee has chosen to fund the NEA, \nwhich the House did not do, reflects the overwhelming support that the \nagency enjoys among committee members, both Republican and Democrat. \nNevertheless, I anticipate a spirited debate about the future of the \nagency as we proceed with consideration of this bill, and when we go to \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. President, putting this legislation together has been a \ntremendous challenge. While the fiscal constraints under which the \nsubcommittee must operate make it impossible to please everyone, I do \nbelieve this bill represents a fair balance between the priorities of \nthe Members of this body--both Republican and Democrat--and the \npriorities of the administration. I truly hope to have the support of \nmy colleagues in voting for final passage, as well as their \nconsideration on any amendments that may be offered during debate on \nthe bill.\n  Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the staff for their hard \nwork on this bill. Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Martin \nDelgado, and Kevin Johnson of the subcommittee staff have worked many \nlong hours to put this bill together, and I have greatly appreciated \ntheir advice, counsel, and perseverance. Hank Kashdan--our\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\ndetailee from the Forest Service--has also been a great help, and we \nwill be sorry to see him go at the end of the year. I also want to \nthank Chuck Berwick and Nina Nguyen of my personal staff for all their \nhelp on a number of critical issues in this bill. On Senator Byrd's \nstaff, it has been a continued pleasure to work with Sue Masica, \nwithout whose expertise and institutional knowledge this bill would \nhave been a lesser product. I also want to thank Carole Geagley of \nSenator Byrd's staff, as well as Lisa Mendelson who worked with Senator \nByrd's staff as a detailee from the Park Service. I would be remiss in \nnot extending my thanks to the full committee staff for their help, \ncooperation, and guidance, particularly the majority and minority staff \ndirectors, Steve Cortese and Jim English.\n  With that, I will defer to Senator Byrd. Before doing that, I want to \nsay publicly once again how much I have learned, working as \nsubcommittee chairman, from his vast experience, his guidance and, \nperhaps even more significant, in the last few years his personal \nfriendship. His technical knowledge of the appropriations process, his \nappreciation for its nuances, and his respect for the entire Senate \nhave been invaluable to me both in producing the bill and, I hope, in \nbecoming a better Senator. At the same time, his advocacy on behalf of \nhis colleagues has been invaluable to many on that side of the aisle \nand, I think I can say, to this side of the aisle as well. It has been \na wonderful partnership. I hope we can continue it for a long time to \ncome.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted to Dr. Robert M. Simon, on detail from the \nDepartment of Energy to my staff, during the pendency of H.R. 2107.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the fiscal year \n1998 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill. This is a bill \nthat is very important to the continued protection and management of \nour Nation's natural resources, to our energy future, to the well-being \nof our Indian population, and to the cultural and historical heritage \nof our country. I hope the Senate will move quickly in its \nconsideration of this bill. If there are amendments--and I am sure \nthere will be some--I encourage Senators to come to the floor and let \nus have the debate and then vote on those matters that are \ncontroversial. The start of the fiscal year is less than 3 weeks away, \nand we still face a difficult conference with the House.\n  It has been my high privilege to serve as the ranking member at the \nside of our very able chairman, the senior Senator from Washington [Mr. \nGorton]. He is an absolute master of the details of the Interior bill. \nHe is a student, and a good one, of much of the history that we protect \nin this bill, and he is a very fair arbiter of the competing demands \nthat fall within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. This bill was put \ntogether in a very bipartisan manner, and it is responsive to \npriorities identified by many Senators, by the administration, by the \npublic, and by the agencies that are charged with carrying out the \ndirections provided in the bill.\n  Mr. President, the reach of the programs in the Interior bill is \nvast, and not much of the funding provided in this bill is spent here \nin Washington. Rather, the dollars that we are considering today will \nflow out to more than 370 national park units, over 500 national \nwildlife refuges, 121 national forests, more than 435 Indian hospitals \nand clinics, 16 different museums of the Smithsonian Institution, and \nto countless other locations where the research and technology \ndevelopment supported by this bill occurs.\n  So these funds will reach from the northernmost point in Alaska to \nthe southernmost tip of Florida and from the Outer Banks of North \nCarolina to the islands in the western Pacific.\n  The extent to which this bill makes its presence known in each State \nis reflected in the number of requests that Senator Gorton and I \nreceive for project funding each year. While no one receives every item \nhe or she requests, I believe that Senator Gorton has done an excellent \njob of trying to accommodate high-priority items within the allocation \nassigned to this subcommittee. This bill contains approximately $13 \nbillion in funding for the base programs, as well as an additional $700 \nmillion for priority land acquisitions and exchanges. This bill is at \nits allocation figure, so any additional funding sought by Senators \nwill need to be offset.\n  Senator Gorton has summarized in a very detailed and clear way the \nitems and the details of the bill thoroughly. So I will not attempt to \ncover them again.\n  While this bill provides needed resources to address protection of \nsome of our most important national treasures, we still have a long way \nto go. The National Park Service has a $6 billion maintenance and \nrehabilitation backlog. The Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Smithsonian, and other \nagencies also have considerable backlogs. Continued pressures to \nbalance the budget on the back of discretionary spending will further \nimpede our efforts to provide the resources necessary to protect the \nwonders with which we have been entrusted.\n  For all of the pride that we take in our National Park System, it is \nalso crumbling before us. Visitors flock to these national treasures \nevery year--not only American visitors and their families, but \nincreasingly, visitors from other countries. They come to partake of \nthe historic, the cultural, and the scenic resources that have been so \ncarefully preserved and entrusted to the National Park Service.\n  Mr. President, as a reflection of our infrastructure and restoration \nprojects, this bill takes into account the needs. And as a reflection \nof the patriotism and commitment to future generations, we should be \ndoing more to preserve and to protect these wondrous resources.\n  Innovative fee structures, enhanced partnership efforts, and expanded \nuse of volunteers--all of which are supported by this bill--are not the \nsole solution to the needs of our national parks. Rather, we must \ncommit funds to allow major infrastructure and restoration projects to \nproceed. When the house is crumbling, we must tend to the foundations \nand not just make minor cosmetic repairs.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I extend a word of appreciation to the staff \nthat have assisted the chairman and me in our work on this bill. They \nwork as a team, and they serve both of us, as well as the full Senate, \nin a very effective and dedicated manner. They have taken years to \nacquire this expertise, and it is a vast benefit to Senators and to the \npeople who research. On the majority side, the staff members, I \nbelieve, have already been mentioned by the distinguished chairman of \nthe subcommittee, as well as on my side of the aisle, which he kindly \nreferred to. This team works under the tutelage of the staff directors \nof the full committee--Steve Cortese for the majority and Jim English \nfor the minority.\n  This is a good bill, Mr. President, and I urge the Senate to complete \nits action promptly.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill, \nparticularly my good friend from Washington.\n  I have good news that an amendment that I had proposed to offer I \nwill not have to offer on this bill.\n  On behalf of the people of Seneca, MO, and really people all across \nsouthwest Missouri, I, along with my colleagues Senator Ashcroft and \nCongressman Roy Blunt, have been fighting against an effort by an \nOklahoma Indian tribe, the Eastern Shawnee, to move into southwest \nMissouri and establish a gambling casino in Seneca.\n  In truth, it is a New Jersey gaming operation that is behind this \noperation. They have claimed that they provided $25 million to the \ntribe because they felt that a gambling casino in the heart of the \nfamily entertainment vacation area of southwest Missouri would be \nextremely profitable for the corporation and its shareholders.\n  Over the last several months, I have presented to the Secretary of \nthe Interior what I thought were good legal arguments that the tribe is \nnot entitled to use an exception in the statute that would permit them \nautomatically to move across the border from Oklahoma into Missouri.\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\n  The people of southwest Missouri finally have some good news. Last \nnight Secretary Babbitt called me to say that the tribe cannot \nautomatically move across the border and build a casino in Missouri. \nThis means that other tribes with land bordering on our State will not \nbe able to come in. They would have to go through the process of \ngetting approval of the Governor and support of the local residents.\n  I think this is a huge victory for the overwhelming majority of local \nresidents who are concerned that gambling would destroy the family \nenvironment and the quality of life for which southwest Missouri is so \nwell known.\n  I assure my constituents and my colleagues that I intend to continue \nto fight to ensure that the entire State is protected from the invasion \nof unwanted gambling. I assure those people who are behind the efforts, \nthe gambling interests, if they find or think they find another \nloophole, I will do my best to close it. So, Mr. President, more \nauthorizing legislation may well be needed in this.\n  I express my thanks to the Secretary of the Interior, who has advised \nme orally, although I have not seen the written opinion, that the tribe \ndoes not qualify for the exception, and under the circumstances that \navenue is no longer open to bring a gambling casino into Seneca, MO.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, later during the Senate's consideration of this bill, \nthe Interior appropriations bill, there will be, it is my \nunderstanding, a rider offered by Senator Bryan of Nevada. That rider \nwould reduce the Forest Service road construction by $10 million, \nroughly 20 percent. It would eliminate the Forest Service's Purchaser \nCredit Road Construction Program and modify the formula for receipt-\nsharing for Forest Service receipts with the counties.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to rise in \nopposition to the amendment and vote against it. I encourage my \ncolleagues to do likewise. But I wanted to share a brief perspective \nwith my colleagues from the standpoint of the chairman of the \nauthorizing committee with jurisdiction over these matters.\n  The Bryan amendment will follow hard on the heels of a similar \namendment which was offered in the House by Congressman Kennedy and \nCongressman Porter in July. That amendment precipitated, as a \nconsequence, a very intense debate in which numerous sets of facts were \npresented to the House and some statements were made that were not \nnecessarily factual.\n  Not surprisingly, the material that was brought into the debate, to a \nlarge degree, was in conflict. I have often believed that everyone is \nentitled to their own opinion, but that we ought to try to express our \nopinions using a commonly held set of facts. Oftentimes in this Chamber \nrhetoric will prevail over sound science simply because of the \ninability of the scientists to be heard and the scientists' willingness \nto stand behind their recommendations with their professional \nreputations.\n  Mr. President, both the Speaker and my House counterpart, the \nCongressman for Alaska, Congressman Young, as chairman of the House \nResources Committee, agree with this proposition. As a consequence, \ntoday Congressman Young has sent me a letter, which I ask unanimous \nconsent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                       Committee on Resources,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During House consideration of the \n     Interior Appropriations bill, the Kennedy-Porter amendment \n     was offered to reduce the Forest Service timber roads \n     program.\n       As you know, the reduction proposed in these amendments \n     would devastate communities that rely on public land timber. \n     It would gravely affect constituents in the West who work in \n     the woods and the mills that supply the nation with wood for \n     homes and other essential products. The implications to \n     schools and children who depend on revenue sharing from \n     timber receipts would also be substantial.\n       In speaking to many of the supporters of the Kennedy-Porter \n     amendment to reduce funding for timber roads, they have \n     explained that they supported the amendment in order to \n     reduce costs and improve the environment. We too have real \n     concerns with the skyrocketing cost of roads and timber \n     sales. We have concluded that our goals may in fact be \n     consistent. We believe that using collaboration and facts to \n     address the problems that face the Forest Service we can \n     reach a mutually beneficial solution.\n       We have offered to work cooperatively with interested House \n     Members who hold different perspectives of forestry issues. \n     We plan to do this in an inclusive way to properly address \n     the real problems with these programs. This approach may be \n     of interest to Senators grappling with the same problems that \n     we grappled with in the House. To begin this process, we are \n     planning an all day workshop involving as many interested \n     Members of Congress as possible. If you wish to organize a \n     group of Senators with an interest in this approach to the \n     roads and cost issue, we invite you to do so and participate \n     with us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Young.\n     Helen Chenoweth.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. At the end of the House debate, many of the parties in \nopposition to one another found they simply shared a common goal. So \nafter an extended debate, they came together and found what they could \nagree upon. They cared a great deal about the skyrocketing costs of the \nForest Service program, without exception. They agreed then that \ncollaboration and common understanding was necessary to address the \nproblems in a way that would most likely achieve a mutual beneficial \nsolution and it would be better to do that than simply replay the \ndebate.\n  I think that is where we are today, Mr. President. We do not want to \nreplay that debate that unfolded in the House and perhaps would unfold \nin this body.\n  So Congressman Young has taken the lead from the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives to work with the conflict resolution center at \nGeorge Mason University to schedule an all-day workshop with interested \nCongressmen to review these issues and find where some common ground \nand consensus could be found. And this is the issue in mind, the Forest \nService's Purchaser Credit Road Construction Program.\n  Congressman Young is inviting me and other interested Senators to the \nworkshop. I will support the House effort and urge Members here to do \nlikewise.\n  I do not believe that we can make sound public policy decisions when \nwe disagree on basic facts associated with the issues that come to the \nSenate floor. This particular issue is ripe for that kind of exposure. \nSo I will leave it to my colleagues later in the debate to come to \ntheir own judgment. We voted on this issue time and time again. It \nprevailed. But I believe the search for consensus, which has been \ninitiated in the House, is something the Senate should adopt. I urge \nthe consideration of my colleagues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to describe to my colleagues \nan amendment that it is my intention to offer on this appropriations \nbill. I intend to offer an amendment on behalf of myself, and Senator \nJohnson, from the State of South Dakota, who will be speaking on it \nwhen I finish. We are joined in this endeavor by a fairly large number \nof Senators: Senators Campbell, Daschle, Domenici, Inouye, Burns, \nConrad, Bingaman, Kohl, Wellstone, McCain, Harkin, Murray, and Levin--a \nvery distinguished and significant bipartisan group of Senators--and, \nas I mentioned previously, by Senator Johnson of South Dakota who has \nworked very closely with me on this amendment.\n  The amendment deals with tribal colleges. Before I describe the \namendment I would like to make a comment about this subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\n  I am privileged to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee. I \nconsider it a distinct privilege to work with the Appropriations \nCommittee, with the distinguished chairman, Senator Stevens of Alaska, \nand the distinguished ranking member and former chairman, Senator Byrd \nof West Virginia. I also serve on the Interior subcommittee. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with the Senator from Washington, Senator \nGorton, whose leadership has been excellent. Although he is not at the \npresent moment on the floor, I want him to know that the chart he \nbrings to the floor to describe the breakdown of expenditures for this \nparticular subcommittee is unique, and particularly useful. It is the \nonly chart of its type that I know of that has been presented to \nMembers, and it, more than almost any other approach, really gives us a \ngood description of where we are spending the money in this \nsubcommittee, how much we are spending, and the purpose of that \nspending.\n  So I say ``thank you'' to Senator Gorton, and to the ranking member \nof this subcommittee, Senator Byrd from West Virginia as well, for \ntheir leadership.\n  I would like to thank Bruce Evans, Anne McInerney, and Sue Masica, \nthe staff on this subcommittee who have been very helpful in working \nwith me on a wide range of issues.\n  The purpose of my offering an amendment today is to increase the \nfunding for tribal colleges. And I want to describe why I think that is \nnecessary.\n  Funding for tribally controlled colleges has not increased for 3 \nyears. The President's budget requested $30,411,000 for these \ncolleges--a $3 million increase over the last fiscal year. Both the \nHouse and the Senate bills have provided for a $1 million increase. And \nI would like to add the extra $2 million to bring funding up to the \nPresident's request in his budget recommendation. With the adoption of \nthis amendment, the Senate will be at the budget request level. And \nthat is still only half of the authorized level. Nonetheless, I think \nit is a very important step forward. This amendment will be offset by a \npro rata reduction in travel for all agencies covered by this bill \nwhose budgets exceed $20 million.\n  I can think of no more worthwhile investment in the future of native \nAmericans than to invest in their education, particularly at the \npostsecondary level. All of us know that education is the key to \nsuccess. We have 24 tribally controlled community colleges in this \ncountry that will be covered by this amendment. These colleges now \nserve more than 20,000 students.\n  There are five tribal colleges in North Dakota. And I have been \npleased to play a role in trying to help them, all of which I have \nvisited personally. I must say that they have made a significant \ndifference in the lives of many, many students. These colleges have \nbeen successful in educating native American students by preserving the \ncultural environment in which these students are familiar while still \nproviding them with the skills to be competitive in the society at \nlarge. I am proud of what they have accomplished. I think the extra $2 \nmillion will be very, very helpful. Unfortunately, tribal college \nappropriations have failed to keep pace with inflation, and actual per \nstudent funding has decreased by $317 while the student enrollment has \nincreased by more than 230 percent over the last decade.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like just for a moment to describe a couple of \npeople that I have either been privileged to meet or have heard about, \nwho have demonstrated to me the importance of tribal colleges.\n  I was invited to speak at a tribal college commencement in North \nDakota a few years ago. As they lined up in cap and gown, enormously \nproud of their achievement on their graduation day, I felt pride as \nwell. I was visiting with several from the class, just kibitzing back \nand forth, and I asked, ``Who is the oldest of this graduating class?'' \nA woman raised her hand. She said, ``I am the oldest.'' She was, I \nbelieve, 41 years old. She was a single mother of four children, whose \nhusband had left her. She had been employed as the janitor in that \nschool at the tribal college cleaning the hallways, cleaning the \nlavatories, working long hours, and working hard to try to care for her \nchildren. As she was cleaning the lavatories and the hallways in this \ntribal college, she got a notion that she would very much like to \ngraduate from this college.\n  So from the position of custodian or janitor at a tribal college, on \nthis day when I was to speak at the graduation, she was wearing a cap \nand a gown, and at age 41 was getting a college degree. She had a smile \nso wide and such pride in her eyes because of what she had achieved for \nherself that no one will ever take away. It was, I think, Ben Franklin \nwho suggested that if we empty our purse in our head, no one will ever \nbeen able to take it from us. And she knew that. But think of the odds \nto overcome--a single mother, raising four children, few skills, \nwithout much pay coming from the employment she then had. But on this \nday, she was a college graduate. I have never forgotten that smile. It \nwas a remarkable achievement for her. But you will find that similar \nstories at all these tribal colleges. It changes people's lives.\n  I want to tell you about a friend of mine named Loretta De Long, a \nNorth Dakotan. I am privileged to know Loretta. She was a single \nChippewa mother of two. She was wondering about her life and her \nfuture. And tribal colleges were established just about the time that \nshe realized the key to her future could be a higher education.\n  After getting her high school diploma in a GED Program, this mother \nof two young children, the youngest of which was 6 weeks at the time, \nenrolled in one of the tribal colleges in North Dakota and that allowed \nfor her to stay near her family and care for her children while she \npursued her education. She said that ``going to college was like \nlooking in the mirror and seeing myself for the first time that college \nseemed to tap a leadership quality that had been squashed by the \noutside world.''\n  Well, today Loretta De Long is Dr. De Long, Dr. Loretta De Long. The \nsame woman, yes. She is also the Superintendent of Education for the \nTurtle Mountain Agency of the Turtle Mountain Tribe in North Dakota--\nanother example of one person, but a success as a result of tribal \ncolleges.\n  I don't know Myra Lefthand, but Myra Lefthand is a Montanan, and she \nis a Crow Indian from Montana. She and her daughter lived on clerk's \npay and after 15 years in the same position on clerk's pay, not doing \nvery well, she felt there were many positions that she saw in and \naround her job situation that she would like to have had but was never \nable to apply for them because she didn't have the education.\n  Here is what she said. She entered a tribal college to get an \neducation. She said:\n\n       For me, it meant a commitment to a goal. When I quit my \n     job, I left behind what little security I had for myself and \n     my daughter and I could no longer expect a paycheck, no \n     matter how small. But while I was at the Little Bighorn \n     College, I was encouraged daily in my pursuit of an associate \n     degree in chemical dependency counseling by the dean of \n     students, Punkie Anne Bollis, and by my sister, Clarice Deny. \n     Between the two of them, a lot of hitchhiking, a lot of \n     scrimping to make small savings go a long way, and the \n     generosity of a sister who brought daily lunches to me, I was \n     able to persist and to graduate from the Little Bighorn \n     Tribal College with an AA degree.\n       To all potential tribal college students, I say that going \n     to get a professional degree is possible. With a little \n     effort, hard study, support, prayers of family members, some \n     financial aid, and the encouragement of some good teachers, \n     an associate degree can be earned.\n\n  The reason I mention today Myra, Dr. De Long, or Wilma, the first \nwoman I described, is that these are people whose lives have been \nchanged by the ability to go to a tribal college, the ability to, on an \nIndian reservation, have the support of family and have the other \nsupport that is available and still enter college and get a degree and \nchange their lives.\n  Now, what I am suggesting by this amendment is that we provide the \nadditional $2 million which will bring the request up to the \nPresident's budget request. It is not a large amount of money by some \nAppropriations Committee standards, but it is an important amount of \nmoney that will I think invest in and benefit the lives of many \nAmericans who now attend these tribal colleges, the enrollments of \nwhich are growing very rapidly but student funding has not kept pace.\n  My intention would be to have this amendment offered. I will offer it \nor it\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\ncan be offered on my behalf at the appropriate time after the committee \namendments have been offered and I would like to work with the \ncommittee chair and the ranking member to see if we can find a way to \nadopt this amendment.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee is here now. He was not here when I \ndescribed the compliments I have for the chart that he provided the \nSenate. He does that every year, and it is the only one I know that \nexists with these subcommittees. It is an awfully good way to describe \nto the Congress what we are spending and where we are spending it, and \nI want to say thanks for the Senator's excellent leadership, and thanks \nto the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership as well.\n  I know the Senator from South Dakota wishes to speak on this \namendment, and I thank him very much for his strong work and support. I \nhope as we move along this amendment can be offered and hopefully we \ncan agree to it.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Dakota soon to be offered. I join Senator Dorgan \nin commending Chairman Stevens for his work, certainly the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for his extraordinary leadership over the \nyears on issues of this nature, and I look forward to working with the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton, to see what we can do to move \nthis kind of amendment along.\n  Mr. President, I represent a State, the State of South Dakota, where \nwe have nine Indian reservations, and where levels of poverty are \nextraordinary. I have worked very hard over the years both in the House \nof Representatives prior to my service in the Senate and now in the \nSenate on a wide range of initiatives designed to try to improve the \ncircumstances of the native American citizens of our Nation, and of our \nState--water development initiatives and efforts on housing and health \ncare and infrastructure improvements. I think all of them are \nimportant.\n  I have come to the conclusion after years of struggling and facing \nwhat sometimes appeared to me to be almost overwhelming circumstances \nof poverty, isolation, and difficulty, that if there is one area that \ndeserves particular emphasis it needs to be education, and in this \ninstance higher education for native American citizens of our country.\n  There was a time when I was, frankly, a bit skeptical, there was a \ntime when I thought that perhaps we could just better utilize the \nexisting State and other private institutions of higher education \nthroughout our States. And we have made some successful efforts there \nin our Upward Bound Programs and others that have been of some help. \nBut, frankly, the dropout rate and the lack of success was very high \nover the years. Now we have 25 tribal colleges serving between 20,000 \nto 25,000 native American students in 11 States around the country. We \nhave four of them in the State of South Dakota, all of them accredited, \nall of them providing high-quality educational opportunities not just \nfor native American students but for many non-Indian students as well \nwho live in those extremely rural areas and who need to have this kind \nof access to educational opportunity.\n  We find that 56 percent of the American Indian population in our \nNation is age 24 or younger. There is, demographically, a huge number \nof people of college age and younger; 90 percent of tribal college \nstudents qualify for need-based financial aid; 85 percent live in \npoverty; more than 50 percent are parents; 70 percent of these young \npeople attending tribal colleges are female.\n  As I examine what has transpired over these years that we have \ndeveloped a tribal college system, I see for the first time a whole \ngeneration of native Americans who are becoming teachers and nurses and \nmanagers and entrepreneurs; who are becoming role models in their \ncommunities where none before ever existed in terms of making their way \nin the larger economic system of our country. We have so many people \nwho have lived all of their lives without an economic opportunity, \nwithout jobs being available, without anyone in their family having had \nthe opportunity to work, who have not had the skills to make it in the \nlarger economy of our Nation, and yet now finally we are seeing this \nforward edge of progress being made among native Americans. It is, more \nthan anything else, because of this opportunity to secure the job \nskills, the training, the education, the brainpower that is required to \nsucceed in America, that is required to succeed in the global economy \nin which we live today.\n  These colleges have made their way with very modest resources. In \nfact, even with the President's recommendation, we will spend only \nabout half the dollars per student as is authorized under Federal law \nand far less than half of what other community colleges and other 4-\nyear colleges in America use to educate each student. It is amazing \nthat they have done as well as they have, that they have kept their \naccreditation, that they have kept the torch of hope alive for so many \npeople and yet they have done it with far less per student than any \nother college in America.\n\n  The $2 million request that Senator Dorgan has put into his amendment \nwill be divided among 25 colleges, and yet they have gone so far on so \nlittle that even this will be a very significant help for them, given \nthe fact that they have now gone 3 years in a row without any upward \nadjustment in their funding at all, and despite the fact that \nenrollment numbers have increased significantly, that this really has \nbecome the steppingstone for success and is recognized as such in tribe \nafter tribe throughout our country.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I will be pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. On behalf of the majority leader, I am authorized to \nannounce there will be no further rollcall votes today.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator. That is always a well received kind \nof announcement from the subcommittee chairman.\n  We find that our tribal colleges are unmatched in retention, in \nmatriculation and job placement of American Indian students; 42 percent \nof these tribal college students transfer to 4-year institutions.\n  As we undertake the welfare reform initiatives at the Federal level \nand which the States are carrying through, it is all the more reason we \nneed this opportunity, this steppingstone for people to develop the \nskills to in fact break out of what has been a relentless, an \noverwhelming cycle of poverty that so many native Americans have been \ncaught up in. But again, it is not just native Americans who benefit \nfrom this.\n  I think of an instance of Wilma Sachtjen of Burke, SD, a displaced \nhomemaker with a high school diploma. Wilma enrolled in the Sinte \nGleska College in Rosebud, SD. A non-Indian, she was able to secure an \neducation because of this program when no other opportunity could \npossibly have existed for her. She secured a bachelor's degree in human \nsrvices. She has been employed in that field ever since. And so we have \nnot just native Americans but the entire population of our States at \nmany of these colleges, in most cases in remote areas, gaining \nopportunity.\n  The four colleges in South Dakota: the Cheyenne River Community \nCollege at Eagle Butte; the Oglala Lakota College at Kyle; the Sinte \nGleska University at Rosebud, and Sisseton Wahpeton Community College \nat Sisseton, have all provided key educational opportunities for the \npopulation of our State. Many of our students also attend Sitting Bull \nCollege at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and many \nattend the United Tribes Technical College in Bismark as well.\n  So these colleges serve regional populations and not simply the \ntribal membership of their own reservations. So I cannot share with you \nin stronger terms the importance of continuing these colleges with \nadequate funding--certainly not extraordinary funding but adequate \nfunding--to make sure that the ladder of opportunity remains in place. \nThis is a newfound opportunity, a newfound ladder, really, that has \nonly been with us for a relatively recent number of years. But I think \nit\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\nis one of the most vital components we could possibly imagine to have \nif in fact we are going to break the cycle of poverty, create greater \nself-sufficiency, greater dignity, greater pride and greater \nopportunity for native American students.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, I cannot commend in stronger terms to my \ncolleagues the importance of the passage of the Dorgan amendment and a \ncontinuation of a strong tribal college system in America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I certainly yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, many people ask the question--if you have \nother colleges elsewhere in the country, why is there a need for tribal \ncolleges? The answer to that, very simply, is that a substantial number \nof women are attending these colleges, especially women who are living \nin poverty, many of them well above the 18- or 20-year-old age when \npeople are moving into college. And because tribal college students are \nolder and female--often single mothers in their late twenties or \nthirties--the ability to go to a tribal college on the reservation \nitself allows them to access the support of families for child care. \nThat support is often the difference between going to college and not \ngoing to college; being able to have an opportunity for a higher degree \nor not being able to have the opportunity. It is in evidence all across \nthis country that these tribal colleges work, whereas in other \ncircumstances those same people, who are now proud graduates, would \nprobably not have had the opportunity to go on for an advanced \neducation.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator's yielding. I would like to make \none additional comment if I might, if the Senator will indulge me.\n  When I mentioned the thank you for so many staffers who worked with \nus on this amendment, I did not mention Mary Hawkins, who works with me \non appropriations issues. Mary is going to be leaving the Hill at the \nend of this year. She has worked for a long while and does wonderful \nwork. I am blessed having her work with me on appropriations issues, \nand I wanted to say thank you to her as well.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I share the Senator's \ncongratulations to Mary and the staff in general who have worked very \nhard on these and other key issues.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota raises an important point \nrelative to the unique importance of these institutions, given the \nkinds of circumstances that the students face where there is a great \nneed for extended family, where transportation is difficult to secure, \nwhere the extended family is necessary to make education--oftentimes \nfar more than 4 years, oftentimes 5 and 6 and 7 years--for \nnontraditional students to become a reality. Were it not for these \ninstitutions, there simply would not be this level of educational \nachievement, there would not be these role models being created, there \nwould not be this kind of leadership created in Indian country today. \nSo, again, I have to thank the Senator for his leadership and insights \non this issue, and I yield my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, tribal colleges play a crucial role in \nIndian country. An educated population is central to all successful \neconomic and community development efforts. Tribal colleges serve young \npeople preparing to enter the job market for the first time, dislocated \nworkers learning new skills, and people seeking to move off welfare and \nonto a career path. These schools are at the heart of efforts to \nstrengthen native American communities.\n  Tribal colleges serve more than 25,000 students nationwide. While \nmeeting with tribal college students from North Dakota earlier this \nyear, they told me how important it was for them to be able to attend \nschools near their homes, and how they planned to search for employment \nin their communities after graduation. Tribal colleges also strengthen \nIndian communities by increasing access to cultural resources, and by \npromoting the revitalization and preservation of American Indian and \nAlaska Native languages, visual and performance arts, and tribal \nhistory.\n  Last October, President Clinton signed an Executive order regarding \ntribal colleges and universities, designed to ensure that they have \nFederal resources committed to them on a continuing basis. This \nExecutive order demonstrates a recognition of the central mission of \ntribal colleges and universities: making educational opportunities \naccessible to people of all ages in Indian country. To this end, it is \nimportant that we increase the Federal resources available to the \ntribal colleges. I am a cosponsor of the Dorgan amendment to increase \nthe fiscal year 1998 appropriation for tribal colleges by $2 million, \nto the level of the administration's request, and I strongly urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted for the duration of the Interior bill to Angela \nLogomasini of Senator Brownback's staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have a series of clarifications of the \ncommittee report that have been agreed to by Senator Byrd. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record, and I submit them \nfor the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Clarifications to Committee Report\n\n       Page 23 of the report indicates that funding for the \n     aquatic nuisance species control program under the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service is increased by $500,000 over the current \n     year level. The actual increase provided is $1,000,000.\n       On page 119 of the report, the Bureau of Land Management is \n     incorrectly listed as an unauthorized program pursuant to \n     paragraph 7 of Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. \n     BLM was reauthorized through fiscal year 2002 in the 1996 \n     omnibus parks bill.\n       The last paragraph on page 9 of the report addresses \n     procedures that the Forest Service must follow in order to \n     change its regional office structure. That paragraph should \n     have included a requirement for the Forest Service to obtain \n     consent from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee.\n       On page 54, in the description of special programs and \n     pooled overhead, the total is $72,726,000. The changes from \n     the FY 1997 enacted level consist of the following:\n       an increase of $341,000 for fixed costs ($42,000 for fixed \n     costs for UTTC are reflected as part of their total);\n       an increase of $2,000,000 for employee displacement;\n       an increase of $728,000 for UTTC, which includes $42,000 \n     for fixed costs;\n       a decrease of $1,569,000 for trust services transferred to \n     the office of special trustee;\n       a decrease of $2,801,000 for internal transfers; and\n       a decrease of $46,000 for other fixed costs (consisting of \n     a decrease of $417,000 for workers compensation and an \n     increase of $371,000 for unemployment compensation).\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do want to respond to the thoughtful \nsuggestions of the Senators from North Dakota and South Dakota while \neach of them is still on the floor.\n  I reflected, as they discussed the value of higher education, in this \ncase to Indians, on the force of their argument. It certainly is \npossible that on some other elements of this bill relating to Indians \nthat we may have some disagreements. But, certainly, if we speak about \neither a doctrine of self-determination or self-sufficiency, education \nmakes a major contribution to the ability of an individual either to be \nself-determining or self-sufficient. To the extent that we can \nencourage education, greater sophistication and greater knowledge, \nobviously we ought to do so.\n  In this bill we have added $1 million to approximately a $27 million \nappropriation last year for the particular purpose to which they speak. \nThat is $2 million less than the President's request, where the total \nallocation we have is some $46 million less than the President's \nrequest. We have, however, given almost a $700,000 increase to the \nUnited Tribes Technical College in the State of the Senator from North \nDakota, which the President did not include in his budget, based \nessentially on the same philosophy that has been stated here by the two \nof them.\n  I can assure both Senators that we will see whether or not in some \nrespect or another we can accommodate what seems to be a reasonable \nrequest, understanding that we have a lot of reasonable requests in a \nlot of areas of the bill. Also, I have to state that one reservation I \nhave is to the sort of let's\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\njust cut everything else proportionately without setting values. We \nworked as hard as we could on these matters, the others of which \napplied to all citizens of the United States. The degree of deferred \nmaintenance in our national parks and national forests and other \nrecreational facilities is literally measured in the billions of \ndollars. We tried to at least begin to work on that.\n  So, if, perhaps, the focus of where we find the $2 million could be \nmore narrowly aimed, if they could discuss with their own constituents \nwhether there are other Indian programs that could absorb such a shift, \nor some other thing of that sort, it will make it easier for us.\n  But I do want to assure both of them that I have heard what they have \nto say. With their philosophy about education, I entirely agree. And to \nthe extent, in a bill where, as I said in my opening remarks, we had \n1,800 requests from Members of the Senate, very few of which this \nSenator thinks in the abstract were not justified, by any means, I will \ntry to the best of my ability to oblige. I am sure I speak for Senator \nByrd when I make that statement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield just for a comment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Because the Senator mentioned United Tribes Technical \nCollege, I wanted to say how much I appreciate what the subcommittee \ndid in that area. That is a unique institution which has been very \nsuccessful and has not had a funding increase for a long, long while. \nJust last Saturday I was at the United Tribes Technical College, where \nthey had one of the largest Indian powwows in this country. It is a \nwonderful cultural celebration, about as colorful and beautiful a \ncelebration as you will see anywhere in the country. I can tell you the \npeople at United Tribes Technical College were enormously grateful for \nwhat you have done in this appropriations bill for them. I think they \nunderstand that the increase you have provided is a recognition of \nexcellence in education, an investment in human potential. They are \nvery grateful for it. Because you mentioned that, I wanted to say how \nappreciative I was as well.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reed pertaining to the introduction of S. 1169 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1132\n\n(Purpose: To amend title 31, United States Code, to address the failure \nto appropriate sufficient funds to make full payments in lieu of taxes \n  under chapter 69 of that title by exempting certain users of White \n Mountain National Forest from fees imposed in connection with the use)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order to be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. GORTON], for Mr. Gregg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1132.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 126, line 16 insert after ``government'' the \n     following: ``that lies in whole or in part within the White \n     Mountain National Forest and is''\n       On page 126, line 19, strike ``recreational user fee'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof. ``Demonstration Program Fee (parking \n     permit or passport)''\n       On page 126, line 21-22, strike ``White Mountain National'' \n     and ``that lies, in whole or in part, within those \n     boundaries.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is an agreed-to amendment between \nSenator Byrd and myself that is presented on behalf of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. He has a special provision relating to \ncertain uses of the White Mountain National Forest that are included in \nthe bill. Technical errors were made in connection with that amendment, \nwhich added an unanticipated cost. These technical changes will cure \nthat defect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1132) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I think I can announce I know of no further business \nrelating to the Interior bill that is likely to come before the Senate \nthis afternoon. But I do ask that any Senator who may wish to speak on \nthe subject or offer an amendment on the subject report his or her \nintention to do so promptly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SANTORUM). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to en bloc, with the following exceptions: page \n46, line 15 through page 47, line 25; page 52, line 16 through page 54, \nline 22; page 55, line 11 through page 56, line 2; page 96, line 12 \nthrough page 97, line 8; page 115, lines 1 through 22; page 123, line 9 \nthrough page 124, line 20; that the bill, as amended, be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment, and that no points \nof order be waived by reason of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the greatest difficulty I had during the \nAugust break was convincing the various newpaper editors I visited \nwhile traveling the State, that the budget was not balanced. Everywhere \nI went, they said that Congress had done its job, producing the first \nbalanced budget since Lyndon Johnson's back in 1968-69. And I said that \nit was totally out of the whole cloth.\n  Mr. President, I think of Mark Twain's famous observation. He said, \n``The truth is such a precious thing, it should be used very \nsparingly.'' Unfortunately, our media friends have been caught up in \nthe politics and with the consultants in the polls and the truth goes \nunreported.\n  I stated this on the floor when we debated the conference report to \nthe budget resolution. I referred at that particular time to the report \nof Mr. Kasich from the committee of conference, submitted on June 4, \n1997.\n  On page 4, I showed where, listed under ``Deficits,'' that under \nfiscal year 2002 a deficit of $108,300,000,000 was listed. It was \nlisted with the exclusion of the Social Security surplus as required \nunder section 13:301 of the Budget Act.\n  Under that particular act that we passed in 1990, 98 Senators voted \nfor it and President George Bush signed it into law. It said that you \ncannot report in the Congress nor shall the President submit a budget \nthat includes the Social Security trust funds in the calculation of the \nbudget deficit. We got this enacted into law, and today it is totally \ndisregarded.\n  I wish I could put in a criminal penalty. We could lock up the \nCongress. But the fact of the matter is, a criminal penalty for this \nalready exists, the 1994 Pension Reform Act. This law was enacted to \nmake sure that workers, with all this merger mania, could be sure that \ntheir pension funds would remain fiscally intact and safe from \ndefraying company debt. Denny McLain, the famous Detroit pitcher, which \nthe distinguished Chair should be very familiar with--is in jail today \nbecause he violated this law. Our great pitcher, McLain, was elected \nthe chairman of a certain corporation where he used the pension fund to \npay the debts. Earlier this year, Denny McLain was sentenced to 8 years \nin prison. Now, if you can find Denny, and what cell he is in, tell him \nhe made a mistake. He should have run for the U.S. Senate instead of \ngoing into business, because instead of a prison term, what you get is \na good Government award. The constant babble over the land in by all \nthe talking heads, on the TV and the radio, is balance, balance, \nbalance.\n  Well, heavens above, this is exactly what is occurring today in the \nU.S. Senate. Even Mr. Kasich said that his submission was not a \nbalanced budget. All you have to do is read and you will see the \nincrease in the debt between the years 2001 and 2002. In 2002, instead \nof a balanced budget--you have a $173.9 billion deficit.\n  So, I went to all the different newspaper editors, and I said, Wait \nuntil the Congressional Budget Office makes their estimate. It usually \ncomes out in August but because of reconcilliation, it will come out in \nSeptember this year. They finally submitted ``The Economic and Budget \nOutlook,'' in September 1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the table on page 34 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Debt Subject to Limit\n\n       As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress \n     increased the statutory limit on federal debt from $5.5 \n     trillion to $5.95 trillion. That amount should be sufficient \n     until the summer of 2000. Even in the face of small deficits \n     and budget surpluses, though, the debt subject to limit will \n     continue to increase, thereby implying that the ceiling will \n     have to be raised in the future.\n       Debt subject to limit far exceeds debt held by the public \n     (a much more useful measure of what the government owes), \n     mainly because it includes the holdings of the Social \n     Security, Medicare, and other government trust funds. The \n     Congressional Budget Office's projections of debt subject to \n     limit through 2007 are presented below. Because the size of \n     the trust fund surplus dwarfs the projected total budget \n     surpluses after 2002, debt subject to limit continues to rise \n     throughout the projection period.\n\n                                                 BASELINE PROJECTIONS OF DEBT SUBJECT TO STATUTORY LIMIT                                                \n                                                        [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]                                                        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1997      1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebt Subject to Limit, Start of Year......     5,137     5,314     5,525     5,751     5,979     6,179     6,339     6,513     6,674     6,834     6,996\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nChanges:                                                                                                                                                \n  Deficit.................................        34        57        52        48        36       -32       -13       -29       -36       -72       -86\n  Trust fund surplus......................       112       130       153       159       143       171       168       172       179       218       178\n  Other changes \\1\\.......................        31        24        21        21        20        22        19        18        17        15        17\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total.................................       177       210       226       228       199       161       174       161       160       162       110\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nDebt Subject to Limit, End of Year........     5,314     5,525     5,751     5,979     6,179     6,339     6,513     6,674     6,834     6,996     7,106\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Primarily changes in Treasury cash balances, investments by government funds (such as the Bank Insurance Fund) that are not trust funds, and        \n  activity of the credit financing accounts.                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                        \nSource: Congressional Budget Office.                                                                                                                    \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let us cite that table.\n  Here they have what they all like to call under the euphemism, a \n``unified deficit.'' Here they just use the word ``deficit.'' They are \nvery clever because they do not want to get in controversy with that \nparticular section, 13:301. So CBO says: ``Deficit for 1997, $34 \nbillion.'' This is what everybody is crowing about. But--but--Mr. \nPresident, trust fund surpluses. You see under the moneys there, and \nother changes, other short-falls there, that there is veritably $143 \nbillion used, spent, in order to make the deficit appear to be only $34 \nbillion. The truth is, and actually listed in this document now by CBO, \nis a deficit of $177 billion for fiscal 1997. And extrapolating it out \nfor 1998, the actual deficit is $210 billion; 1999, $226 billion; the \nyear 2000, $228 billion; the year 2001, $199 billion; and the year \n2002, $161 billion.\n  There you are, Mr. President. The Congressional Budget Office has not \nestimated a balanced budget. And no one else in his right mind has \nestimated a balanced budget except for the political dissembling over \nthe land, in the editorial columns, and in the news reports, ``balance, \nbalance, balance,'' because what they've got up here this consultant \nthing to get our ``message, message, message'' out. If you say it \nenough, they will believe anything.\n  The truth is--the truth is--that we are going to expand the debt by \nover $1 trillion in the next 5 years, Mr. President. Now, let me say \nsomething about a soaring debt. When debt increases, interest increase. \nEverybody around here is saying, ``I'm cutting taxes, cutting taxes,'' \nwhen in essence they are increasing taxes. There are two kinds of \ntaxes. One tax, of course, is like a school tax, where in my home \nState, South Carolina, all the sales tax goes to the public school \nsystem, or gasoline taxes which go to highway construction. Those are \nwhat you call win taxes--you win something for paying those taxes.\n\n  The second kind of tax is the waste tax. An example of this is the \ninterest costs on the national debt. You do not win anything. It is \nabsolute waste. This goes up, up, and away to the tune now in the last \nseveral years, of at least $15 billion, and it is going up more every \nday. The actual estimated amount for this particular fiscal year which \nwill end in a couple of weeks' time, at the end of September, is $358 \nbillion. That is the CBO estimate. That is almost $1\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\nbillion a day for nothing.

Government FY 1998: Beginning in 1962 CBO's 1997 Economic and      \n  Budget Outlook.                                                                                               \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. When is this crowd going to wake up around here? The \ninterest cost was less than $75 billion when Mr. Reagan came to town \nand promised to balance the budget in 1 year. We had less than $1 \ntrillion debt. Now we have a $5.3 trillion debt--quadruple the debt \nsince that time. We are spending about $283 billion more a year today \nin interest costs than that particular day 17 years ago.\n  Now, if I had that $283 billion, I would get all the highways built, \nI would get all the research at NIH, I would put in all the money at \nHead Start. With all of these amendments, we are spending the money but \nnot getting the government. We are proving with this cut taxes, cut \ntaxes, cut taxes that we are incompetent up here.\n  Now, Mr. President, I had hoped at that particular time, since the \neconomy was going well and we have had lower deficits each year for the \nlast 5 years under President Clinton, that we would stay the course, \nnot have any tax cuts, not have any spending increases. But this hope \nwas defeated.\n  Instead, Mr. President, we passed what? We passed a $52 billion \nincrease in spending and cut the revenues $95 billion and call it \nbalanced. How can you increase spending, lower your revenues, and get \nto a balanced budget? Of course, it is obvious--you cannot. That is why \nyou have the $177 billion deficit this particular fiscal year and \ninstead of a balanced budget in the year 2002, we have a $161 billion \ndeficit.\n  Interestingly, this assumes that by the year 2000--you will have a \ndeficit of $228 billion, an almost $70 billion decrease in a 2-year \nperiod. The cuts are back-loaded. That is the smoke and mirrors.\n  Everyone is talking about balance, talking about baby boomers, \ntalking about Social Security, which is in the black and balanced. But \nwe are not paying for defense, we are not paying for education, we are \nnot paying for Senators' pay, we are not paying for Head Start, we are \nnot paying for foreign aid, we are not paying for the general \nGovernment expenses, and we come around here and we say, ``Now what we \nneed is tax cuts to buy the election next year.''\n  Mr. President, they have a big hearing going on about campaign \nfinancing. The biggest campaign finance violation is the Federal budget \nscam of a balanced budget and cutting taxes. We are\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\nusing this budget scam to reelect ourselves. This is what ought to be \ninvestigated. This is a public hearing. I hope C-SPAN is covering it. I \nhope everyone is listening right now, because this is how we buy the \nvotes. I am not worried whether I get from a PAC contribution of $1,000 \nor $2,000 The country of Japan has over 100 lawyers here, paid over \n$113 million to lobby us, the Congress. I need not tell you that this \nis significantly more than the pay of the 535 Members of Congress. I am \nnot worried about those things. What I am worried about is the campaign \nfinancing fraud scam that is going on on the floor of the national \nCongress. We're all running around here hollering, ``balance,'' and our \ngood friends, the Concord Coalition, is yelling ``entitlements, \nentitlements.'' They have not yet faced the reality.\n  My friend, David Broder, says I have gotten to be a nuisance on this \nsubject. I wonder why the truth has become a nuisance in Washington?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9193-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9195-S9196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION SPENDING BILL FOR FY98\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate today \ncontains several education and health provisions that I feel are \nespecially important and have worked hard on to help improve the lives \nof people in New Mexico and nationwide.\n  The key health and education provisions include a plan to move \ncontrol over the proposed new math and reading tests to an independent \nboard, increased funding for education technology and technology \ntraining for teachers, first-time funding to help low-income students \nparticipate in the rigorous and cost saving academic program known as \nAdvanced Placement, and funding for a Boarder Health Commission that I \nhelped enact in 1994.\n  It is especially important to note that the United States Senate \ntoday approved $1 million in funding to implement the United States-\nMexico Border Health Commission. The Commission, which has long been \none of my priorities, is designed to help improve public health along \nthe United States-Mexico border. I requested that the funds be included \nin the 1998 spending bill in a letter to Senate appropriators earlier \nin the year.\n  I led the fight to fund the Commission because I believe that we \ncan't wait any longer to begin addressing the serious health problems \nalong the border. They greatly affect people in nearby communities and \nin New Mexico. What's alarming is that many of these health problems--\nsuch as malaria and tuberculosis--can affect people nationwide. This \nappropriation represents the first time Federal funds have been \nearmarked specifically for implementation of the commission.\n  The funds would go to the commission to begin a comprehensive border \nhealth needs assessment followed by a coordinated medical response to \nborder health problems. Each United States-border State would receive \ntwo federally appointed commissioners who would work with Mexico to \ndesign and coordinate programs to improve health, water resources, \nsewage treatment, vector control and air quality along the border. \nBecause of the Senate's move today, we are inching closer to being able \nto directing medical help to our ailing border region.\n  The Senate has also now approved funding for several key education \ninitiatives that have been some of my top priorities in this Congress.\n  Perhaps most notable is that the Senate approved $30 million to train \nteachers in the use of technology in the classroom. The funding will be \nused to implement the Technology for Teachers Act, new legislation that \nI authored earlier this year.\n  There is a tremendous effort underway to put computers in classrooms \nand hook schools across American into the Internet. But until now, the \nprimary focus has been on obtaining equipment--not on training teachers \nto use it. We can't simply install a computer in the classroom and \nexpect it to revolutionize education all by itself. These new resources \nrepresent the first time Federal funds have been set aside specifically \nfor training new and current teachers in the use of education \ntechnology.\n  As a founding member of the Senate Education Technology Workforce, I \nam also proud that the Senate voted to double the funding for the \nTechnology Literacy Challenge Fund, created by my 1994 Technology for \nEducation Act. The fund would jump to $425 million in 1998 from $200 \nmillion in 1997. New Mexico's State Department of Education this year \nreceived $1.7 million from the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, and \nawarded grants to 26 communities across the State. The 1998 funding \nwould boost New Mexico's share to $3.55 million.\n  And finally, the Senate also approved $3 million in funding to \nincrease the number of low-income students who participate in the \nrigorous Advanced Placement [AP] program in schools in New Mexico and \nacross the country. I secured this funding in the 1998 Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill in order to broaden the reach of AP classes to all \nstudents--not just to those who attend more affluent schools or have \ndefinite plans to attend college. By promoting AP, we're promoting \nhigh-standards education in our schools without creating new Federal \nprograms.\n  These are just a few of the most important elements of a bill that on \nthe whole is very strong, I believe. However, I must note one part of \nthe legislation that we are sending into conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, which is the Gorton amendment.\n  As part of this spending bill, the Senate narrowly approved--49 to \n51--an amendment by Senator Gorton that would convert billions of \ndollars in critical Federal education dollars into unrestricted block \ngrants that school districts could spend with few restrictions and \nlittle accountability. For reasons I would like to describe here, I \nstrongly oppose the amendment and will push for its elimination from \nthe final version of the 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations measure.\n  In essence, this amendment would eliminate much of the U.S. \nDepartment of Education--a radical and misguided effort that I had \nthought was abandoned in the face of tremendous public opposition over \nthe last few years.\n  Specifically, this amendment block grants to local districts--not \nstates--roughly $5.5 billion in annual funding for Federal education \nprograms. The eliminated programs would include:\n  Funding for the new voluntary national tests for reading and math, \nwhich would help so many parents keep their schools accountable for \npreparing their students for a high-tech world;\n  Title 1, the roughly $7 billion program to help poor children improve \ntheir reading and math skills in the early grades;\n  The $425 million Technology for Education Act, which is already \nproviding $1.7 million in education technology funding to 26 grantees \naround the state, and would rise to $3.5 million next year;\n  The $50 million Charter Schools program, which helps foster the \ncreation of more new, independent public schools like the five that are \nup and running in New Mexico;\n  Goals 2000, which has provided millions of dollars to New Mexico as \npart of its effort to raise academic standards and achievement;\n  The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which has given both local and \nstatewide implementation grants to help improve training for students \ngoing straight into the workforce from high school;\n  Safe and Drug Free Schools, a program that sends Federal funds to the \nStates and schools most affected by school violence in order to make \nthem more orderly;\n  Teacher training funds called the Eisenhower program that are used in \nNew Mexico to help upgrade the preparation of teachers in our \nclassrooms; and\n  Bilingual and immigrant education programs, which also provide much-\nneeded support for communities with large numbers of limited English \nproficient students.\n  In effect, this would create an unmonitored windfall for school \ndistricts that could be used for nearly any purpose--conceivably even \nraising administrative salaries, or building swimming pools and tennis \ncourts. There would be no oversight or accountability--in fact, all of \nthe limits on administrative costs and accountability measures that \nrely on State oversight and are already in Federal law would be \neliminated by the amendment.\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\n  The Gorton amendment would also fully by-pass State education \nagencies that in New Mexico help coordinate and monitor programs. Some \npeople think block-granting education funds might give local school \ndistricts more control or more funding. The reality is that if we block \ngrant these programs and bypass the our entire State education network, \nwe actually put a huge administrative burden on school districts that \nvery few will be able to handle. And in fact, only about 6 percent of \nFederal funding is taken off the top by States for administrative and \ntechnical assistance. It simply isn't cost-efficient for small \ndistricts to provide the specialized training or diverse course \nofferings that can be provided economically at a state and regional \nlevel.\n  It's also entirely unclear how New Mexico would fare under such an \narrangement--there is no real way of telling from the amendment, which \nproposes an entirely untried approach that has never really been \ndebated before. Funding levels would basically be determined by having \neach individual district conduct a self-reported census on its own of \nall the school-aged children in the district, and then weighting each \ndistrict's funding according to each State's average per capita income \nlevel. However it's not too hard to guess that we won't do nearly as \nwell as some may think, since current formulas already awarding money \ndirectly to districts based on individual community need would be \nscrapped--and many communities would be left to fend for themselves.\n  For these reasons, it is my hope that this ill-conceived amendment \nwill be dropped in conference, and left out of the final bill that is \nmade into law. If necessary, I would likely join my colleague Senator \nDodd in filibustering the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill if the \nGorton amendment is kept in the final version.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9195-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CRISIS IN SIERRA LEONE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to light recent \nevents in Sierra Leone. This has been a challenging year for democracy \non the African Continent, and no where has it been more seriously \nchallenged than in this West African nation. On May 25, 1997, mutinous \nsoldiers overthrew the democratically-elected government of President \nAhmad Tejan Kabbah. Lawlessness reigns throughout the country, as jail \ndoors throughout Sierra Leone have been thrown wide, and judges and \nlawyers who once worked to ensure the rule of law have been forced to \nflee the country for their lives.\n  Ironically, it was only a year and a half ago that Sierra Leone held \nits first multiparty elections in 30 years, resulting in the transfer \nof power from the military to the civilian government of President \nKabbah. With the conclusion of Sierra Leone's 5-year civil war last \nNovember, Sierra Leone was hailed by many in Africa and the West as a \nmodel for other African nations. The bloody military coup d'etat that \nousted President Kabbah almost 4 months ago is not only an affront to \nthe expressed will of the people of Sierra Leone, but is a direct \nchallenge to the cause of democracy in Africa. I strongly condemn this \ndeplorable action, and call upon the military to return power to the \ndemocratically-elected government.\n  Now, as a result of the spring coup, the Sierra Leone is largely \nisolated from the world. Foreign embassies have closed their doors. \nForeign aid has been suspended. There is virtually no humanitarian \nassistance to speak of left in Sierra Leone. Every day that the \nmilitary junta remains in power more men, women and children needlessly \nfall victim to senseless violence.\n  Meanwhile, the military junta continues its rapacious looting of the \ncountry, oblivious to the dire consequences of its actions. Freetown, \nthe capital city, without electricity, sits in darkness. Schools are \nclosed. Most doctors have fled the country and hospitals have been \nlooted. Those who have not already fled the country face both a \ndwindling food supply and the military leaders' seemingly abject \ndisregard for human life.\n  Mr. President, Sierra Leone's West African neighbors have \ncourageously taken the lead in responding to this humanitarian crisis. \nUpon the outbreak of the coup, regional leaders quickly condemned the \ncoup and imposed regional sanctions. At a recent meeting of West \nAfrican heads of state those who called for the use of force to end the \nstandoff were resisted, and it was resolved to strengthen the sanctions \nregime already in place.\n  I strongly commend this decision. Although attempts at negotiation \nwith the junta in July were unsuccessful, I strongly believe that the \nsuccessful road to peace and stability in Sierra Leone leads to the \nnegotiating table instead of the battlefield. Sanctions must be given \nmore time to pressure the military junta to give up its quixotic lust \nfor power.\n  While the United States was among the first to condemn the coup, I \nurge our Government to continue to seek every opportunity to publicly \nsupport democracy in Sierra Leone. Those who would subvert the will of \nthe people in Sierra Leone should have no illusion about the United \nStates position.\n  The United Nations has already added its voice to international \ncondemnation of the military junta in Freetown. Moreover, the \nSecretary-General has just appointed a special envoy to Sierra Leone in \nan attempt to resolve the crisis. I applaud these efforts. I urge the \nadministration to use its influence at the United Nations to initiate a \nmultilateral effort to severely restrict the military junta's ability \nto purchase arms and fuel. At the same time, I believe it is necessary \nto try to find a way to address the humanitarian needs of the innocent.\n  Mr. President, these are very troubled days for democracy in Africa. \nAlthough democracy is beginning to blossom in other parts of the world \nsince the end of the cold war, it has yet to firmly take root in the \nfertile soil of many African nations.\n  Mr. President, as the rest of the world moves toward integration into \nthe global economy, embracing democracy and liberal economic \nprinciples, we must not leave Africa behind. It is imperative that we \nwho have fought for our own freedom, and who enjoy the fruits that \ndemocracy offer, continue to support others in their fight for the \nsame. I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9196-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  MR.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act with respect to penalties \nfor powder cocaine and crack offenses; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       the powder-crack cocaine penalty equalization act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most \nlongstanding and racially sensitive disputes in the criminal justice \nsystem. I am introducing legislation to equalize the criminal penalties \nfor offenses involving crack and powder cocaine.\n  Under current law, a seller of 5 grams of crack cocaine receives the \nsame mandatory 5-year prison term as a seller of 500 grams of powder \ncocaine.\n  That disparity between penalties has been scrutinized by the U.S. \nSentencing Commission, Congress, and the Clinton administration for the \nlast several years. Although many solutions have called for narrowing \nthe gap in penalties, these recommendations don't go far enough. \nInstead of equalizing the penalties, they only narrow the disparity in \nsentencing for powder versus crack cocaine by altering the ratio from 5 \nto 1 instead of the current 100 to 1.\n  Additional recommendations have called for lessening the penalty for \ncrack dealers, bringing it closer to the lax penalties applied to \npowder offenders.\n  My legislation rejects the hollow solution of lowering the penalty \nfor crack to make it equal to powder cocaine penalties. The fact is \nthat 90 percent of those convicted of dealing crack are African-\nAmericans, while the majority of powder cocaine offenders are white.\n  Raising the powder cocaine penalties to that of crack will help \nalleviate the perception of unfairness and racial bias in sentencing. \nBut reducing the penalties for crack cocaine would only increase \nviolent crime and harm those which the law is seeking to help.\n  Statistics remind us that cocaine addiction continues to plague our \nsociety. According to the Partnership for a Drug Free America, 1 out of \nevery 10 babies born in the United States is born addicted to drugs, \nand most are addicted to crack cocaine. Crime exploded between 1985 and \n1990, the years crack was introduced. In fact, violent crime went up 37 \npercent in 1990 and aggravated assaults increased 43 percent. Partly \nbecause of crack cocaine, more teens in this country now die of gunshot \nwounds than all natural causes combined. Lowering sentences on crack \ncocaine would be devastating to the progress we have made in fighting \nthe drug war.\n  During the 1980's, Congress legislated steep consequences for crack \ncocaine.\n  The crack epidemic spread across our Nation--and it warranted several \ndrastic legal reforms. We saw the destruction wrought on entire \ncommunities by this cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine and \nrealized that tough penalties were needed to restrict its availability.\n  These tougher sentences were needed, but the problem we are seeing \ntoday is that powder cocaine sentences were set before the crack \nepidemic began and do not reflect the influence powder has had on crime \nand drug trafficking.\n  This bill provides a twofold solution: It corrects the inequality in \npenalties which has contributed to the perceived race bias in \nsentencing; while at the same time stiffening the penalty for powder \ncocaine offenses, which are currently far too lenient.\n  In light of the numerous proposals introduced to correct this \nproblem, I encourage my colleagues to contemplate the alternatives and \nconsider how justice is served in this matter. Maintaining the current \nratio is allowing a wrongful disparity in penalties to continue. \nCongress must act now to correct this injustice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BRYAN:\n  S. 1163. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit the \ndistribution of any negotiable check or other instrument with any \nsolicitation to a consumer by a creditor to open an account under any \nconsumer credit plan or to engage in any other credit transaction which \nis subject to that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the unsolicited loan consumer protection act\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill protect consumers from a new, egregious banking practice that \ngives new meaning to the old expression, ``The check's in the mail.''\n  This practice involves financial institutions sending unsolicited \nchecks to consumers, some of whom have no prior relationship with the \nfinancial institution at all. These checks in fact obligate the \nrecipient to a loan with interest rates as high as 25 percent.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to a format that is frequently \nused. This check is sent in a window envelope in which the recipient \nsees his or her name, opens it up and believes that indeed a check has \nbeen sent to him or to her.\n  What may at first appear to be pennies from Heaven is in reality a \nloan backed by exorbitant interest rates and punitive loan terms, but \nthese details are only found in the fine print often on the back of the \ncheck.\n  While only a few banks are engaged in this practice, it is \nnevertheless a growing practice and needs to be stopped before it gets \ncompletely out of hand. For example, one bank has booked $1 billion of \nthese unsolicited loans in a period of 18 months.\n  At a time when personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high --many \nattribute that to easy credit-card debt--the practice in which \nconsumers are enticed into taking a loan that they really have not \nsought should concern all Americans.\n  I fear for the long-term consequence of these loans should the \neconomy take a sudden downturn and these loans are left in default.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is loans should only be issued when \nan application has been made and approved, with the consumer fully \nunderstanding the terms of the loan. In the case of these loans, all \nthe pertinent information consumers need to know about\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nfees, charges, interest rates is in microscopic print and most \nfrequently on the back of the check itself.\n  Mr. President, banks are trying the patience of the American consumer \nwith their ever increasing use of fees and questionable market \npractices.\n  My State of Nevada has gone through a series of bank mergers that \nhave left customers frustrated and confused. Service has been \ndowngraded, accounts lost and fees increased. According to one report, \nthe number of types of fees charged by banks increased from 96 to 250 \nwhile the banking industry itself continues to earn record profits--\nsurpassing $50 billion.\n  These unsolicited checks are setting rates right up against the usury \nceilings with some carrying rates as high as 25 percent. Adding insult \nto injury, these checks are targeted to people who can least afford to \npay these exorbitant rates but are easily tempted by the lure of easy \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Congressmen Hinchey and Gonzalez in \nthe House for raising this issue. I look forward to the Banking \nCommittee holding hearings on this important legislation. The \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee has indicated that it is his \nintention to hold hearings on this issue. I look forward to processing \nthis legislation as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Mack, \n        and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1164. A bill to state a policy of the United States that engages \nthe People's Republic of China in areas of mutual interest, promotes \nhuman rights, religious freedom, and democracy in China, and enhances \nthe national security interests of the United States with respect to \nChina, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                        CHINA POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the China \nPolicy Act of 1997. Cosponsors of this legislation include Senators \nFeingold, Hutchinson, Coverdell, DeWine, Ashcroft, Brownback, Mack, and \nHelms.\n  Now is the time, Mr. President, to take a closer look at our \nrelations with the People's Republic of China. Preparations are \nunderway for the October 28 state visit of Chinese President Jiang \nZemin. The President will be feted, toasted, and praised. Meanwhile, \nWei Jingsheng rots in a Beijing prison, serving out a 14-year sentence \nfor the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and other political \nreforms.\n  This contrast, in my view, points up the current crisis in United \nStates-China relations. For too long now, this administration has put \nprocess over substance, holding repeated meetings and discussions with \nChinese leaders, but failing to set and hold to a concrete agenda \naddressing critical issues of human rights and religious freedom, as \nwell as nuclear and other weapons proliferation.\n  There is much of substance to work out with Chinese leaders, Mr. \nPresident. To begin with, China's record of human rights abuses and \nrepression of religious faith is long and disturbing. Women pregnant \nwith their second or third child have been coerced into abortions. \nPeaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been \nsentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, \ntortured, and denied needed medical care. Religious meeting places have \nbeen forcibly closed. Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious \nleader, the Dalai Lama, have been forced from their monasteries; some \nof their leaders have disappeared.\n  President Clinton knows full well about these abuses. His own State \nDepartment just released a report on human rights in China which states \nthat in 1996 ``The Government continued to commit widespread and well-\ndocumented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally \naccepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \nfear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic \nfreedoms.'' America cannot allow these abuses of fundamental human \nrights to continue unopposed.\n  Our own national security also demands that we take a firmer, more \nsubstantive stance in our dealings with China. Although China signed \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and agreed to abide by the terms \nof the missile technology control regime in 1992, violations of both \nagreements continue. Especially worrisome are Chinese sales of weapons \ntechnology to Pakistan, Iran, and other countries in the Middle East.\n  Chinese weapons exports also have more directly threatened Americans \nhere on United States soil. Companies associated with the People's \nLiberation Army [PLA] have been caught attempting to sell smuggled \nassault weapons to street gangs in Los Angeles.\n  Mr. President, I am not advocating any rash response to these \nprovocations. China is an important nation with the potential to take \npart in mutually beneficial commerce and diplomatic cooperation, or \ndestabilize a number of important strategic areas. In my view our \ndisagreements with China call for development of incentives and \ndisincentives designed to steer that country toward internal \nliberalization and constructive participation in the international \ncommunity.\n  Up until now, debates over American policy toward China have focused \nalmost exclusively on the annual extension of that country's most-\nfavored-nation trading status [MFN]. Both sides in this debate have \nhighlighted legitimate issues calling for reasoned argument. But, now \nthat Congress has renewed MFN, it is imperative that we address broader \nUnited States-China relations, lest China policy be relegated to the \nback pages for another year.\n  I firmly believe, Mr. President, that Congress and the President can \nput United States-Chinese relations on a course toward substantive \nprogress by taking concrete action now. That is why I am introducing \nthe China Policy Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to \ndiscourage the Chinese regime from oppressive internal policies and \ndestabilizing actions contrary to United States national security, \nwhile advancing American values of freedom and human rights among the \nChinese people. It represents a consensus view reached among proponents \non both sides of the MFN question. It combines provisions of China-\nrelated bills and amendments authored by myself and Senators Feingold, \nAshcroft, DeWine, Coverdell, and Brownback. I would like to extend \nspecial thanks to Senator Feingold for strengthening the human rights \nfocus of the bill.\n  This legislation includes a number of sanctions aimed at Chinese \nleaders intended to express our dismay at recent human rights abuses. \nFirst, the bill would deny American visas to high ranking Chinese \nGovernment officials involved in political and religious persecution. \nThe bill also would require United States representatives at \nmultilateral development banks to vote ``no'' on all loans to China, \nexcept those related to famine, national disaster relief, and \nenvironmental protection. This last provision also puts into practice \nthe important principle that United States taxpayers should not be \nforced to subsidize the Chinese Government.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the bill would institute targeted \nsanctions against PLA companies found to have engaged in weapons \nproliferation, illegal importation of weapons to the United States or \nmilitary or political espionage in the United States. The U.S. \nGovernment also would publish a list of other PLA-controlled companies. \nThis would allow American companies and consumers to decide whether \nthey wish to purchase products manufactured in whole or in part by the \nCommunist Chinese army. The bill also takes direct aim at China's use \nof slave labor by instituting stricter enforcement of the ban against \nsale of Chinese products produced in prison labor camps.\n  These sanctions, specifically aimed at government officials and the \nChinese Governmental apparatus, will show our determination to stand up \nand defend human rights and religious freedom.\n  This legislation also would tighten United States export licensing \nrequirements for supercomputers sold to China. This will impede Chinese \nweapons development and proliferation.\n  In addition to its sanctions, the bill includes provisions to \nencourage internal reforms and cultural exchanges between our two \ncountries. It would increase funding for international broadcasting to \nChina, including Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. I also\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\nwould increase funding for National Endowment for Democracy and U.S. \nInformation Agency student, cultural, and legislative exchange \nprograms.\n  These concrete actions would make clear to the Chinese leadership \nthat there is a price to be paid for human rights abuses and for \nirresponsible weapons proliferation. They also would encourage greater \nopenness in that country, without penalizing the Chinese people for the \nactions of their Government. They would provide the basis for \nsubstantive negotiations and a productive relationship with China.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will adopt these measures, and that \nthe President will seize the opportunity to set our policy on a new, \nmore productive course.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and the full \ntext of the China Policy Act of 1997 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS ON HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE PEOPLE'S \n                   REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding human \n     rights abuses in the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     Department of State regarding human rights in the People's \n     Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``Abuses include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, \n     forced confessions, and arbitrary and incommunicado \n     detention''.\n       (D) ``Prison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``Although the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state' and for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``Non-approved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``Serious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia [, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``Overall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) People's Republic of China authorities continue to hold \n     Wei Jingsheng in prison for his prodemocracy beliefs, and he \n     is suffering in prison from a lack of medical attention and \n     beatings by fellow prisoners.\n       (3) On October 30, 1996, a People's Republic of China court \n     sentenced Wang Dan to 11 years in prison primarily for \n     articles published outside the People's Republic of China, \n     and People's Republic of China authorities are not providing \n     him with adequate medical care.\n       (4) In addition to Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, hundreds, if \n     not thousands, of other political, religious, and labor \n     dissidents are imprisoned in China for peacefully expressing \n     their beliefs and exercising their internationally recognized \n     rights of free association and expression.\n       (5) Labor activist Liu Nianchun, severely ill in a labor \n     camp, has not only been denied medical treatment but has been \n     tortured with electric batons and has had his 3 year \n     reeducation-through-labor sentence in prison arbitrarily \n     extended by 216 days.\n       (6) Li Hai was charged with prying into and gathering state \n     secrets and subsequently sentenced to a 9-year term in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for going door-to-door to collect the \n     names, ages, family situations, alleged crimes, lengths of \n     prison sentences, locations of imprisonment, and treatment \n     while imprisoned of people sentenced to prison for their \n     activities during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\n       (7) Gao Yu, serving a 6-year term in prison on charges of \n     ``leaking state secrets'' despite the fact that the \n     information in question was already common knowledge, has \n     been denied medical parole and adequate medical care despite \n     life threatening illness and was vilified by People's \n     Republic of China authorities after she was awarded the \n     UNESCO Guillemo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.\n       (8) People's Republic of China companies still export \n     prison labor products to the United States. Since 1991, the \n     United States Customs Service has issued 27 detention orders \n     banning the importation of goods suspected to be products of \n     prison labor in China, including hand tools, artificial \n     flowers, Christmas tree lights, and diesel engines.\n       (9) The People's Republic of China has not fully complied \n     with the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding on Prison Labor, \n     and People's Republic of China authorities often wait several \n     years before granting requests by United States Customs \n     Service officials to inspect prison facilities in China. In \n     1996, such authorities granted just one of eight outstanding \n     requests by such officials to inspect prison facilities in \n     China.\n       (10) Under current law, People's Republic of China \n     authorities may administratively sentence China citizens to 3 \n     years of labor reform without trial.\n       (11) The People's Republic of China restricts the access of \n     its citizens to the Internet and blocks web sites operated by \n     foreign news organizations and human rights organizations.\n       (12) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     prohibits independent labor unions, and workers who attempt \n     to form unions without state approval are given severe prison \n     sentences as shown in the treatment of Zhang Jingsheng, a \n     labor leader in Hunan province who was arrested following the \n     1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and sentenced to 13 years in \n     prison for organizing workers.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE PEOPLE'S \n                   REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding religious \n     freedom in the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     restricts the ability of religious adherents, including \n     Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and others, to practice \n     outside of state-approved religious organizations, and\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n     detains worshipers and clergy who participate in religious \n     services conducted outside state-approved religious \n     organizations, as well as those who refuse to register with \n     the authorities as required.\n       (2) Bishop Zeng Jingmu, 76 years old, detained for the \n     third time in 7 months and in poor health from pneumonia, is \n     serving a reeducation through labor term for organizing \n     religious assemblies and masses not sanctioned by the \n     official Chinese Catholic Church.\n       (3) On January 31, 1994, Premier Li Peng signed decrees \n     number 144 and 145 which restrict worship, religious \n     education, distribution of Bibles and others religious \n     literature, and contact with foreign coreligionists.\n       (4) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     created official religious organizations that control all \n     religious worship, activity, and association in China and \n     Tibet and supplant the independent authority of the Roman \n     Catholic Church, independent Protestant churches, and \n     independent Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic associations.\n       (5) In July 1995, Ye Xiaowen, a rigid communist hostile to \n     religion, was appointed to head the Bureau of Religious \n     Affairs, a government agency of the People's Republic of \n     China that is controlled by the United Front Work Department \n     of the Chinese Communist Party. The Bureau of Religious \n     Affairs has administrative control over all religious worship \n     and activity in China and Tibet through a system of granting \n     or denying rights through an official registration system. \n     Those who fail to or are not allowed to register are subject \n     to punitive measures.\n       (6) Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were \n     targeted by the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at forcing all churches \n     to register or face dissolution resulted in beating and \n     harassment of congregants, closure of churches, and numerous \n     arrests, fines, and sentences. In Shanghai, for example, more \n     than 300 house churches or meeting points were closed down by \n     the security authorities in April alone.\n\n     SEC. 203. FINDINGS ON TIBET.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding Tibet:\n       (1) The Department of State China Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices for 1996 states: ``Chinese government \n     authorities continued to commit widespread human rights \n     abuses in Tibet, including instances of death in detention, \n     torture, arbitrary arrest, detention without public trial, \n     long detention of Tibetan nationalists for peacefully \n     expressing their religious and political views, and \n     intensified controls on religion and on freedom of speech and \n     the press, particularly for ethnic Tibetans.''.\n       (2) The report also cites three instances in which Tibetan \n     Buddhist monks died in prison in the People's Republic of \n     China in 1996.\n       (3) Many victims of the brutality committed by the People's \n     Armed Police and the Public Security Bureau of the People's \n     Republic of China have been young Tibetan Buddhist nuns and \n     monks.\n       (4) Between June 1994 and May 1995, three Tibetan nuns--15-\n     year-old Sherab Ngawang, 24-year-old Gyaltsen Kelsang, and \n     20-year-old Phuntsok Yangkyi--died as a result of torture in \n     prison in Tibet.\n       (5) On March 11, 1997, the Senate adopted a resolution \n     calling for the release by the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China of Tibetan ethnomusicologist and Fulbright \n     Scholar Ngawang Choephel, who was sentenced to 18 years in \n     prison in the People's Republic of China in December 1996, \n     and of other Tibetans who are prisoners in the People's \n     Republic of China for reasons of conscience.\n       (6) In May 1995, authorities of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China detained Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, \n     then 6 years old, and his parents, just days after the boy \n     was recognized by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama, \n     and authorities of that government continue to hold him and \n     his family.\n       (7) In May 1997, the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China announced the sentencing of Chadrel Rinpoche, the head \n     of the search committee for the 11th Panchen Lama, to 6 years \n     in prison.\n       (8) In April 1996, authorities of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China banned the display of photographs \n     of the Dalai Lama, even in private homes, and the decision \n     led to demonstrations in Ganden monastery during which 90 \n     monks were arrested and 1 monk was shot to death by security \n     forces of that government.\n\n     SEC. 204. FINDINGS ON COERCIVE FAMILY PLANNING PRACTICES IN \n                   THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding family \n     planning practices in the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) For more than 15 years there have been frequent and \n     credible reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization \n     in connection with the coercive population control practices \n     of the People's Republic of China.\n       (2) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (3) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program \n     of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the \n     policy of that government seems to encourage both forced \n     abortion and forced sterilization through a combination of \n     strictly enforced birth quotas and impunity for local \n     population control officials who engage in coercion. \n     Officials acknowledge that there have been instances of \n     forced abortions and sterilization, yet there is no evidence \n     that the perpetrators of such acts have been punished.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, monitor women's menstrual cycles and subject women \n     who conceive without government authorization to extreme \n     psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions \n     (including unpayable fines and loss of employment), and to \n     physical force.\n       (5) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families who cannot pay the fine have had their homes and \n     personal property confiscated and destroyed.\n       (6) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance to such policies is motivated by \n     religion. For example, according to a 1995 Amnesty \n     International report, the Catholic inhabitants of two \n     villages in Hebei Province were subjected to population \n     control under the slogan ``better to have more graves than \n     one more child''. Enforcement measures included torture, \n     sexual abuse, and the detention of resisters' relatives as \n     hostages.\n       (7) Forced abortions in the People's Republic of China \n     often take place in the very late stages of pregnancy, or \n     even during the process of birth itself.\n\n     SEC. 205.

Joint \n     Declaration will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong \n     Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic \n     of China, by the National People's Congress of the People's \n     Republic of China, and they will remain unchanged for 50 \n     years''.\n       (4) The Basic Law prescribes the systems to be practiced in \n     the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the \n     resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People's \n     Republic of China.\n       (5) According to Article 2 of the Basic Law: ``The National \n     People's Congress authorizes the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region to exercise a high degree of autonomy \n     and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial \n     power, including that of final adjudication''.\n       (6) According to Article 5 of the Basic Law: ``The \n     socialist system and policies (of the People's Republic of \n     China) shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and \n     way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years''.\n       (7) According to Article 27 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong \n     residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and \n     publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of \n     procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to \n     form and join trade unions, and to strike''.\n       (8) According to Article 32 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong \n     residents shall have freedom of religious belief and freedom \n     to preach and to conduct and participate in religious \n     activities in public''.\n       (9) According to Article 34 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong \n     residents shall have freedom to engage in academic research, \n     literary and artistic creation, and other cultural \n     activities''.\n       (10) According to Article 39 of the Basic Law: ``The \n     provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, \n     Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour \n     conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and \n     shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region''.\n       (11) President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of \n     China, in his statement of July 1, 1997, at the ceremony in \n     Hong Kong marking the establishment of the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region, said that ``. . . Hong Kong will enjoy \n     a high degree of autonomy as provided for by the Basic Law, \n     which includes the executive, legislative and independent \n     judicial power, including that of final adjudication''.\n       (12) President Jiang further said that the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region has the ``ultimate aim of \n     electing the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council by \n     universal suffrage''.\n       (13) President Jiang further said that ``[n]o central \n     department or locality (of the People's Republic of China) \n     may or will be allowed to interfere in the affairs which, \n     under the Basic Law, should be administered by the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region on its own''.\n       (14) President Jiang further said that ``the provisions of \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \n     International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n     Rights, and international covenants as applied to Hong Kong \n     shall remain in force to be implemented through the laws of \n     Hong Kong's regional legislation''.\n       (15) President Jiang further said that adherence to these \n     principles ``serves Hong Kong, serves the (People's Republic \n     of China) and serves the entire nation as well. Therefore \n     there is no reason whatsoever to change them. Here I want to \n     reaffirm that `one country, two systems, Hong Kong \n     administering Hong Kong' and `a high degree of autonomy' will \n     remain unchanged for 50 years''.\n       (16) President Jiang, in another statement of July 1, 1997, \n     at a rally in Beijing marking the establishment of the Hong \n     Kong Special Administrative Region, said that the People's \n     Republic of China ``will unswervingly carry out the \n     principles of `one country, two systems', `Hong Kong people \n     administering Hong Kong' and `high degree of autonomy', and \n     make sure that the previous socio-economic system and way of \n     life of Hong Kong remain unchanged and that laws previously \n     in force will remain basically unchanged. We will firmly \n     support the Hong Kong SAR in its exercise of the functions \n     and powers bestowed on it by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong \n     SAR Government in its administration in accordance with \n     law.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the statements of President Jiang Zemin of the People's \n     Republic of China constitute a welcome reaffirmation of the \n     obligations of the People's Republic of China under the Joint \n     Declaration to ensure that Hong Kong remains autonomous, the \n     human rights of the people of Hong Kong remain protected, and \n     the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \n     is elected democratically; and\n       (2) the fulfillment by the People's Republic of China of \n     the obligations under the terms of the Joint Declaration and \n     the Basic Law constitutes a crucial test of Beijing's ability \n     to play a responsible global role.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Basic Law.--The term ``Basic Law'' means the Basic Law \n     of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the \n     People's Republic of China, as adopted on April 4, 1990, by \n     the Seventh National People's Congress of the People's \n     Republic of China.\n       (2) Joint declaration.--The term ``Joint Declaration'' \n     means the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United \n     Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question \n     of Hong Kong, done at Beijing on December 19, 1984.\n                  TITLE III--NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 301. FINDINGS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF BALLISTIC MISSILES \n                   BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding the \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles by the People's Republic \n     of China:\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\n       (1) In December 1992, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and \n     the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by \n     the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of approximately 24 M-11 \n     missiles to Sargodha Air Force Base in Pakistan.\n       (2) From September 1994 to June 1996, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China again violated the Arms Export \n     Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with \n     the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of as many \n     as 30 M-11 ballistic missiles to Sargodha Air Force Base.\n       (3) In June 1995, the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Chinese \n     Aerospace Corporation to Iran of possibly hundreds of missile \n     guidance systems and computerized machine tools for the \n     production of ballistic missiles.\n       (4) In August 1996, the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer to Pakistan of \n     factory plans and equipment capable of constructing a \n     ballistic missile factory.\n       (5) In August 1996, the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\n     Proliferation Act of 1992 with the transfer by the China \n     Precision Engineering Institute to Iran's Defense Industries \n     of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for the \n     construction and test of ballistic missile guidance systems.\n       (6) It has been reported that the Central Intelligence \n     Agency discovered a shipment by the People's Republic of \n     China to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, a \n     Syria Government agency that oversees missile development, of \n     guidance equipment for M-11 ballistic missiles. This alleged \n     shipment would be a violation of the Missile Technology \n     Control Regime. This alleged shipment would have taken place \n     after the limited sanctions imposed by the United States on \n     the People's Republic of China for shipments of M-11 missiles \n     and components to Pakistan had been lifted following the \n     assurances of the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China that it would comply with the Missile Technology \n     Control Regime.\n       (7) After each of these violations, the President either \n     failed to take appropriate actions to deter future violations \n     of such Acts and the Regime, took the least onerous action \n     against the Government of the People's Republic of China that \n     was possible under such Acts and the Regime, or rescinded \n     previous actions thereby diluting or eliminating the \n     deterrent effect of sanctions under such Acts and the Regime \n     with respect to the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China.\n       (8) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative \n     action in the bilateral relations between the United States \n     and the People's Republic of China in order to respond \n     sufficiently to these violations of United States law.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS \n                   DESTRUCTION BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by the People's \n     Republic of China:\n       (1) In January 1996, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the \n     Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and the Export-\n     Import Bank Act of 1945 with the transfer by the China \n     Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation to the Abdul Qadeer Khan \n     Research Laboratory in Kahuta, Pakistan, of as many as 5,000 \n     ring-magnets for the extraction of enriched uranium for the \n     potential use in nuclear weapons.\n       (2) In September 1996, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Nuclear \n     Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with the transfer by the \n     China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation to a nuclear \n     reactor facility in Khushab, Pakistan, of an industrial \n     furnace and special diagnostic equipment capable of \n     converting plutonium and uranium to weapons grade material.\n       (3) In March 1996, the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979, the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\n     Proliferation Act of 1992, and Executive Order 12938 with the \n     transfer by the Jiangsu Corporation to Iran organizations \n     affiliated with the Iranian Defense Industries Organization \n     and the Revolutionary Guards of virtually complete chemical \n     weapons production facilities.\n       (4) After each of these violations, the President either \n     failed to take any action to deter future violations of such \n     Acts or took such trifling action as to have no meaning or \n     effect on the future proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction by the People's Republic of China.\n       (5) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative \n     action in the bilateral relations between the People's \n     Republic of China and the United States in order to respond \n     sufficiently to these violations of United States law.\n\n     SEC. 303. FINDINGS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF DESTABILIZING \n                   ADVANCED CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS BY THE PEOPLE'S \n                   REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding the \n     proliferation of destabilizing advanced conventional weapons \n     by the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) In January 1996, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China violated the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\n     Proliferation Act of 1992 with the transfer by the Chinese \n     Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation to the Iran \n     military of 60 C-802 advanced anti-ship missiles and 20 \n     Houdong fast-attack patrol craft, 15 of which were equipped \n     with C-802 missiles.\n       (2) In test firings of this missile from land-based \n     batteries and from naval vessels, and test firings of a \n     similar missile from fighter aircraft, the Iran Government \n     claimed direct hits on the intended targets. This operational \n     ability restores an anti-surface warfare capability lost by \n     the Iran military during the Iran-Iraq War.\n       (3) The Commander of the United States Fifth Fleet \n     commented that these missiles represented a new dimension to \n     the threat faced by the United States Navy, stating ``[i]t \n     used to be we just had to worry about land-based cruise \n     missiles. Now [the Iranians] have the potential to have that \n     throughout the [Persian] Gulf mounted on ships.''.\n       (4) It was reported in numerous press sources that the \n     Department of Defense found these transfers destabilizing, \n     and pressed for the imposition of sanctions under the Iran-\n     Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 but that the \n     Department of State did not wish to impose such sanctions for \n     fear of damaging bilateral relations between the People's \n     Republic of China and the United States.\n       (5) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 does \n     not differentiate between transfers of destabilizing weapons \n     that will and will not damage bilateral relations. Any \n     determination of whether to impose sanctions on the People's \n     Republic of China for this transfer should have been made \n     strictly on the basis whether this transfer was or was not \n     destabilizing.\n       (6) In light of these reports, it is likely that sanctions \n     would have been imposed if the Clinton Administration had \n     been more concerned with the stability of the region and the \n     security of United States troops than with the maintenance of \n     cordial relations between the People's Republic of China and \n     the United States.\n       (7) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative \n     action in the bilateral relations between the People's \n     Republic of China and the United States in order to respond \n     sufficiently to this violation of United States law.\n\n     SEC. 304. FINDINGS ON THE EVASION OF UNITED STATES EXPORT \n                   CONTROL LAWS BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding the evasion \n     of United States export control laws by the People's Republic \n     of China:\n       (1) On November 14, 1994, the President issued Executive \n     Order 12938, relating to the emergency regarding weapons of \n     mass destruction, declaring that the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction and the means of delivering them \n     constitute ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \n     national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \n     States'' and that he had therefore decided to ``declare a \n     national emergency to deal with that threat''.\n       (2) The President reaffirmed Executive Order 12938 on \n     November 15, 1995, and again on November 11, 1996.\n       (3) The Director of Central Intelligence stated in the \n     report entitled ``The Acquisition of Technology Relating to \n     Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional \n     Munitions'' that, from July to December 1996, ``China was the \n     most significant supplier of W[eapons of] M[ass] \n     D[estruction]-related goods and technology to foreign \n     countries.''.\n       (4) United States supercomputers are the computer of choice \n     for the nuclear weapons agencies of the People's Republic of \n     China as highlighted by the comments of the Chinese Academy \n     of Sciences, an agency known to work on nuclear weapons \n     development, that its United States-built supercomputer \n     provides the Academy with ``computational power previously \n     unknown'' and is available to ``all the major scientific and \n     technological institutes across China''.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China has consistently \n     provided technical and scientific assistance for the \n     development of nuclear weapons to both Iran and Pakistan, and \n     it is illogical to believe that such assistance would not \n     also include computational assistance if needed.\n       (6) According to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export \n     Administration, 47 United States high-performance \n     supercomputers were exported to the People's Republic of \n     China between January 1996 and March 1997. Press reports \n     indicate United States intelligence sources consider the \n     actual number of such supercomputers exported to the People's \n     Republic of China during that period to have been in the \n     hundreds.\n       (7) Current United States export regulations require an \n     export license for shipments of supercomputers to the \n     People's Republic of China only if the end-use will be \n     militarily related. However, the determination of that end-\n     use is left to the exporter, thereby providing an incentive \n     for inadequate investigations of the end-use of \n     supercomputers exported to the People's Republic of China.\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\n       (8) The Department of Commerce has initiated investigations \n     of United States supercomputer manufacturers who, as last as \n     June 1996, allegedly sold supercomputers to the Chinese \n     Academy of Sciences, which also administers research in \n     nuclear weapons and missiles, in violation of existing United \n     States export control regulations relating to supercomputers.\n       (9) On 14 July 1997, the ``China Daily'', the newspaper of \n     the Government of the People's Republic of China, stated that \n     ``China will open up its defense sector to foreign \n     investors'' by ``strengthening international military-related \n     electronic technology exchanges'' and that ``China's defense-\n     related electronics should no longer be hidden from foreign \n     investors''.\n       (10) It was exactly this concern of diversion to military \n     end-use and to third nation proliferators that prompted the \n     President, on June 16, 1997, to tighten export controls for \n     supercomputers so as to address the concern of ``[t]he \n     potential diversion to military use of technology acquired'' \n     through experience developed in operating supercomputers and \n     customizing software and the concern that ``the People's \n     Republic of China may transfer advanced-weapons related \n     technology to other countries, as in the case of ballistic \n     missile transfers''.\n       (11) Throughout this period, the President has consistently \n     acted in a manner so as to loosen controls on the export of \n     supercomputers from the United States and thereby make it \n     easier for the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to divert United States supercomputers to military end-uses \n     and to assist in the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (12) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative \n     action in the bilateral relations between the People's \n     Republic of China and the United States in order to respond \n     sufficiently to these violations of United States law.\n\n     SEC. 305. FINDINGS ON THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF UNITED \n                   STATES EXPORT CONTROL LAWS TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                   REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND HONG KONG.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings regarding the \n     inconsistent application of United States export control laws \n     to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong:\n       (1) While Hong Kong was sovereign territory of the United \n     Kingdom, United States control of United States exports to \n     Hong Kong of items listed on the United States Munitions List \n     and the Commerce Control List was considerably more lax than \n     United States control of exports of such items to the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (2) On June 19, 1997, at a time when Hong Kong was still \n     territory of the United Kingdom, the Department of Commerce \n     discovered that a supercomputer exported to a Hong Kong based \n     company without the need of an export license because it was \n     being exported to Hong Kong was reexported to a defense \n     research institute in Changsha, People's Republic of China.\n       (3) A Federal grand jury is currently investigating the \n     1995 diversion by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to military aviation production of aircraft machining \n     equipment that was originally exported from the United States \n     for civilian end-use.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China is the only country \n     which does not allow United States officials to investigate \n     the final end-use of exported technology and recently refused \n     United States requests to examine the location of the \n     supercomputer diverted from Hong Kong.\n       (5) The continuation of this inconsistent export control \n     regime without specific assurances and verification measures \n     to prevent unauthorized reexport from Hong Kong, or diversion \n     to military end-use, provides the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China with the means to circumvent United States \n     export controls and gain access to critical technology \n     necessary both for defense modernization and the \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (6) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative \n     action in the bilateral relations between the People's \n     Republic of China and the United States in order to respond \n     sufficiently to these violations of United States law.\n\n     SEC. 306.

The attempted illegal sale of AK-47 machine guns to \n     street gangs in California warrant these targeted sanctions \n     against these firms.\n        The bill establishes a mechanism to apply \n     sanctions on additional PLA companies based on certain \n     specific actions, including weapons proliferation, illegal \n     arms sales in U.S., and military and political espionage in \n     the United States. The Director of Central Intelligence and \n     the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in \n     separate annual reports, shall identify entities owned in \n     part or wholly by the People's Liberation Army who have \n     engaged in proliferation of nuclear or chemical weapons, the \n     illegal importation of weapons to the United States, or \n     unlawful military intelligence collection or espionage in the \n     United States. Such entities will be prohibited from \n     exporting to, or maintaining a physical presence in the \n     United States, receiving loans from the Export-Import Bank, \n     and receiving contracts from the United States Government for \n     a period of 1 year.\n        Sanctions remain in effect for 5 years. The bill \n     includes a Sense of Congress that the sanctions in the China \n     Policy Act shall be reviewed by Congress within the 5 year \n     period upon the occurrence of one or more of the following \n     events: (1) People's Republic of China's entry into the WTO \n     on commercially viable terms; (2) President's certification \n     of PRC's full implementation of international proliferation \n     standards and agreements; (3) President's certification that \n     PRC is actively and effectively combating all forms of \n     religious persecution; (4) PRC re-evaluation of Tiananmen \n     Square massacre; (5) Publication by the PRC of a National \n     Security White Paper describing its intentions \n     internationally; or (6) President's certification that the \n     PRC has taken concrete steps towards improving overall human \n     rights conditions in China and Tibet, including the release \n     of political prisoners; improving prison conditions and \n     providing prisoners with adequate medical care; and full \n     compliance with the international human rights accords to \n     which the PRC is a signatory.\n\n\n        title ii: human rights, religious freedom, and democracy\n\n        Congressional findings detailing the Chinese \n     Government's jailing of political dissidents, persecution of \n     religious groups, human rights violations in Tibet and \n     coercive family planning practices.\n        Combats slave labor and ``reeducation'' centers. \n     The bill calls for stricter enforcement of the ban against \n     the sale of products produced in slave labor camps; \n     appropriations to United States Customs to increase \n     monitoring; require reporting and advocacy requirements; and \n     a Sense of Congress urging renegotiation of prison labor \n     memorandum of understanding with China.\n        Authorize an additional $5 million for \n     international broadcasting to China, including Radio Free \n     Asia and the Voice of America to expand broadcast hours in \n     multiple Chinese dialects, Tibetan, and other languages \n     spoken in China.\n        Authorize additional $2 million in funding for \n     National Endowment for Democracy programs in China.\n        Authorize additional $2 million of funding for \n     existing United States Information Agency student, cultural, \n     and legislative exchange programs between the U.S. and China.\n        Terminate the East-West Center. This center funds \n     cooperative programs of study, research and training between \n     the U.S. and Asian Pacific nations. However, the resources of \n     the State Department, which maintains a network of embassies \n     and consulates in Asian Pacific countries, should be more \n     than sufficient to promote good relations with these \n     countries. Eliminating this $10 million program offsets \n     the spending increases proposed in the bill.\n       Require United States contractors who receive international \n     family planning funds from the United States to report on \n     their organization's activities in China.\n       Sense of Congress concerning multilateral efforts to \n     address China's human rights record.\n       Sense of Congress that China should abide by the 1984 Sino-\n     British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong.\n\n\n                  Title III: National Security Matters\n\n       Congressional findings on PRC's proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles, weapons of mass destruction, destabilizing advanced \n     conventional weapons, and evasion of U.S. export controls.\n       Tighten United States export licensing requirements on \n     super computers sold to China. Current regulation only \n     requires an export license for mid-range supercomputers to \n     countries such as China with only a certification, by the \n     exporting firm, that the end-use is not military-related. \n     This provision requires an export license for any mid-range \n     supercomputers (currently 2000-7000 MTOP range, but amendable \n     by the Secretary of Commerce) sold to China which the \n     Departments of Defense, State, Energy, and Commerce, and the \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency do not unanimously agree \n     to export without a license. This provision is a modified \n     version of the Spence-Dellums amendment to the House Fiscal \n     Year 98 DoD Authorization bill.\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\n       Protects against dual-use export diversion from Hong Kong. \n     The recent diversion of a Sun Microsystems supercomputer from \n     a Hong Kong importer to a military end-user in the People's \n     Republic of China highlights the potential problems with \n     having dual-use technology exports to Hong Kong being treated \n     more liberally than such exports to the PRC. This provision \n     would deny licenses for export of items on the U.S. Munitions \n     List and the Commerce Control List to Hong Kong if United \n     States officials are denied access to conduct pre-license \n     checks verifying the end-user. It will also require that if \n     United States officials are denied access for post-shipment \n     verification checks, or if an actual diversion of dual-use \n     items takes place from Hong Kong to the PRC, then Hong Kong \n     will thereafter be placed in the same export control category \n     as the People's Republic of China.\n       A finding that China violated the Iran-Iraq \n     Nonproliferation Act with the export of C-802 missiles to \n     Iran, and a requirement on the implementation of this Act's \n     sanctions. The Commander of the United States Navy's Fifth \n     Fleet in the Persian Gulf has called the Iranian acquisition \n     of C-802 cruise missiles a direct threat to the 15,000 US \n     servicemen stationed in the area. Iran acquired these \n     missiles from China, in direct contravention of the Iran-Iraq \n     Nonproliferation Act (McCain-Gore Act). However, the \n     Administration did not implement the sanctions called for in \n     the Act.\n       Limiting transfers of sensitive equipment and technology by \n     the People's Republic of China. Require within 60 days a \n     report detailing State Department's sanctions determination \n     process for each allegation against China in the area of \n     proliferation, and a schedule for initiating sanctions \n     determination process where the process has not been \n     initiated.\n       Sunshine requirement on PLA companies.

In addition, require \n     a report on PLA military modernization.\n       Require enhanced monitoring of Chinese intelligence \n     activities in the United States, including a report on such \n     activities and a report on political and military espionage.\n       Require a bilateral United States-Taiwan study of \n     establishing theater missile defense in the Pacific Rim.\n       Sense of the Congress that the current level of United \n     States forces in Asia are vital to continued peace and \n     stability in the region and should only be reduced with a \n     clear understanding of their impact on United States treaty \n     obligations and the continued ability of the United States to \n     deter potential aggression in the region.\n       Sense of Congress that the President shall initiate \n     negotiations with the PRC and other Asian countries to \n     establish a ``Helsinki Commission'' for Asia.\n\n\n                            Title IV: Trade\n\n       Sense of Congress that Taiwan should enter the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) as soon as it meets the established \n     criteria.\n\n\n         Title V: Human rights and Religious Freedom Worldwide\n\n       The legislation mandates additional and extensive training \n     for United States asylum officers world-wide in recognizing \n     religious persecution.\n       Enhanced reporting of human rights violations and religious \n     persecution around the world. Increased publicizing of \n     political and religious persecution world-wide through annual \n     reports by the State Department, publication of list of \n     individuals involved in religious persecution, and \n     establishment of a Prisoner Information Registry.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nChina Policy Act of 1997. As an original cosponsor of the act, I \nbelieve this legislation provides the starting point for a much needed \nrestructuring of United States-China relations. For too long, our \napproach to China has been one of passivity and appeasement. The \nClinton administration seems willing to tolerate virtually any \nmisbehavior--gross violations of human rights, arms deals with \nterrorist states, a headlong push to develop military capabilities that \nexceed any conceivable threat, even efforts to smuggle guns into the \nUnited States. This is no way to build a stable, peaceful, and \nconstructive relationship.\n  Our legislation offers a dramatically different approach. Under this \nbill, when China violates standards of decency or endangers vital \nAmerican interests, there will be a response that is swift, \npredictable, and appropriate. This legislation is an important first \nstep toward a policy that rewards and encourages constructive behavior, \nand discourages questionable activity. It points the way to a new and \nbetter era in United States-China relations.\n  The 20th century has been the American century, and if the new \ncentury is to bear the same imprint, we must fashion a stable and \nconstructive relationship with the People's Republic of China, which is \npushing hard for global superpower status.\n  One specific provision I have included in this bill protects the \nUnited States from Chinese diversion of sensitive technology from Hong \nKong. Hong Kong has abided by international export control regimes and \nhas benefited from preferential access to sensitive U.S. technology--\ntechnology that can be used for military purposes.\n  My provision simply does the following: if China diverts controlled \ntechnology from Hong Kong, or if United States officials are denied the \nopportunity to conduct post-shipment checks on location and end use of \ncontrolled items, then the United States shall apply the stricter \nexport controls to Hong Kong presently applied to the rest of China. In \naddition, if United States officials are denied an opportunity to \nconduct a prelicense check on the end use and end user of a controlled \nitem, then the export license for that item shall be denied.\n  A May, 1997 GAO report on the export of controlled items to Hong Kong \nstated that effective monitoring is critical to prevent weapons and \ntechnology proliferation. The report identified pre-license checks and \npost-shipment verification as possible means to ensure the continued \neffectiveness of Hong Kong's export control system.\n  Now that Hong Kong has reverted to Chinese control, China undoubtedly \nwill attempt to use the port to divert technology and proliferate \nweapons. Prosecutions for illegal shipments of arms-related commodities \nin Hong Kong have grown dramatically in recent years, from 65 cases in \n1994 to 250 last year. One Hong Kong firm, Cheong Yee, was sanctioned \nby the United States last May for helping Iran obtain chemical weapons.\n  The technology flow to Hong Kong is a significant national security \nrisk if China compromises the integrity of Hong Kong's export control \nsystem. Chinese front companies in Hong Kong already have been \nidentified with efforts to acquire controlled technologies for illicit \nexport to countries of proliferation concern, according to United \nStates and Hong Kong officials. China has refused to sign many of the \nexport control regimes by which Hong Kong historically has abided. The \nold restrictions are kept in place only from a sense of moral \nobligation, states Brian Lo, Hong Kong's chief trade-licensing officer.\n  Mr. President, moral obligation is flimsy stuff when you are dealing \nwith the Communist leaders of Beijing. These are the leaders who attack \ntheir own young people in Tiananmen Square, persecute Christians, and \nproliferate weapons to terrorist states which target U.S. citizens \naround the world.\n  In the face of this growing proliferation risk, the Clinton \nadministration has been relaxing America's export control regulations. \nJust this week, a bipartisan report issued by the House National \nSecurity Committee stated that the changes made to U.S. export controls \ncontributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \ntheir means of delivery as well as the development of advanced \nconventional weapons.\n  The number of export licenses reviewed each year for national \nsecurity reasons has fallen from 150,000 in the mid-1980's to less than \n8,000 today. The world may have become a safer place, but the \ninternational arena is still threatening.\n  Clearly, it is time for the United States to take aggressive steps \nwhich protect United States national security interests and limit the \nability of potential enemies to develop weapons of mass destruction. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of the China Policy Act and believe that the \nprovisions contained therein make a significant contribution to the \nUnited States-China debate. I urge the Senate's prompt consideration \nand passage of this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nAbraham] in introducing the China Policy Act of 1997. This is a bill \nthat I am proud to cosponsor and one that will send a much-needed \nmessage to the leaders of the People's Republic of China. I commend the \nSenator from Michigan for his efforts.\n  The China Policy Act is an omnibus bill that covers a broad range of \nissues. This legislation will impose targeted sanctions against Chinese \nentities--\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\nsuch as the military and public security apparatus--that are directly \nengaged in weapons proliferation and human rights abuses. In addition, \nthis bill calls for tighter enforcement of various laws related to \nChina, such as the ban on Chinese prison-labor goods and controls on \nthe export of high-speed computers to China. The legislation also \ncontains funding increases for student, cultural, and legislative \nexchanges between the United States and China.\n  The China Policy Act is designed to move Congress and the American \npublic beyond the sometimes polarizing debate over China's most-\nfavored-nation trade status, offering realistic alternatives to \nrevoking MFN that merit broad bipartisan support.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong opponent of \ngranting MFN privileges to China and, in fact, have been an original \ncosponsor of the resolutions of disapproval for the past 3 years. I \nstrongly believe that, in light of Beijing's egregious human rights \nrecord, China does not deserve to have such trade privileges with the \nUnited States. Ever since the administration delinked MFN and human \nrights in 1994, I have watched with alarm as the Chinese Government has \nheightened its political and religious persecution throughout the \ncountry.\n  But despite my strong views on the issue, I realize that the Congress \nhas been unable to reach a consensus on whether MFN is the best tool to \npressure China to make improvements in human rights. I know that many \nof my colleagues share my concerns over China's human rights record, \nbut nevertheless feel that MFN is too blunt an instrument, especially \nfor a nation as large and diverse as China.\n  But once you step away from the debate over the effectiveness of MFN, \nthere is widespread agreement among Members of both the Senate and the \nHouse that the administration's current policy of constructive \nengagement toward China remains unsatisfactory.\n  I believe the administration is promoting engagement for engagement's \nsake, not as a way to halt the many offensive behaviors of the Chinese \nregime. I prefer to call the administration policy not ``constructive'' \nengagement but rather unconditional engagement.\n  No matter how uncooperative China is, the United States appears ready \nto continue business as usual with the Chinese regime. This is \nespecially true with respect to human rights. Recent events paint a \nvery bleak picture. In October of last year, a Chinese court sentenced \nWang Dan--a leader of the Tiananmen Square protests--to 11 years in \nprison for peacefully expressing his prodemocracy beliefs. Seventy-six-\nyear-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu has been sentenced to reeducation through \nlabor for organizing religious ceremonies outside China's official \nCatholic Church. In Tibet, Chinese authorities have banned the display \nof the Dalai Lama's photograph and the State Department Human Rights \nReport cites three instances of Buddhist monks dying in Chinese prisons \nin 1996. Sadly, this represents on a tiny fraction of the human rights \nabuses that are taking place in China today. It would be impossible to \nname all of the people who are being kept behind bars for the \nexpression of their political and religious beliefs.\n  Yet, even as the Chinese leadership continues to brutalize political \ndissidents and the people of Tibet, the administration is preparing to \nwelcome China's President, Jiang Zemin, to the White House next month. \nWhat kind of message does this send?\n  The China Policy Act of 1997 represents the efforts of both pro- and \nanti-MFN Senators to find new ways to deal with the problems the United \nStates currently faces in China.\n  And there is no shortage of problems.\n  I have already mentioned my primary concern, which is China's \ndeplorable human rights record, but in addition, the Government of \nChina continues to sell dangerous chemical and nuclear weapons \ntechnologies to terrorist and rogue regimes. China has used military \nintimidation to disrupt free elections in Taiwan and has harassed its \nneighbors in the South China Sea. Furthermore, we have all seen reports \nof Beijing's unfair trade practices and rampant copyright violations. \nThis is what I refer to as a ``kaleidoscope'' of problems the United \nStates has with China.\n  The China Policy Act of 1997 contains targeted sanctions aimed at the \norganizations most directly associated with China's poor behavior. For \nexample, the bill contains provisions imposing comprehensive sanctions \nagainst enterprises run by the People's Liberation Army that have \nengaged in weapons smuggling or proliferation. The United States simply \nshould refrain from doing business with companies that create security \nrisks to our country.\n  This bill will also require the administration to deny United States \nvisas to high-level Chinese officials directly connected with human \nrights violations and religious persecution. This provision expresses \nUnited States outrage at China's human rights abuses while still giving \nthe President adequate waiver authority to conduct foreign policy.\n  I am particularly pleased this bill contains strong language on human \nrights, an area that has been a special focus of mine. The bill \nincludes a provision stating that the administration needs to greatly \nincrease multilateral efforts to condemn China's human rights record. \nAs you know, Mr. President, this past April, the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission failed to pass a resolution criticizing China's human rights \npolicies. Unfortunately, the United States only began lobbying for the \nresolution at the last moment and, as a result of this delay, many of \nour allies--including France, Germany, and Canada--would not cosponsor \nthe motion. To make our China policy more effective, the United States \nmust do a better job of coordinating with our allies in multilateral \nfora.\n\n  In addition to addressing a wide spectrum of issues in Sino-United \nStates relations, the China Policy Act also gives the Senate--and the \nAmerican people we represent--an important opportunity to have an \nextensive debate about China policy. Such a debate is long overdue, and \nhas continued to be delayed because of the controversy surrounding MFN.\n  It is my view that the inability of Congress to reach a consensus on \nMFN has led the Chinese authorities to believe that they can continue \nto commit gross human rights violations without facing any \nconsequences. Unfortunately, it may be that, until now, the Beijing \nleadership has been right. In China's eyes, Congress has become what \nChairman Mao Zedong would have called a paper tiger, something that \nmight act ferocious, but is, in fact, harmless.\n  However, once Congress steps out of the restrictive confines of the \nMFN debate, I think China will be surprised at the level of \ndissatisfaction in Congress toward Beijing's actions.\n  The Chinese Government will obviously condemn this legislation \nbecause it demands that Chinese leaders live up to the international \nand bilateral agreements on weapons-proliferation, human rights, and \ntrade to which China is a party. The Beijing government categorically \nrejects any outside scrutiny of its policies and equates good relations \nwith a complete lack of criticism. But truly close relations between \ntwo countries can only be built when both sides fulfill their \nobligations and act in good faith toward one another.\n  The China Policy Act of 1997 is intended to send a strong message \nthat Chinese Government's actions on many fronts remains unacceptable. \nUnfortunately, Chinese leaders have not heard this message loudly or \nstrongly enough in the past. They have not heard it from the U.N. Human \nRights Commission. They have not heard it from our trade negotiators. \nAnd, until now, they have not heard it from the U.S. Congress.\n  It is my view that the time has come for us to send this message \nclearly.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1165. A bill to apply rules regarding the conduct of meetings and \nrecordkeeping under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Social \nSecurity Advisory Board and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADVISORY BOARD SUNSHINE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Social \nSecurity Advisory Board Sunshine Act. This legislation will apply the \npublic meeting and disclosure requirements of\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Social Security advisory \nboard.\n  The Social Security Advisory Board was created in 1994 when the \nSocial Security Administration became an independent agency. Its \npurpose is to serve as an advisor to the Commissioner of the Social \nSecurity Administration, the President and the Congress. The 1994 law \nrequires the Board to make recommendations on some of the most critical \nissues facing the Social Security Administration and the country, \nincluding: How to ensure economic security for Government retirement \nand disability programs; how to ensure the solvency of Social Security \nprograms; how to improve the quality of service and the policies and \nregulations that influence that service; and how to increase the \npublic's understanding of Social Security.\n  With such a significant mandate, the question we should be asking is \nnot why have open meetings, but why not have open meetings? This Board \nhas been entrusted with the responsibility of making policy \nrecommendations regarding the largest domestic Government program in \nthis country. Virtually every American is affected by Social Security. \nEvery American has a stake in Social Security. They have the right to \nknow what recommendations are being made and why. The Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, which became public law in 1972 is intended to promote \ngood Government values, such as openness, accountability, and balance \nof viewpoints. At the heart of the matter is a desire to keep the \nchannels open between Government and the interested public.\n  Yesterday, during the confirmation hearing for Ken Apfel for the \nposition of Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, I asked \nhim if bringing the Advisory Board under the Sunshine laws was a good \nidea. He said, ``I think sunshine is almost always a good idea.''\n  My legislation would require the Advisory Board to provide notice of \nall meetings, make available for public inspection all Advisory Board \ndocuments, provide opportunities for nonmembers to participate in Board \nmeetings, keep minutes of those meetings, and make transcripts of \nAdvisory Board meetings available. In addition, the Social Security \nAdministration will be required to disclose the disbursement of money \nto, and the disposal of money by, the advisory Board.\n  My legislation would also provide for compensation of the board \nmembers. Board members are paid per diem travel expenses, but they \nreceive no compensation for the time they take off work to attend the \nmeetings, which are held once a month. Because they have been given \ncharge of such an important task, and because of the homework that must \nbe done in order for them to be prepared and participate in meetings, \ncompensation commensurate with that of similar boards and committees is \nonly fair.\n  I want to commend the Board on the work it has done so far, \nparticularly to highlight the need to expand the Social Security \nAdministration's policy analysis capabilities. Those capabilities will \nbe very important as we jump start discussions about Social Security \nreform.\n  The Advisory Board will be undergoing some changes in membership in \nthe near future. I intend to work at getting this legislation enacted \nas soon as possible so the change in membership will occur with a \nchange in the philosophy that Government is best done in the open and \nnot behind closed doors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1166. A bill to prevent Federal agencies from pursuing policies of \nunjustifiable nonacquiescence in, and relitigation of, precedents \nestablished in the Federal judicial circuits; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                   The Federal Agency Compliance Act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, because the concept of nonacquiescence \nis so often mired and hidden in the bureaucratic processes of our \nGovernment agencies, few realize the magnitude of its true \nimplications. I am extremely concerned that so many Federal agencies \ncurrently fail to comply with established case law when dealing with \nAmerican's rights and legal claims. Instead, the very agencies whose \nfunction it is to serve the people of this country have been ignoring \nthe law through the policy of nonacquiescence. Specifically, \nnonacquiescence occurs when an agency refuses to comply with judicial \nprecedent and instead, relies on agency policy to determine the outcome \nof a claim. For example, if a beneficiary has a social security claim, \nthe agency can rule against the claimant even if the judicial precedent \nin that circuit is entirely in favor of the beneficiary. Agency wins--\nclaimant loses--end of story. The only recourse that beneficiary has is \nto relitigate that same issue in court. The beneficiary can't bypass \nthe agency and go directly to court, because he or she must first \nexhaust all administrative remedies. This is an extremely expensive \nburden on any person with a claim against an agency. In fact, it is a \nfinancial burden on the entire judicial system and on the American \ntaxpayer who eventually pays the cost of relitigation.\n  Stare decisis--``let the decision stand''--is the fundamental \ndoctrine of law upon which our entire judicial system is based. It is a \nconcept of fairness and equity that has withstood the test of time. We \nrequire the American people and courts to adhere to judicial precedent. \nThis policy of nonacquiescence completely undermines that principle. It \nallows the agency to completely ignore judicial precedent and instead \nrely solely on agency interpretation. The most glaring examples of \nnonacquiescence have surfaced in a select few agencies, such as the \nSocial Security Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, and \nthe Internal Revenue Service. This year alone, the Social Security \nAdministration itself indicates that tens of thousands of claims \ninvolving nonacquiescence may be litigated. In a recent judicial \nopinion, the appellate judge stated that ``if a [social security] \nclaimant has the determination and financial and physical strength and \nlives long enough to make it through the administrative process he can \nturn to the courts * * *'' and ultimately prevail. Similarly, the NLRB \nand the IRS have invoked this policy and were the subject of inquiry \nduring a recent House hearing which investigated the alarming rise of \nagency nonacquiescence.\n  The true residual dangers of the nonacquiescence policy, however, lie \nin its more far-reaching implications. Theoretically, any agency can \ninvoke this policy to avoid the law. When the Bureau of Land Management \nrecently proposed reform regulations for grazing permits, ranchers \nchallenged the new provisions. After exhausting all administrative \nremedies, the ranchers took their case to court. Following lengthy and \ncostly litigation, the appellate court ruled in favor of the ranchers. \nHowever, under the nonacquiescence policy, the BLM could refuse to \nabide by this ruling each and every time this issue arises. Now grazing \npermits may not seem like a big deal to people here in Washington, but \nlike many Western States, more than 30 percent of all the land in my \nhome State of Colorado is Government-owned and under the control of a \nFederal agency. In western Colorado, almost 60 percent of the land \nfalls into this arrangement. A rancher waiting for a grazing permit may \nbe unable to get a loan or conduct necessary planning, which could \nforce that rancher out of the livestock industry altogether. At the \nvery least, each time a claim is relitigated, it involves tens of \nthousands of dollars and years of financial uncertainty for the \nclaimant. Such a refusal to adhere to judicial precedent sends a clear \nmessage to the American people--a message of unfairness and inequality \nwhich in turn breeds mistrust against the Government. If the people \nmust adhere to judicial precedent, we should require no less of \nGovernment agencies.\n  This problem has been around for decades, but Congress first \naddressed this issue when it was considering the Social Security Act of \n1984. The conference report for that legislation highlighted the \nmagnitude of concern over this policy when it stated:\n\n       By refusing to apply circuit court interpretations and by \n     not promptly seeking review by the Supreme Court, the \n     Secretary forces beneficiaries to re-litigate the same issue \n     over and over again in the circuit, at a substantial expense \n     to both beneficiaries and the federal government. This is \n     clearly an undesirable consequence.\n\n  At that time, Congress allowed the agencies to address this problem \ninternally rather than by statute. Now in\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\n1997, 13 years later, nonacquiescence is alive and well and it would be \na gross understatement to say that this problem continues to be an \nundesirable consequence. In fact, Congress' failure to act 13 years ago \nhas allowed the nonacquiescence policy to grow into a bureaucratic \nnightmare. This is nothing less than bureaucracy run amuck. It is now \nour duty to address this situation before any more time and money is \nwasted.\n  Because I believe it is important to hold Federal agencies \naccountable, today I am introducing legislation which would require a \nFederal agency to comply with Federal court precedents within the \ncircuit where a claim is filed. However, this bill also allows an \nagency to deviate from such precedent under certain circumstances, thus \ngiving the agency additional avenues when there is a conflict between \njudicial precedent and agency regulations. In contrast to the present \npolicy of nonacquiescence, in which the general public has no \nadditional avenue except to relitigate an issue at personal expense, my \nbill upholds the fundamental concept of stare decisis and will in turn \nprovide stability, economy and equality for all Americans.\n  The House version of this legislation was introduced earlier in this \nCongress by Congressman Gekas and Congressman Frank and has been \nreported favorably out of the Subcommittee on Commercial and \nAdministrative Law. This bill is supported by the Judicial Conference \nof the United States, Americans for Tax Reform, the Association of \nAdministrative Law Judges, and the American Bar Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \nmake very minor changes to the antidumping provisions of the Tariff Act \nof 1930. This bill will clarify Commerce Department authority to \nallocate costs in antidumping cases consistent with sound accounting \nprinciples and commercial reality. Although the antidumping law \ngenerally affords the Commerce Department wide latitude in determining \nproper cost allocations in antidumping cases, developing case law in \nthis area severely limits the ability of the Department to calculate \naccurate dumping margins. Specifically, these cases interpret the \ncurrent antidumping statute to prevent the Department from relying on \ncost allocations based on revenues, even though revenue-based \nallocations are widely accepted in the accounting profession and often \nare most appropriate in particular fact situations.\n  This bill would not require a particular kind of cost allocation in \nany given case. Rather, the proposal would clarify the Department of \nCommerce's authority to use any appropriate cost allocation \nmethodology, including a revenue-based methodology, consistent with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles and the particular facts of \nthe case at hand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish professional development partnerships to \nimprove the quality of America's teachers and the academic achievement \nof students in the classroom, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n        the teacher excellence in america challenge act of 1997\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we all recognize the need for qualified, \nwell-trained and dedicated teachers to improve the education of \nstudents throughout the United States. Unfortunately, many students who \nare just returning from their summer vacations are entering classrooms \nwhere teachers have not been so prepared, who are not as qualified as \nthey should be, and this, of course, impacts tremendously on the \nproductivity and the excellence of American education.\n  Today I am introducing legislation which I believe will change \nfundamentally the way teachers are trained and, thus, improve the \nquality of teaching in America's classrooms. This is absolutely \ncritical, since over the next decade, 2 million new teachers will need \nto be hired. This is the result of a combination of retirements of \nexisting teachers, together with the increase in student population \nwhich is taking place throughout the United States.\n  Last year's report by the National Commission on Teaching and \nAmerica's Future entitled, ``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's \nFuture'', shed light on the disheartening state of the teaching \nprofession in the United States: more than 12 percent of all newly \nhired teachers have no training whatsoever in educational technique and \npedagogy; more than 14 percent enter the teaching profession without \nmeeting State standards; 23 percent of all secondary teachers do not \nhave even a minor in the main teaching field which they have been hired \nto perform, including more than 30 percent of mathematics teachers; \nand, in schools with the highest minority enrollments, students have \nless than a 50-percent chance of getting a science or mathematics \nteacher who holds a license and degree in the field which they are \nteaching.\n  These findings were echoed also in ``Quality Counts: A Report Card on \nthe Condition of Public Education in the 50 States,'' which was \npublished this past January by Education Week. This report notes that \non average, 4 out of 10 secondary teachers do not have a degree in the \nsubjects they teach; there are too many unlicensed teachers in \nAmerica's classrooms; and too few of our prospective teachers receive \nthe high-quality education they need to be effective teachers.\n  Overall, this report rated the States, and the average was C. No \nState received an A, and there were only eight B's: California, \nColorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, and \nVermont. Three States received D's for their teaching: Arizona, Hawaii, \nand Idaho. And the rest, including my State of Rhode Island, received a \ngentleman's C, which in today's competitive world is unsatisfactory for \nthe future of our country and the success of our children.\n  It must be noted that teacher quality varies tremendously; that in \ndifferent classrooms in the same schools, you will see outstanding \nteachers in one and less qualified teachers in another. Many students \nare taught by a qualified teacher who understands their subject and how \nto teach students to excel. But not all students are so fortunate. \nThese students are being deprived essentially of the quality education \nthey need because their teacher is not well prepared and not qualified.\n  ``What teachers know and do is the most important reflection on what \nstudents learn'' is the first premise of the National Commission on \nTeaching and America's Future.\n  Given the statistics I just recited about the current state of \nteaching in America, it is no wonder American students are failing to \nmake the grade in a very competitive world. Indeed, a study which \ncompared high- and low-achieving elementary schools with similar \nstudent characteristics found that more than 90 percent of the \nvariation in achievement in math and reading was directly attributable \nto differences in the qualifications of the teachers in those schools.\n  It is also no wonder that American students don't fare well in \ninternational comparisons. The results of the eighth-grade \nThird International Mathematics and Science Study found that these \nstudents barely scored above the world average in science and below the \nworld average in mathematics. And today, being mediocre is insufficient \nin order to face the challenges of a very complex world.\n\n  Even though much has been done to address teacher quality, the truth \nis that the current system of teacher preparation does not give \nteachers a fair chance at success. Prospective teachers, those in \ntraining in our Nation's teacher colleges, are not likely to be \nprovided with the panoply of experiences which they need, such as \nactual classroom time, structured practice opportunities, a talented \nand experienced teacher as a mentor, and the skills to work with \ndiverse student populations.\n  These are the tools they need to be adequately prepared and, sadly, \nmany do not receive this help while they are in teacher preparation. \nIndeed, as the 1996 report by the National Commission on Teaching and \nAmerica's Future notes, traditional teacher education programs are \nfailing because they are too short, too fragmented and they use \ntextbooks rather than active hands-on teaching methods. They also \nneglect to develop some of the ideas and concepts that are critical to \nsuccess, such as working in teams and using technology.\n  Sadly, I believe there is a real disconnect between the teacher \ncolleges that prepare teachers and the elementary and secondary schools \nthat hire them to teach the children of America. Consequently, \nbeginning teachers are thrown into classrooms without the skills to \nsucceed. As Linda Darling-Hammond, the Executive Director of the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future, writes, the \nmessage given to these teachers in the beginning of the school year is \n``Figure it out yourself. We'll see you in June. . .if you make it that \nlong!''\n  Due to this sink-or-swim method of teacher preparation, some teachers \ndo not make it to June or survive past the first few years of teaching. \nAs a USA Today article from earlier this year points out, 17 percent of \nnew teachers leave the classroom after 1 year, and a 1987 study by \nGrissmer and Kirby estimated that 30 to 50 percent of new teachers \nleave the profession within 3 to 5 years.\n  Add to this defection from the ranks of the profession the increased \nstudent enrollment due to the continuing Baby Boom Echo which will \nreach a record 52.2 million in 1997 and, indeed, increase each year \nthrough 2006, and impending retirements of many of our teachers. This \nsituation creates a tremendous challenge and a need to prepare over 2 \nmillion new teachers to face the next century.\n  The time is ripe to face this challenge. We must do so now before \npublic support for education wanes. By enacting needed reforms and \nchanges in how we prepare and continue the development of teachers, we \ncan guarantee the success of both students and teachers.\n  We must directly connect our teacher preparation and development \nsystem to\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\nour elementary and secondary schools. Our future teachers need and \ndeserve the kind of hands-on training and ``real world'' experience \nthey will get from more exposure and practice in today's classrooms, as \nwell as the mentoring and assistance they will receive from our best \nand most experienced veteran teachers. My bill accomplishes this by \nfostering partnerships between the teacher colleges at our Nation's \ninstitutions of higher education and elementary and secondary schools.\n  These partners should work in concert to prepare teachers adequately \nand keep their skills updated by working jointly to develop enhanced \ncurricula and mentoring activities, as well as to research and \nimplement sound teaching and learning practices.\n  As Jerrald Shrive wrote in ``Lessons from Restructuring Experiences: \nStories of Change in Professional Development Schools'':\n\n       . . . educational partnerships and collaborations [between \n     schools and universities] can be one significant piece of the \n     actions necessary to move all of education to more productive \n     levels.\n\n  These premises underlie the legislation I introduce today. The \nTeacher Excellence in America Challenge Act or the TEACH Act, aims to \nimprove the continuum of professional development from preservice \npreparation to the induction of new teachers to the improvement of \nveteran teachers, all of this designed to increase the achievement of \nour students.\n  My legislation establishes a competitive 5-year grant program to \nprovide grants to professional development partnerships consisting of \ninstitutions of higher education, public elementary and secondary \nschools, local educational agencies, and others, such as the State \neducational agency, teacher organizations, or nonprofit organizations. \nThese partnerships must be based upon a mutual commitment to improve \nteaching and learning.\n  These partnerships would use grant funding to support, as well as \ncreate, professional development schools, a reform that has been \nemployed across this country and other industrialized nations and has \nshown success in increasing student achievement, better preparing \nprospective and beginning teachers, and providing critical ongoing \nopportunities for the professional development of veteran teachers.\n  Professional development schools involve shared responsibility and \ncooperation between the institutions of higher education that prepare \nteachers and the public elementary and secondary schools that employ \nteachers, a system similar to teaching hospitals.\n  An example of a professional development school can be found at the \nSullivan School in Newport, RI. It is in a partnership with Salve \nRegina University. At the Sullivan School, Salve Regina students are \ngiven opportunities to practice teaching in a real classroom. Sullivan \nteachers are involved in observing these Salve Regina students, and \nthey can also utilize the resources of Salve Regina University for \nprofessional development opportunities. Sullivan students go on field \ntrips to Salve Regina for both higher education and career awareness \nactivities, and the parents of these Sullivan students are also \ninvolved and are also provided opportunities for education and \ntraining.\n  This is a model of one possible way to use professional development \nschools to enhance the preparation of teachers, the education of \nstudents, and the involvement of parents.\n  Additional components of the TEACH Act include forging links between \na university's school of education and their schools of arts and \nsciences. We have found in our discussions and research that many times \nwithin the university itself there is no collaboration, connection and \nconcentration. This legislation will foster such cooperation.\n  The TEACH Act also encourages the development of mentoring programs \nin which senior expert teachers would help younger teachers. It \nemphasizes technology training, which is a key piece now of higher \neducation everywhere, and it recognizes that in order to be a good \nteacher, you have to have time to prepare to be a good teacher. It also \nwould create a cadre of quality teachers that would act as a resource \nto enhance the professional development of all teachers and \nreestablishes principals as educational leaders.\n  This is not a giveaway grant program. The TEACH Act offers resources \nto partnerships but it demands results. Strong evaluation provisions in \nthe TEACH Act require that partnerships demonstrate increased student \nachievement, improved teacher preparation, increased opportunities for \nprofessional development, and also it insists that well-qualified \nteachers be placed in the classroom in order to continue to receive \nthis grant funding.\n  In addition, the legislation requires an independent national \nevaluation of the short-term and long-term impacts and outcomes of \nthese professional development partnerships.\n  Mr. President, given the growing need to update and improve the \nteacher training in this country, I expect we will see other proposals \nto address this problem offered in this body. I would be concerned if \nsuch proposals fell short on what we must accomplish by block granting \ntraining programs or failing to approach the kind of rigor that is \nincluded in the legislation I submit today. We have to have a rigorous \nand demanding legislative agenda in order to inspire and act as a \ncatalyst for better teacher training across the country. Better teacher \ntraining will lead to better teachers. And better teachers will lead to \nbetter education and a better future for our children.\n  My legislation puts us on track to answering the call of the National \nCommission on Teaching and America's Future to provide every student in \nAmerica with access to competent, qualified, and dedicated teaching by \nthe year 2006.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor and to \nsupport the TEACH Act and help reform our system of teacher training as \nwell as update the skills of teachers already in the classroom.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a training voucher system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the working american training voucher act of 1997\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill address a serious need of America's workers: The need to receive \ntraining that will prepare individuals for the workplace of the 21st \ncentury. My legislation, entitled the ``Working American Training \nVoucher Act,'' would provide $1,000 training vouchers to 1 million \nworking men and women who typically have little or no access to \nemployer-provided training.\n  Mr. President, many Federal programs focus on the needs of those \nwhose challenges and difficulties are most easily recognized and \ntangible. When we see a hungry child, an unemployed adult, or an \nimpoverished senior citizen, we justifiably want to reach out and do \nwhat we can to help. Indeed, I am proud to be an active voice for those \nwhose challenges and pains we can sometimes only imagine. However, it \nis oftentimes difficult to recognize the needs of those whose \nchallenges are less tangible, whose concerns are less evident, or whose \nsense of insecurity about the future is known only by the individual \nand their family.\n  It is this difficulty that confronts many American workers today. In \nthe face of increasing global competition, many workers wonder if the \njob they have today will be there for them tomorrow. They are concerned \nthat the advent of new technologies is making their skills and talents \nless useful for their current employers which, in turn, makes them feel \nmore vulnerable and expendable. And they wonder if the skills they \nposses today are even marketable if they are downsized or otherwise put \nout of work.\n  Unfortunately, these types of concerns and anxieties oftentimes do \nnot show on the surface, so it can be difficult for others to recognize \nor address them. It is too easy for many to assume that because a man \nor woman is already holding down a job, all is well and his or her \nfuture is secure. After all, how bad can it be if you're punching a \ntime clock and getting a paycheck? Unfortunately, such a view is not \nonly shortsighted, it is also misguided and could prove disastrous.\n  We should not wait until a worker has been laid off from their job, \nor a company shuts its doors and shutters its windows, to take steps to \nhelp the American worker. Rather, we should take steps to ensure that \nour Nation's work force is confident of their future and feels prepared \nto address the changes that tomorrow will bring. Not only does this \nhelp the individual, but I think we would all agree that the best way \nto reduce the impact and cost of unemployment is to take steps to keep \nthose who are already employed on the job.\n  Admittedly, many policies and decisions play an integral role in \ncreating a vibrant job market. The tax burden we place on businesses, \nthe trade agreements we sign with foreign governments, and the \nregulatory load we place on employers all have a significant impact on \nour economy's ability to produce and sustain good jobs. However, for \nthe individual, many of these polices seem too macro to have an impact \non their own employment prospects. In fact, an individual may not even \nrecognized the direct impact these broader policies have on their job \nfrom day to day.\n  There is, however, one issue that truly strikes at the heart of how \nan individual feels about the future: The degree to which he or she \nknows that their skills match the needs of their\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\ncurrent employer or other prospective employers in the marketplace. \nWithout this knowledge, it does not matter to an individual if the \nunemployment rate is as low as economists consider the natural rate of \nunemployment or if the newspapers tell him or her that the economy \ncouldn't be better. The simple fact is that unless an individual \npersonally feels that their skills are up-to-date and marketable, there \nwill never be a complete sense of security on the job from one day to \nthe next.\n  And that's what the legislation I am introducing today is all about. \nThe Working American Training Voucher Act addresses the needs of the \naverage American worker--the individual who has a job today, but \ndoesn't know if he or she has the skills needed for the jobs of \ntomorrow. The person who's collecting a paycheck now, but is concerned \nthat the rapidly changing work environment may put an end to that soon.\n  Mr. President, we all know new technologies and new products are \nentering the workplace at an unprecedented rate and the changes these \ntechnologies bring are substantial. Few professions and few jobs have \ngone untouched by these changes--and even fewer will be immune from \nchange in the future. Indeed, just as computers have changed the face \nof manufacturing, they have also changed the world of art and design. \nEven labor intensive tasks at assembly shops have taken on a high-tech \nflair thanks to new technologies.\n\n  For an individual who understands these technologies or received \ntraining in their use, these changes present exciting new opportunities \nthat improve performance and ultimately give one a sense of assurance \nthat their skills are in demand. But for those who do not understand \nthese technologies or do not receive training in their use, these \ntechnologies are nothing more than a threat and cause for anxiety.\n  Regrettably, even as the demand for training at all levels in the \nworkplace continues to grow because of these changing technologies, the \nUnited States has historically lagged far behind our global competitors \nin training workers. In fact, a study by the Congressional Office of \nTechnology Assessment concluded: ``When measured by international \nstandards, most American workers are not well trained.''\n  While some U.S. companies devote a substantial amount of money to \ntraining, many of our global competitors spend considerably more. A \nstudy by the American Society for Training and Development highlighted \nthis point when it found that U.S. companies spend--in the aggregate--\napproximately 1.4 percent of their payroll on training, while a number \nof our competitor nations actually require companies to spend 2 to 4 \npercent. While I would not espouse a mandatory training budget for any \nbusiness, I believe we can and should seek to improve the availability \nof training for our Nation's workers--and especially for those who need \nit most but are least likely to receive it. And that's precisely who \nthe working American training voucher is designed to reach.\n   Mr. President, the working American training voucher would provide \naccess to critically needed training for workers at businesses with 200 \nor fewer employees. Why is it targeted to workers in small businesses? \nQuite simply, because these are the individuals who are the least \nlikely to receive--or be offered--employer-provided training. The same \nreport by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment summarized \nthe plight of employees at small businesses quite succinctly: ``Many \n(employees) in smaller firms receive no formal training.''\n  A recent report--completed by Prof. Craig Olson at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison and presented to the Senate Manufacturing Task Force \nthis past September--looked at the difference between the likelihood an \nindividual would receive training and the level of educational \nachievement he or she attained, or the field he or she chose to enter. \nDr. Olson's study found that individuals with a bachelor's or master's \ndegree had a 50 percent chance of receiving training in the past year, \nwhile individuals with a high school diploma had only a 17 percent \nchance. Those who dropped out of high school fared even worse; their \nodds of receiving training were only 5 percent.\n  When viewed by occupation, individuals who worked in production- or \nservice-related jobs had only a 16 percent and 18 percent chance of \nreceiving training respectively, while those in management had a 50 \npercent chance. When considering that only one in four American workers \nreceived training in the past 12 months, these odds don't bode well for \nmany employees at small businesses whose educational attainment and \noccupations fall in the categories that are the least likely to receive \ntraining.\n  One might understandably ask: Why is it that small businesses often \nprovide so little training? The answer: cost. Small businesses are \nquite often unable to afford the cost of sending an employee to a \ntraining program. When your business is just trying to make ends meet, \nit's impossible to send an employee to a training class that costs the \nbusiness both money and time away from work.\n   Mr. President, the working American training voucher is designed to \naddress this problem in a straightforward and efficient way. These \nvouchers--valued at up to $1,000 each--would be made available to \nemployees at small businesses through the existing job training system \nthat is already in place as a result of the Job Training Partnership \nAct, or JTPA. As my colleagues in the Senate know, State and local \ngovernments--joined by the private sector--have primary responsibility \nfor the development, management, and administration of job training \nprograms in the JTPA, so no new distribution network would be necessary \nto conduct this voucher program.\n  The only major requirement for receiving a voucher would be that the \nemployee and employer must agree on the specific training that will be \npurchased with the voucher. This will ensure that the training will be \ntargeted specifically to the needs of the individual and the business--\nmoney would not be spent on generic training programs that teach skills \nthat are of little, if any, use in a particular field or job. \nFurthermore, such an agreement will ensure that workers are actively \nengaged in pursuing training that will help their careers, even as \nemployers will be urging employees to undertake training that will help \nthe business.\n  The Senate Labor Committee will soon be preparing legislation to \nrecraft and consolidate many of our federally-run job training programs \nin the JTPA. I am greatly concerned that none of our current 128 job \ntraining programs is specifically targeted to training for currently \nemployed individuals--and I believe that the working American training \nvoucher would fill this void for those who need access to this training \nthe most. Therefore, I am hopeful that my legislation and this concept \nwill be incorporated in the job training reform bill when it is \nreported from the Senate Labor Committee and is considered on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I believe that as we prepare our work force for the \nnext century, we should be encouraging workers to develop new skills \nthat will improve their longevity in their current jobs even as they \ngain confidence that their skills will be needed in the future. Not \nonly will these new skills increase the confidence and performance of \nthe individual worker, but they will also improve the productivity of \nthe business who employs them. And we all know that if we improve a \nbusiness' productivity and output, that business is more likely to \nsurvive and thrive--which means that this voucher may ultimately assist \nin preserving businesses and jobs in the long run.\n  Furthermore, better skills and training will ensure that individuals \nare able to rapidly transition to new jobs in the unfortunate event \ntheir current job is lost for reasons beyond their control. Regardless \nof how favorable the Tax Code is made or how many burdensome \nregulations we remove, we will never be able to guarantee an individual \nthat his or her job will be around forever. But we can provide a worker \nwith access to training that will keep his or her skills up to date and \nmarketable no matter what the future holds.\n  Mr. President, the working American training voucher would be a \ntangible, concrete, and definable program that would address a core \nissue facing American workers. It will ensure that those who typically \nhave the least access to training will be able to acquire the skills \nneeded for their current jobs, while improving their jobs in the \nfuture. It is targeted to those who are\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\nmost in need of assistance, and will ensure that we no longer wait \nuntil an individual is out of work to provide help.\n  The Federal Government often promises the American people many \nthings, but we can never offer peace of mind to a worker who doesn't \nknow if his or her skills are adequate to keep them employed. Let's \ntake a step in the right direction and at least ensure that those who \nhave a job will not lose it due to a lack of access to training and new \nskills. Let's pass the Working American Training Voucher Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSLEY-BRAUN:\n  S. 1171. A bill for the relief of Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas \nand her husband, Diogenes Patricio Rojas; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today to \nprovide relief to Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, \nDiogenes Patricio Rojas. These two individuals, who currently reside in \nChicago, IL, face deportation later this month to the Dominican \nRepublic as a result of an absurd technicality in current Federal \nimmigration law.\n  Ms. Rojas has been denied citizenship because her mother was the \nchild of a U.S. citizen female and foreign male. Previous law allowed \nonly children of U.S. citizen males and foreign females to claim U.S. \ncitizenship.\n  Simply put, Mrs. Rojas has been denied U.S. citizenship because she \nhad the ``misfortune'' of having a U.S. citizen grandmother instead of \na U.S. citizen grandfather.\n  In 1994, Senator Paul Simon passed the Immigration and Nationality \nand Technical Corrections Act, which allowed individuals born overseas \nbefore 1934 to U.S. citizen mothers, and their descendants, to claim \nU.S. citizenship. As a result of that 1994 law, the mother of Janina \nRojas applied for U.S. citizenship, which she received in January 1996.\n  When Janina Rojas attempted to derive citizenship as a descendant of \na direct beneficiary of the 1994 law, however, her application was \ndenied. Despite the 1994 law, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService requires that the mother of Janina Rojas meet transmission \nrequirements: the mother must have been physically present in the U.S. \nfor 10 years prior to Janina's birth, 5 of which were after the age of \n16 years, in order for Janina to derive citizenship. Since her mother \nwas prohibited from becoming a U.S. citizen until 1996, however, it is \nunreasonable to require that she was in the U.S. for 10 years.\n  Clearly, while 60 years of discriminatory law was corrected in 1994, \nthe citizenship qualifications of the line of descendants of those U.S. \ncitizen females remain adversely impacted.\n  On May 1 of this year, I introduced a bill, S. 677, the Equity In \nTransmission of Citizenship Act of 1997, that will waive the parental \ntransmission requirement for the grandchildren of U.S. citizen females. \nThat bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. While I \nam hopeful S. 677 will be promptly approved, it may not be approved \nbefore September 27, the deportation date of Mr. and Mrs. Rojas. The \nprivate relief bill I introduce today will provide an extension for Mr. \nand Mrs. Rojas so that S. 677 can be taken up and passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1171\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for purposes \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \n     seq.), Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, \n     Diogenes Patrico Rojas, shall be held and considered to have \n     been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \n     residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon \n     payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Janina \n     Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, Diogenes Patricio \n     Rojas, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by the appropriate \n     number during the current fiscal year the total number of \n     immigrant visas available to natives of the country of the \n     aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

                           LABELING\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Abraham) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 52\n\n       Whereas for the past several decades the ``Made in USA'' \n     label has defined a product as having all or virtually all of \n     its parts and labor originating in the United States;\n       Whereas the people of the United States depend upon the \n     integrity of this label when purchasing products;\n       Whereas the label projects a sense of pride for American \n     workmanship and value;\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission has proposed \n     regulations to lower this standard to allow substantial \n     amounts of a product to be of foreign origin;\n       Whereas lowering this standard will be a misrepresentation \n     to consumers in the United States who presently believe \n     products bearing the ``Made in USA'' label were all or \n     virtually all made in the United States;\n       Whereas consumers in the United States are entitled to \n     purchase products with the understanding that the labels on \n     these products reflect consistent definitions; and\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission is responsible for \n     safeguarding the consumer from unfair, deceptive, and \n     fraudulent practices: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) maintains that the standard for the ``Made in USA'' \n     label should continue to be that a product was all or \n     virtually all made in the United States; and\n       (2) urges the Federal Trade Commission to refrain from \n     lowering this standard at the expense of consumers and jobs \n     in the United States.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Spencer \nAbraham of Michigan, I am pleased to submit a resolution opposing a \nproposal by the Federal Trade Commission to allow the ``Made in the \nUSA'' label to be applied by products that are not made in the United \nStates. If the FTC's proposal were to take effect, it would result in \nmisleading and inaccurate claims and could ultimately cause widespread \ndeception and consumer confusion. Moreover, the FTC's proposal would \nencourage manufacturers to send U.S. jobs abroad.\n  The FTC's recent proposal would reverse 50 years of precedent by the \nuse of the ``Made in USA'' label even for products with as much as 25 \npercent or more, foreign labor or materials if they were substantially \ntransformed in the United States. In some instances this could result \nin a product being labeled as ``Made in the USA'', even if all of the \nproduct's materials or components were made abroad.\n  Under current rules, products can only be labeled as made in the USA. \nIf all or virtually all of the products is made in the United States. \nThis strict rule ensures that American consumers can rely on the \nassertions made by manufacturers, on U.S. made products. American \nconsumers have come to rely on this label, as insurance that the \ncomponents, materials, and labor used to make the product are from the \nUnited States. To change the standard would invite confusion and \nundermine the value of the made in the USA label.\n  The FTC's proposal is opposed by many of the country's leading \nconsumer groups, including the National Consumer's League, the National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens, and Citizen Action. Moreover, many leading \nmanufacturers, agriculture groups, and labor unions oppose changes to \nthe current standard. In my State of South Carolina one of our pre-\neminent manufactures, Nucor Steel Corp., is among the corporations \nopposed to the FTC changes.\n  In addition, by permitting manufacturers to mislabel their products, \nthe FTC is encouraging American employers to transfer manufacturing of \ncomponents or materials abroad. Because consumers prefer products made \nin the United States, the ``Made in USA'' label is strong incentive for \nmanufacturers to keep jobs in the United States. By permitting \nmanufacturers to shift manufacturing abroad where they can pay lower \nwages and still maintain the benefits of labeling products as made in \nthe USA, the FTC is explicitly encouraging the transfer of jobs abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9219-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9219-S9236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT \n    OF 1997 PRESCRIPTION DRUG USERS FEE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 1130\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 830) to amend the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act \nto improve the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological \nproducts, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to extend my \nheartfelt congratulations to Etta Moten Barnett on the occasion of her \nrecent 96th birthday. Mrs. Barnett is a remarkable woman who has lived \na life of great artistic and civic achievement.\n  By the time she was 30, Mrs. Barnett was married, had three children, \ndivorced, and returned to school. After receiving a fine arts degree in \nvoice from the University of Kansas, Mrs. Barnett moved to New York \nCity to begin an illustrious career in show business that would take \nher around the world and before millions of people.\n  Mrs. Barnett distinguished herself with her incredible singing \nability, both on the stage and on the silver screen. Her theatrical \naccomplishments include Broadway performances of ``Porgy and Bess'', \n``Fast and Furious'', ``Sugar Hill'', ``Zombie'', and ``Lysistrata''. \nGeorge Gershwin wrote the role of Bess with Mrs. Barnett in mind, and \nshe performed in the starring role in the first revival of ``Porgy and \nBess'' on Broadway in 1942.\n  Mrs. Barnett's film credits include ``The Gold Diggers'', ``Flying \nDown to Rio'', and ``My Forgotten Man''. Her stirring performance in \nThe ``Carioca'' earned the film an Oscar nomination for best song. \nAfter seeing her in ``My Forgotten Man'', President Franklin Roosevelt \ninvited Mrs. Barnett to personally sing for him, and thus, she became \nthe first African-American woman ever to perform at the White House.\n  Although Mrs. Barnett stopped performing in 1952, her contributions \nto American society continued. Along with husband Claude Barnett, the \nfounding director of the Associated Negro Press, Mrs. Barnett took an \nactive interest in issues affecting people of color around the world \nand became a champion of equal rights for all people.\n  As a founding member of the North Shore Chapter of the Links, Inc. in \nChicago, Mrs. Barnett continues to give freely of herself to numerous \ncultural and civic organizations. Her commitment to improving the \nplight of women throughout the world was recognized when she was the \nfirst nongovernmental organization representative of the Links at the \nUnited Nations.\n  Etta Moten Barnett is truly an American legend. In honoring her 96th \nbirthday, I join her family, friends, and colleagues in commending her \nfor her outstanding accomplishments. Her talent on Broadway and on film \nhas touched thousands of Americans, and her hard work, gracefulness, \nand civic-mindedness has inspired and set an example for thousands \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9237-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9237-S9238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE ALBERT LEE SMITH, JR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of The \nHonorable Albert Lee Smith, Jr., who died at age 65 on August 12, 1997, \nfrom injuries suffered in a tragic fall at his home. Mr. Smith was a \nfriend, dedicated husband and father. He served with distinction in the \nU.S. House of Representatives during the 96th Congress on behalf of the \npeople of Alabama's Sixth District.\n  Albert Lee Smith, Jr., grew up in Birmingham, AL and received his \nbachelor's degree from Auburn University. Always a leader, he served as \nan officer in the U.S. Navy, and was later awarded an honorary doctor \nof law degree from Samford University.\n  In 1956, Mr. Smith joined the Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Co. in \nBirmingham. For the next 41 years, Mr. Smith had a distinguished career \nas a Chartered Life Underwriter. He served as president of the \nBirmingham Association of Life Underwriters and held several leadership \npositions in other professional organizations.\n  Albert Lee Smith, Jr. was a true gentleman and conservative \nvisionary. He was an extraordinary leader for the Alabama Republican \nParty. Active since 1962, Mr. Smith served as a\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\npollwatcher, precinct captain and vicechairman of the county party. At \nthe time of his untimely passing, he was serving as a vice-chairman of \nthe Alabama Republican Executive Committee. Further, Mr. Smith was a \ndelegate to the 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984 Republican National \nConventions.\n  Driven by his desire to help Alabamians, Albert Lee Smith, Jr., ran \nfor Congress to work for lower taxes and a smaller, more efficient \ngovernment for the American people. Among the first in Congress to do \nso, Congressman Smith demonstrated concern for the strength of American \nfamilies as the sponsor of the Family Protection Act. As a member of \nthe House Budget Committee and the Committee on Veteran's Affairs, he \nsupported tax cuts and a strong national defense.\n  Albert Lee Smith, Jr., knew the importance of restoring America's \nfinancial and spiritual health for our children and grandchildren. For \nhis dedicated service, Congressman Smith was honored by several \nimportant awards: The Taxpayers Best Friend Award from the National \nTaxpayers' Union; the Leadership Award from the American Security \nCouncil; and the Golden Bulldog Award from the Watchdog of the \nTreasury, among others.\n  Congressman Smith was a public servant of the first order. The \nAlabama Republican Party nominated him as its candidate for the U.S. \nSenate in 1984. Following his departure from the House of \nRepresentatives, President Ronald Reagan named him in 1985 to the \nFederal Council on Aging, an appointment subsequently confirmed by the \nU.S. Senate.\n  An exemplary citizen, leader and role model, Congressman Smith served \nas a board member of the Birmingham Campus Crusade for Christ and was a \nmember of the Kiwanis Club and the Metropolitan Board of the YMCA. Mr. \nSmith served as a deacon at the First Baptist Church in Birmingham and \nwas elected by the Southern Baptist Convention to the Baptist Joint \nCommittee on Public Affairs. As a husband, father and friend, Albert \nLee Smith, Jr., was a compassionate and thoughtful human being.\n  My prayers go out to Albert's wife, Eunie Walldorf Smith, their \nchildren, Karen, Smith, Albert Smith, and Meg Wallace, and their family \nand friends. The Honorable Albert Lee Smith's lifelong dedication to \ncommunity and country made our world a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9237-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, this bill establishes wildlife \nobservation, hunting, fishing, and environmental education as the \npriority public uses of the refuge system. We have found in the State \nof Florida that even wildlife observation can become incompatible if \nnot carefully regulated and managed.\n  For example, at Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, visitors \nenjoy observing the manatees that this refuge was established to \nprotect. The favored way of observing the animals is by swimming with \nthem in the refuge waters. A few years ago, the Fish and Wildlife \nService discovered that so many people were engaging in this activity \nthat many of the manatees were leaving the refuge that was designed for \ntheir protection. The agency determined that this form of wildlife \nobservation was occurring at levels that were incompatible with the \npurpose of the refuge and had to establish certain limits on when and \nwhere people could engage in this activity and how many could do so at \none time.\n  Am I correct that even those so-called wildlife-dependent activities \nthat are considered priority public uses in the bill must be found to \nbe compatible with the purposes of the refuges and the mission of the \nsystem? And, that as a part of this determination, the Fish and \nWildlife Service must consider whether there are adequate funds \navailable to administer the use in a manner that is compatible?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct. Even though we are designating wildlife \nobservation, hunting, fishing, and environmental education as priority \npublic uses the bill requires each of these to pass the compatibility \ntest. Even these uses have occasionally been determined to be \nincompatible on a number of refuges in the past and may be so in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, this bill--for the first time in law--would \nestablish a definition for the term ``compatible.'' This is one of the \nsingle most important aspects of this legislation. Too often in the \npast, activities have been allowed on refuges that have harmed the fish \nand wildlife and habitats that these areas were designed to protect. \nThere has been some concern that the definition used in the bill is \noverly vague. The bill defines a compatible use as one that will not \n``materially interfere with or detract from the purpose of a refuge or \nthe mission of the Refuge System.''\n  The House committee report on this bill further clarified that what \nthis language means is that a use is compatible if it will not have a \ntangible adverse impact on refuge purposes. Is it also your \nunderstanding that this is what is meant by this definition?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. That is the correct interpretation of what is meant \nby this definition. A compatible use is one that will not have a \ntangible adverse impact on refuge purposes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, the third part of our amendment concerns \nthe issuance of permits for such uses as electric utility rights-of-way \nthat may be of longer than 10 years in duration.\n  The underlying bill requires that all non-wildlife-dependent uses be \nreevaluated every 10 years to ensure they are still compatible. The \nlanguage of our amendment directs that for uses that are authorized for \nmore than 10 years, such as utility right-of-way the Fish and Wildlife \nService will evaluate compliance with the original terms and conditions \nof the permit and not the authorization of the right-of-way itself.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Your understanding is correct. This amendment is intended \nto address the concerns of those with permits for more permanent or \nsemipermanent physical structures such as powerlines.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, some have pointed out correctly that, in \nthe case of unforeseen changes in circumstances, it may occasionally be \nnecessary to adjust a use to ensure that it remains compatible. My \nunderstanding is that utility companies have been willing and able to \nmake minor adjustments to their facilities to ensure that they remain \ncompatible.\n  Mr. Chairman, am I correct to understand that this amendment will \nstill allow the flexibility to make such adjustments to facilities that \nhave been authorized for more than 10 years in order to ensure that \nthey remain compatible?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9238-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9238-S9239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   APPLAUDING LITHUANIA AND POLAND FOR HOSTING THE VILNIUS CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud Lithuania \nand Poland for their efforts in promoting peace and security in Central \nand Eastern Europe. This past weekend, Lithuania and Poland hosted an \ninternational conference in Vilnius on the subject of coexistence \nbetween nations and good neighborly relations. The conference brought \ntogether the leaders of 11 countries--Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, \nEstonia, Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Belarus, \nFinland, and Russia--to discuss practical ways to promoting peaceful \nrelations among their peoples. Lithuania and Poland pointed to \nimprovements in their own relationship as a model for other nations. I \nalso commend President Clinton for recognizing the leadership of \nLithuania and Poland on this issue, by sending the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State for European Affairs as the United States \nrepresentative to the Vilnius conference.\n  In convening this conference, Lithuania and Poland stressed the \nessential connections between democratic institutions, free markets, \nand peace. Democratic institutions are founded on the values of \ntolerance and respect for individual and minority rights; values which \npromote good relations between neighbors. Free markets are providing \nthe people of that region with unprecedented opportunities to improve \ntheir lives in material terms, giving them an incentive to put aside \nold animosities and differences. And of course, peace provides an \nenvironment in which democratic institutions and free markets can \nflourish. The work of the Vilnius conference advances major\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\nAmerican foreign policy goals: security in the North Atlantic region \nand the expansion of democratic institutions and free markets.\n  Lithuania and Poland are meeting their responsibilities in the new \nEurope. They are leading the way in forging a new pattern of politics \nin Europe, as Secretary of State Albright called for during her trip to \nLithuania last July. During her visit, Secretary Albright stated that \nany new members of NATO must be producers of security, not merely \nconsumers. Mr. President, by reaching out to their neighbors--including \nRussia--Lithuania and Poland are showing themselves to be producers of \nsecurity. They are, in short, excellent candidates for NATO membership. \nWe in the Senate should do all we can to encourage Lithuania and Poland \nin their efforts to promote security in the North Atlantic region and \nto support their membership in NATO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9238-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the U.S. Air \nForce on its 50th anniversary, which will be celebrated across the \ncountry on September 18, 1997.\n  On July 26, 1947, the National Security Act was signed into law by \nPresident Truman. This act established the U.S. Air Force as a separate \nbranch of our Nation's Armed Forces. On September 18, 1947, W. Stuart \nSymington was sworn in as the first Secretary of the Air Force. Eight \ndays later, Gen. Carl A. Spaatz became the Air Force's first Chief of \nStaff.\n  While 1947 marked the beginning of the Air Force as we know it today, \nthe U.S. official involvement with the military applications of flight \nactually started 40 years earlier in 1907. On August 1 of that year--\njust 3 years after the Wright Brothers' historic first manned flight--\nthe Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps was \nestablished. This was the forerunner of today's Air Force. The \nAeronautical Division's mission was to ``take charge of all matters \npertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and all kindred \nsubjects.'' It is from this initial mandate that the Air Force has \nevolved into the indispensable force which today provides the United \nStates with ``Global Reach, Global Power.''\n  With its founding in 1947, the Air Force became an equal partner with \nthe Army, Navy, and Marine Corps in our Nation's Armed Forces. It did \nnot take long for the Air Force to make history. Within 2 weeks of its \ncreation, the Air Force hit the first of many impressive milestones. On \nOctober 14, 1947, a young Air Force captain by the name of Chuck Yeager \ncourageously piloted the X-1 on the first supersonic flight.\n  Beginning in June 1948, it was the Air Force that was called upon to \ntake the lead in the Berlin Airlift. Dubbed Operation Vittles and over \nthe course of the next 15 months, the Anglo-American airlift delivered \na total of 2.3 million tons of food, fuel, and supplies to sustain the \npeople of that beleaguered city.\n  The theme of this 50th anniversary year for the Air Force--``Golden \nLegacy--Boundless Future''--is very appropriate because facing \nchallenges has been the hallmark of the Air Force. They have always \naimed high. The Air Force has achieved countless numbers of aviation \nfirsts that are the envy of the aeronautical world. Lesser known \nactions, though, are also an important part of the Air Force's golden \nlegacy and should also be celebrated. For instance, on July 1, 1949, \nthe Air Force became the first service to announce an end to racial \nsegregation in its ranks.\n  The greatest strength in all of the military services has always been \nin its members themselves. Without any doubt and question, Gens. Hap \nArnold and Jimmie Doolittle and Sen. Ira Eaker are great Air Force \nlegends in their own right. So too though is Lt. Col. John Paul Stapp, \na Air Force flight surgeon who in 1954 rode a rocket sled to 632 mph \nand then decelerated to zero in 125 seconds. He survived more than 35 \ntimes the force of gravity in order to determine if a pilot could eject \nfrom an airplane at supersonic speed and live. We should also remember \nCol. Robin Olds who, on January 2, 1967, became the first and only U.S. \nAir Force ace with 12 victories in World War II and 4 victories in \nVietnam.\n  Over the past 50 years the men and women of the Air Force have served \nwith honor and distinction in the major conflicts of Korea, Vietnam, \nand in the Persian Gulf. They have been the faithful stewards of two-\nthirds of America's arsenal of nuclear weapons. They have kept the \npeace deep below the Earth in missile silos and high in the heavens in \nreconnaissance aircraft.\n  The Air Force truly does have a golden legacy that we should all take \ntime to reflect upon and honor. I am confident that the Air Force's \nrich history is the foundation of its boundless future. Regardless of \nany future threat our Nation may face, the Air Force will meet the \nchallenge just as they always have.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the 50th \nanniversary of the United States Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9239-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9239-S9240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONDEMNATION OF BOMBING IN JERUSALEM\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, the American people watched with horror and \ndisgust as the incidents of sexual misconduct at Aberdeen Proving \nGround unfolded last fall. As details emerged at Aberdeen and other \nArmy training facilities, the extent and seriousness of this problem \nbecame increasingly and terribly evident.\n  As a result of these events, the Secretary of the Army, Togo West, \ncommissioned his senior review panel and tasked the Army Inspector \nGeneral to conduct two separate widescale investigations of sexual \nharassment within the Army. Today, the Secretary released the results \nof these two studies.\n  Both reports delivered a scathing indictment of the climate and lack \nof leadership that permits sexual harassment to permeate all levels of \nthe Army.\n  Mr. President, in each case involving leaders and trainees, the \nsexual misconduct which occurred at Aberdeen and elsewhere within the \nArmy was a result of abuse of authority. The key to solving this \nproblem is to eliminate the systemic conditions which created the \natmosphere which allowed these outrageous and egregious instances of \nabuse to occur. The Army's equal opportunity system, which is supposed \nto provide a safety valve when all else fails, is itself a complete and \nutter failure--devoid of support by the chain of command and lacking \ncredibility by those it seeks to protect.\n  The stark reality is that only 5 percent of the 9,000 people \nsurveyed, as part of the Army's own review, said they would use the \nformal complaint mechanism provided by the equal opportunity system.\n  Mr. President, what kind of program engenders confidence in only 5 \npercent of the population? The answer is simple. One that is badly \nbroken, and in desperate need of repair.\n  The reports released today found that sexual harassment exists \nthroughout the Army, crossing gender, rank, and racial lines. They also \nfound that the Army leadership is the critical factor in creating, \nmaintaining, and enforcing an environment of respect and dignity, yet \ntoo many leaders have failed to gain the trust of their soldiers.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have taken a long hard \nlook at sexual harassment throughout the military. I have made visits \nto Fort Jackson, SC, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and Camp Lejeune, NC. \nAs part of these visits, I asked the Army about the quality of its \nsexual harassment training designed to sensitize both instructors and \ntrainees to the problems of sexual harassment. Army officials assured \nme that the training was adequate, but today's shocking report reveals \notherwise.\n  The Inspector General's survey reported that professionals and \nleaders who are expected to deal with soldiers reporting incidents of \ninappropriate sexual behavior need to be trained and qualified, \nindicating that is obviously not the case today.\n  Army officials must act swiftly and aggressively to change the \nclimate that has allowed sexual harassment to permeate the Army. These \nsame officials must also vastly improve the education provided to both \ninstructors and\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\ntrainees to ensure beyond the shadow of a doubt that all parties \nunderstand their responsibilities with regard to sexual harassment. The \nequal opportunity system has clearly failed and must be repaired so \nthat victims of sexual harassment will have confidence that Army \nleadership will act on valid complaints and actively seek to eliminate \nsexual harassment.\n  Today's acknowledgment by the Army is a first step that identifies \nthe alarming scope of this problem. Now, it is incumbent upon the \nmilitary and on our civilian leaders to put an end to sexual harassment \nonce and for all.\n  I will again meet with Army officials tomorrow and will continue to \naggressively pursue changes to eliminate the poisonous environment that \nallows such pervasive levels of sexual harassment to undermine the good \norder and discipline of the United States Army, so crucial to our \nnational security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/11/senate-section/article/S9240-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
