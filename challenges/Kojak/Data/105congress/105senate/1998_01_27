Mr. President, I also hope that all Members are ready for \nwhat I hope will be a very productive second session of the 105th \nCongress. I have spent some time with the distinguished Democratic \nleader. We have talked in general about bills we want to try to \nconsider before the Easter recess in April, and of course we have gone \nover the schedule just for this week. We have a number of very \nimportant legislative items that we need to consider before the Easter \nrecess, including, I hope, even a budget resolution. I think it is \nimportant this year that we not go after April the 15th to take up a \nbudget resolution. I will be talking further to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and the ranking member and the leadership to make sure \nthat we are all in agreement in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of potential \nfloor items and a calendar for the first week of the session be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n list of potential items that may be considered in the Senate prior to \n                      the scheduled Easter recess\n\n       Auto choice bill.\n       Budget resolution.\n       Campaign Fin.

Mr. President, no legislative or executive business will be \ntransacted during today's session. Therefore, no votes will occur \nduring the session of the Senate today. We will recess mid to late \nafternoon to reconvene at 8:30 p.m. this evening in the Chamber. All \nMembers are asked to be in the Chamber at approximately 8:30 in order \nthat we can go over as a body to the Hall of the House of \nRepresentatives to hear the President's State of the Union Address \nbeginning at 9 p.m. this evening.\n  During tomorrow's session we will consider three judicial \nnominations, those being Barry Silverman to be a circuit judge for the \nninth circuit, Richard Story, to be a district judge for the northern \ndistrict of Georgia, and Ann Aiken, to be a district judge in Oregon. \nWe hope to enter into a time agreement of approximately 2 hours, with \nrollcall votes expected on each nomination. Therefore, there could be \nthree votes tomorrow, Wednesday. In fact, I think the Members should \nexpect that there will be three votes.\n  Then on Thursday of this week we hope to consider the Ronald Reagan \nairport bill which is presently in the Commerce Committee. Amendments \ncould be offered. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur on that \nitem on Thursday of this week.\n  The Senate will not be in session on Friday. Following the Senate's \nconsideration of the Ronald Reagan bill, the Senate would proceed over \nuntil Monday, February 2nd. The schedule for Monday will be announced \nlater in the week. However, no votes will occur during the session on \nMonday. We do expect votes, of course, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday \nof next week.\n  We will be talking to committee chairmen, sponsors of bills and with \nthe Democratic leadership to decide exactly what bills could come up. \nWe are considering possibly the PUHCA legislation, the Public Utilities \nHolding Company Act modifications. We are still considering a cloning \nbill that I believe could be considered. We have several others that we \nare considering, as well.\n  Next week we expect to take up the FEC, the Federal Election \nCommission nominees, the nomination of Mr. Satcher to be the Surgeon \nGeneral, and possibly two more Federal judges that are now going \nthrough the process of being cleared.\n  I do want to say, again, Mr. President, I appreciate the year we had \nlast year. I thought we had a good year. I thought we accomplished a \ngreat deal for the American people, most of the time with very little \nrancor. I want us to continue to be able to work together for the \ninterests of the people and do it in a way where Members are not \nexhausted and they can do their work during the daylight instead of \nalways at night.\n  I want to thank those of you that work for the Senate here in the \nChamber. You do outstanding work and we quite often don't thank you \nsufficiently for the way you help us keep things running smoothly doing \nthe people's business here in the Senate.\n  I do look forward to a very active year even though we may have \naround 100 legislative days--because of the necessity of adjourning \nearly in October for the election. There are several things we need to \ndo and we will do for the best interests of the American people. I look \nforward to working with the\n\n[[Page S3]]\n\nSenate and working with the leadership on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S2-5", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECOND SESSION OF THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I welcome back the majority leader and \nagain wish him a happy New Year and commend him for his leadership. \nDuring the past 3 months, when we have not been here, I have seen him \non several public appearances and, as always, he has been articulate \nand very forthcoming with regard to the schedule and our plans for the \ncoming weeks. I welcome the opportunity to work closely with him as we \npursue our national agenda, and appreciate very much the cooperation he \nhas already demonstrated in helping senators make plans both in terms \nof days, as well as weeks, ahead. I trust the past 3 months have been \nproductive and enjoyable, Mr. President, and I expect it has provided \nus with rest and the perspective to fulfill our obligations now.\n\n  It is obvious we return under very difficult circumstances. \nAllegations have been made against the President and have been \nvehemently denied. The legal process continues, flawed as it may be. \nWhile the circumstances may be extraordinary, the work of this \nGovernment must go on. The American system is uniquely constructed to \nwithstand the winds of controversy and crisis which howl throughout \nhistory, and this moment is no exception. Important matters are at \nhand, dealing with both foreign and domestic policy, and the American \npeople have a right to insist that their leaders continue to give those \nmatters their full attention.\n  Congress has a clear responsibility--a duty and an obligation--to go \nabout our work on behalf of the American people. Despite allegations, \ninvestigations, and obvious distractions, our country would be ill-\nserved if we were to allow interruption in the steady function of \nGovernment or the remarkable progress that we have made on matters of \ngreat importance to our Nation.\n  Democratic Senators begin this year with a true sense of \naccomplishment over what we have achieved and a sense of purpose \ndirected toward the challenges ahead. We need to continue the economic \nmomentum born of the 1993 budget plan, a momentum that will propel us \nin 1998 to the first balanced budget in over 30 years, and our first \nopportunity in our lifetime to reduce the accumulated debt.\n  South Dakotans, like all Americans, have made clear their \nexpectations. Having just returned from home, my conversations with \nSouth Dakotans remain clear and well understood. South Dakotans have \nurged us to work together, to continue to demonstrate that democracy \ncan be both responsive and effective in addressing the challenges that \nlie ahead. They say, build on the extraordinary budgetary and economic \nrecord of the last 5 years, pay off the debt, solve the Social Security \nand Medicare problems we face. Remember that 42 million of us have no \nhealth insurance--find a way to solve that national embarrassment. \nRemember, above all, in this new age of information, that education, \nbeginning virtually at birth, is one of the most important \nresponsibilities of government at every level. There is so much to be \ndone: Improve wages and child care, fix our political finance system \nthat is broken and in great need of repair, be a leader to the world.\n  New and old democracies around the world look to us for leadership, \nand there is no one else. In Iraq and Bosnia, in Europe and Asia, \nAmerica's leadership is needed now more than ever. That is the message \ngiven to me by South Dakotans back home over and over again. Their \nwisdom dictates our collective response.\n  Now is the time to go to work. As the majority leader has already \nindicated, we have very few days in this session of Congress. We must \napproach our work with urgency and with energy.\n  We must make the most of each one. Over the past few months, \nDemocrats in the Senate and House, working with the administration, \nhave built a legislative agenda that addresses many of the challenges \nour country must face. It will build on the themes that we hear tonight \nin the State of the Union Message. It represents the legislative \nembodiment of the priorities contained in the President's budget to be \nsubmitted next week.\n  So, again, I look forward to working closely with the majority \nleader. We will all certainly work with our Republican colleagues, \nbecause we believe this can be a most productive session. We begin \ntoday by extending a hand of partnership and a sincere hope for real \nsuccess. I thank, again, the majority leader for offering me the \nopportunity to respond to his kind remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ALICE WYNNE GATSIS SPEAKS ON THE 10TH AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the North Carolina General Assembly \nembarked in 1997 on a significant course--that of inviting some of our \nState's best-known and best-qualified citizens\n\n[[Page S4]]\n\nto address joint sessions of the legislature's house and senate. Dr. \nBilly Graham, for example, made a remarkable and unforgettable \nappearance during the year.\n  Meanwhile, the North Carolina General Assembly's Select Committee on \nFederal Education grants heard a splendid address by a prominent and \nlearned North Carolina lady, Mrs. Alice Wynne Gatsis, of Rocky Mount, \nwhose distinguished husband is a retired general of the U.S. Army, \nAndrew J. Gatsis.\n  General and Mrs. Gatsis are stouthearted defenders of the U.S. \nConstitution. They are exceedingly knowledgeable about the perils \nconfronting this Nation as a result of constant tampering with the \nintent and the meaning of the Constitution. In short, Alice Wynne \nGatsis and her husband understand the miracle of America.\n  That, Mr. President, is why the North Carolina General Assembly's \nSelect Committee on Federal Education Grants invited Mrs. Gatsis to \naddress the committee on November 10 of last year.\n  Mr. President, I have in hand the text of Mrs. Gatsis' address and, \nbeing enormously impressed with her remarks, I have decided to share \nthem with Senators and others who read the Congressional Record.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nMrs. Gatsis' address be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Alice Wynne Gatsis--November 10, 1997--Speech to the N.C. General \n    Assembly--House of Representatives--Select Committee on Federal \n                            Education Grants\n\n     Note: For purposes of definition, and the benefit of any \n     egalitarians among us, I will be referring to man and men \n     generically in the sense of man being the human race--it is \n     not my intention to slight the ladies.\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Ladies and gentlemen I have been invited to \n     speak this morning on the Tenth Amendment, that heart of the \n     U.S. Constitution which says, ``The powers not delegated by \n     the Constitution or prohibited by it to the States are \n     reserved to the states, respectively or to the people.\n       You may be asking yourselves, busy people that you are, an \n     important committee with an important mission, why this \n     subject at this time?\n       It seems to me that every now and then in a nation there \n     comes a time when there is a need for restoration, a \n     resetting of the pillars that are the foundation of all that \n     is great in America. It must be apparent to many in both \n     public and private life that the time has come.\n       It must be apparent, as well, that for some time an \n     evolutionary process of unconstitutional usurpation of power \n     has escalated to an alarming degree, and in spite of the law \n     of the government (the Constitution) which forbids it.\n       All aspects of the domestic affairs of the people have \n     become a federal concern to the point where we now have a \n     president and congressmen, and, yes, innumerable bureaucrats, \n     bureaucrats who appear to be accountable to nobody, \n     addressing daily the domestic affairs of the people from soup \n     to nuts.\n       It was not pleasing to hear Donna Shalala, Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, say, at her confirmation hearings \n     in the first Clinton administration, that the President views \n     the states as ``laboratories'' for the federal government. \n     Her statement represents the apotheosis of many years of \n     usurpation and preemption which has taken place in all \n     administrations, not just the Clinton administration, for the \n     last fifty years. It has slipped into our great free system \n     on quiet little feet, taking a step forward and a step back \n     but steadily advancing in the path toward centralizing and \n     unifying the divided and enumerated powers which have made us \n     a free people. There are reasons innumerable that such \n     unlawful inroads have been made, perhaps federal money, \n     perhaps false philanthropy, perhaps expediency. It is not \n     necessary to engage in the ``politically correct'' subjective \n     analysis of ``why.'' Objective judgment reveals that the \n     problem exists and must be addressed, if the first great \n     republic in history is to be the inherited blessing of our \n     descendants.\n       Attention to the 10th amendment is growing as its \n     importance cannot be overestimated. What would the system be \n     like without it? Where would you be?\n       The founders were not ignorant men; they drew on their \n     knowledge of Greek and Roman law, the American colonial \n     experience, the English legacy of common law and checks upon \n     power, the Christian theories of natural law and then they \n     added that best and newest ingredient, government at the \n     local level. State legislators sit at the pinnacle close to \n     the people with their powers enumerated over all domestic \n     law. There is no finer elective position in the country. The \n     authority of state legislators, faithfully executed has power \n     in many ways to keep America stable.\n       Thankfully, it can be said that the 200 year old \n     Constitution stands, relatively unchanged, amended only 17 \n     times since the Bill of Rights. Within it, the 10th \n     Amendment, in spite of assaults against it, stands unchanged \n     too, because when Con-cons and conferences of the States come \n     along, the people realize that their Constitution is \n     endangered and combine to preserve it.\n       One of the strongest reasons for defeating the Equal Rights \n     Amendment, once the emotional aspects of it were put in \n     perspective, was that it was a major 10th amendment issue, \n     the second part of this amendment transferred all authority \n     over the domestic affairs of the nation to the Federal level. \n     Not everyone realized that this was the true goal but \n     constitutionalists did.\n       Standing in the way of ratification of the United Nations \n     Treaty on the Political Rights of Women and the U.N. Treaty \n     on the Rights of the Child is the Tenth Amendment.\n       The discredited health plan of the first Clinton \n     administration ran into roadblocks as the bevy of lawyers \n     assigned to the health care commission were told, ``You can't \n     do that because of the 10th amendment.''\n       The recent Supreme Court ruling that the Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Act is unconstitutional, drove a dagger into the \n     heart of some conservatives who will bend the Constitution a \n     bit if their issue is at stake, but Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Act really is unconstitutional. The ruling of the \n     court made it clear that the enforcement power of the 14th \n     amendment does not override the broad powers of the 10th.\n       One great ally of the Tenth Amendment is Supreme Court \n     Justice Clarence Thomas. He has enunciated hard nosed \n     positions limiting federal power. Writing about him, Joseph \n     Sobran said, ``In the 1995 Term Limits Case, he insisted on \n     the pertinence of the Tenth Amendment and added a brilliant \n     new twist to the debate. The Tenth not only limits the \n     federal government to its enumerated powers, he argued, it \n     reserves to the states and to the people all powers not \n     specifically denied to them.''\n       The clear purpose of the founders when they produced the \n     U.S. Constitution was to create a federal government with \n     strictly limited powers. It was the states who created the \n     federal government not the other way around. Their shared \n     attitude was best expressed by Thomas Jefferson when he said, \n     ``In questions of power then, let no more be said of faith in \n     man, but bind him down with the chains of the Constitution.'' \n     Also he said, after reading the new constitution, which he, \n     of course, had no part in writing, ``I assume that if the \n     federal government were to be involved in education, there \n     would have to be a constitutional amendment.'' There has been \n     no constitutional amendment in this area, because it is \n     understood that the American people do not want education \n     transferred to the federal level. They are the rightful \n     authorities over the education of their children; their \n     authority is protected by the 10th amendment and state \n     legislators are obligated to uphold that right--no where in \n     the Constitution is ``here-in granted'' for the federal \n     government to make laws about education and no where is there \n     authority for legislators to transfer voluntarily their \n     enumerated power to another branch of government.\n       There are those who would, if possible, scrap the \n     Constitution. They have openly said so; they are prominent \n     people, known public figures. One of their spokesmen, \n     Professor James McGregor Burns said it, during the observance \n     of the 200th anniversary of the ratification of the \n     Constitution. I thought it a strange way to celebrate this \n     occasion, but he said ``let's face reality, the framers have \n     simply been too shrewd for us. They have out witted us. They \n     designed separated institutions that cannot be unified by \n     mechanical linkages, frail bridges, tinkering. If we are to \n     turn the founders upside down, to put together what they put \n     asunder, we must directly confront the constitutional \n     structure which they erected.'' This quote comes from page \n     160 of Professor Burns book Reforming American Government.\n       Threads of this agenda from Reforming American Government \n     surface from time to time. For instance in Newt Gingrich's \n     new contract with America 2000. He wants that year's \n     Republican candidates for the House, Senate and Presidency to \n     run as a team committed to enacting a 10 point contract with \n     America. He foresees a parliamentary-like campaign in which \n     the entire national party runs on a unified platform. This \n     has the net effect of solidifying allegiance to the Party and \n     diluting allegiance to the Constitution and Congressional \n     constituents. The Contracts with America are 10th amendment \n     issues, because they generally address domestic affairs--but \n     never mind that--``conservative'' activists are already \n     trying to get their issues into the Contract.\n       Identifying the undermining of local state government, \n     several legislatures have passed 10th amendment resolutions, \n     and more of them will be as evidence mounts that the federal \n     government is out of control, and that ignoring the oath that \n     public servants take is dangerous to the liberty of all.\n       State legislators are so important. You are not only, by \n     decree, closest to the people, along with county and city \n     government, but you come from among us--the people. You are \n     our neighbors, our friends and part of the businesses and \n     activities that make up our various communities. Any \n     qualified citizen can sit in the halls of the legislatures if \n     fellow citizens so elect. Once that happens and the oath is \n     taken, you become a citizen-legislator who can represent the \n     rest of us only\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\n     by strict adherence to the law of the Constitution. Since the \n     majority are not always right, that adherence to the \n     Constitution assures justice for all. The 10th amendment, \n     then, protects the law-makers and the people to whom they are \n     bound. This is an arrangement worth preserving.\n       Why then have state legislators been allowing their just \n     powers to slip away? Federal bureaucracies are doing more and \n     more unconstitutional runs around them.\n       It is time for a wake up call. As this committee prepares \n     to take up its duties, more end runs are occurring in \n     Washington. On Friday president Clinton traded off some of \n     his national education standards for a couple of years, and \n     the House voted overwhelmingly to fund charter schools by one \n     hundred million dollars, giving them a certain autonomy if \n     they teach performance-based education. The President, who \n     has no enumerated authority, any more than Congress does, \n     over education has highly endorsed charter schools as long as \n     they teach national standards. The net effect will be the \n     nationalizing, long term, of the school system, putting it \n     into the hands of special interest private boards, gradually \n     absorbing current public and private schools.\n       So much for elected local school boards, so much for local \n     legislators if they let it continue.\n       The more these federal intrusions into education create \n     massive failures in education, the more bent these federal \n     ``nannies'' seem to be on more of the same.\n       Will state legislators seize the initiatives which are \n     rightfully and lawfully theirs? If they do not, as I have \n     said before, they will end up figure heads in a regional \n     satrapy run from somewhere on high.\n       Never before in recent times has the choice been so well \n     defined--On the one side is the Republic of the United States \n     of America a nation under God as defined by the Declaration \n     of Independence, a nation governed by God's law as \n     incorporated into the Constitution. It establishes limited \n     government, and divided powers. Most of all it leaves \n     citizens free to guide and direct their own lives. God given \n     rights are unalienable and may not be taken away; they are \n     eternal.\n       At the opposite end of the spectrum is the United Nations \n     Charter which enshrines the religion of man (generically \n     speaking) as the source of rights. Man through government can \n     give and take away rights from other men, women and children. \n     It is government farthest from the people run by councils of \n     ``wise'' men. We will have to choose whom we will serve. \n     Knowing that where the spirit of God is, there is the spirit \n     of liberty. I trust that citizen and legislator alike will \n     not remove the ancient landmarks which our fathers have set.\n       In summary, this select committee has some very serious \n     matters to investigate, probably the tip of the iceberg--in \n     an ongoing chore. I wish you well and hope that you will ever \n     keep before you the basic truths of the 10th amendment base. \n     The law is on your side.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this evening we will hear from the \nPresident of the United States in his State of the Union Address. We \nlive in a time where the United States is extraordinarily fortunate. We \nare at peace. We are a Nation that has great prosperity. We are a \nNation with a balanced budget for the first time in 25 years. This is \nall good news. But there looms on the horizon a fiscal policy which, if \nwe do not address in the coming near term, will dramatically undermine \nour Nation and make it difficult to pass on to our children a country \nof prosperity. That, of course, is the pending retirement, beginning in \nthe latter part of the next decade, of the postwar baby-boom \ngeneration, that huge demographic group of which I and the President \nare members, which has impacted this country this very decade in some \nunique way, and which in the next two decades will, as a result of \ntheir retiring have an impact of basically bankrupting this country in \nthe Social Security system, which so many seniors rely on, if we do not \naddress these concerns.\n  The opportunity to address these concerns is today. It is much like \nthat oil filter ad, ``You can pay me now or you can pay me later.'' The \nopportunity to make changes in our Social Security system, which will \nallow for its solvency, allow it to be a strong and vibrant part of our \nfabric as a Nation, the opportunity for those changes to be effective \nand to be done reasonably, is much better today than if we wait for 4, \n5 or 10 years.\n  In addition, of course, as we head into a time of surplus, there will \nbe, as a basic policy in this Chamber and in the House, over the next \nfew months a question of how we use that surplus. What is generating \nthe surplus should be the first question. What is generating the \nsurplus is the Social Security trust fund. For the foreseeable future, \nthe extent to which we generate a surplus at the Federal level will be \nas a result of the fact that more people are paying Social Security \ntaxes than are taking benefits out of the Social Security trust fund. \nIt is not a surplus generated, therefore, as a result of the day-to-day \noperation of Government being in surplus, of having raised more tax \nrevenues for the day-to-day operation of the Government--defense, \neducation, environmental protection, building roads, for those accounts \nincome surplus; rather, it is a surplus generated by the fact that \npeople who pay payroll taxes are paying more in payroll taxes to \nsupport people on retirement under Social Security than they need to.\n  That should be retained as a primary point as we move down the road \nof addressing the surplus issue. Therefore, I would like to posture \nthat if we are going to be responsible as legislators and as keepers of \nour Nation's future, we have an obligation to address the issue of \nSocial Security and address it in the short-term, rather than to wait. \nI also would like to suggest a manner in which we might consider \naddressing it. One of our goals, as we look at the issue of the \nsurplus, should be to give people tax relief. Another goal, as we look \nat the issue of the surplus, should be to pay down the Federal debt. A \nthird goal, as we look at the issue of addressing how we are going to \ndeal with the surplus, should be to increase the savings of the \nAmerican people. A fourth goal should be to assure the solvency of the \nmost critical Federal program that we have, the Social Security system.\n  All four of those goals can be significantly advanced if we \nintelligently approach the use of the surplus and apply it to benefit \nthe Social Security system. How can we do that?\n\n  Well, the best way would be to cut the Social Security tax. This is \nthe most regressive tax we have. It is also the taxes generating the \nsurplus. If we were to reduce the Social Security tax so that the \naverage wage earner, instead of paying approximately 7\\1/2\\ percent, \nwould end up paying 6\\1/2\\ percent; it would mean that the average wage \nearner in this country would receive the benefits directly of a tax \ncut, the purpose of which would be to refund to them the surplus which \nis being generated by the Federal Government.\n  In such a tax cut, if we were to say to the folks receiving it, the \nwage earners, the people paying the payroll tax, if we were to say that \nthe tax cut must be saved in an account designated in your name, a \npersonal savings account, such as an IRA account, then we would be \naccomplishing a second goal, which would be to allow individuals who \nare seeing retirement coming at them to begin to specifically have an \naccount in the Social Security structure which would be in their name \nand on which they could participate in the investment decisions, and \nwhich would most likely return a much better return than the present \nSocial Security system returns, and which would give them an actual \nsavings vehicle.\n  Thirdly, the practical effect of cutting the tax for people who are \nwage earners and allowing them to save would be that we would begin the \nprocess of refunding the liability in the Social Security system. The \nSocial Security system today has a $3 trillion unfunded liability. So \nthat as the postwar baby-boom generation hits the system in 2008, which \nis the first year when the system starts to pay more out than it takes \nin, there becomes a liability that must be paid for through either \nincreased taxes or by reducing the benefit structure of approximately \n$3 trillion. Well, to the extent that we can encourage people to save \nby cutting their taxes today and putting those tax cuts into savings \naccounts, we can significantly reduce the unfunded liability of the \nSocial Security system, which will, in turn, reduce the debt of the \nFederal Government, which would\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\nbe another goal in using the surplus that we presently are confronting, \nor which we are soon to have.\n  So it is great news that we have this surplus. After 25 years, it is \nextraordinary news. But the proper management of this surplus is \nclearly one of the core public policy questions that we have to face as \na Congress. It is my view that the proper management of this surplus \nshould involve returning to the taxpayers the funds that were paid in, \nwhich gave us the surplus, allowing us to give the taxpayers an \nopportunity to save for their retirement, and to assure the solvency of \nthe Social Security system, and to begin to pay down the Federal debt. \nThese are the goals that I believe we should be looking at.\n  I am hopeful that the President, in his State of the Union Address, \nwill set forth a process and a procedure for allowing us to reach these \ntypes of goals. So I look forward to hearing the President's proposals \nin his State of the Union, and I certainly look forward to the next few \nmonths as this Congress wrestles with the issue of how to preserve and \nprotect the Social Security system at the same time that we address the \nbudget surplus.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to discuss a serious matter. I \nhesitate to comment on ongoing law enforcement investigations. I have \nalways felt that way.\n\n  I am not going to jump into the swirling mix of rumor and revelation \nand innuendo that has transfixed many in Washington over the last \nseveral days. I spent nearly a decade as a prosecutor. I have a very \nstrong sense of what prosecutors should and can do. I am one who has \ntried to keep any kind of ideological partisanship out of law \nenforcement decisions. I did that during the time I was a prosecutor, \nand I have urged that same thing to prosecutors since.\n  But I am troubled that the independent counsel law has itself been \ncorrupted and no longer serves its intended purpose. The law was part \nof a congressional effort to create a mechanism that would reassure the \nAmerican people that partisanship was not influencing prosecutorial \ndecisions, and that law enforcement judgment was being exercised by \nthose who did not have an ax to grind either way--by those who \napproached matters from a law enforcement point of view, and not--not--\nfrom a lodestone set in a partisan rock.\n  I cannot say with confidence that this is the case with the current \nWhitewater counsel. I look at the continuing and very selective leaks \nand tactics employed by Mr. Starr's office over the last few years, and \nparticularly over the last few days. And, like so many other Vermonters \nand so many other Americans, it gives me pause to see these kind of \ntactics that no prosecutor should ever condone in his or her offices.\n  I have seen reports that two weeks ago he was intent on constructing \na sting operation to engage the President of the United States in \nsecretly recorded conversations. Have we sunk this low, Mr. President, \nthat we would do things like this?\n  I have seen complaints that he sought to pressure a young woman and \nthreaten her mother and father if she did not cooperate in allegations \nthat she was counseled to lie under oath.\n  Maybe I am missing something here, Mr. President. But this is a far \ndistance from investigating a decade-old land deal in Arkansas. Having \nspent more than $30 million of taxpayers' money in what apparently \nbecame a self-perpetuating investigation, the goal now seems to go \nabout getting the President by whatever means necessary.\n  Last summer I was critical of efforts by Mr. Starr's office to \ninvolve itself in allegations of marital infidelity. The justification \nthen to justify the leaks coming out of Mr. Starr's office was that \nmaybe pillow talk might lead to the discovery of some evidence relevant \nto this decade-old land deal in Arkansas.\n  Now it seems that the current activities of Mr. Starr's office seem \noddly coordinated to aid in a civil lawsuit against the President. The \nPaula Jones case has had a gag order on it from the beginning. Yet \nevery single day we find the lawyers and those allied with Ms. Jones \nselectively leaking depositions and court proceedings to the public. \nAlmost in conjunction--almost in the same package--we see items \nselectively leaked from Mr. Starr's office with one passing the other. \nYou would think it was the same law firm carrying out this civil case. \nI have never ever seen a prosecutor do something like that in a State \ncourt, a Federal court, or any kind of a case.\n  Having been a prosecutor, I have a sense for the enormous power in \nthat office. If you have $30 million to spend you have the most power \nany prosecutor could ever have. But with that power comes a \nresponsibility. Decisions about what to pursue and what to prosecute \nare among the weightiest exercises of public authority. Exercised \nirresponsibly and without accountability the prosecutor's power is \neasily abused and is left to go towards effectively partisan purposes.\n  My point is that at this juncture we need an independent counsel who \nis clearly removed from partisanship and who can exercise independent \njudgment. But the country has neither. This is the most partisan, \nunjustified, demeaning investigation that I can ever remember in my \nlife. Rather than succeed in insulating the power of the prosecutor \nfrom abusive partisan purposes, the independent counsel law appears to \nhave captured partisan forces. This goes beyond any question of what \nmight have happened in Whitewater or anywhere else. It is the tactics \nbeing used. The tactics tend in many ways to become so outrageous that \nthey can only be considered partisan. If you want people to have \nconfidence in the result of an investigation, then the investigation \nhas to be nonpartisan, and it has to be perceived to be nonpartisan so \nthat all people can respect what comes out of it.\n\n  Frankly, Mr. President, from what I am hearing throughout the \ncountry, as well as in my own State, people do not expect any idea of \nimpartiality or nonpartisanship from the prosecutor's office. I hope \nthat Mr. Starr will quickly take steps to change that, and will quickly \ntake steps to stop having his office somehow coordinating itself with a \ncivil case, a civil case involving Paula Jones.\n  I say this because the country is facing some other issues that also \nhave to be attended to.\n  On Friday I flew back to Vermont, as I do so often during the month, \nand I picked up every newspaper that I could on the way up just to read \nin the airplane. There on the front page of a major newspaper were all \nof the stories of what leaks are coming out of the Paula Jones case and \nwhat leaks are coming out of Mr. Starr's office. Tucked almost as an \nafterthought were such stories as this: The Pope making a historic \nvisit to Cuba, with all the ramifications that means; Microsoft's \nsettlement with the Justice Department and implications that is going \nto have for jobs and consumer protection in the years to come; the \nUnabomber, who terrorized this country for years, pleads guilty; U.S. \nforces move to arrest a war criminal, something we have not seen I \ndon't think since the time of Nuremberg; the successive visits by \nBenjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to this country and the \nimplications on the peace process for the Middle East. There are other \nsuch significant stories: The question of whether we are going to have \nto go into Iraq and act unilaterally because our allies don't appear to \nhave the guts to stand up to Saddam Hussein. All of these\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\nthings are tucked back, I say to my colleagues, almost in the fast-food \nads in the newspaper. Every one of these things is going to have an \nenormous effect on your life, on my life, and on the lives of the \nAmerican people, just as the State of the Union Message will tonight, \njust as what we do on the floor of the Senate this year.\n  These are the things that need debate. I am not suggesting that it is \nwrong to ask questions about the conduct of anybody--not of me, of you, \nof the President, or anybody else. I am not suggesting that. But what I \nam suggesting is let us not forget that we represent the most powerful \nnation history has ever known and the greatest economy history has ever \nknown, at a time of economic boom. Let us not lose sight of what the \nAmerican people want us to do in protecting this country.\n  But also let us ask--and I asked the same question incidentally \nduring the activities of the special prosecutor in the Reagan era--let \nus ask whether we undermine the very things we want to protect in this \ncountry by allowing a special prosecutor situation to go way out of \nbounds of what its original aim was--especially when it becomes \nideological, partisan, and allied with those who are carrying out civil \ncases which have nothing to do with the issue initially contemplated by \nWhitewater.\n  Mr. President, I will speak on this more as we go along. I see other \nSenators who are seeking the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank you. I ask that I be recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S6-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7-S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEMISE OF OUR DEFENSE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a great deal of concern over some \nof the things that we have been hearing during this interim when we \nhave been considering what we would do if a surplus should become a \nreality. And we and many people have talked about problems in child \ncare, in Medicare, in the environment, and in education. But the one \nthing, the one area, that we have the greatest deficiency in America \nin, and the great threat facing us, is what has happened with the \ndemise of our defense budget and what has happened to our defense \nsystem.\n  Being the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Readiness \nSubcommittee, we have had occasion to go around and pay visits to a \nnumber of our installations. Mr. President, this is not something that \nhas just come on recently. Although now is when the public has finally \na wake-up call, thanks perhaps to Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and realizes \nthat there is a great threat out there.\n  I would like to read just one paragraph out of the 1998 Defense \nAuthorization Act under, ``The Storm Clouds Are On The Horizon.''\n\n       There are two key factors that threaten to undermine the \n     readiness of our forces--a lack of adequate funding and the \n     over commitment of a greatly reduced force structure. Unless \n     we take necessary steps to correct these problems our \n     military capability will incur significant degredation as we \n     enter into the 21st century.\n\n  Mr. President, during this interim period, I visited a number of \ninstallations, including Nellis Air Force Base out in the Mojave \nDesert, and national training systems: The Army Advanced Training \nSystem, the Marine Advanced Training Center at Twentynine Palms, and \nthe San Diego naval operations. Also, I have had occasion to be in Camp \nLejuene, Fort Bragg, and Fort Hood, and these installations that are \ntrying to keep us prepared throughout America, and throughout the \nworld.\n  I can tell you that we really have a serious problem. We find that \nour operations are up, that now we have U.S. forces that have been used \nin 36 countries in the last 9 years. In the 9 years prior to that there \nwas only 22 countries. We have had over a 300-percent increase in the \npace of operations since 1990. We have 26 Army contingency operations \nin the 7 years since 1991 compared to 10 operations in the 30 years \nprior to that time. There were 26 operations in just 7 years compared \nto 10 over the previous 30 years. What this means is we have a ``op \ntempo,'' or a first tempo, which is a term that is used to measure how \nbusy our people are that are out there and how this is going to affect \nall of our other operations.\n  So we actually have two problems that we are faced with. One problem \nis the fact that we have reduced our budget to an artificially low rate \nthat puts us in the position where we cannot carry out the minimum \nexpectations for the American people. And to be specific about it, we \nhave roughly one-half of the force strength today that we had in 1991. \nI am talking about one-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical \nair wings, and one-half of the ships floating out there. So that is a \nserious problem.\n  Then we have stood on this floor time and again and talked about the \nproblems of our deployment on these contingency operations. I can \nremember standing on this floor in November of 1995 and saying that we \ncannot afford to send our American troops into Bosnia, and that if we \ndo send them into Bosnia we will incur an operation and an obligation \nthat will sustain the next two decades. The President assured us and \npromised us. He didn't estimate it, Mr. President. He said that this \noperation will not exceed 12 months, and that all of our troops will be \nhome from Bosnia for Christmas in 1996. Of course, we knew that wasn't \ntrue. We knew the President was not telling the truth. I remember going \nover there and talking to them. When I told them up there in the \nnortheast sector, the U.N., that it was going to be a 12-month \noperation, they laughed, and they said, ``You mean 12 years.'' They \nsaid it is like putting your hand in the water and leaving it there for \n12 months. Take it out, and nothing has changed. The President also \nsaid that the cost would be $1.2 billion. Guess what? It has now gone \nover $8 billion in that effort.\n\n  That is not even a part of it. When the American people are told that \nwe only have 8,500 troops over there in Bosnia, that is not true either \nbecause if you count the troops as of last week that are in Croatia and \nthe Moravian countries, it is well up to over 12,000 troops. You go \nover to the 21st Tatical Command in Germany that supplies the logistics \nfor the operation in Bosnia, and they are at 100-percent capacity, and \ntheir op tempo rate is 60 percent higher than it should be. What that \nmeans in normal terms is that if something happens in Iraq they have to \nsupport that logistically on the ground from the 21st Tactical Command. \nYou go 10 miles down the road to Ramstein Air Force Base where they \nhave the 86th Airlift operation, and I defy you to go there and find \nany ramp space that isn't being used as the C-141s, C-5s and DC-17s \nthat are bringing in everything going to Bosnia are transferring onto \nC-130s, and off they go. We are using 100 percent of our capacity \nthere. So that is a very, very serious problem that has to be \ncorrected. We cannot do that and continue to try to rebuild a defense \noperation that has been decimated mostly by this administration. As we \ngo around to these installations, we find that our retention rate is \ndown, the divorce rate is up, and that we are approaching the hollow \nforce days of the late 1970's. We know the two reasons: the budget cuts \nand the contingency operations.\n\n  We have stood on this floor for the last 5 years and talked about the \nthreat that is facing the United States of America. It is not just that \nwe are not adequately prepared in our state of readiness to take care \nof normal operations should something erupt, for example, in Iraq or \nIran or Syria or North Korea, but we also do not have a national \nmissile defense system. In 1983 we started one that should have been \ndeployable by the year 1998. That is now. Someone was pretty smart back \nthere. And yet this administration stopped that in 1992. We are now 5 \nyears behind, if we get right back in, which I think we will now \nbecause there is a wake-up call that the American people have heard. \nAnd that is, I would have to say, some good news, that even right now \nthis administration is agreeing with what they have refuted over the \nlast 5 years.\n  I was very pleased to hear Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen stand up \nand say that we now know there are over 25 nations that have weapons of \nmass destruction, either biological, chemical or nuclear, and are \nworking on the missile means to deliver those as far as the\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\nUnited States of America. When Bill Cohen stood up and said Saddam \nHussein--keep in mind, here is a guy who murders his own \ngrandchildren--and Iraq under our close supervision still has enough DX \ngas to kill every man, woman and child on the face of this Earth in 60 \nseconds, finally America is waking up, and I am very pleased that has \nhappened.\n  I have a couple articles here that I will not read from because my \ntime is running out, but one article is the one that is the cover story \nof the current U.S. News & World Report that is out on the newsstands \ntoday. It is called: ``Can peacekeepers make war?'' And they get into \nthe fact, as we have found, that if we had to bring these troops back \nand put them in a combat environment, it would take between 4 and 6 \nmonths to train them. So that exacerbates our problem. And the other is \nin the National Review. I ask unanimous consent that both of these \narticles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1).\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are going to have to do something and \ndo that something pretty quick. Unfortunately, as the chairman of the \nReadiness Committee, I recognize the fact that we are going to have to \ncome up with some money right away, in this coming fiscal year budget, \nin the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill. \nWe are finding that the Defense Department has engaged in policies that \nhave caused us to foolishly use money that should have been used for \nreadiness. So I am standing here saying we are going to have to do--the \nmoney can only come from one place. If we are going to try to keep our \nretention rate or get it back up, if we are going to stop the divorce \nrate going up, we are going to have to put some money in quality-of-\nlife and force strength, and the only place that can come from is \nmodernization.\n  As a strong supporter of the F-22, I can only stand on the floor of \nthe Senate and say we are going to have to delay that program unless we \nare able to come up with some money to put into our budget for the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  People who are very wise say, well, that is what we depend upon for \nfuture readiness, the F-22. Yes, we do, but we have to make a tradeoff \nfor current readiness or future readiness. It has to be current \nreadiness, with the threat that faces us.\n  I am here to tell you that we are facing a greater threat today than \nat any time since World War II. We have a reduced force, and we cannot \nmeet that threat. It has to be changed.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the U.S. News, Jan. 19, 1998]\n\n                       Can Peacekeepers Make War?\n\n                         (By Richard J. Newman)\n\n       In January 1991, eight Apache helicopters from the Army's \n     101st Air Assault Division were assigned to fire the first \n     shots of the Persian Gulf war. Flying with their lights out, \n     50 feet off the desert floor, the Apaches sneaked deep into \n     western Iraq and destroyed two key radar sites. The dangerous \n     mission, which largely blinded Saddam Hussein to the \n     subsequent deluge of attack aircraft, was a complete success.\n       Seven years later, the 101st is not performing so \n     gloriously. During a November mock battle at the Army's \n     National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., the \n     division's gunners failed to destroy any of the antiaircraft \n     missiles of the ``opposition force.'' As a result, the OpFor \n     shot down all the 101st's Apaches when they tried to mount a \n     deep-strike mission. The OpFor put away half of its \n     antiaircraft missiles, and the 101st tried again. Once more, \n     all its helicopters were shot down. Then the OpFor put all \n     its missiles away--and still shot down six Apaches with tanks \n     and other guns, losing only four tanks in the process. While \n     the OpFor was probably a tougher foe than the Iraqi military, \n     officials familiar with the NTC say the 101st's performance \n     reflects a general deterioration in the last five years in \n     the capabilities of units training at Fort Irwin. It's a \n     ``very sad situation here,'' said one NTC official.\n       Throughout America's armed forces, there is mounting \n     evidence that conventional combat skills--and the warrior \n     ethic that goes with them--are being eroded by a combination \n     of downsizing, budget cuts, and widespread commitments to \n     noncombat operations in Bosnia, the Middle East, and \n     elsewhere. A December report by a Senate Budget Committee \n     analyst cited ``extremely serious Army-wide personnel and \n     training (i.e., readiness) problems,'' such as units half \n     staffed in key positions like infantry and mechanics. With \n     troop levels being cut to free more money for high-tech \n     weapons systems, the report predicted, those problems will \n     get worse.\n       Soldiers seem to agree: In a 1997 ``leadership \n     assessment,'' Army officers in 36 percent of a series of \n     focus groups said their units don't know how to fight; nearly \n     half of those groups expressed concern about the Army's \n     growing ``hollow,'' a provocative allusion to the inept, so-\n     called hollow force of the 1970s.\n       In the Air Force, ``mission capable'' rates for some \n     fighter jets, which measure how many planes can be ready for \n     war on short notice, are more than 15 percentage points lower \n     than they were in 1989. ``We've got some severe stresses,'' \n     says Gen. Richard Hawley, head of the Air Force's Air \n     Combat Command. ``There's not enough resilience in the \n     force.'' Even the Navy and the Marine Corps, which are \n     better structured to endure long deployments, are \n     struggling. Downsizing and budget cutting have left some \n     ships short of parts and crew members and have forced \n     commanders to increase their estimates of how long it \n     would take to be ready to fulfill wartime tasks. Last fall \n     Rear Adm. Daniel Murphy, the Navy's head of surface \n     warfare, said it may be necessary to pay bonuses to \n     sailors in the surface fleet--like those paid to aviators \n     and submariners--to keep experienced sailors in the Navy.\n       Do gaps in the force matter? The U.S. military can \n     obviously afford to relax the hair-trigger posture that \n     became the norm over 40 years in the cold war. U.S. defense \n     funding is roughly equal to that of the next six spenders \n     combined. The once-feared Soviet military has dwindled from 4 \n     million troops in 1990 to a Russian force of 1.2 million--\n     with such problems that it could not defeat a ragtag rebel \n     force in the tiny province of Chechnya in 1995. Analysts \n     think it will be at least 15 years before a ``peer \n     competitor'' such as China or a resurgent Russia could \n     challenge the United States militarily. No country now poses \n     a serious threat to American territory.\n       More with less. But in many ways the American military has \n     a uniquely demanding job today. Instead of preparing largely \n     for territorial defense, U.S. troops must safeguard vaguely \n     defined American and global ``interests'' in an increasing \n     number of far-flung places. Since 1990, U.S. armed forces \n     have been utilized in 36 foreign missions, compared with just \n     22 between 1980 and 1989, according to analysis by the \n     Congressional Research Service. And there have been fewer \n     troops and dollars to carry out those missions. Since 1989, \n     administrations of both parties have cut the armed forces by \n     one third, and the defense budget by 30 percent, after \n     inflation. The changes were inevitable, with the demise of \n     the Soviet threat, but they still affect the military's \n     ability to meet increasing demands.\n       The busy pace that results appears to be driving out more \n     experienced service members than ever. In the Marine Corps, \n     23 of the 175 captains chosen last year to attend the \n     prestigious Amphibious Warfare School in Quantico, Va., \n     decided instead to leave the Marines; statistics weren't kept \n     before 1995, but officials say it used to be rare for more \n     than three or four to drop out. The Army recruited only 70 \n     percent of the infantrymen it needed in the year ending last \n     September, though Army officials expect that to improve. A \n     1997 report released by Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the \n     House National Security Committee, cited Army statistics \n     showing that 125 infantry squads--equivalent to about five \n     500-man battalions--are unmanned, keeping units from training \n     at the appropriate combat strength. And increasingly, Army \n     and Air Force units put off combat training because they are \n     too busy with ``low intensity'' missions or need the money \n     elsewhere.\n       In the past, military leaders have used readiness \n     ``scares'' to plead for more money for favored weapons or \n     other programs. These days, most Pentagon officials \n     understand that total defense budgets will not rise--and so a \n     gain for one branch comes out of another's share. But they \n     also complain that frequent ``low intensity'' missions--such \n     as peacekeeping, counterdrug operations, humanitarian \n     efforts, and even joint exercises with new Eastern European \n     allies--are diluting the war-fighting capability of U.S. \n     troops by disrupting combat training and breaking down unit \n     cohesion. Ultimately, that is producing an identity crisis: \n     Is the American military's purpose still ``fighting and \n     winning our nation's wars,'' as the Pentagon's national \n     military strategy states? Or are America's enemies so few \n     and feeble that U.S. troops can focus less on war and more \n     on other problems throughout the world?\n       By its own benchmarks, U.S. military manpower and readiness \n     are falling short. Since 1993 the government's national \n     security strategy has called for U.S. troops to be prepared \n     to fight two regional wars, presumably in Korea and Iraq, \n     less than 45 days apart. (Before that, the Pentagon planned \n     for one very large war with the Soviet Union and lesser \n     conflicts elsewhere, but didn't quantify them.) The \n     Pentagon's quadrennial defense review, released last May, \n     said U.S. forces also must be prepared for greater \n     involvement in ``smaller-scale contingencies,''\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\n     such as peacekeeping in Bosnia and the ongoing enforcement of \n     the Iraqi no-fly zones--even though at the same time the \n     Pentagon cut the military by 62,000 troops.\n       That reduction was part of a deliberate trade-off to pay \n     for new weapons, such as the joint strike fighter and the F-\n     22 aircraft, a new carrier, and tank upgrades. Many analysts \n     agree on the need to modernize some fighting platforms that \n     are 15 to 20 years old. Yet to some officials, the Pentagon's \n     reliance on the offerings of defense contractors borders on a \n     dysfunctional dependency. ``We can beat the Chinese or the \n     Russians, but we can't beat Lockheed Martin or Ingalls \n     Shipbuilding,'' says Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, an \n     intelligence analyst who has written widely on strategic \n     planning. ``We're spending so much money on aircraft and \n     ships that we'll paralyze the future force.'' Bases that are \n     no longer needed to support a smaller force also suck up \n     cash. The Pentagon wants to close some of them but has met \n     resistance from Congress.\n       Such trade-offs make it harder to meet demands on the \n     military today. A classified Pentagon memo written after a \n     Joint Staff war game last spring said the game ``made it \n     obvious that we cannot sustain current levels of overseas \n     presence,'' citing negative effects on ``maintenance, \n     personnel, and training readiness.'' Frederick Kagan, a \n     history professor at West Point, says downsizing alone would \n     make it difficult for the United States to fight even one \n     regional war today. The Army, he says, has only six heavy \n     divisions--too few to field the six division equivalents that \n     fought in the Persian Gulf war while still leaving one \n     division in South Korea to deter an invasion from the north. \n     John Correll, editor of Air Force magazine, points out that \n     the Pentagon said it would take 24 fighter wings to win two \n     wars when it first scripted that scenario in 1993. The Air \n     Force has since been cut to 20 fighter wings, but the \n     Pentagon says this is still enough.\n       Perhaps most significant is that the declining emphasis on \n     war fighting is not being managed--it is just happening \n     haphazardly as units cut whatever corners on training time \n     and war-fighting preparations they can in order to fulfill \n     assigned missions or meet their budgets. In the Persian Gulf \n     region, for instance, there are usually anywhere from 100 to \n     300 aircraft enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. \n     Pilots of F-15, F-16, and A-10 jets typically fly four-hour \n     patrols that consist mainly of ``left-hand turns.'' The \n     flights are so routine and uneventful that pilots pass the \n     time asking each other movie-trivia questions over their \n     radios. During 45- to 90-day tours in the desert, pilots \n     spend so little time practicing combat maneuvers that when \n     they return home, it takes two to three months of training \n     before they are considered fully ready for war again. A 1997 \n     Rand study even suggests that repetitive air patrols may \n     amount to ``negative training,'' desensitizing crews to \n     dangers and degrading their situational awareness.\n       Synergy. Those problems on their own may be manageable. But \n     shortfalls in training, readiness, and manpower often feed on \n     one another, multiplying the impact of each. For the 69th \n     Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia--which \n     soon will leave for a 60-day rotation enforcing the Iraqi no-\n     fly zone--a shortage of spare parts means ground crews must \n     regularly ``cannibalize'' jets, taking parts from one to make \n     another fly. That is not a new practice. But the wing's \n     recent cannibalization rate, which measures parts taken from \n     jets versus missions flown, has topped 25 percent, three \n     times higher than its 8 percent goal. Overall, the wing's \n     goal is a mission-capable rate of 80 to 84 percent; but rates \n     have been below 70 percent for over a year. The mission-\n     capable rate for all F-16s belonging to Air Combat Command is \n     77 percent, down from 90 percent in 1989; for F-15 air-to-air \n     fighters the rate has fallen from 85 percent to 77 percent.\n       With a smaller military, troops are being sent more \n     frequently on drawn-out missions such as those in Bosnia--\n     which President Clinton last month declared to be an open-\n     ended commitment--and the Persian Gulf, where the U.S. \n     commitment is 7 years old and growing. Increasingly long \n     deployments away from home and aggressive hiring by growing \n     commercial airlines are driving many pilots out of the Air \n     Force once they have fulfilled their seven-year commitment. \n     In the A-10 squadron at Moody, six out of the nine pilots \n     eligible to leave this year decided to do so--despite \n     increased bonuses of up to $22,000 for staying in. Throughout \n     the Air Force, retention rates for pilots fell to an \n     estimated 75 percent in 1997, down 12 points from 1995 \n     levels. The Air Force has had other pilot crunches--in the \n     early 1980s, for example, when airlines were aggressively \n     luring away fliers--but the problem then was not exacerbated \n     by budget cuts and increased missions, as it is now.\n       The Air Force is compensating by running more people \n     through flight school--but with junior pilots replacing \n     senior ones, there could soon be a sharp drop in overall \n     experience levels. Mechanics and other key personnel are also \n     affected. One C-130 pilot says: ``We're getting a lot of \n     [mechanics] with no C-130 experience. They ask, `How do you \n     turn this thing on?' If he's asking how to turn it on and \n     it's his job to fix the system, there's obviously a \n     problem.'' Many pilots fear that such shortages could lead to \n     more accidents.\n       The Army faces similar strains. After one infantry unit \n     returned from a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia in 1994--\n     where it went without its Bradley fighting vehicles--it \n     received the lowest score in its division on tests of its \n     ability to shoot and operate its Bradleys. A Rand study to be \n     released within the next month found that Army troops sent \n     frequently on peace operations, such as military police and \n     certain transportation units, are underprepared for their \n     wartime tasks.\n       As the service most dependent on people, the Army is \n     particularly vulnerable to ripple effects that begin with \n     personnel shortfalls. A lack of infantrymen, mechanics, and \n     mid-grade officers forces the Army to stitch units together \n     in order to field the appropriate force for missions in \n     places such as Bosnia. That in turn breaks up units, \n     undermining the cohesion needed for infantry, tanks, \n     artillery, and aviation to fight as ``combined arms''--a \n     level of performance critical to success in modern combat.\n       The 1st Armored Division in Germany epitomizes the problem. \n     It has two staffs--one in Germany, one in Bosnia--and troops \n     in at least three different regions. ``The logic of \n     maintaining readiness is thrown astray by this piecemeal \n     discombobulation,'' says an Army general. The Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff have begun to study what would happen if units doing \n     peace operations were suddenly needed in a war--or two wars. \n     Early findings: Moving troops out of one place and into a war \n     zone would ``put a strain on an already fragile \n     transportation system,'' according to one classified Pentagon \n     document. Another cites ``many more risks''--including the \n     potential loss of equipment in a hasty withdrawal and the two \n     to six months it would take to retrain units for war.\n       Above all, some fear that soldiers are not learning the \n     basic lessons needed to succeed in war. Units going through \n     the National Training Center or the Joint Readiness Training \n     Center in Louisiana are barely more than half staffed, says \n     retired Marine Corps Gen. John Sheehan. That, the Senate \n     Budget Committee report noted, violates the Army's doctrine \n     to ``train just as you go to war.''\n       ``We're raising a generation of young leaders who are not \n     learning to run large organizations,'' says Sheehan. ``They \n     won't know how to command their troops even if they get them \n     all in a war.'' More important may be the messages sent by \n     top commanders. ``We have no leaders talking to us about how \n     important it is to prepare your soldiers for battle so they \n     don't die in combat,'' says an Army major. ``It's \n     disheartening to many of us.'' That may also be causing \n     deeper problems not easily fixed by more funding, higher-tech \n     weapons, or better training. ``The brass are refusing to \n     stand up for the warrior spirit,'' says John Hillen, a \n     Persian Gulf war veteran and fellow at the Council on Foreign \n     Relations. Recent imbroglios over the proper role of women in \n     the military have added to the distractions.\n       Hanging touch. Top Pentagon leaders insist the military is \n     not going soft. In an interview last week, Gen. Henry \n     Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dismissed \n     comparisons between the demoralized force of the 1970s and \n     today's. ``There is a world of difference between where we \n     were then and where we are now,'' he said. ``We have a \n     tremendously talented bunch of young men and women.'' Nor \n     does Shelton believe that anecdotal reports of problems, on \n     their own, indicate a readiness shortfall. He and others say \n     that the Pentagon's carefully monitored readiness statistics \n     do not indicate serious degradations in the force.\n       But those figures--which measure how long it would take a \n     unit to be ready for war--are somewhat subjective, based on \n     commanders' own estimates of how well their troops are \n     trained. Some doubt their validity. ``The readiness rates are \n     false,'' one Army colonel flatly states. ``There is a lot of \n     pressure from higher-ups to inflate them. It's like all the \n     students are getting A's, then flunking the final exam.'' \n     Shelton does acknowledge some readiness ``issues,'' \n     particularly problems with highly skilled troops leaving the \n     service. Some senior and retired leaders who served during \n     the 1970s think those are ominous signs. They say that \n     readiness tends to slip gradually at first--but at a point \n     begins to drop precipitously, and then becomes very hard to \n     reverse.\n       The Pentagon has protected some of its key units from \n     cutbacks and other distractions. The 2nd Infantry Division in \n     South Korea, for example, which could absorb the brunt of a \n     North Korean invasion with less than three days' notice, is \n     staffed at over 100 percent, including some \n     ``augmentees'' from the South Korean Army. Commanders are \n     so focused on war they are almost scornful of any other \n     type of mission. ``We don't face the same problems \n     stateside units do,'' says Lt. Col. Robert Sweeney, former \n     commander of the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. ``My \n     focus is clear. I'm not going to be doing humanitarian \n     operations.'' Even though assignments to Korea are \n     considered a ``hardship tour''--an entire year's \n     deployment, with no family allowed for most troops--\n     commanders say a clear focus, and a ready enemy, make it \n     easy to sustain morale.\n       JSTARS, where are you? But even there the tip of the spear \n     may be getting duller, U.S. military planners in South Korea \n     say budget constraints and competing demands elsewhere keep \n     them from getting enough access to ``special mission'' assets \n     such as Joint STARS surveillance aircraft, F-117 stealth \n     fighters, and F-15E strike jets. ``We're being told to be \n     more efficient,'' says an intelligence staffer in Seoul. \n     ``But efficiency doesn't cut it in war. Redundancy does.'' \n     Some analysts think new technology may greatly reduce the \n     numbers of ground troops and conventional platforms needed in\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\n     a war. But relying on new systems before they are battle \n     tested leaves troops feeling they have less margin for error.\n       Shortfalls appear to be more serious in the Persian Gulf, \n     where a rematch with Iraq would probably come with more \n     advance warning--but still be bloody. A radar operator who \n     has worked at an airfield in Kuwait says there are no longer \n     any backups for the facility's radar, the only ground-based \n     system available for tracking nearby aircraft, including \n     enemy planes. ``We're a forward operating unit and we still \n     don't get what we need,'' he says. ``When that baby goes down \n     and you realize there's no backup, you start saying, `Where \n     is the priority?' ''\n       Troops' morale, an intangible but essential ingredient of \n     success in combat, can weather temporary problems. But \n     persistent shortages and seemingly never-ending commitments \n     take a toll. ``Troops don't understand why, if what they do \n     is so important, they don't give us the tools to do it,'' \n     says Lt. Col. Michael Snodgrass, commander of the 69th \n     Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base. Enthusiasm suffers \n     first. Before Desert Storm, says Col. Billy Diehl, acting \n     commander of Moody's 347th Wing, the Air Force's annual Red \n     Flag aerial combat exercise ``was the highlight of the \n     year.'' But in 1996, when he arrived at Moody, ``everybody \n     was thrilled that it was canceled.''\n       A more important casualty is confidence. A C-130 pilot says \n     that due to training cutbacks, ``My own skills are nowhere \n     near where they were. Some of the new guys, I'm deathly \n     afraid to go to war with them. They just don't have the \n     training.'' John Stillion, a former Air Force navigator and \n     Rand analyst, says that on a recent visit to an Air Force \n     base, morale was ``far worse than I've ever seen it. I'm \n     amazed at how bitter they sounded.''\n       Surprisingly, few in the military--which studies show is \n     overwhelmingly conservative today--feel the solution is to \n     withdraw from its peacekeeping missions in the world's \n     trouble spots. One typical Army colonel strongly objects to \n     the political gamesmanship of setting unrealistic deadlines \n     for troop adjustments in places such as Bosnia. But \n     nonetheless, he believes U.S. troops should be there: ``It is \n     appropriate use of the military, mainly because nobody else \n     can do it.''\n       Some practical steps could help strike a better balance \n     between preparing for war and preserving peace. Many in the \n     Army would like to see the National Guard shoulder more of \n     the burden for peacekeeping, Rand researchers and others \n     argue that a more modular structure would make the Army much \n     more flexible. Ideas include self-supporting combat groups of \n     about 5,000 troops--one third the size of a division--or \n     discrete support units that can each carry out a variety of \n     functions, instead of specializing in transportation or \n     engineering. Some in the Air Force are pushing a ``cop on the \n     beat'' approach, enforcing no-fly zones with random patrols, \n     augmented by sensors that detect air and ground movements.\n       But what America's troops crave most is a clear message \n     from their leaders stating the purpose of U.S. forces. Are \n     they warriors, whose main job is to fight and win wars? Or \n     police assigned to prop up struggling nations and keep the \n     world safe for American commerce? If U.S. forces must fulfill \n     both roles, how can they do each well? Many members of the \n     military believe that before those questions can be answered, \n     there needs to be greater awareness of what U.S. troops \n     accomplish by being everywhere they are--and what risks are \n     involved in spreading them ever thinner. ``We need a better \n     understanding among the American public that we have \n     interests outside the United States,'' says Lt. Gen. Joseph \n     Hurd, commander of the 7th Air Force in South Korea. Once \n     those interests are sorted out, it wouldn't hurt to inform \n     the troops in the ranks, either.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S7-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10-S12]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET SURPLUS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we reconvene today for the second \nsession of the 105th Congress, there is important work ahead of us. I \nam certain my colleagues join me in acknowledging that regardless of \nthe headlines and the commotion that is going on outside this chamber, \nthe Senate cannot be distracted from its responsibility to carry out \nthe will of the people. America's families, its taxpayers, have great \nexpectations of us, and we must not let them down. So I look forward to \nwhat we can accomplish together on their behalf.\n  I have to admit, though, that I have mixed feelings about the session \nahead of us. I think Will Rogers explained my predicament best when he \nsaid, ``This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in \nsession as when the baby gets hold of a hammer.''\n  When the baby finds the hammer, somebody almost always gets hit over \nthe head. In 1998, the ``hammer'' is the much-anticipated budget \nsurplus, and I am afraid it may very well be the taxpayers who get \nwhacked by it.\n  Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office projected that \nthe federal deficit would decline sharply this year from its original \nestimate of $125 billion to $5 billion. It also forecast a $14 billion \nsurplus in 2001 and a total of $665 billion in surpluses by the end of \nthe next decade.\n  Now, tax dollars are always considered ``free money'' by the big \nspenders here in Washington, and the thought of all that new ``free \nmoney'' is creating a feeding frenzy here on Capitol Hill. The rush to \nspend is like something right off the Discovery Channel, like the free-\nfor-all that results when a pack of hungry predators gets hold of a \npiece of raw meat. A ravenous creature in its own right, Washington \nwill attack a pile of tax dollars and spend, spend, spend until it is \nall gone--until the bones have been stripped of every last morsel of \nmeat.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues in both \nchambers, I am disgusted by this ``stampede to spend,'' and angry that \nit is being championed on both sides of the political aisle. I am a \nRepublican, elected by the people of Minnesota to carry out my promise \nto lower their taxes and rein in a federal government that has grown \nout of control. Republicans gained control of Congress because we are \nthe champions of the taxpayers--the American people trusted us to carry \nout our promise when we said, ``Elect a Republican majority and we will \nhelp you build a better life for yourselves and families by curbing \nWashington's impulse to spend your precious tax dollars.''\n  They certainly did not elect Republicans thinking we would build a \nbigger, more expensive government the first chance we got.\n  Not only are we rushing to join the spending stampede, but we are \ndoing it before the budget is actually balanced, before a surplus \nactually exists, before even a single surplus dollar makes its way into \nthe federal treasury.\n  If this is a race to prove who can be the most ``compassionate'' with \nthe taxpayers' dollars, it is a race nobody is going to win, and one \nthe taxpayers most certainly will lose. When is Washington going to \nunderstand that you cannot buy compassion? And Washington cannot give \nsomething to Americans, without taking more from Americans. I hear the \nbig spenders say that Americans are struggling so Washington needs to \ndo more. And ``more'' always means taking more from Americans so \nWashington can control, shape, and direct our families and our lives.\n  Who is going to stand up in this chamber for the taxpayers if the \nRepublicans will not? If our party is abandoning our commitment to \nfiscal responsibility--the commitment that built a congressional \nmajority--we are abandoning the taxpayers as well. And do not think the \ntaxpayers have not noticed. One of my constituents, Dale Rook of \nBeardsley, Minnesota, summed up the feelings of many in a recent \nletter: ``It appears that the Democrats are still in control of both \nHouses of Congress,'' he wrote. ``Why? What has happened to the \nRepublican Party?'' he wrote. A lot of us are asking that very same \nquestion.\n  Of course, the Republicans do not have a monopoly here when it comes \nto spending. I am deeply troubled by what is happening on Capitol Hill \namong both parties, and every taxpayer ought to be as well. And as a \nSenator representing the nation's families--America's hard-working, \ntaxpaying families--I pledge that they will not be forgotten.\n  Let me speak specifically about the deficit and the anticipated \nsurplus. Both Congress and the President have rushed to claim the \ncredit for the decline in the federal deficit. Mr. President, I think \nwe should give credit where credit is due. In this case, the credit \nreally belongs to the robust American economy and the working Americans \nwho propel it. And Washington should not be allowed to take that away \nfrom American families, workers, and business. Washington should not \ngain more control of our spending.\n  The economy, not any government action, has produced this \nunprecedented revenue windfall. These unexpected dollars have come \ndirectly from working Americans--taxes paid by corporations, \nindividuals and investors. If the economy continues to generate 8\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\npercent revenue growth as in recent years, we could soon enjoy unified \nbudget surpluses.\n  However, Mr. President, we must remember this is a surplus only under \na unified budget. That means Social Security surpluses that the \ngovernment borrowed to pay its bills are also counted in the \nprojection. Payroll taxes from the current generation of workers \nprovides far more money than is needed to finance benefits for today's \nretirees; the extra money is used for other government programs. \nWithout borrowing from the Social Security trust funds, the real \nfederal deficit could be $116 billion, rather than a $14 billion \nsurplus in 2001. In fact, the total deficit will be nearly a trillion \nin the next ten years. This means we will see deficits, not surpluses, \nas far as the eye can see.\n  In any event, if the budget surpluses, indeed, occur, with or without \nSocial Security borrowing, the question of how to apply these surpluses \nremains critical. In my view, the right way to use any potential budget \nsurplus is to return those funds to working Americans and their \nchildren in the form of meaningful tax relief, national debt reduction, \nand channeling them toward solutions to our long-term financial \nimbalances, thus ensuring our economy continues to grow. Since the \nunexpected revenue has come directly from working Americans, it is only \nfair to return it to them. Despite the first, tentative steps we took \nlast year toward real tax reform for families, the tax burden on the \nAmerican people is still historically high. It is sound policy to use \npart of the surpluses to lower the tax burden and allow families to \nkeep a little more of their hard-earned money.\n  Over the past 30 years, we have amassed a $5.5 trillion national debt \nthanks to Washington's culture of spending. A newborn child today will \nbear about $20,000 of that debt the moment he or she comes into the \nworld. Each year, we sink more $250 billion into the black hole of \ninterest payments, which could be better spent fighting crime, \nmaintaining roads and bridges, and equipping the military. It is sound \npolicy to use part of any surpluses to begin paying down the national \ndebt and reducing the financial burden on the next generations.\n  The budget surpluses also give us a great opportunity to address our \nother long-term financial imbalances. Federal unfunded liabilities \ncould eventually top $14 trillion, bankrupting our government if no \nreal reform occurs. It is vitally important that we use the budget \nsurpluses to finance these reforms, not to try to buy popularity--\nspending in the name of compassion and need, while putting our entire \nfutures at financial risk.\n  If we fail to fix these long-term fiscal time bombs, the federal \ndeficit could come back and haunt us in a catastrophic way, shattering \nthe health of our future economy and placing an unbearable burden on \nour children and grandchildren. According to the CBO, the federal \ndeficit would increase to $11 trillion and the national debt would \nballoon to $91 billion in 2035 without substantial entitlement reform.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that we put the surpluses into \nthe Social Security trust funds. I generally agree that we should build \nreal assets for the trust funds by returning borrowed Social Security \nsurplus into it. But our Social Security system is in serious financial \ntrouble--a fiscal disaster-in-the-making that is not sustainable in its \npresent form as the Senator from New Hampshire outlined a few minutes \nago. Simply funneling money back into a broken system will not help fix \nthe problem. It will not build the real assets of the funds for current \nand future beneficiaries and it does not address the flaws of the \ncurrent pay-as-you-go finance mechanism. Without fundamental reform, \nthe system will consume all the surpluses and go broke. Using the \nbudget surpluses to build real assets by changing the system from pay-\ngo to pre-funded is the right way to go.\n  The wrong way is to spend all those dollars on new government \nprograms, which is exactly what President Clinton has proposed to do, \neven before a surplus is realized. The President has recklessly planned \nto expand Medicare, rather than reforming it to preserve it from soon \ngoing broke. He is also seeking a $22 billion increase in child-care \nexpenditures and subsidies. This is after Washington increased child \ncare expenditures by 500% in the last two years, going from $4 billion \nto $20 billion a year just one year ago. Although I think it is good to \nbring tax credits back to the table, it is wrong for Washington to \ncontrol daycare for American families. The President also wants to \nthrow more money into federal education programs for local schools \nwithout addressing the real problems of the system. And advocating \nWashington take more control of education rather than State and local \ngovernments and local school boards.\n  Despite the President's rhetoric that the era of big government is \nover, President Clinton, with the help of congressional spenders, has \nmade it even bigger. Actual annual government spending has increased \nfrom $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion since Mr. Clinton took the White \nHouse, adding over $1.2 trillion to the national debt.\n  Even under the `97 budget agreement, spending will increase to nearly \n$1.9 trillion in 2002, a growth of 18 percent over 1992 levels. Is \nthere any sign of leaner government anywhere? No. Like the overweight \ndiner who lunches on lettuce and peaches with the family then sneaks a \npint of ice cream once the kitchen lights have been turned off, the \nenablers of big government profess their new-found fiscal restraint but \nhungrily pounce on your tax dollars at the first opportunity.\n  We must never, never, never repeat the mistake we made in 1997. If \nyou will remember, as soon as the CBO discovered a $225 billion revenue \nwindfall that ``might'' be received by the federal government in the \nnext six years, Congress and the President spent all of it, to expand \nexisting programs and create new programs. Not a penny is left. Few \nwasteful and unnecessary programs were eliminated. The savings we \nachieved through welfare reform are almost completely wiped out.\n  If the budget surpluses are not returned to the American people in \nthe form of debt reduction or tax relief, I am absolutely certain \nCongress and President Clinton will spend them all for new and expanded \ngovernment programs. When it is paid for by the taxpayers, Washington \nhas never been able to resist raiding the freezer for that late-night \npint of ice cream.\n  Listen to what the people are saying. A Time/CNN poll conducted in \nmid January reveals that most Americans--78 percent of them--believe \nthat spending the budget surplus to reduce the national debt should be \na top priority. Sixty-eight percent also favored using the surplus to \ncut federal income taxes.\n  I`m hearing that same message in the calls, faxes, letters, and e-\nmails I have received this month. Here are the words of Mark Keppel of \nMinneapolis:\n\n       I want you to know how strongly your constituency feel that \n     you do not allow those feeding at the taxpayer trough to \n     waste this opportunity to reduce our huge current debt \n     burden.\n       These tax collections are over-collections of our money, \n     and we wish to either reduce our outstanding debt or have \n     this surplus returned to us, not reallocated to new, unfunded \n     projects. Can that be any clearer?\n\n  Brian Tice, a 27-year-old constituent of mine from Anoka, was equally \nclear. ``If our country is bankrupted,'' he wrote, ``my lifetime of \nsavings and my retirement will go down with it. I encourage you to \nstand firm against those . . . who will pressure you into spending the \nsurplus on social and special interest programs.''\n  After hundreds of billions of new spending and over a trillion in new \ndebts, President Clinton announced on January 5th that he will submit a \nbalanced budget to Congress for the 1999 fiscal year. I am encouraged \nby his announcement. I welcome the President's intention to balance the \nbudget. But why wait another year?\n  The robust economy has offered us a historic opportunity to finally \nput our fiscal house in order. We should, and can, balance the budget \nthis year by trimming just a few wasteful government-spending programs.\n  Compared to nearly $1.7 trillion in annual government spending, a $5 \nbillion spending cut is peanuts. And if we can achieve it, it will \nbalance the federal budget for the first time since 1969, and think of \nthe positive impact it would have on our economy. That is why my \ncolleagues, Senators Brownback, Inhofe, Ashcroft, Allard, Hutchinson \nand myself sent a letter to the congressional leadership\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nearly this month, urging Congress and the President to work together to \nachieve a balanced budget this year, rather than the next year, by \nrescinding $5 billion from the 1998 budget.\n  More importantly, the sooner we balance our budget the less pain we \nwill suffer in the future. As I said earlier, the long-term fiscal time \nbombs we are facing require that we take action quickly. Escalating \nSocial Security and Medicare costs pose the primary threat to the \nfederal government's long-term solvency. We have only ten-year's time \nto fix Social Security. If it is mishandled, millions of Americans \ncould suffer. Medicare is already in a horrific situation. It has \naccumulated over a trillion-dollar deficit and will soon be broke. \nImmediate action has to be taken to preserve and improve it.\n  There are trillions of other federal unfunded liabilities that we \ncannot ignore. These include entitlement programs other than Social \nSecurity and Medicare: federal civilian and military pensions, railroad \nretirement benefits, federal insurance programs, bank deposit \ninsurance, private pension insurance, and a huge portfolio of \nguaranteed loans, environmental cleanup, and deferred maintenance and \nlife-cycle costs for equipment and infrastructure--all of which have \nsome risk of going sour and costing the government substantial sums \ndown the road.\n  If we balance the budget this year, it will give us a little more \ntime and a little more flexibility to focus on and fix these long-term \nfinancial liabilities.\n  Mr. President, I began this statement by quoting Will Rogers. As I \nconclude, let me quote him once again:\n\n       There is not a man in the country that cannot make a living \n     for himself and family. But he cannot make a living for them \n     and his government, too, the way his government is living. \n     What the government has got to do is live as cheap as the \n     people.\n\n  Our immediate task should be to regain the confidence of the American \npeople by achieving a balanced budget and keeping it balanced by \nshrinking the size of the government. That is, by asking government to \nlive as cheap as the people. By doing so, we will reduce interest \nrates, increase national savings, create more jobs, provide more \nmeaningful tax cuts, and generate more revenues. More importantly, we \nwill shrink the financial burden for our children and grandchildren.\n  As the Senate meets today to open the second session of the 105th \nCongress, I urge my colleagues to recall the promises they have made to \nthe American taxpayers. Embrace those promises, and put the needs and \ndesires of the people ahead of the impulse to leave a legacy of \ncompassion--a legacy that could bury the taxpayers if left unchecked. \nLet us work with the President to achieve a balanced budget this year \nand begin a new era of government accountability.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 8 \nminutes as in morning business, to be followed immediately by my \ncolleague, Senator Allard, for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell and Mr. Allard pertaining to the \nsubmission of S.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize an \noutstanding institution in my home state of Georgia, Darton College.\n  Recently, I was contacted by one of the school's students who wrote \nto express his pride and support of his school and the educational \nopportunity that he is being provided. Mr. President, it is my belief \nthat the finest accolade a school can receive is the praise of its \nstudents and, in turn, their success.\n  There are many battles on the American playing field each day, in the \nbusiness world, political world, the judicial world, but none can be \nmore important than those being fought in the classrooms of our \nlearning institutions. Because, after all, our nation depends on these \neducational institutions to provide us with the necessary tools to win \nthe other battles we encounter in our lifetime.\n  Mr. President, with that in mind, I would like to express my support \nfor continued success and prosperity for past, current and future \nstudents, faculty and staff of Darton College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S12-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12-S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            1997 FALL PAGES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, when the first session of the 105th \nCongress ended last November, a group of young men and women also ended \ntheir term as United States Senate Pages. Today, I rise on behalf of \nthe Senate to say ``thank you'' to these young people.\n  Pages are an integral part of our daily life here in the Senate, and \nI salute them for their tireless service, and would like to express the \nappreciation of the Senate for their fine work.\n  Many people, Senators included, may not fully appreciate the rigorous \nnature of page life. Their daily routine is not an easy one, and is one \nthat begins early each morning. Senate pages rise early in order to \nattend classes. Upon concluding class work, the pages make their way to \nthe Capitol to prepare for the day's session. Preparing the Senate \nChamber for a day's session entails securing and placing on each \nSenator's desk the appropriate legislative documents that will be under \ndiscussion during the session, as well as securing supplemental \ndocuments that become available throughout the day.\n  Pages are on the go constantly, and are called upon to perform a \nvariety of tasks--in addition to their tasks associated with preparing \nthe Senate chamber for daily sessions. These might include obtaining \ndocuments requested by individual Senators, running errands between the \nCapitol and the Senate office buildings, as well as assisting Cloakroom \npersonnel at the regularly scheduled conference luncheons.\n  Once the Senate has concluded business for the day, the pages return \nto their dorm and prepare for the next day's classes and, we hope, get \nsome much-needed sleep. While a day in the life of a page is filled \nfrom morning to night, each page continually discharges his or her \ntasks efficiently and cheerfully.\n  In the first session of the 105th Congress, these young people \nwitnessed the enactment of a balanced budget agreement ironed out \nbetween the Administration and the Congress that will soon result in a \nbalanced budget. This historic event was the result of months of \nnegotiations and required both sides, Democrats and Republicans, to be \nwilling to accede on policy issues of importance to each side--the give \nand take of the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, our country's future lies with the generation of those \nyoung people who sit to the left and right of the Presiding officer.\n  I hope that some of what the pages have witnessed here will inspire \nthem to pursue a career of public service. As they have returned to \ntheir hometowns, perhaps they have taken with them an appreciation and \nbetter understanding of our system of government and the importance of \nthe legislative process. Perhaps in the years ahead, one or more of \nthat group will return here to serve as members of the Senate.\n  Again, I say goodbye to the pages and hope that they all enjoyed \ntheir experience in the United States Senate. Speaking on behalf of my \nDemocratic colleagues and all members of the Senate, we wish for them a \nbright and successful future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the 1997 \nFall Senate pages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            1997 Fall Pages\n\n\n                              REPUBLICANS\n\n       Adamson, Justin, Idaho.\n       Austin, Chesley, Vermont.\n       Bowers, Jackson, South Carolina.\n       Brown, Sarah, New Hampshire.\n       Dorn, Lauren, South Carolina.\n       Grade, Renee, Washington.\n       Holson, William, Delaware.\n       Jaussi, Richard, Utah.\n       Johnson, Junior, South Carolina.\n       Martira, Nancy, Rhode Island.\n       Maurer, Michelle, Arkansas.\n       McFerron, Ben, Maryland.\n       Moody, Justin, Alaska.\n       Ordner, David, Indiana.\n       Parker, Marisa, Mississippi.\n       Satcher, Bess, South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\n       Shevlin, Thomas, New York.\n       Studdert, Michael, Utah.\n\n\n                               DEMOCRATS\n\n       Eschenbacher, Christian, Montana.\n       Graff, Garrett, Vermont.\n       Knowles, James, Oregon.\n       Koontz, Megan, Iowa.\n       Larson, Tiffany, South Dakota.\n       Lichtblau, Daniel, New York.\n       Miller, Anne, Massachusetts.\n       Raizada, Avinash, Michigan.\n       Soriano, Jennifer, Hawaii.\n       Towns, Rachel, Wisconsin.\n       Wiese, Dayton, South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S12-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senators may be intrigued to learn that \nduring the 74 days Congress was in recess, the federal debt increased \nby more than $57 billion.\n  To be exact, the increase (from November 13, 1997 to January 26, \n1998) totaled $57,033,087,681.31 (Fifty-seven billion, thirty-three \nmillion, eighty-seven thousand, six hundred eighty-one dollars and \nthirty-one cents).\n  This increase is a blunt reminder that even when Congress takes a \nbreak, the federal debt does not. The federal debt will continue to \nsoar unless and until Congress changes the status quo. Presently, each \ncitizen's share of the national debt is $20,424.89.\n  Mr. President, with this in mind, let me begin where we left off:\n  At the close of business yesterday, Monday, January 26, 1998, the \nfederal debt stood at $5,487,280,357,810.54 (Five trillion, four \nhundred eighty-seven billion, two hundred eighty million, three hundred \nfifty-seven thousand, eight hundred ten dollars and fifty-four cents).\n  Five years ago, January 26, 1993, the federal debt stood at \n$4,171,138,000,000 (four trillion, one hundred seventy-one billion, one \nhundred thirty-eight million).\n  Ten years ago, January 26, 1998, the federal debt stood at \n$2,448,079,000,000 (Two trillion, four hundred forty-eight billion, \nseventy-nine million).\n  Fifteen years ago, January 26, 1983, the federal debt stood at \n$1,196,856,000,000 (One trillion, one hundred ninety-six billion, eight \nhundred fifty-six million).\n  Twenty-five years ago, January 26, 1973, the federal debt stood at \n$449,476,000,000 (Four hundred forty-nine billion, four hundred \nseventy-six million) which reflects a debt increase of over $5 \ntrillion--$5,037,804,357,810.54 (Five trillion, thirty-seven billion, \neight hundred four million, three hundred fifty-seven thousand, eight \nhundred ten dollars and fifty-four cents) during the past 25 years.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S13-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13-S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECOND SESSION OF THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we begin a new year in the U.S. \nCongress, the second session of this Congress, I look forward with \nanticipation to a number of issues we must address. I hope we can do \nthat in a bipartisan way, and I hope we will not be distracted by a lot \nof other things that come up during the year and that we will actually \naccomplish some good things for the country.\n  I recognize that outside this Chamber there is now a scandal that \nexists in this country. We will undoubtedly learn the facts about the \nallegations that have been made, and the American people will make a \njudgment based upon those facts. That is the way it should be. To make \njudgments about allegations and about rumors and about planted stories, \nand so on, before the facts are known is not a proper way to deal with \nthem.\n  But notwithstanding what is happening outside this Chamber, we have \nresponsibilities here. I was interested to learn that in the first hour \nand a half of this second session, we had people come to the Chamber of \nthe Senate, once again, and tell us about how our country works and \nwhat is wrong with our country. It was interesting to me that the \nChamber lights had hardly become warm when we had Members come to the \nfloor to, once again, talk about who the big spenders are. ``Oh, the \nbig spenders on this side'' and ``the big spenders on''--it is \ninteresting that nothing ever changes.\n  I watched the American music awards show on television last night. I \nthought to myself as I listened to a bit of this this morning that, had \nthis discussion taken place yesterday, we could have entered some of \nthis dialog for best rap artist or best presentation in rap music. It \ncertainly is a rap. There is no tune there, but they never miss a \nlyric. It is that this side represents the big spenders.\n  I just want to begin for a moment today to talk about where we are \nand how we got here and what our need is this year to address critical \nissues for this country.\n  First of all, where are we? We are in a country that is blessed with \na very strong economy. Things are going well in this country. \nUnemployment is down. Welfare is down. Crime is down. Inflation is \ndown. Economic growth is up. More people are working. Things are better \nin this country.\n  I heard not too many minutes ago someone say, ``But none of that has \nanything to do with Congress; it has to do with a good economy.'' I \nremind Members of Congress that in 1993, this President and this \nCongress decided to take a tough vote. Are we going to put this country \nback on track? Are we going to tell the American people that we are \nserious about wrestling this crippling budget deficit to the ground? \nAre we going to cast a hard vote, an unpopular vote, a tough vote? The \nanswer was yes. We did, by one vote in the U.S. Senate and one vote in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives, cut spending. Yes, we increased some \ntaxes, and we said to the American people we are serious about getting \nthis country's fiscal house in order. We are going to wrestle that \nFederal deficit to the ground. And the fact is, it gave the American \npeople confidence. They said, ``These folks are serious; they \nunderstand this is a serious problem for this country and they are \nwilling to make tough votes.''\n  I went home to my State and said, ``I voted yes. I voted yes because \nI believe it is the best thing for this country to send a signal to the \nmarkets, the American citizens and everyone in this world that this \ncountry cares about these issues and we intend, this President intends \nand this Congress intends, to get our fiscal house in order.'' And by \none vote we passed a plan in 1993 that set this economy off into a \nuniverse of economic growth and economic opportunity--by one vote.\n  This economy rests on people's confidence. If people are confident \nabout the future, they do things that reflect that confidence: They buy \ncars; they buy houses; they invest; they do things that reflect their \nconfidence about the future. If they are not confident, they make \ndifferent decisions. Based on people's confidence or lack of it, this \neconomy moves forward or lurches backward.\n  My point is, for someone to say this is all accidental is to ignore \nhistory. This is not accidental. This President deserves some credit \nfor a fiscal policy that was tough and no nonsense and said we care \nabout wrestling this Federal budget deficit to the ground. And this \nCongress, those of us in it who voted yes on that, participated in it.\n  I might add, while people are pointing across aisles, as I heard \nearlier, about big spending in the Congress, we did not even get one \nvote by accident from the other side of the aisle for a fiscal policy \nthat says we are going to solve this deficit  problem.\n\n  We come to today with a good economy and, I think, some good news \nahead of us. I hope all of us, reaching across the aisle, can decide we \nhave a common agenda. When people sit around their homes in the evening \nand have supper together and talk about their lives, what do they talk \nabout? They talk about these things: Are our kids going to a good \nschool, getting a good education? Do we have a good job or opportunity \nfor a decent job that pays well with decent benefits? Do our children \nor grandparents have an opportunity for health care that is good? Can \nthey afford it? Are our streets safe, our neighborhoods safe? Is the \nair clean, the water we drink safe, the food we eat safe? What about \nour roads? In what condition are our roads and bridges? And what about \nfamily farms and those who produce our food? Those are the issues that \npeople care about and want us to do something about.\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n  Let me tick off about four areas that we have to grapple with \nquickly. We just heard two discussions a moment ago about surplus. One \nsaid we are not spending enough money; we need to spend more on \ndefense. The second one said it is the other folks over here on this \nside of the aisle who are the big spenders, and so forth, and talked \nabout the surplus. There is no surplus.\n  The only basis on which anyone can claim they balanced the budget is \nto take nearly $100 billion out of Social Security trust funds and use \nit over in the budget to claim there is a surplus. There is no surplus, \nand no one in this room ought to be persuaded to spend the surplus that \ndoesn't exist. To the extent we will have a surplus after we have made \nwhole the Social Security funds and used those trust funds for the \npurpose for which they were intended, when we get to that point, and \nonly when we get to that point, will we have a surplus. And when we do, \nI think at least a part of that surplus ought to be used to pay down \njust a part of the Federal debt. In good times, you ought to be able to \nreduce indebtedness. But no one ought to rush around talking about a \nsurplus that doesn't exist.\n  I believe that President Clinton will call tonight to use the \naccumulated revenues that come from a better economy to make good on \nthose trust fund bonds, and that is exactly what we ought to do. No one \nought to claim a surplus as long as those who are using those trust \nfunds are using them as operating revenues.\n  Let me tell the Presiding Officer that, if you look at the \nCongressional Budget Office, which puts out byzantine reports, their \nmost recent report shows that if a budget which they claim is in \nbalance at some point--next year, I guess--they claim that the debt \nwon't continue to grow. Why will they claim that? Because they don't \ninclude all the debt. I have just written them a letter saying you \ncan't give us half-answers and half-truths. The answer is, when they \nclaim the budget is in balance, the Federal debt will continue to \nincrease, which is prima facie evidence that this notion of a budget \nbeing in balance when you are misusing Social Security trust funds is a \nfraud.\n  Campaign finance reform. We must address it and do it quickly. We had \na little house race in New York State. In the middle of that race for \none house seat in New York State, $800,000 of out-of-State money came \nin under the notion of express issue advocacy, brought in against a \ncandidate--I understand that was not money accountable to anybody; it \ncould be soft money, corporate money--brought in precisely to defeat a \ncongressional candidate, but essentially laundered through a system \nthat now permits that kind of laundering so that no one in that \ndistrict will ever know whose money it was. Is it unlimited corporate \nmoney that goes into this system and then is washed up through some \ncongressional district someplace to defeat a specific candidate and, \ntherefore, it is not accountable? It is polluting the political system. \nIt is wrong, and anyone in this Chamber who stands up and defends that, \nin my judgment, doesn't understand what the Founding Fathers decided \nabout this political system of ours.\n  That ought not be the case, and we ought to take steps to change it. \nWe are going to push and push in this Chamber to get a vote on these \nissues and get campaign finance reform done. Some will continue to \nfilibuster. They have a right to filibuster, but the American people \nhave a right to expect us to clean up this mess, and the sooner the \nbetter.\n  Health care. We ought to deal with health care. We ought to do that \nsoon. I read in the New York Times about a woman who had fallen in an \naccident. Her brain was swelling. She was in an ambulance being rushed \nto the hospital. She had the presence of mind to say to the ambulance \ndrivers, ``I don't want to go to the nearest hospital,'' and she named \nit by name. ``I want to be taken to a hospital farther away.'' This is \na woman with a brain injury, in the back of an ambulance, speeding down \nthe street. She said that because she knew by reputation that when you \nare wheeled into that nearest hospital, your health is a matter of \ntheir bottom line--dollars and cents. She said, ``I want to go to a \nhospital where I am wheeled into an emergency room where they are not \ngoing to look at me with respect to dollars and cents.''\n  Managed care. What does it mean to quality of care all across this \ncountry? We ought to address that. Do patients have rights? If so, what \nare the rights? Do they have a right to find out from their doctors in \nthis country what the treatment options are? If not, why not? Who is \nwithholding that information from patients and why? Which patient \ndoesn't get it? Is it some function of a bottom line in some company \nthat is making money off health care? Is it some 24-year-old accountant \nin some office 200 miles away that is telling a doctor what kind of \nhealth care that doctor can perform on that patient and what the doctor \ncan tell that patient about the patient's options? This Congress has a \nright and a responsibility to deal with those health care issues, and \nwe ought to do it soon in this session.\n  Mr. President, the issue of education is also critically important. \nThere isn't a country that shortchanges education and remains a strong \nworld-class power. Thomas Jefferson, at the start of this system, said \nanyone who believes this country can be ignorant and free believes in \nsomething that never was and never will be.\n  We can do things to improve education in the country, but I am not \none who believes it is bankrupt. How did we get to where we are? Does \nanyone want to leave this country to find better health care somewhere \nelse? Do you know anybody who wants to go to a world-class university \nwho looks overseas? Most of them are here in this country.\n  I am not one who says it is a bankrupt system, but we can improve it. \nWe ought to get reports on our schools. We get reports about our kids. \nAs parents and taxpayers, we deserve a report card about how our \nschools are doing in educating our kids.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we need to deal with the highway bill, and we \nneed to do that quickly. On our agenda, we ought to decide tomorrow the \nhighway bill ought to be brought to the floor of the Senate. We were \nsupposed to have done it last year and didn't. And we were told now it \nwill be the first item on the agenda this year.\n\n  I am told it may wait until the budget bill. I appeared on a \ntelevision program this morning with the chairman of the relevant \ncommittee in the House of Representatives. He says, well, he is ready \nto bring up the bill in the House, but he has an agreement with the \nSpeaker not to bring it up until the budget bill. That means 2, 3, or 4 \nmonths from now. That cannot happen.\n  We cannot wait 3 or 4 months for a highway bill that was supposed to \nhave been passed last year. You do that and you have contractors in \nStates that cannot do bid lettings, you have people being laid off of \nprojects where the project should go forward to build and repair roads \nand bridges. So we cannot do that.\n  We need to expect, in the next day or two, that the majority leader \nwill do what he told us he would do; that is, bring the highway bill to \nthe floor of the Senate. Let us debate it and let us move it out.\n  Oh, they are worried about an amendment that is going to be offered \nto it. I understand that. But, you know, you can worry about amendments \nforever. Bring the bill to the floor, let us have a vote on the \namendments and send the bill to conference --and let us put some \npressure on the Speaker to do the same on the House side--and get a \nhighway bill out so the American people can have some certainty about \nwhat kind of investment we are going to make in bridges and roads and \nrepairs and the building of that infrastructure.\n  People pay taxes. It goes into a trust fund to do it. And I think \nthey should be able to expect that we are going to do what is \nnecessary.\n  Finally, Mr. President--and I know the Senator from Minnesota is \nwaiting to speak so I will finish--I want to say, in the midst of all \nthat is happening in this country now, there are some who perhaps get \ndiscouraged about this process of ours. And I understand why that can \nbe the case. It is an unusual process.\n  A free and open democratic society is in some cases a society that \ndoes not look good from time to time. And yet, if you look at our \nsystem through a couple hundred years of very successful democracy, you \nsee as democracies\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\npass through angst and anxiety and pain and suffering and all the other \nthings, it tends to make an open and democratic society make tough, \nthoughtful decisions about its future.\n  We have abolished slavery. We have survived depressions. We have \ndefeated Hitler. We have cured polio. We have sent people to the Moon. \nI mean, we can talk a lot about what this country has endured and what \nthis country has done.\n  My only point is, I do not think any of us ought to at this point in \ntime be discouraged about democracy and about Congress and about our \nGovernment and about the press and about all the institutions in our \nlives. It is a good place to be. I do not know of anybody who wants to \ngo elsewhere. I do not know of anybody who wants to exchange it for \nsome other location in the world.\n  We should not be discouraged. Our job, it seems to me, is to do our \nwork for the American people. And there is plenty of work to do. I have \nmentioned some--education, health care, finish the job on fiscal \npolicy, deal with highways, deal with campaign finance reform, and \nmore. And that is just a start.\n  I am here and I am ready, and I hope my colleagues feel the same. We \nought to join hands and say there are things that Democrats and \nRepublicans believe in and can do together. And we will be persuaded to \ndo that if we can just turn off the rap music, turn off the rap that \none side is all wrong and the other side is all right, one side is big \nspenders and the other side is not.\n  I finally say this. I do not think there is a plugged nickel's worth \nof difference between the two aisles in the U.S. Senate--Republicans \nand Democrats--in terms of how much they want to spend. Is there a \ndifference on what they want to spend money for? Absolutely. But I will \nguarantee you, for everybody who stands up on one side of the aisle \nwanting to spend money on one program, there is somebody on the other \nside standing there saying, ``No. I want it spent on my priorities.'' \nWhat we need to do is join together and, through this process, find the \nright priorities for this country's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Real Issues rumble beneath the \ncalm and could soon send a wake-up call,'' by Robert Reich, former \nSecretary of Labor, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n           [From the New York Times Magazine, Jan. 25, 1998]\n\n                     Whatever Happened to Politics?\n\n                          (By Robert B. Reich)\n\n       There's no longer any political news, a reporter friend \n     confided recently, explaining why ``human interest'' stories \n     were oozing like syrup across his newspaper's front pages. \n     We're in the Bland Decade now, a time when citizens march on \n     Washington not to affect politics but to vow they'll be \n     better people and when politicians speak out mainly to urge \n     niceness: volunteer your time, enter into dialogues on race, \n     hire someone off welfare, please. Apparently we need little \n     more than charity, moral uplift and perhaps a modest program \n     or two. Politics is dead, or so it seems.\n       The easiest explanation for this torpor is that the nation \n     is fat, like an overstuffed bear starting hibernation. It's \n     no longer the economy, stupid. Six years ago, a prolonged \n     recession hurt white-collar workers, giving some urgency to \n     the politics of ``change.'' Prosperity, though, is a powerful \n     sedative. Forget politics for now, we seem to be saying. \n     Let's compare stock portfolios, banter about culture and \n     identity and tut-tut over problems decades hence, like an \n     insolvent Social Security trust fund or excessive greenhouse \n     gases.\n       The great economic contests have been won. Communism \n     vanished before it was even vanquished. The Japanese \n     competitive threat is now a sorry heap of bad debt. European \n     welfare states heave under double-digit unemployment. And \n     here in the land of plenty we've never had it so good. Wealth \n     is exploding, unemployment is at a 24-year low, inflation is \n     quiescent (the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan \n     Greenspan, publicly raised concerns about deflation), the \n     stock market is riding high. American capitalism is the envy \n     of the world.\n       But look more closely and the easy explanation falls short. \n     Most Americans don't have it so good. They have jobs, but \n     most wages and benefits are stuck or continue to drop. Wealth \n     has exploded at the top, but the wages of people in the \n     bottom half are lower today in terms of purchasing power than \n     they were in 1989, before the last recession. This is in \n     sharp contrast to every previous recovery in the postwar \n     period. Corporate downsizing and mass layoffs are still \n     the order of the day, which partly explains why so few \n     workers demand raises in this tight labor market. They'd \n     rather keep their jobs.\n       The reality is that Wall Street's advance hasn't been \n     widely shared. The richest 1 percent hold more than 35 \n     percent of the nation's wealth. The typical middle-class \n     family has no more than $7,000 in stocks and $12,500 in \n     mutual funds, according to a 1995 survey by the Federal \n     Reserve and the Treasury Department. Even the recent market \n     surge isn't likely to have changed this very much, given what \n     has happened to wages.\n       Whatever savings Americans do have are imperiled by \n     hospital bills. A growing portion of the public lacks health \n     insurance--in 1989, 33 million Americans under age 65 were \n     without it; by 1996, 41.3 million. (The President's proposal \n     to extend Medicare coverage to early retirees and displaced \n     workers as young as 55, which would be the largest expansion \n     in 25 years, is expected to add only 300,000 to the rolls.)\n       Despite the boom, inequality has widened. The nation's \n     poverty rate is slightly higher than it was before the last \n     recession. In 1989, 12.6 million, or 19.6 percent, of the \n     nation's children lived in poverty; now it's 14.5 million, or \n     20.5 percent. The Conference of Mayors reports rising demand \n     for food and shelter among the homeless. And the successes of \n     the civil rights movement notwithstanding, today's urban \n     schools are more racially segregated than in the 1980's.\n       So why, then, the prevailing political somnolence? \n     Traditional politics has been all about who's gaining and \n     who's losing. Yet it has lately become unfashionable, indeed \n     in poor taste, to notice such things. In the present upbeat \n     climate, downbeat data are slightly subversive. It is \n     necessary to minimize all worry about the economy lest the \n     public lose confidence, a perfect tautology. Bankers and \n     business leaders have become cheerleaders in the nationwide \n     pep rally. Onward! Upward!\n       Recent polls show, accordingly, high rates of consumer \n     confidence. A record 40 percent of consumers queried in the \n     Conference Board's December survey called jobs ``plentiful,'' \n     although, tellingly, only 28 percent expected their own wages \n     to rise. These are the ones who have heard the distant roar \n     of surging wealth and assume that the rising tide will lift \n     them, too--which may explain the record level of consumer \n     debt. Personal bankruptcies are also at a record high.\n       Will politics revive when the economic tide ebbs and \n     hardships appear like shipwrecks on the tidal flats? Not \n     necessarily. Even in 1992, with the nation mired in \n     recession, political engagement was grudging. Americans \n     wanted ``change'' to get the economy moving again. But there \n     was no sense of moral urgency. It was simply time to replace \n     old management with new. Most Americans had long before \n     stopped believing in government as a force for much good \n     in their lives.\n       Some people will say we don't need a vital politics to be a \n     vital society. We can expand the circle of prosperity through \n     grass-roots moral activism, spearheaded by community groups, \n     socially responsible businesses, not-for-profits, religious \n     organizations and compassionate individuals--perhaps all \n     deftly linked by fax and modem, a ``virtual'' social \n     movement. Commentators rightly stress the importance of such \n     civic engagement. But they make a serious mistake labeling it \n     as an alternative to politics. Throughout our history, civic \n     activism has been the precursor, and the propellant, of \n     political movements.\n       Almost a century ago, American politics appeared similarly \n     listless despite growing social problems. As today, the \n     economy was booming, jobs were plentiful and vast fortunes \n     were being accumulated. Yet real wages had stopped growing, \n     and the gulf between rich and poor was widening into a chasm. \n     New technologies (steam engines, railway locomotives, the \n     telephones, steam turbines, electricity) were transforming \n     the nation, pulling families off the farms and immigrants \n     from aboard and depositing many into fetid slums. Wall Street \n     magnates were consolidating their empires. Government was \n     effectively bought by large corporations, and the broad \n     public was deeply cynical. William McKinley won re-election--\n     legened has it, on a pledge to ``stand pat''--and as the \n     century closed, the nation seemed politically comatose.\n       Within three years, however, there was an outburst of \n     reform: muckrakers like Lincoln\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n     Steffens and Ida Tarbell exposed corruption, and the middle \n     class demanded fundamental change; small businessmen railed \n     at monopolies; Wisconsin's crusading Governor, Robert La \n     Follette, enacted legislation regulating health and safety in \n     factories; Oregon limited the hours of work for women (no \n     more than 10 per day); Theodore Roosevelt, McKinley's \n     energetic Vice President who took over after McKinley was \n     assassinated, set out to bust the trusts; suffragists \n     marched; campaigns were organized for pure food and drug \n     laws, workers' compensation and a minimum wage. Politics \n     gained new life and meaning.\n       What happened? Indignation, which had been rising steadily, \n     suddenly burst out and flooded the country. Citizens were \n     already active at the local level, as they are today. Common \n     morality simply couldn't abide the way things were going. Yet \n     instead of opting for revolution or radical change, Americans \n     preferred to spread the benefits of the emerging industrial \n     economy, thereby saving capitalism from its own excesses.\n       Another foreshadowing occurred in the placid Eisenhower \n     era. The overall economy was doing nicely  then as well, even \n     though its benefits had not reached the rural poor, many \n     of whom were black. Politics had grown inert. Ike golfed. \n     In 1954, the Supreme Court decided that separate schools \n     were not equal. In 1957, Eisenhower dispatched Federal \n     troops to Little Rock's Central High School. But who could \n     have predicted that within a few years the civil rights \n     movement would have remolded American politics with the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965?\n       The next revival of American politics can be expected to \n     follow a similar course. The current economic boom has \n     bypassed too many; the gap between winners and losers has \n     grown too wide. Fortunately, there is a common morality at \n     the heart of this capitalist democracy that ultimately keeps \n     us on track and keeps us together. Glimpses of it can be had \n     even in these languid times. For example, a majority of \n     Americans supported last year's increase in the minimum wage \n     to $5.15, although only a tiny fraction stood to benefit. It \n     was a matter of simple fairness. Or consider the broadscale \n     indignation stirred up by revelations of garment sweatshops.\n       We got another glimpse this summer, when a sudden \n     groundswell of support forced a skinflint Congress to extend \n     health care to millions of children. And a majority of \n     Americans supported the United Parcel Service strikers, not \n     because the public is particularly fond of organized labor \n     but because it seemed unfair for U.P.S. to pay its part-time \n     work force so little.\n       Recall also the firestorm when, almost exactly two years \n     ago, AT announced it was firing some 40,000 employees and \n     then gave the boss stock options that raised his total \n     compensation to $16 million, from $6.7 million. Recall, by \n     contrast, the celebration of Aaron Feuerstein, the owner of \n     Malden Mills in Lawrence, Mass., who, after his synthetic-\n     fleece business burned to the ground, assured his employees \n     that he'd stick by them until the factory was rebuilt.\n       The pressure keeps rising. A final glimpse came just before \n     the holidays, when the public signaled unease about giving \n     the President ``fast track'' authority to whisk trade \n     treaties through Congress without amendment and most members \n     of the House of Representatives, including many Republicans, \n     refused to support it. That may be a mistake. Trade is good \n     for America. But the public's negative reaction shouldn't be \n     seen as a repudiation of free trade. It was, at bottom, a \n     matter of fairness: trade hurts some people, and we haven't \n     made adequate provision for the losers.\n       Trade may, in fact, be the precipitating issue this time \n     around. The economic implosion in East Asia will continue to \n     reverberate here, as bahts, won, rupiahs, ringgit and yen \n     drop in value relative to dollars--one of the biggest price-\n     cutting contests in world history. American consumers will \n     have the benefit of bargain-basement sales, but the cheap \n     imports will put additional downward pressure on the wages of \n     lower-skilled Americans. The tumult also will crimp profits \n     of American companies that export to the region, causing more \n     layoffs here. If the Asian flue turns more deadly, the \n     infection here will be all the worse. However resolved, \n     the Asian crisis portends larger jolts, as the global \n     economy absorbs the surging output of 1.2 billion \n     Chinese--more than a fifth of the world's population. When \n     the current recovery ends, the underlying reality will be \n     starkly evident and the political debate surrounding trade \n     will intensify.\n       To an extent, that debate has already begun. The tension \n     between economic nationalism and globalism is emerging as one \n     of the most significant fissures in American politics, and it \n     runs through both parties--as shown by the current dispute \n     over financing for the International Monetary Fund.\n       But it would be unfortunate indeed if the revival of \n     American politics were to turn on the question of whether the \n     nation should engage in more or less commerce with the rest \n     of the world. The underlying choice is larger, more important \n     and more subtle: ultimately, we must decide whether we want \n     to slow the pace of globalization or else take bold steps to \n     help today's losers share in the benefits of the new economy. \n     I cannot predict the outcome of that great debate to come, \n     but I can express a clear preference. It is that we expand \n     the circle of prosperity and that we do so on a scale that \n     matches the challenge.\n       A new nationalism founded on shared prosperity might, for \n     example, support ``re-employment insurance'' that would \n     enable people who lose their jobs to move to new ones with \n     far less disruption and pain than is the norm today. (If the \n     new job paid less, half the difference should be offset for a \n     year by a wage subsidy.)\n       In that spirit, we could enlarge and expand the earned-\n     income tax credit--a reverse income tax that makes work pay \n     if you're at or near the bottom. We could bring a larger \n     portion of the next generation into the circle of prosperity \n     by rebuilding decaying schools and helping states equalize \n     spending between rich and poor school districts. And we would \n     make sure that everyone has access to adequate health care \n     and child care.\n       To finance all of this--and move beyond the small, feel-\n     good programs that lack adequate scale to make much of a \n     difference--we could simply reverse the current trend in \n     public finance and adopt a truly progressive tax system \n     (including payroll taxes).\n       None of this will come easily or without a fight. But in \n     the end, the nation will be stronger and better for bringing \n     everyone, or nearly everyone, along. Future historians \n     looking back on the Bland Decade will conclude that, as \n     before, American politics wasn't really dead. It was only \n     caught napping.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  It is really a superb article.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S15-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16-S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to just speak briefly. I think \nwe are all back. As the Senator from North Dakota said, I think most of \nus really are focused on the legislative work, Democrats and \nRepublicans. I think that people want us to be focused on our work. But \nour work is connected to our conversations with people in our States, \nwhat people have said to us, and trying to connect what we do as \nlegislators to the betterment of the lives of people that we serve.\n  Mr. President, I was impressed with Secretary Reich's piece because I \nhave found in my travels in Minnesota and around the country that while \nall of the macroeconomic statistics look good--for that I am grateful; \nthe GDP and other indicators of economic performance, the official \nlevels of unemployment, a record low, so on and so forth--that in many \nways we have a paradox which is that we also, at least since we started \ncollecting social science data, we have the most stratification in our \nsociety that we have ever had.\n  We have the most glaring inequalities, and I think we have been \nmoving to two Americas. It is not the other America that Michael wrote \nabout in a very important book in 1963 about poverty, which I know the \npresiding officer has been concerned about, but it is two different \nAmericas.\n  You have one America with mounting access to all the things that I \nsuppose you could say make life richer in possibilities, and you have \nanother America struggling to make ends meet.\n  You have one America that is barreling down the information \nsuperhighway, and you have another America without even the rudimentary \nskills to participate in our economy or to participate in our polity or \nto participate in our society.\n  You have one America with the economic resources to purchase the \nsecurity of gated communities, living in gated communities, and you \nhave another America that is beset by the decay of some of our very \nimportant social institutions which we have to rebuild if we are to \nrebuild communities, libraries, hospitals, and schools.\n  You have one America that is focused on a booming stock market, and \nyou have another America that is faced with the insecurities of a job \nmarket still with all of the downsizing and the latest news about AT, \nI think, laying off 18,000 employees.\n  You have one America that every summer sort of plans a trip to Asia \nor Europe, and you have another America where the discussion is, ``How \ncan we scrape up enough money to take the family to a ballgame?''\n  Mr. President, I find that, in just touring the cafes in Minnesota--I \nwant to draw from my data, which is now less social science data and \njust conversations with people. You know, most people in the country--\npoor people, middle-income people, professional people, it does not \nreally matter--from really almost all walks of life, I think first and \nforemost, are very focused on how they can earn a decent living and how \nthey can give their children the care they know their children need and \ndeserve.\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n  To me, that translates into lots of specific conversations. I could \ntalk a lot about health care. But there is one conversation I cannot \nforget. It was with a woman. I met her a year ago. It was very sad. Her \nhusband is about 40 and found out he had cancer and was given a couple \nmonths to live. I met them about 2 months ago, and she reintroduced me \nto her husband, who is now in a wheelchair.\n  She said, ``You know, Senator, the doctors said that my husband had \nonly 2 months to live, but he's a real fighter. And I want you to come \non over and say hello.'' You know how that happens when we are out and \nabout. Of course, I did and was pleased to talk to him. Then she took \nme aside and said, ``Every day it is just a nightmare. I'm constantly \non the phone trying to find out what my insurance companies will cover, \nwhat they will not cover. It is a constant battle.''\n  Mr. President, I think, therefore, health care is very much on the \nagenda. I do not have time to talk about all the specifics of policy, \nbut I am very interested in making sure it is not just bottom-line \nmedicine. I am very interested in all of us, Democrats and Republicans, \nmaking sure there is some consumer protection and also that the \ncaregivers are able to give the kind of care they went to medical \nschool or nursing school to be able to give.\n  I am very interested in our really thinking about a strategy, going \ninto the next century, about how do we obtain universal coverage, \ncomprehensive care. And I think it can be a decentralist thrust with \nStates figuring out ways to do it within a national framework, within a \npackage of benefits, affordable, and with consumer protection. That is \na bill I look forward to introduce.\n  I think we can do better. I loved working with Senator Domenici on \nmental health. I tell you, there is an area I am really looking forward \nto do work on as a legislator and that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell \nis going to be working with me on. That is in the whole area of the \nSubstance Abuse Parity Act, trying to make sure that people--it is just \nwrong. People who are struggling with alcoholism, for example, where \nthey get detox treatment once or twice, then there is no longer any \ncoverage.\n\n  We can do much better. There is a tremendous amount of discrimination \nhere. We can do much better as a nation. I look forward to working on \nthat legislation.\n  Mr. President, above and beyond health care, I would like to talk \njust a little bit about jobs, and jobs with decent wages. I have had a \nchance to travel. It has been the best work I have done outside of \nMinnesota.\n  I would love to travel with you, I say to the Presiding Officer, \nbecause I think as a Senator from Indiana you have focused a lot on \nthese issues. We may have different approaches, but you have just a \ntremendous commitment to this.\n  I have traveled in a lot of low-income communities from Letcher \nCounty, KY, where my wife's family is from, to Appalachia to Chicago to \nBaltimore to East L.A., to Watts to urban and rural Minnesota to the \ndelta in Mississippi.\n  There are two questions people ask in these communities. One of those \nquestions is, ``Where are the jobs that we can be trained for and that \nwe can find to support our families on?''\n  I think raising the minimum wage--I was speaking with Senator Kennedy \nabout this--is absolutely on the mark. I think we must do it. I think \nit is a matter of economic justice. It is also true, however, as \nWilliam Julius Wilson, in his fine book about a year and a half ago, \nmakes the fine point that in some communities and ghettos there is the \ndisappearance of work, there is no work.\n  So the question is, how do we build the human capital and make sure \nthere are jobs that are community-building jobs? And how do we link \nthat with the private sector? How do we ultimately make sure people are \nable to get transitional jobs for a year to build those skills, to \nbuild community? And we can then at the same time have the job training \nand track the private-sector capital in those communities.\n  I think it is a real priority, if we are concerned about these issues \nof race and gender and poverty and children. They are all far more \ncorrelated and interrelated than some of us want to admit.\n  Another area I want to talk about is the President's initiative on \nchild care. Two points I would like to make.\n  Again, I do not do justice to the policy debate which we will have, \nbut at least I want to just try to survey this.\n  I think the President has really laid forth some good proposals. I \nthink we can do more and should do more, and I want to talk about that. \nWe have to make sure that the tax credits, if that is the way we go, \nare refundable so families with incomes under $28,000 who did not have \na tax liability can benefit.\n  I think the after-school care is extremely important. But you know \nwhat? I read in the paper--and maybe, Mr. President, you are a part of \nthis that Senator Chafee and others were talking about--how it is we \nalso can target resources to families where one parent stays at home. I \nthink that is an excellent idea.\n  I met with so many couples in Minnesota where one of them will say, \n``You know, Senator, one of us is not working. We understand why both \nparents work, but we made the decision not to. We forgo the income. We \nthink one of us should be at home during these early years. And why not \nhave some of the funding stream go toward providing us with some \nassistance?''\n  I think that is an excellent idea. I hope we can really kind of \ncombine efforts and do something about early childhood development. It \nis so important.\n  The medical evidence--Mr. President, you have held some hearings--it \nis irrefutable and irreducible. We have to do well for these children. \nThey are all God's children. And if we do not do well for these \nchildren--the private sector, public sector, community based--by age 3, \nmany of them will never be ready for school. They will never be ready \nfor life. And I cannot think of a more important investment. I want to \ntalk some about that as well.\n  Mr. President, I will finish up because I only reserved 10 minutes \nfor myself. I just say to my colleagues, there is so much work to be \ndone, so many problems.\n  I was in East Grand Forks the other day. Last year we were on the \nfloor talking about the floods. It was heartbreaking. James Lee Witt \nhas just done a great job. I so appreciate what he has done for \nMinnesota. And FEMA came through. But you know what? We lost a third of \nour housing stock from the flood in East Grand Forks. There are seniors \non fixed incomes, low-income people. They cannot find housing. We are \ngoing to have to build that housing. There is going to be State money. \nMaybe we can leverage Federal money.\n  There are many real problems, many important issues that face \nfamilies in Minnesota and all across the country. I have delineated \nsome of them.\n  I urge my colleagues, get out on the floor, do the work in committee, \nbring the bills and the amendments out here. Just do the work.\n  I can't resist this, since the Chair happens to be one of my very \ngood friends and is about to tell me I am out of time, I look forward \nto debating Senator Coats out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor a period of time not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bryan pertaining to the introduction of S. 1572 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. 1573 are located in today's Record under ``Submission \nof Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight the President of the United \nStates will address the country in the State of the Union Address and \nmuch of the focus of that speech, we have been told, will be on the \nsubject of education, something that I know the Presiding Officer has \nworked on over the years, and certainly I have worked on as my No. 1 \npriority since I came to the U.S. Senate. I am really pleased, however, \nthat among the items in the area of education that the President will \ntouch on is a particular item that I have labored long and hard on \nsince I came to the Senate, and that is the issue of our crumbling \nschools.\n  The President will tonight propose an initiative to rebuild our \ncrumbling schools by making available support for local efforts to deal \nwith the facilities and the infrastructure of their schools in the \nrespective parts of the country.\n  The centerpiece of the proposal that will be announced tonight is a \nplan to provide tax credits to help stimulate local school construction \nand modernization. The plan will help States and school districts \naddress the enormous backlog of deferred maintenance to upgrade their \nschools to incorporate and accommodate modern technologies and to build \nnew classrooms to accommodate soaring enrollment where appropriate.\n  The plan--and I would like to talk specifically about it --will \npropose the creation of a new class of zero-interest bonds which can be \nused exclusively for school facilities and infrastructure development. \nInstead of receiving interest payments on these bonds, purchasers of \nthe bonds will instead receive Federal income tax credits.\n  This innovative plan will stimulate at least $22 billion--$22 \nbillion--worth of school improvements over the next several years. \nFrankly, it is exactly the kind of new thinking and the kind of new \npartnership and innovative and creative financing that we will need to \naddress the issue of our crumbling school infrastructure.\n  I would like to take a moment to revisit how this issue came about. \nComing out of State and local government, I was very concerned that we \nmaintain, on the one hand, the values of local control of education, \nbut at the same time find some way to relieve the pressure on the local \nproperty taxes that elementary and secondary education so often \nrequires.\n  Among the issues that seemed to me to be the most pressing and the \nmost difficult for local districts to address was the question of \nschool facilities. The buildings in which many of our children go to \nschool are literally falling down around them. Most of these buildings \nhave been built a generation ago when I was in school or the Presiding \nOfficer was in school. Frankly, over time, these things just wear down. \nSo you can see all over, certainly all over my State of Illinois and, \nindeed, all over the country, that our school facilities are crumbling \nright in front of us. Students talk about the fact that the windows are \nbroken or the roof leaks or the lights--it even got to the point where \nCharles Schulz with the Peanuts cartoon did a series where Peppermint \nPatty is sitting in the classroom and raindrops are falling on her \nhead.\n\n  The point is, we can do better. So I commissioned a study by the \nGeneral Accounting Office to look at the issue of crumbling schools. \nThey went around and did a really exhaustive and highly acclaimed \nsurvey in which they documented $112 billion worth of deferred needs in \nterms of our school infrastructure; $112 billion required to rebuild \nthe schools, to fix the plants, to provide our children with an \nenvironment that is suitable for learning.\n  In addition to the aesthetics of it, that we want our kids to go to \nclassrooms that are comfortable, consider for a moment that you cannot \nuse a computer unless you plug it into the wall. If the electrical \nsystem is not there, then we will be denying our youngsters the \nopportunity to get trained, denying our work force the opportunity to \nbe trained to compete in this global economy. It seems to me this is \nsomething of national importance and import and that it makes sense for \nthe Federal Government to weigh in to help local districts meet the \nneeds, the $112 billion worth of needs, all over the country.\n  I started down this trail attempting to get a modest appropriation. I \nwent in and got $600 million authorized and $100 million appropriated \nto this end. Then in the Congress of 1994, the $100 million that I had \ngotten appropriated for rebuilding the crumbling schools was taken back \nin the rescission package. So there was no money for it.\n  We started the ball up the hill again, and the second time around, we \nwere able to get the support of the White House and the Department of \nEducation, and they proposed a $5 billion tax credit program to do \nthis. That went up through committee and then eventually fell because \nof the lack of support last year.\n  We have continued with this. Frankly, at every step of the way, even \nthough we failed to actually get the full appropriation that we wanted, \nthe public support built and built and built to the point that in the \nlast session of the Congress, when we passed the Tax Relief Act, we \nwere able in that bill to get some support for local districts going \ninto the capital markets to borrow money. We changed the arbitrage \nrules a little bit. We raised the bond cap. So we were able to get some \nfinancial support but certainly not the $5 billion that we had hoped to \nget.\n  Now the issue has gotten to the top of the pop charts, and polling \ndata tells us again that 79 percent of the American people think there \nis an appropriate Federal role in rebuilding educational facilities.\n  This proposal that the President will announce tonight will allow us \nto access about $22 billion--now, that is not the whole $112 billion--\nbut $22 billion will help local districts repair their crumbling \nschools without having to increase property taxes. It seems to me that \nthat is an absolutely appropriate role for us to take, given the \nnational security interests, given the future of our work force, given \nthe national stakes in all of this. If we can begin to have Federal \nsupport of elementary and secondary education in ways that preserve \nlocal control of education but allow us to contribute national \nresources to the enormous task that is before us, then we would have \ndone our duty, frankly, by this next generation.\n  So I am very pleased that the creative financing proposal that will \nbe mentioned tonight represents a new direction, a new partnership. I \nbelieve firmly that the days when we can point fingers and say, ``Well, \nit's the local taxpayers' fault that the schools are falling down,'' \nor, ``It's the State government's fault the schools are falling down,'' \nor somebody else's fault, the days of fingerpointing are over. In fact, \nmy mother used to say, when you point a finger, you always have three \nof them pointing back at yourself.\n  If we can begin to have a new kind of partnership where States and \nlocal governments and the National Government work together to provide \nour children with the education that they need and the work force \ndevelopment that our country deserves, we will have discharged our \nresponsibility to them and to the future of this Nation.\n  We certainly have every opportunity with this proposal to go forward \nand pass this legislation. I am hopeful that we will do better this \ntime around in achieving bipartisan support for the approach that says \nthis is a new partnership; this new partnership will maintain local \ncontrol and will give, if anything, local governments some financial \nsupport with regard to the challenge they face in rebuilding their \ncrumbling schools.\n  I am very excited about it, but having had two previous successes \nthat were undone, I am not going to get\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\noverly excited until such time as the President actually signs the \nbill. But I am very encouraged, Mr. President, that the force of this \nidea has continued to support it and the force of this concept means, I \nthink, that it is an idea whose time has come. That being the case, I \nfeel very confident that, if not now, we will eventually pass \nlegislation to rebuild our crumbling schools so that America's \nschoolchildren are given suitable environments in which they can learn.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S18-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19-S20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RESERVE JUDGMENT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nstatements made earlier today by Senator Leahy concerning Independent \nCounsel Kenneth Starr. Senator Leahy has challenged Mr. Starr on a \nnumber of items, matters of very substantial concern.\n  I telephoned Mr. Starr to find out what the facts were. Both Senator \nLeahy and I are on the Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over \nthe Department of Justice and also the independent counsel. Senator \nLeahy began his presentation by noting that he had spent nearly a \ndecade as a prosecutor, and I have a similar background, actually a \nlittle longer than a decade, but about the same. Senator Leahy then \ncommented about his concern about law enforcement being nonpartisan and \nnonideological, and on the facts. I most certainly agree with Senator \nLeahy on his assertions to that extent. Then Senator Leahy proceeded to \ncriticize Mr. Starr for conducting a partisan investigation, for making \nleaks to the press, by coordinating the investigation with what is \ngoing on in the civil case involving Ms. Paula Jones, and charging that \nthere was a sting operation to engage the President of the United \nStates in secretly recorded conversations. All of these are obviously \nvery serious accusations.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that the current controversy involving \nthe President and Ms. Monica Lewinsky is something that ought to be put \nbehind the country at the earliest possible time. I made public \nstatements last week when the President was questioned about this \nmatter, while Chairman Arafat was in his office, and said that I \nthought it inappropriate to have that question and bad practice for the \nPresident to respond to that question, and made public statements last \nweek and over the weekend about what I consider to be an unwise media \nfrenzy on this matter--that we all ought to wait and see what the facts \nare before coming to any conclusions, and in the interim the President \nought to be permitted to carry out his duties because they are very, \nvery important duties.\n  I agree with what Senator Leahy said when he recited the issues of \nforeign policy, Iraq, the State of the Union, and the matters which the \nPresident has to deal with.\n  There have been many reports in the press about what Mr. Starr did \nand how he got into this investigation and whether his activities were \nan inappropriate extension of what he had been authorized to do prior \nto the time he took his first steps on this matter involving Ms. Monica \nLewinsky. Mr. Starr told me this afternoon in a telephone conversation \nthat he did engage in a consensual monitoring in the eastern district \nof Virginia on a conversation with Ms. Linda Tripp and Ms. Monica \nLewinsky. It was a consensual monitoring because it was consented to by \nMs. Linda Tripp. Mr. Starr told me that Ms. Linda Tripp had been a \nwitness on independent counsel matters in the past involving the White \nHouse Travel Office and Mr. Foster, and that the consensual monitoring \nwas undertaken to corroborate what Ms. Linda Tripp had told Mr. Starr \nindependently.\n  Mr. Starr said it was an appropriate exercise of his existing \njurisdiction because in his investigation involving Mr. Webster Hubble, \nMr. Hubble's situation involved a matter where an individual was \ninvolved in providing job arrangements for Mr. Hubble outside the \nDistrict of Columbia with a certain prospective employer. Mr. Starr \nsaid that the same person was involved in providing a job opportunity \nfor Ms. Monica Lewinsky outside the District of Columbia with the same \nprospective employer and that this connection was sufficient for Mr. \nStarr to proceed with this consensual monitoring, which Mr. Starr \npointed out was done professionally by the FBI and, as Mr. Starr \ndescribed it, in a completely appropriate manner. Mr. Starr advised \nthat he then took this matter to the Department of Justice after he had \ncompleted the consensual monitoring.\n\n  Mr. President, I will not become involved here in what the factual \nallegations are, what Ms. Tripp said or what Ms. Lewinsky said, because \nthe issue which concerns me and the thrust of what Senator Leahy \ncomplained about is the propriety of Mr. Starr's activity, and that \nneed not involve the allegations and the substance. I think there has \nalready been enough talk about that, in any event.\n  Mr. Starr then advised that he took the tape recordings to the \nDepartment of Justice, met with the senior attorney and the public \nintegrity section. There was a collaborative determination between the \nDepartment of Justice and independent counsel as to who should carry \nout the further investigation. Mr. Starr advised that the Attorney \nGeneral then asked the special court of the District of Columbia \nCircuit to specifically enlarge Mr. Starr's jurisdiction so that he \ncould proceed with this investigation.\n  Now, we all know that Attorney General Reno has been very circumspect \nin the independent counsel issue as to appointment and as to extending \njurisdiction--that has been a subject matter which has been talked \nabout on this floor a great deal, to a substantial extent by this \nSenator. But the facts as Mr. Starr outlined them are that he proceeded \nin this way just as outlined, which is entirely appropriate because of \nthe connection between what happened with Ms. Monica Lewinsky and what \nhappened with Mr. Webster Hubble. That was obviously approved by \nAttorney General Reno when she then acted on information which Mr. \nStarr brought to her to request the special court of the District of \nColumbia Circuit to enlarge Mr. Starr's jurisdiction.\n  I asked Mr. Starr further about the other statements which Senator \nLeahy had made. I now quote from the transcript:\n\n       Senator Leahy: I look at the continuing and very selective \n     leaks and tactics employed by Mr. Starr's office over the \n     last few years and particularly over the last few days.\n\n  I asked not only Mr. Starr about the leaks, which he emphatically \ndenied, but also about the composition of the personnel who were \nhandling this sensitive material, and Mr. Starr gave me some \nsubstantial detail about the attorneys who were on the matter in terms \nof their backgrounds and in terms of their professionalism, which Mr. \nStarr says is the effort made and he thinks is always the effort made, \nto avoid the leaks. We all know in Washington, DC, or for that matter, \nany place, the difficulty of establishing leaks, but if someone makes a \ncontention, as Senator Leahy does, as to leaks, the question is, what \nis the proof of those leaks.\n  Mr. Starr made an emphatic denial regarding the leaks, and spoke of \nthe professionalism of the people that have the confidential \ninformation.\n  Senator Leahy went on to say earlier today, ``I have seen reports of \ntwo weekends ago that he,'' referring to Mr. Starr, ``was intent on \nconducting a sting operation to engage the President of the United \nStates in secretly recorded conversations. Have we sunk this low, Mr. \nPresident, that we would do things like this?\"\n  I asked Mr. Starr about that, and he emphatically denied it. I, too, \nhave seen press reports about the proposed sting operation, but I think \nit is very important that as we accord the President the presumption of \ninnocence and as we look for proof before coming to any judgments about \nanyone, that the same thing apply to Mr. Kenneth Starr, the independent \ncounsel, and that a serious accusation about the sting operation ought \nto have some authentication and verification before it\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nis made on the floor of the U.S. Senate. At least that is my opinion.\n  Senator Leahy went on earlier today saying, ``I have seen \ncomplaints,'' he is referring to Mr. Starr, ``he sought to curse a \nyoung woman''--I asked Kenneth Starr about that, and again he denied it \nin absolute terms--``and threatened her mother and father if she did \nnot cooperate.'' Again, Mr. Starr denied that in absolute terms.\n  Senator Leahy then went on to say, ``Mr. Starr's office seems oddly \ncoordinated to aid the civil lawsuit against the President involving \nthe Miss Paula Jones case.'' Again I asked Mr. Starr about that, and it \nhas been denied.\n\n  Mr. President, I make these comments after talking to Kenneth Starr, \nparticularly to state for the record exactly how Mr. Starr got into \nthis matter on the consensual monitoring. A consensual monitoring under \nVirginia law is appropriate when one party to the conversation agrees \nto it so that in the action by Mr. Starr and the FBI agents in \nrecording the conversation of Ms. Monica Lewinsky and Ms. Linda Tripp, \nwhere Ms. Linda Tripp has consented to it--that was a lawful consensual \nmonitoring--and as explained by Mr. Starr, the nexus or connection \njustifying his conduct was because the same person had suggested \nproviding a job opportunity for Ms. Monica Lewinsky with the same \nemployer who had made similar activity with respect to Mr. Webster \nHubble.\n  It would be my hope that as this matter proceeds, that there would be \na toning down of the decibel level and a real effort made to find out \nwhat the facts are before accusations are made against anybody. I think \nthat applies to President Clinton, as I said so last week and over the \nweekend, and applies to Mr. Starr, and there has been a concern \nexpressed that there is now an orchestrated effort made to discredit \nIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr. I do not know whether that is true \nor not. There have been a number of statements coming out, but whatever \nthe charges and accusations that were made against anybody--President \nClinton, Independent Counsel Starr, anyone--they ought to be backed up \nby the facts and not a recitation of something that appeared in the \nnewspaper where we know of the questionable reliability of what appears \nin the press.\n  The real issue here is not necessarily what Mr. Starr has done but \nwhat the underlying facts are on the substantive matter at issue. If \nMr. Starr has acted in an inappropriate manner, that can be reviewed at \nsome time. When you deal with issues such as those involved here, we \nare not looking at a respective criminal case where the admissible \nevidence is judged on certain standards. We are looking at a real \ndetermination to find what the facts are so that we can make a \ndetermination as to what ought to be done in this matter.\n  It is my view that once the facts are asserted, there will be general \nagreement about what the conclusions ought to be. But it is not the \nIndependent Counsel's conduct at issue here. I think the Independent \nCounsel ought to conduct himself in a manner which comports with the \nmanner of decency. That is his job and responsibility. Also, I think \nthat he is entitled not to be vilified in newspaper headlines or \nnewspaper stories. But the facts ought to be ascertained. The facts as \nMr. Starr outlines them to me justify the steps that he took. That is \nnot my view alone; that is corroborated by what Attorney General Reno \nhas done in the case.\n\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 105th \nCongress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\n  Since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two \npatriots and fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of \nthe aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep \nlove for this House and an unshakeable commitment to improving the \nlives of all our people. In the past few weeks they have been \neulogized; tonight, let us send a message to their families and \nfriends--let us celebrate their lives, and give thanks for their \nservice to their nation.\n  For 209 years, it has been the President's duty to report to you on \nthe State of the Union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of \nthe American people, these are good times for America. We have more \nthan 14 million new jobs. The lowest unemployment in 24 years. The \nlowest core inflation in 30 years. Incomes are rising, and we have the \nhighest homeownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five \nyears in a row, and the welfare rolls are the lowest in 27 years. Our \nleadership in the world is unrivaled. The state of our union is strong.\n  But with barely 700 days left in the 20th Century, this is not a time \nto rest; it is a time to build, to build the America within our reach.\n  An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work. \nWhere every citizen can live in a safe community. Where families are \nstrong, schools are good, and all young people can go on to college. An \nAmerica where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to \nAlzheimers to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand \nacross a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting \never painted, every symphony ever composed.\n  Where government provides opportunity, and citizens honor the \nresponsibility to give something back to their communities. An America \nwhich leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity.\n  This is the America we have begun to build; this is the America we \ncan leave to our children--if we join together to finish the work at \nhand. Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st Century.\n  Rarely have Americans lived through so much change, in so many ways, \nin so short a time. Quietly but with gathering force, the ground has \nshifted beneath our feet, as we move into an information age, a global \neconomy, a truly new world.\n  For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as \nAmericans have at every turning point--by renewing the very idea of \nAmerica; widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of \nour freedom, forging a more perfect union.\n  We have shaped a new kind of government for the Information Age. I \nthank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its \nsupport in building a government that is leaner, more flexible, a \ncatalyst for new ideas. Most of all, a government that gives the \nAmerican people the tools they need to make the most of their own \nlives.\n  We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say \ngovernment is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My \nfellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest \ngovernment in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller \ngovernment, but a stronger nation.\n  We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st \nCentury. An economy that offers opportunity. A society rooted in \nresponsibility. And a nation that lives as a community.\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\n                   an economy that offers opportunity\n\n  First, Americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursued a \nnew strategy for prosperity: Fiscal discipline to cut interest rates \nand spur growth. Investments in education and skills, in science and \ntechnology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new \neconomy. New markets for American products and American workers.\n  When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 \nbillion, and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be \n$10 billion, and heading lower.\n  For three decades, six Presidents have come before you to warn of the \ndamage deficits pose to the nation. Tonight, I come before you to \nannounce that the federal deficit--once so incomprehensibly large that \nit had eleven zeroes--will be, simply . . . zero.\n  We will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 \nyears.\n  And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget \nthis year--four years ahead of schedule.\n  Turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle. It is the product \nof hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in \nCongress--the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit \nof 90% . . . and the historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement \npassed by this Congress. And if we maintain our resolve, we will \nproduce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.\n  We must not go back to unwise spending, or untargeted tax cuts, that \nrisk reopening the deficit. Last year, we enacted targeted tax cuts, so \nthat typical middle class families will now have the lowest tax in 20 \nyears.\n  My plan to balance the budget next year includes new investments and \nnew tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, \nchild care, and the environment.\n  But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to \nmeet this test: approve only those priorities that can actually be \naccomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.\n  If we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we will \nthen have a sizeable surplus in the years immediately afterward. What \nshould we do with this projected surplus?\n  I have a simple four word answer: Save Social Security first.\n  Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100% of the surplus--that's every \npenny of any surplus--until we have taken all the measures necessary to \nstrengthen the Social Security system for the 21st Century.\n  Let us say to all Americans watching tonight--whether you are 70 . . \n. or 50 . . . or just beginning to pay into the system--Social Security \nwill be there when you need it. Let us, tonight, make this commitment: \nSocial Security first.\n  I urge all Americans to join us--in facing these issues squarely, and \nforming a true consensus on how to proceed. We'll start by conducting \nnonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope that \nlawmakers of both parties will participate. We will host a White House \nconference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I \nwill convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan \nlegislation to achieve a landmark for our generation--a Social Security \nsystem that is strong in the 21st Century.\n  In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to \nreap the rewards of prosperity.\n  Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, \nsensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for \ntheir families: We should raise the minimum wage.\n  The information age is first and foremost an education age . . . in \nwhich education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime.\n  Last year, from this podium, I said education was our highest \npriority. I laid out a ten point plan to move us forward, and urged us \nall to make sure politics ends at the schoolhouse door.\n  Since then, this Congress and the American people have responded, in \nthe most important year for education in a generation . . . expanding \npublic school choice . . . opening the way to 3,000 charter schools . . \n. working to connect every classroom to the information superhighway . \n. . committing to expand Head Start to 1 million children . . . \nlaunching America Reads, sending thousands of college students into our \nschools to make sure all our 8 year olds can read.\n  Last year I proposed, and you passed . . . 220,000 new Pell Grant \nscholarships for deserving students. Student loans are already less \nexpensive and easier to repay, and now you can deduct the interest. \nFamilies all over America can put savings into our new, tax free \neducation IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, \nfamilies will get a $1,500 tax cut--a Hope Scholarship that will cover \nthe cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior \nyear, graduate school, and job training, there's a lifetime learning \ncredit.\n  So I have something to say to each and every American family \nlistening tonight: your children can go on to college. If you know a \nchild from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go to \ncollege. If you know struggling young parents who are worried they \nwon't be able to save for their children's education, you tell them not \nto give up. Their children can go on to college. If you know somebody \ncaught in a dead-end job, afraid he can't afford the classes that will \nget him better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up. \nHe can go to college.\n  We can make college as universal as high school is today. And my \nfriends, this will change the face of 21st Century America.\n  We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher \neducation. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools \nthe best in the world, too--by raising standards, raising expectations, \nand raising accountability.\n  Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, \nfor the first time, a voluntary national test based on national \nstandards in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math. Parents have a right \nto know whether their children are mastering the basics.\n  And every parent already knows the key: good teachers and small \nclasses. Tonight I propose the first ever national effort to reduce \nclass size in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire \n100,000 new teachers who have passed a state competency test. With \nthese teachers, we will reduce class size in the first, second, and \nthird grades to an average of 18 students a class.\n  If I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes \nrequires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax \ncut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.\n  We must also demand accountability. When we promote a child from \ngrade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we do that child no \nfavors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.\n  Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision--not to hold children \nback, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion, and \nstarted mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to \ncatch up. I proposed an effort to help other communities follow \nChicago's lead. Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't \nlearn, and we will give you the tools you need to make sure they do.\n  I also ask this Congress to support our effort to enlist colleges and \nuniversities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the 6th \ngrade--to give them guidance and hope so they too can go on to college.\n  As we enter the 21st Century, the global economy requires us to seek \nopportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We \nmust shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last five \nyears, we have led the way in opening new markets, with 240 trade \nagreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud \nstamp, ``Made in the USA.''\n  Today, record high exports account for fully one third of our \neconomic growth. I want to keep them going, because that's the way to \nkeep American growing and to advance a safer, more stable world.\n  This is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition \nto more comprehensive trade agreements, rooted in two fears; first that \nour trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards \nwhich will give them an unfair advantage in our markets--and do their \nown people no favors; and, second, that with more trade, more of our \nworkers will lose their jobs and have to start over.\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\n  We should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around \nthe world. It should be a part of our trade agenda. But we can't \ninfluence other countries' decisions if we send a message to them that \nwe're backing away from trade.\n  This year, I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations \nto join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all--\nabusive child labor.\n  We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily \nleft behind by the global marketplace, or by the march of technology.\n  That is why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated \nworkers since 1993--and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple it.\n  That is why we must do more, more quickly, to help workers who lose \ntheir jobs for any reason. We help communities when their military base \ncloses. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.\n  And that is why, again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan \nwork to consolidate the tangle of training programs into a GI Bill for \nWorkers, a simple skills grant so people can move quickly to new jobs \nand higher incomes.\n  Change is not always easy, but we have to reap its benefits. And \nremember the big picture: While we have been entering into hundreds of \nnew trade agreements, we have been creating millions of new jobs.\n  So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia \nand Europe. We should pass the new African Trade Act.\n  And I renew my request for the fast track negotiating authority \nnecessary to open more new markets and create more new jobs, which \nevery President has had for two decades.\n  Whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the \nworld's economies are more and more interconnected.\n  Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. \nRecent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, \nIndonesia, South Korea and beyond.\n  Why should Americans be concerned about this?\n  First, these countries are our customers--and if they sink into \nrecession, they won't be able to buy the goods we want to sell them. \nThey are also our competitors--and if their currencies lose their \nvalue, the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and \nothers with cheap goods, making it tougher for our people to compete. \nFinally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our \nsecurity.\n  The American economy remains sound and strong--and I want to keep it \nthat way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all \nthe world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as \nsmall as possible is the right thing to do for a safer world--and the \nright thing to do for America.\n  Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform \nitself. But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic \nreform, we should help them to do it. So I call on Congress to renew \nAmerica's commitment to the International Monetary Fund.\n  Preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser \nthan ignoring the thunder until the clouds are overhead.\n\n\n                   a society rooted in responsibility\n\n  A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility.\n  A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of \nwork, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger \npointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. Now we \nare replacing welfare checks with paychecks.\n  Last year, after a record four year decline in welfare rolls, I \nchallenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by \nthe year 2000. I am pleased to report that we have also met that goal--\ntwo years ahead of schedule.\n  This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual \ncourage, persistence and hope. For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of \nIndianapolis, Indiana was on and off welfare. Today, she is a \ndispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her \nfamily to a good neighborhood. And she's helping other welfare \nrecipients get to work.\n  Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the \nwelfare revolution; there are millions just like her across America. I \nam happy she could join the First Lady tonight. Elaine, we are very \nproud of you.\n  We must all do more to make welfare reform a success--providing child \ncare, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more \ncompanies to join the welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child \nsupport collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support \ntheir own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some \nbenefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard--and I ask \nyou to finish the job this year.\n  We must make it possible for hardworking families to meet their most \nimportant responsibilities.\n  Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans keep their health \ninsurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to \nup to 5 million children. This year, I challenge Congress to take the \nnext historic steps.\n  160 million Americans are in managed care plans. These plans can save \nmoney and can improve care. But medical decisions should be made by \nmedical doctors, not insurance company accountants.\n  I urge the Congress to write into law a Consumer Bill of Rights that \nsays this: You have the right to know all your medical options--not \njust the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for \nthe care you need. You have the right to emergency room care, wherever \nand whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical \nrecords confidential. Traditional care or managed care, every American \ndeserves quality care.\n  Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their \nhealth insurance. Some are retired; some are laid off; some lost their \ncoverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they are \nleft with nowhere to turn. So I ask the Congress: let these hardworking \nAmericans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the \ndeficit--but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.\n  Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest \nhealth threat they face: an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by \nmultimillion dollar marketing campaigns.\n  So I challenge Congress: let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive \nlegislation that will improve public health, protect tobacco farmers, \nand change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what \nit takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of \ncigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, with \npenalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to kids. \nTomorrow, like every day, 3000 children will start smoking. 1000 of \nthem will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the \nCongress that saved their lives.\n  In the new economy, most parents work, harder than ever. They face a \nconstant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers--and \ntheir even more important obligations to be good parents.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I signed \ninto law. I ask you to extend the law to cover 10 million more workers, \nand to give parents time off for parent-teacher conferences and \ndoctor's visits.\n  Child care is the next frontier. Last year, the First Lady and I \nhosted the very first White House conference on child care. From all \ncorners of America, we heard the same message: we must raise the \nquality of child care and make it safer and more affordable.\n  Here is my plan: Help families to pay for child care for one million \nmore children. Scholarships and background checks for child care \nworkers, and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for \nbusinesses that provide child care for their employees.\n  And a larger child care tax credit for working families--so that if \nyou pass my plan a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high \nchild care costs will no longer pay a penny of federal income tax.\n  You know, I have often wondered how my mother--as a young widow--\nwould have been able to go away to school if my grandparents had not \nbeen able to care for me. She and I were lucky. How many other families \nnever get that same opportunity? We don't know the answer to that \nquestion. But\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\nwe do know what the answer should be: Not a single family should have \nto choose between the job they need and the child they love.\n  A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe \nschools, safe neighborhoods.\n  We are pursuing a strategy of more police, tougher punishment and \nsmarter prevention, with crimefighting partnerships with local law \nenforcement and citizen groups.\n  I can report to you tonight that it is working. Violent crime is \ndown, robbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down . . . for five \nyears in a row, all across America.\n  Now we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on the \nstreets.\n  Again I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more \nprosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs, guns and \ndrugs, and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.\n  And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school \nprograms. Most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in \nthe afternoon and 8 at night. We can keep so many of our children out \nof trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other \nthan the streets.\n  Drug use is on the decline. I thank General Barry McCaffrey for his \nleadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the biggest anti-drug \nbudget in history. Now I ask for the resources to hire, 1,000 new \nborder patrol agents, and to deploy sophisticated new technologies, to \nhelp close the door on drugs at our borders.\n  Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, good as they are, can't \nwork if the court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers \nof vacancies in the federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of \nthe United States wrote: ``[Judicial] vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.'' I \nask the United States Senate to heed this plea, and vote on the highly \nqualified judicial nominees before you, up or down.\n\n  We must exercise responsibility not only at home but abroad.\n  On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build \na new era of peace and security. But today's possibilities are not \ntomorrow's guarantees.\n  America must stand up for its interests and stand against the \npoisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis \nof new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug \ntraffickers. These 21st Century predators feed on technology and the \nfree flow of information, ideas and people. And they will be all the \nmore lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.\n  To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules \nof the road for the 21st Century, protecting those who join the family \nof nations, and isolating those who do not.\n  Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make \nHungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. For \nfifty years, NATO contained Communism and kept America and Europe \nsecure. These three formerly Communist countries have said ``yes'' to \ndemocracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them--our new allies.\n  By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, \nincluding Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a \nstronghold for peace in the 21st Century.\n  Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and \ntheir mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to \nSarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan Congressional \ndelegation. We saw children playing on the streets, where two years ago \nthey were hiding from snipers and shells. Shops are filled with food, \ncafes alive with conversation.\n  The progress is unmistakable--but not yet irreversible. To take firm \nroot, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and \nallied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. Senator Dole \nsaid it best: this is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a \nfootball game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit \nthe victory.\n  I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They are very \nproud of what they are doing in Bosnia. And America is very proud of \nthem. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the First Lady \ntonight--Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated \nVietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. And last \nyear, he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from \ntaking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance \nin Bosnia.\n  In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always \ndo their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained \nand ready . . . to improve their quality of life . . . and to provide \nthe 21st Century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.\n  I also ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to \nreduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n  This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President \nEisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is within our \nreach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the \ndevelopment of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more \ndifficult for non-nuclear states to build them. I am pleased to \nannounce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--\nGenerals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell, David Jones and Admiral \nWilliam Crowe--have endorsed this treaty. I ask the Senate to approve \nit--this year.\n  Together, we also must confront new hazards: chemical and biological \nweapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals \nseeking to acquire them.\n  Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of \nhis nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people but on \ndeveloping nuclear, chemical and biological weapons--and the missiles \nto deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a \nremarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was \ndestroyed during the Gulf War itself. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop \nthem from completing their mission.\n  I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and \nDemocrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of \nthe world. You have used weapons of mass destruction before. We are \ndetermined to deny you the capacity to use them again.\n  Last year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to \nprotect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now, we must act to \nprevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The \nBiological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years. The \nrules are good, but the enforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with \na new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.\n  In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old \nallies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and \nPakistan . . . from South America to China. And from Belfast, to Korea \nto the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand \nfor peace.\n  Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United \nNations. More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve \ncommon goals. If we want America to lead, we must set a good example. \nAs we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also \nshare our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are \nactually enriched, not impoverished, by our increasing interdependence \nwith other nations.\n\n\n                    a nation that lives by community\n\n  Our Founders set America on a permanent course toward ``A more \nperfect union.'' It is a journey we can only make together--living as \none community.\n  First of all, we must continue to reform our government--the \ninstrument of our national community.\n  Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a \nfundraising arms race. This year, by March 6, the Senate will vote on \nbipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and \nFeingold. Let's be clear: a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for \nsoft money, for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy \nand pass campaign finance reform.\n  Even more, we must address the reason for the explosion in campaign \ncosts--the high cost of media advertising. I will formally request that \nthe Federal Communications Commission\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\nact to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates. The \nairwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have a \nresponsibility to help strengthen our democracy.\n  Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have reduced the \nfederal payroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulations, \neliminated hundreds of programs, and improved the operations of \nvirtually every agency. But we can do more.\n  Like every taxpayer, I am outraged by the reports of abuses by the \nIRS. We need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a \nstronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for \ninnocent taxpayers. Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, \nthe House passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not languish in \nthe Senate. Tonight I challenge the Senate: pass our bipartisan package \nof IRS reforms as your first order of business.\n  A nation that lives as a community must value its communities.\n  For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private \nenterprise into inner city and poor rural areas--with community \ndevelopment banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, \ncleanups of polluted sites for development. Under the continued \nleadership of the Vice President, we propose to triple the number of \nempowerment zones, which give businesses incentives to invest in poor \nareas and create jobs. We also should give poor families more help to \nmove into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the \nconstruction of more low income housing.\n  Last year this Congress took strong action to help the District of \nColumbia. Let us renew our resolve to make this capital city a great \ncity for all who live and visit here.\n  Our cities are the vibrant hubs of our great metropolitan areas. They \nare still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, coming \nto work for their own American Dream. Let's keep our cities going \nstrong into the 21st Century.\n  Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, \nthe water they drink, the Earth they will inherit.\n  Last year, we put in place the toughest-ever controls on smog and \nsoot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We \nexpanded every community's right to know about the toxics that threaten \ntheir children.\n  Yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to \nprotect consumers from dangers like e-coli and salmonella.\n  Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water \nInitiative, a far-reaching new effort to clean our rivers, lakes and \ncoastal waters.\n  Yet our overriding environmental challenge is a worldwide problem \nrequiring worldwide action: the gathering crisis of global warming.\n  The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if \nwe do not reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, at some point in \nthe next century we will disrupt our climate and put our children and \ngrandchildren at risk. This past December, America led the world to \nreach a historic agreement committing nations to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions through market forces, new technology and energy efficiency.\n  We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 \nbillion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage \ninnovation, renewable energy, fuel efficient cars, energy efficient \nhomes.\n  Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have \nsaid it would hurt our economy. Well, today our economy is the \nstrongest in a generation--and our air and water are the cleanest in a \ngeneration. Americans have always found a way to grow the economy and \nclean the environment at the same time. And when it comes to global \nwarming, we'll do it again.\n  Finally, community means living by the defining American value--the \nideal heard round the world--that we are all created equal.\n  Throughout our history, we have not always honored this ideal--and we \nhave never fully lived up to it. Often it is easier to believe that our \ndifferences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, \nbut it is wrong.\n  What must we do in our day and generation to make sure that America \ntruly becomes one nation, even as we become more and more diverse?\n  The answer cannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our \nshared values. We all cherish family and faith, work and community, \nfreedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a \nworld where their talents are matched by their opportunities.\n  I have launched a national initiative on race to help us to recognize \nour common interests and bridge the opportunity gaps that keep us from \nbecoming One America.\n  Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. \nDiscrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously \nenforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the \nbacklog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 60,000 of our \nfellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now \nto end that wait.\n  We also should recognize that the greatest progress we can make \ntoward building one America lies in the progress we make for all \nAmericans.\n  When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all \nour streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all \nneighborhoods, when we make sure that all parents have the children \nthey need, we help to build one nation.\n  We, in this chamber and in government, must do all we can to address \nthis continuing American challenge. But we will only move forward if \nall Americans--including every one of you watching at home tonight--are \nalso committed to this cause.\n  We must work together, learn together, live together, and serve \ntogether. On the forge of common enterprise Americans of all \nbackgrounds can hammer out a common identity. We see that in the United \nStates military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps, wherever people of \nall races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor.\n  With shared values, meaningful opportunities, honest communication, \nand citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and \nmutual respect. We are many. We must be one.\n\n\n                  the millennium--gifts to the future\n\n  In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will \nwe mark that passage?\n  This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program \nto promote America's creativity and innovation, and to preserve our \nheritage and culture into the 21st Century. Our culture lives in every \ncommunity--and every community has places of historic value that tell \nour stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a \npublic private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to \ncelebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and \nsmall.\n\n  While we honor the past, let us imagine the future.\n  The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In \nthe 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis--it \ntook 9 years. Last year, we located the gene that causes Parkinson's \nDisease--in only 9 days. Within a decade, ``gene chips'' will offer a \nroadmap for prevention of illness throughout a lifetime. Soon, we will \nbe able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand \nof fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live \nto see the 22nd Century.\n  Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st \nCentury Research Fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry. This will be \nthe largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of \nHealth, the National Science Foundation, and the National Cancer \nInstitute. We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and \ndiabetes. I ask you to support this initiative, so that ours will be \nthe generation that finally wins the war against cancer . . . and \nbegins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.\n  As important as rapid scientific progress is, science must continue \nto serve humanity, never the other way around. We must prevent the \nmisuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we \nmust ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious \ncommunities, and ban the cloning of human beings.\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\n  We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of \ncyberspace.\n  The first time I reported to you on the State of the Union, only a \nhandful of physicists used the World Wide Web. Now, in schools, \nlibraries, homes and businesses, millions of Americans surf the Net \nevery day.\n  We must give parents the tools they need to protect their children \nfrom inappropriate material on the Internet. And the Internet is an \nexploding global marketplace of ideas as well as commerce.\n  I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation \nInternet, which will operate up to a thousand times faster than today.\n  Even as we explore innerspace, in the new millennium we will open new \nfrontiers in outer space.\n  Throughout history, humankind has had only one place to call home--\nthe planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 \ncountries will build a foothold in the heavens--the international space \nstation. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will set sail \non this uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential.\n  And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat \nmissions, and one five hour space flight that changed the world, will \nreturn to the heavens.\n  Godspeed, John Glenn.\n  You will carry with you America's hopes, and on your uniform you will \ncarry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection between the deeds \nof America's past and the daring of America's future.\n  Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright \nstars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved \nFrancis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope. \nThose words became our national anthem. Today, that Star Spangled \nBanner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, \nand the Bill of Rights are on display just a short walk from here. They \nare America's treasures, and we must save and preserve them for the \nages. I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all of our \ntreasures so that generations of the 21st Century can see for \nthemselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing \nglory of America.\n  An America that has continued to rise through every age, against \nevery challenge; a people of great works and greater possibilities, who \nhave always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one \nnation--to widen the circle of opportunity--to deepen the meaning of \nour freedom--to form that more perfect union. Let that be our gift to \nthe 21st Century.\n  God Bless You, and God Bless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S20-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on December 4, 1997, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Morella) \nhas signed the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 1604.

and\n       Whereas, A properly installed child passenger restraint \n     system can reduce the risk of serious or fatal injury to a \n     child in a crash by 71 percent and reduce the need for \n     hospitalization by 67 percent, and child restraint systems \n     are 50 percent effective in preventing minor injury; and\n       Whereas, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     (NHTSA) estimates that if all child safety seats were \n     correctly installed in vehicles, 5,300 injuries would be \n     prevented and the lives of 500 young children would be saved \n     each year; and\n       Whereas, NHTSA estimates that child restraint systems saved \n     the lives of 2,934 children under the age of five years in \n     the United States from 1982 through 1995; and\n       Whereas, NHTSA estimates that 600 children under five years \n     of age were killed and approximately 70,000 were injured due \n     to improper, or lack of, use of child car safety seats in the \n     United States in 1996; and\n       Whereas, In 1996, the Department of the California Highway \n     Patrol issued 15,516 citations for noncompliance with child \n     restraint system laws; and\n       Whereas, As many as 80 percent of all child safety seats \n     are used incorrectly in the United States, and safety seat \n     checkups conducted in California have shown that as many as \n     92 percent of child safety seats in the state are misused; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Department of the California Highway Patrol \n     reports that 30 of the 48 children under four years of age \n     who died as passengers in 1993 were in a car seat, but only \n     eight of those car seats were properly installed; and\n       Whereas, Of the children who died in California car \n     accidents in 1995, 85 percent would have survived had they \n     been sitting in correctly installed child restraint systems; \n     and\n       Whereas, The impact received by a child in an improperly \n     installed child restraint system at 30 miles per hour is the \n     same as being thrown out of a third-story window; and\n       Whereas, For a child traveling in a vehicle, the most \n     dangerous place to be is in an adult's arms, otherwise known \n     as the ``child crusher position''; and\n       Whereas, In a crash at approximately 30 miles per hour, a \n     10-pound infant will be ripped from a belted adult's arms \n     with a force of almost 200 pounds; and\n       Whereas, A mother weighing 100 pounds, sharing an adult \n     seat belt with her child, in a car traveling 25 miles per \n     hour, on impact will throw 2,500 pounds of pressure against \n     the child; and\n       Whereas, According to NHTSA, 479 children could have been \n     saved nationwide in 1995 if they had been properly restrained \n     in their child care safety seat; and\n       Whereas, For consumers the most likely point of contact for \n     information regarding child restraint systems for new \n     vehicles is the automobile dealer, and yet sales, service, \n     and parts personnel are generally unaware of child restaint \n     system installation problems and techniques, and supplemental \n     tools needed for installation; and\n       Whereas, The only other existing sources of information and \n     assistance about child restraint systems for consumers are \n     printed manuals, instructions, and labels provided\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\n     by child restraint system and automobile manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, While some of this information is mandated by \n     regulation, it is often provided at the discretion of the \n     manufacturer, and does not necessarily accurately display or \n     describe proper installation; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature encourages the \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to continue \n     developing and assembling data on CD ROM to demonstrate which \n     child restraint systems are compatible with which vehicles; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature supports the recommendations \n     of President Clinton that, under the National Transportation \n     Department Plan, every child car safety seat have two \n     standard buckles at its base, that every automobile \n     manufacturer install standard latches in the back seat that \n     are designed specifically to fasten these buckles, that \n     universal attachments be developed to secure the top of the \n     child care safety seat to the automobile's interior, and that \n     the new safety system, referred to as the Uniform Child \n     Restraint Anchorages (UCRA), be available for purchase by \n     1999; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature commends the General Motors \n     Corporation for committing $10.6 million for a five-year \n     partnership with the National SAFE KIDS Campaign to promote \n     correct installation and use of child restraint systems; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature commends the automobile \n     manufacturers that are currently developing and disseminating \n     safety information, and encourages all automobile \n     manufacturers to develop educational materials on the correct \n     placement and installation of child restraint systems in \n     their vehicles for use by automobile dealer sales, service, \n     and parts personnel, child restraint system trainers, and \n     child restraint system manufacturers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That warnings of incompatibility between vehicle \n     seating positions and child restraint systems should be \n     prominent in automobile and child restraint system owner's \n     manuals, as well as in vehicles; and be it further\n       Resolved, That child restraint system manufacturers should \n     develop comprehensive, consistent language on and \n     illustration of, correct installation of child restraint \n     systems in their instruction manuals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourages the manufacturers \n     of child restraint systems to identify which automobile makes \n     and models their products are compatible with, and enclose \n     this information in the initial child restraint system \n     packaging; and be it further\n       Resolved, That an intensive child restraint system \n     educational campaign on the correct use and installation of \n     child restraint systems should be undertaken by federal and \n     state governments and automobile and child restraint system \n     manufacturers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the President \n     and Congress of the United States to work together to promote \n     and support practical methods of encouraging automobile \n     manufacturers to address the problems discussed in this \n     resolution as well as the safety risks that arise because of \n     the problems; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the President and \n     Congress of the United States to encourage automobile \n     manufacturers, that are not presently informing their \n     customers about the need to correctly install child restraint \n     systems, to take steps to educate consumers with regard to \n     the correct installation procedures for child restraint \n     systems; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and the Vice \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, and to the Chief Executive Officers of the \n     General Motors Corporation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-311. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, the passage of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) in 1991 represented a \n     watershed event in the evolution of federal transportation \n     policy; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization of ISTEA is expected to be \n     adopted by the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives later this year; and\n       Whereas, all members of California's Congressional \n     delegation have created a caucus which has advocated on \n     behalf of California and its interests during the ISTEA \n     reauthorization process; and\n       Whereas, several proposals are currently being considered \n     by the United States Senate and House of Representatives; and\n       Whereas, in considering these proposals for reauthorizing \n     ISTEA, the federal government is evaluating numerous factors \n     for calculating the distribution of federal Highway Trust \n     Fund moneys; and\n       Whereas, each of these proposals contain some provisions \n     that will be fiscally beneficial to California, and some \n     provisions that will be fiscally detrimental to California; \n     and\n       Whereas, current federal program categories limit the \n     flexibility of the states with regard to the manner in which \n     the states may spend their funding; and\n       Whereas, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) \n     Program has proven to be effective at improving air quality \n     in California given the state's substantial air quality \n     improvement needs despite the current funding limitation on \n     the program for large states; and\n       Whereas, California has traditionally been a ``donor'' \n     state, having received on average over the six-year \n     authorization of ISTEA just 91 percent of the amount \n     California provided in gas tax revenues to the Highway \n     Account of the federal Highway Trust Fund over that period; \n     and\n       Whereas, recent projections estimate that, within the next \n     two years, international trade will account for 25 percent of \n     California's economy, and intermodal goods movement as a \n     result of international trade places a significant burden on \n     the state's transportation infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, it is imperative that the federal government place \n     a high priority on providing transportation funding for the \n     heavy infrastructure needed to advance the nation's \n     competitiveness in accommodating the growing international \n     trade shipped through the nation's ports, airports, and \n     border crossings; and\n       Whereas, California has been compelled to divert hundreds \n     of millions of dollars from county, street, and road \n     allocations to pay for border infrastructure improvements \n     needed as a result of increased commercial and industrial \n     traffic caused by the North American Free Trade Agreement; \n     and\n       Whereas, local and regional transit systems are \n     indispensable to the daily transportation needs of millions \n     of Californians; and\n       Whereas, California has recently enacted welfare reform \n     legislation that is expected to result in a significant \n     increase in transportation and transit needs of new workers \n     leaving welfare; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the Congress of the United States to \n     enact legislation to reauthorize ISTEA in a manner that \n     ensures more flexibility for states in spending Highway Trust \n     Fund moneys, increases the amount of funding designated for \n     the CMAQ program and removes the current limitations on CMAQ \n     allocations to larger states, guarantees that each state \n     receives at least 95 percent of its contribution to the \n     Highway Account of the federal Highway Trust Fund each year, \n     provides adequate funding to reflect the level of intermodal \n     activity in each state, and allocates funding to offset the \n     cost of local improvements to California's border \n     infrastructure needed as a result of the implementation of \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement, ensures consistent \n     funding support for transit, and reflects support at the \n     highest funding level possible for discretionary welfare-to-\n     work transportation access programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, to each member of the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure, each member of the United States Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works, and each Senator \n     and Representative from California in the Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-312.

If diagnosed and treated before \n     the cancer spreads outside of the ovary, the five-year \n     survival rate is 92 percent. However, only approximately 24 \n     percent of all cases of ovarian cancer are detected at this \n     stage; and\n       Whereas, Ovarian cancer research is desperately needed. \n     Research would encourage more women to undergo screening \n     tests earlier, as well as reduce medical costs associated \n     with later discovery; and\n       Whereas, House Bill No. 953, authored by Representative \n     Patsy Mink, the Ovarian Cancer Research and Information \n     Amendments of 1997, would authorize $90 million to conduct \n     ovarian cancer research; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and \n     Congress of the United States to support House Bill No. 953 \n     by Representative Patsy Mink, the Ovarian Cancer Research and \n     Information Amendments of 1997; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and the Vice \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-317.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 185\n\n       Whereas, Teterboro Airport is located in the boroughs of \n     Teterboro and Moonachie in Bergen County, New Jersey, a \n     heavily populated residential and commercial area; and\n       Whereas, Teterboro Airport is designated as one of the \n     reliever airports for Newark International Airport's \n     scheduled airline service and also functions as a major \n     business aviation center for corporate and private aviation \n     operations; and\n       Whereas, In recent years the character of Teterboro Airport \n     has changed from an airport which has had a limited number of \n     larger jet aircraft and corporate jet activity to one in \n     which a greater number of larger jets are permitted to \n     operate at the airport and where corporate jet activity \n     operates at a high level; and\n       Whereas, Plans are being discussed to expand corporate jet \n     activity at Teterboro Airport by using it as a reliever \n     airport for Newark International Airport's corporate jet \n     traffic; and\n       Whereas, The confluence of airline traffic from Newark \n     International Airport, Teterboro Airport, LaGuardia and \n     Kennedy Airports over the residential communities of northern \n     New Jersey, such as the communities of Hasbrouck Heights, \n     Little Ferry, Lodi, Moonachie, South Hackensack and Wood-\n     Ridge in the Teterboro area, creates an intolerable level of \n     aircraft noise for residents of these communities which \n     adversely affects their physical and mental health and well-\n     being, and lowers the property values of their residences; \n     and\n       Whereas, It is in the public interest for steps to be taken \n     to control the level of aviation noise caused by excessive \n     aircraft traffic at Teterboro Airport and prevent the \n     expansion of further corporate jet activity at that facility; \n     now, therefore; be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey.\n       1. The Congress of the United States and the Federal \n     Aviation Administration are respectfully memorialized to take \n     appropriate steps to control the level of aviation noise at \n     Teterboro Airport in Bergen County, New Jersey, and to \n     prevent the expansion of further corporate jet activity at \n     that facility.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 169\n\n       Whereas, The Port of New York and New Jersey (``port \n     district'') is at a critical and historic juncture in its \n     economic development as the Northeast's primary \n     transportation hub; and\n       Whereas, The port district's transportation network will be \n     increasingly pressured to facilitate the movement of both \n     people and freight commodities throughout the port district \n     as efficiently and as cost effectively as possible; and\n       Whereas, Although the port district is endowed with an \n     existing rail-freight infrastructure, this infrastructure is \n     in need of comprehensive repair and modernization and is \n     currently underutilized because of these conditions, \n     resulting in a considerable imbalance between the use of rail \n     freight and the use of truck freight throughout the port \n     district; and\n       Whereas, The New York Cross Harbor Railroad (NYCHRR), the \n     port district's only interstate short-line marine rail-\n     freight carrier, with direct links to the recently approved \n     ``Conrail, CSX and the Norfolk & Southern Network,'' is \n     considered a key rail-freight hub for the port district and \n     an integral part of the effort to improve interstate rail-\n     freight commerce between the economic and transportation \n     networks of New Jersey and New York; and\n       Whereas, The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 (ISTEA) is a six-year program authorized to \n     provide a total of $155 billion for highway and mass \n     transportation purposes; and\n       Whereas, ISTEA has provided significant, annual federal \n     funding to New Jersey and all other states to help develop a \n     strong, globally-competitive economy and to improve the \n     mobility, safety and well-being of our nation's residents; \n     and\n       Whereas, The NYCHRR has requested, as part of the \n     reauthorization of the ISTEA, approval of a project, entitled \n     the ``Rail Freight Initiative,'' to enhance the NYCHRR's \n     operational infrastructure and to upgrade its operational \n     equipment, in order to bolster its ability to facilitate \n     interstate commerce in the port district; and\n       Whereas, This ``Rail Freight Initiative,'' would include a \n     minimal expenditure of $4.75 million from the ISTEA \n     reauthorization bill, with 80 percent of the estimated \n     project cost coming from the federal government, and with the \n     NYCHRR funding the remaining 20 percent; and\n       Whereas, $1.5 million of the $4.75 million cost will be \n     used for improvements to the NYCHRR's Greenville Yards \n     facilities in Jersey City, which will allow the NYCHRR to \n     handle much higher volumes of rail freight, without cost to \n     the State of New Jersey or the city of Jersey City; and\n       Whereas, Congressional approval of the ``Rail Freight \n     Initiative'' will serve to correct the current imbalance \n     between regional truck freight and the use of rail and \n     intermodal freight systems throughout the Port of New York \n     and New Jersey, and promote the development of, and the \n     investment in, enhanced rail, intermodal and float-barging \n     systems within the port district; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The Congress of the United States is memorialized to \n     approve a project request, as part of reauthorization of the \n     federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n     1991, to support the efforts to enhance, trans-harbor rail-\n     freight float-barging operations throughout the Port of New \n     York and New Jersey.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n       Whereas, Thousands of Holocaust survivors who fled Poland \n     and Eastern Europe to the United States, Israel, Russia and \n     other Eastern European nations may be living around the \n     world, not knowing that family members from whom they were \n     separated during the Holocaust are also still alive; and\n       Whereas, In July 1996, Russian resident Solomon Bromberg \n     and his sister, Israeli resident Rivka Bromberg Feingold, \n     were reunited after a separation of more than 60 years, both \n     having believed that their entire family had been murdered \n     during the Holocaust; and\n       Whereas, The Bromberg siblings were reunited after a \n     business acquaintance, returning from a trip to Russia, \n     contacted Israel's Jewish Agency, an organization which \n     attempts to reunite family members separated during the \n     Holocaust; and\n       Whereas, Many other Holocaust survivors are trying to \n     locate living family members from whom they were separated \n     during the Holocaust, thereby highlighting the significance \n     of efforts long pursued by organizations such as the Red \n     Cross and Israel's Jewish Agency to reunite family members \n     separated during the Holocaust; and\n       Whereas, Coordinated efforts of the United States, foreign \n     nations, especially Israel, Russia, Poland and other Eastern \n     European nations, and organizations such as the Red Cross and \n     Israel's Jewish Agency will help to reunite family members \n     separated during the Holocaust; and\n       Whereas, A concurrent resolution sponsored by Congressman \n     Robert Franks introduced in the United States Congress \n     encouraging the Secretary of State, foreign nations and \n     others to work together to support the effort to reunite \n     family members separated during the Holocaust has yet to be \n     reported from the Committee on International Relations to the \n     entire House of Representatives; now, therefore,\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House recognizes the enormous significance of \n     helping families locate family members who may have survived \n     the Holocaust, pays tribute to the inspirational efforts of \n     those helping reunite family members separated during the \n     Holocaust and endorses every attempt to coordinate these \n     meaningful efforts.\n       2. This House urges the United States Congress to adopt \n     House Concurrent Resolution 14 of 1997, which encourages the \n     Secretary of State, foreign nations, especially Israel, \n     Russia, Poland and other Eastern European nations, and \n     organizations such as the Red Cross and Israel's Jewish \n     Agency to coordinate efforts to help reunite family members \n     separated during the Holocaust.\n       3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to raise \nthe 15 percent income tax bracket into middle class income levels, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Middle \nClass Tax Relief Act of 1998. Last year, this Congress passed historic \nlegislation: the Balanced Budget Act providing the first balanced \nbudget in nearly thirty years, and the Taxpayer Relief Act providing \ntax relief for the first time in sixteen years. As a result, faith in \nthe Nation's economy is strong, and we are seeing the results of that \nfaith.\n  Now is the time for us to consider sweeping middle class tax relief. \nThis tax relief proposal accomplishes several goals. First, it directs \nthe vast majority of the relief to those who feel the tax squeeze the \nmost: middle-income taxpayers.\n  Second, because it is across-the-board relief, every middle class \ntaxpayers wins. Every American earning $25,000 taxable income or more \nwould see relief. Estimates by the Tax Foundation show that \napproximately 25 million taxpayers would see tax relief this\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nyear with two-thirds earning less than $75,000 annually.\n  Third, it provides significant marriage penalty relief without adding \ncomplexity to the tax code.\n  Fourth, this is one of the very few proposals that is also entirely \nconsistent with the long-term goal of a flatter, simpler tax code.\n  My proposal, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, achieves these goals by \nraising the roof on the 15% individual income tax bracket. In other \nwords, it returns middle class taxpayers to the lowest individual \nincome bracket. Married couples with taxable income of $70,000 or less \nwould be taxed at the 15% tax bracket, an increase over the 1998 \nthreshold of $42,350. The threshold for heads of households would be \n$52,600, an increase over the current threshold of $33,950. Finally, \nthe thresholds for single workers would be set at $35,000, an increase \nover the current threshold of $25,350.\n  In the coming weeks, a great deal of discussion will focus on \nproviding the American people with the tax relief they need and \ndeserve, and how that is to be accomplished. There are a number of \nproposals providing tax relief, some of which I am a supporter. \nHowever, I believe the Middle Class Tax Relief Act will be successful \nultimately because it is actually achievable during this Congress. I \nask my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1571. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the earnings test for individuals who have attained \nretirement age; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the senior citizen's freedom to work act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Senior \nCitizen's Freedom to Work Act.'' This bill would fully repeal the \nerroneous Social Security earnings limit.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1987, I have been working to eliminate \nthe discriminatory and unfair Earnings Test.\n  I am pleased that in 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton \nsigned into law my bill, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act. This \nlegislation took a step in the right direction by increasing the \nearning threshold for senior citizens from $11,520 to $30,000 by the \nyear 2000. Now it is time to eliminate the unjust Earnings Test in its \nentirety.\n  Most Americans are shocked and appalled when they discover that older \nAmericans are penalized for working. Nobody should be penalized for \nworking or discouraged from engaging in work. Yet, this is exactly what \nthe Social Security Earnings Test does to our nation's senior citizens. \nThe Social Security Earnings Test punishes Americans between the ages \nof 65 and 70 for their attempts to remain productive after retirement.\n  The Social Security Earnings Test mandates that for every $3 earned \nby a retiree over the established limit, $19,999.92 in 1998, the \nretiree loses $1 in Social Security benefits. This is clearly age \ndiscrimination, and it is very wrong. Due to this cap on earnings, our \nsenior citizens, many of whom exist on fixed, low-incomes, are burdened \nwith a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When this is combined \nwith Federal, State, local and other Social Security taxes, it amounts \nto an outrageous 55 to 65 percent tax bite and even higher. This \nearnings limit is punitive and serves as a tremendous disincentive to \nwork. An individual who is struggling to make ends meet on \napproximately $19,000 a year should not be faced with an effective \nmarginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent.\n  The Social Security Earnings Test is a relic of the Great Depression, \ndesigned to move older people out of the workforce and create \nemployment for younger individuals. This is an archaic policy and \nshould no longer be our goal because our nation's labor pool is \nshrinking. Many senior citizens can make a significant contribution, \nand often their knowledge and experience compliments or exceeds that of \nyounger employees. Tens of millions of Americans are over the age of \n65, and together they have over a billion years of cumulative work \nexperience. These individuals have valuable experience to offer our \nsociety, and we need them.\n  In addition, experts predict a labor shortage when the ``baby boom'' \ngeneration ages, and it is evident that employers will have to develop \nnew sources of income as our elderly population continues to grow much \nfaster than the number of workers entering the workforce. According to \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``retaining older workers is a priority \nin labor intensive industries, and will become even more critical as we \napproach the year 2000.'' To me it seems counterproductive and foolish \nto keep willing, diligent workers out of the American workforce. Our \ncountry must continue to support pro-work, not pro-welfare policies.\n  More importantly, many of the older Americans penalized by the \nearnings test need to work in order to cover their basic expenses; \nhealth care, housing and food. Many seniors do not have significant \nsavings or a private pension. For this reason, low-income workers are \nparticularly hard-hit by the earnings test.\n  It is important to note that wealthy seniors, who have lucrative \ninvestments, stocks, and substantial savings are not affected by the \nearnings limits. Their supplemental ``unearned'' income is not subject \nto the earnings threshold. The earnings limit only affects seniors who \nmust work and depend on their earned income for survival.\n  Finally, let me stress that repealing the burdensome and unfair \nearnings test would not jeopardize the solvency of the Social Security \nfunds. Opponents who claim otherwise are engaging in cruel scare \ntactics. It is important to remember that the Social Security benefits \nwhich working seniors are losing due to the earnings test penalty are \nbenefits they have rightfully earned by contributing to the system \nthroughout their working years before retiring. These are benefits \nwhich they should not be losing because they are trying to survive by \nsupplementing their Social Security income. Furthermore, certain \nstudies indicate that repealing the earnings test would result in a net \nincrease of $140 million in federal revenue.\n  Mr. President, there is no compelling justification for denying \neconomic opportunity to an individual on the basis of age. It is quite \nevident that the earnings test is outdated, unjust and discriminatory. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation which would eliminate \nthis egregious law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BRYAN (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 1572. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from \npromulgating certain regulations relating to Indian gaming activities; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                     gaming activities legislation\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, Senators Enzi, Reid and I are today \nintroducing legislation to stop the Interior Department from moving \nforward with regulations that in my view trample on States rights and \ninvade the province of Governors and State legislators to determine \nwhat kinds of gaming activities will occur in their States. This \nproposed regulation flies in the face of the intent of Congress.\n  I must say I am disappointed we are forced to take this step and \nwould hope that the Secretary of the Interior would reconsider his ill-\nadvised action. Last week the Secretary of Interior proposed rules that \nwould allow the Interior Department to be the sole arbiter in the \ncompacting process as to what kinds of gaming activities can be \nconducted on Native American lands. This is being done over the strong \nobjections of the Nation's Governors and the Nation's Attorneys \nGeneral, as well as the intent of Congress.\n  I believe that in so doing, the Secretary is overstepping his \nauthority and is making a grave mistake. In what I consider \nparticularly convoluted logic, the Department has asserted that because \nthe courts have struck down certain provisions of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, referred to as IGRA, that they can step in and decide \non their own what gaming activities States must allow tribes to engage \nin.\n  I think by way of background, Mr. President, it may be helpful to \nshare with my colleagues the basis of the underlying legislation as it \nrelates to Native American gaming activities. In 1988, the Congress \npassed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and in so doing, tribal gaming \nactivities were and are divided into three categories,\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\nwith class I being reserved as traditional Indian games, class II being \nbingo-type games, and class III being casino-type games. Now, with \nrespect to class III gaming, under the law, States and tribal \ngovernments negotiate a compact as to what type of games are to be \npermitted, if any, within class III.\n  Under recent court decisions, Governors are required to negotiate \nwith tribes only on gaming activity that is permitted by law in that \nState. For instance, Hawaii and Utah prohibit all forms of gaming, and \ntherefore their respective Governors are not required to negotiate with \ntribes for any types of gaming activity. In Nevada, where we permit all \nforms of casino gaming, that is class III gaming, the State is required \nto enter into a compact with tribes allowing them to engage in all \nforms of gaming, and indeed without conflict or controversy five such \ncompacts have been entered into.\n  The Secretary has chosen, however, to put his own legal \ninterpretation of what types of gaming activities must be put on the \nnegotiating table. This so-called ``scope of gaming'' issue was fought \nout in the courts and decided in favor of Governors in the Rumsey case. \nThe Rumsey case held that Governors are not forced to negotiate other \ngaming activities that are not permitted in the State in general.\n  The Secretary appears to be trying to circumvent this decision and \nwould force States, for example, that would allow a lottery and require \nthem to negotiate with Indian tribes to make slot machines available, \neven though slot machines are illegal in that State. Given this clearly \nskewed legal interpretation, it seems to me that the Governors' fears \nare well-founded.\n  The Department holds the position of fiduciary and trust obligation \nto the tribes and is an acknowledged advocate for tribal interests. The \nDepartment is taking the position that it should be the sole arbiter \nbetween the interest of the State and tribes in negotiating what form \nand scope of gaming should be permitted when it clearly has a bias in \nfavor of one of the parties.\n  It is no wonder the Governors said in their December 5 letter to \nPresident Clinton that they will actively oppose any independent \nassertion by the Secretary of his power to authorize tribal governments \nto operate class III gaming.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the December 5, 1997, letter \naddressed to the President by the Western Governors' Association, \nsigned by its chairman, Governor Knowles of Alaska, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Western Governors' Association,\n\n                                     Denver, CO, December 5, 1997.\n     William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: It is the understanding of the Western \n     Governor's Association that the Secretary of Interior has \n     proposed a rule-making on Indian Gaming that would usurp the \n     Governors authority to enter into compact negotiations on \n     gaming with Indian tribes. States have repeatedly voiced \n     their concerns about the Secretary's desire a promulgate this \n     rule. On October 10, a letter was sent by the National \n     Governors' Association Chairman and Vice Chairman to the \n     Secretary of Interior on this rule-making proposal.\n       It is evident that the states' concerns have gone unheard \n     or at least have not been responded to by the Secretary. As a \n     former Governor, you can appreciate how troubling it is when \n     a cabinet member fails to consider or enter into a dialogue \n     with us about state's legitimate concerns.\n       The Secretary is using the Seminole Tribe of Florida vs. \n     Florida decision by the Supreme Court to inappropriately \n     expand his authority. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) \n     established a procedure whereby decisions could be made when \n     a state and tribe were unable to agree to the terms of a \n     compact. Before the Secretary is authorized to provide a \n     compact to a tribe under IGRA, the courts must first make a \n     finding of bad faith on the part of the state. When the \n     Supreme Court stuck down the portion of IGRA that permitted \n     tribes to sue states in Federal Court, it eliminated the \n     mechanism for arriving at a finding of bad faith by the \n     court. It would be inappropriate for the Secretary to now \n     take the authority to render a finding of bad faith and then \n     to authorize a gaming compact to a tribe over the objections \n     of a state. Moreover, the Secretary's action contradicts the \n     clear intent of Congress as embodied in the final Interior \n     conference report that you signed, which imposes a one-year \n     moratorium on imposition of a procedure that would result in \n     tribal Class III gaming in the absence of a tribal-state \n     compact as required by law.\n       As the National Governors' Association policy states \n     ``nothing remains in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or any \n     other law that endows the Secretary with the authority to \n     independently create such a process. The Governors will \n     actively oppose any independent assertion by the Secretary of \n     the power to authorize tribal governments to operate Class \n     III Gaming. State and tribal governments are best qualified \n     to craft agreements on the scope and conduct of Class III \n     Gaming under IGRA.'' Furthermore, under the duties of the \n     office, the Secretary has a special legal relationship to \n     Native Americans, and it would be impossible for him to be \n     objective in making decisions settling compact differences \n     between states and tribes--in effect the Secretary becomes a \n     self-appointed judge and jury.\n       There are difficult issues, and we understand the Secretary \n     intepretating his role as advocate for Native Americans. \n     However, Governors have Constitutional responsibilities to \n     all of the people of our states. Based on these \n     responsibilities we are compelled to tell you that the \n     Secretary started down an unproductive path when we concluded \n     that the Interior Department should become the sole arbiter \n     in the compact process.\n       We urge you to find a resolution to the conflicts between \n     the states and tribes that is more appropriate than that \n     initiated by the Secretary. The Western Governors Association \n     stands ready to participate in such an effort.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Tom Knowles,\n\n                                               Governor of Alaska,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Governors have repeatedly called the Secretary's \nproposal an inappropriate expansion of his authorities. Governors of \nthe State in the process of negotiating a gaming compact with tribes \nwill be severely disadvantaged by this proposal. Tribes will be much \nbetter off letting the Secretary of the Interior decide their fate--\nbelieving they can get a better deal from a person who is an \nacknowledged advocate for their interests and indeed encourages gaming \nas a means of generating tribal revenues.\n  The Department asserts the States must be acting in bad faith for the \nSecretary to strip the States of their rights. Of course, the Secretary \nis the judge and jury over whether the States, in fact, are negotiating \nin bad faith. To make matters even worse and to heighten the concerns \nthe Governors have, the Department has informed us that they would \nconsider the actions of Governor Wilson of California to be negotiating \nin bad faith because he refuses to negotiate with any tribe that \npersists in operating illegal games on tribal reservations. As Governor \nWilson has indicated, he has a simple rule: If it is legal under State \nlaw, all can do it; if it is not legal under State law, no one can do \nit. The Governor wants the tribes to cease and desist illegal gaming \nactivities before he will negotiate a compact or legal game, and the \nInterior Department would consider that bad faith.\n  Now, that situation is not peculiar to California alone. Let me cite \nan example, if I may, Mr. President, in a letter addressed to the \nHonorable Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, July 1, 1996, on \nbehalf of the National Governors' Association. I quote a single \nparagraph from that letter. It arises out of the situation that \noccurred in the State of Florida.\n\n       The factual situation underlying the U.S. Supreme Court's \n     decision in Seminole is an example of typical tribal-State \n     conflict over IGRA implementation. Florida refused to \n     negotiate with the Seminole Tribe over the operation of slot \n     machines. Slot machines are prohibited by Florida law, and \n     state voters have rejected three referenda to legalize such \n     devices, as well as other casino-style games. The state's \n     public policy and the preference of Florida citizens with \n     respect to this type of gambling activity could not be \n     clearer. Yet the Seminole Tribe proceeded to take the state \n     to court on the grounds that Florida had failed to negotiate \n     in good faith, even though the state was merely negotiating \n     within the limits of state law and state public policy on \n     gambling.\n\n  Again, under the proposed regulation, the Interior Department would \ninterpret the Florida situation as being one of bad faith and therefore \nthe Interior Department could step in--in effect, supersede the \nnegotiations and the position taken by Florida's Governor in response \nto voter preference and public policy in the State of Florida--and to \nnegotiate a compact that could conceivably allow a full range of casino \ngaming activity contrary to the public policy of that State.\n  Mr. President, I am personally offended that the Department has \nchosen to proceed with rulemaking in clear violation of the intent of \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n Members will recall that Senator Enzi and I attached language to the \nInterior appropriations bill which imposes a moratorium on the \nDepartment implementing such a rule. The language reads: ``During \nfiscal year 1998, the Secretary may not expend any funds made available \nunder this act to review or approve any initial tribal-State compact \nfor class III gaming entered into on or after the day of the enactment \nof this act, except for a compact which has been approved in accordance \nwith IGRA and State law.'' That contemplates the negotiating process \nbetween Governors and the tribal governments, as I indicated \npreviously.\n  Nevertheless, the Department has chosen to ignore our intent and to \nproceed with putting this process in place, which Congress has clearly \nsaid it doesn't want. Since the Department has chosen to ignore the \nclear intent of Congress, we are forced to stop this power grab once \nagain through the legislative process.\n  I might note over 100 compacts between States and tribes for class \nIII gaming have been successfully negotiated. As I pointed out \npreviously, five of those compacts are in place in Nevada. In only a \nhandful of States has the compacting process failed. I believe the \nfailure can be attributed to the unwillingness of Federal prosecutors \nto close down illegal tribal gaming operations. Tribes running illegal \noperations have no incentive to reach an agreement with States as long \nas they face no consequences for their illegal gaming activities.\n  In California alone, tribes are operating 14,000 illegal slot \nmachines. It is not clear to me why the Secretary of Interior feels the \nneed to stack the deck even further against the interests of those \nStates who do not favor, as a matter of public policy, slot machines in \ntheir States.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the Secretary will reconsider this \nill-advised proposal. If not, we will work with the Nation's Governors \nand Nation's attorneys general on this legislation to block the \nemasculation of States' rights.\n  This bill is introduced by myself, Senator Enzi, and Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Moseley-Braun, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Torricelli and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1573. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nincrease the Federal minimum wage; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                   the fair minimum wage act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Wellstone, \nMikulski, Moseley-Braun, Kerry, Torricelli, Boxer, and myself, I am \nintroducing the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998, a bill to raise the \nminimum wage in three annual increases of 50 cents each in the next \nthree years, to bring the minimum wage from its current level of $5.15 \nan hour today to $6.65 an hour on September 1 in the year 2000. \nCongressmen Bonior and Gephardt are introducing identical legislation \nin the House of Representatives.\n  After the third year, the legislation calls for the minimum wage to \nbe indexed, so that it will rise automatically as the cost of living \nincreases. Working Americans should not have to depend on the whim of \nCongress each election year to determine whether they are paid a fair \nminimum wage.\n  In 1996, after a hard-fought battle in the last Congress, we raised \nthe minimum wage, and the economy continued to grow. The scare tactics \nabout lost jobs proved to be as false as they are self-serving. A \nrecent study by the Economic Policy Institute documents that ``the sky \nhasn't fallen'' as a result of the last increase.\n  Raising the minimum wage does not cause job loss for teenagers, \nadults, men, women, African-Americans, Latinos, or anyone else. \nCertainly, the 12 million Americans who would benefit from this \nlegislation deserve the increase.\n  We know who these workers are. Sixty percent are women. Nearly three-\nquarters are adults. Half of those who would benefit from this bill \nwork full-time. Over 80 percent of them work at least 20 hours a week. \nThey are teachers' aides and child care providers. They are single \nheads of households with children. They are people who clean office \nbuildings in countless communities across the country. Working 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks a year, minimum wage workers earn $10,712 a year--\n$2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three.\n  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. In good \nconscience, we cannot continue to proclaim or celebrate the Nation's \ncurrent prosperity while consigning millions who have jobs to live in \ncontinuing poverty.\n  The value of the minimum wage still lags far behind inflation. To \nhave the purchasing power that it had in 1968, the minimum wage today \nwould have to be $7.33 an hour instead of the current level of $5.15 an \nhour. That fact is a measure of how far we have not just fallen short, \nbut actually fallen back, in giving low-income workers their fair share \nof our extraordinary economic growth.\n  In the past 30 years, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has \ngone up by 115 percent, while the purchasing power of the minimum wage \nhas gone down by 30 percent. Lavish end-of-the-year bonuses were \nrecently distributed on Wall Street--but not to the working families on \nMain Street, who actually created the wealth in the first place.\n  Americans understand that those on the bottom rungs of the economic \nladder deserve a raise. Seventy-six percent of those surveyed in the \nJanuary 21 ABC-Washington Post poll said they supported increasing the \nminimum wage.\n  Seventy-seven percent of those surveyed by Peter Hart Research \nearlier this month specifically supported a three-year, $1.50 increase.\n  The American people understand the unfairness of requiring working \nfamilies to subsist on a sub-poverty minimum wage. Across the country, \nsoup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters are increasingly \nserving the working poor, not just the unemployed. In 1996, according \nto the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 38 percent of those seeking emergency \nfood aid held jobs --up from 23 percent in 1994. Low-paying jobs are \nthe most frequently cited cause of hunger. Officials in 67 percent of \nthe cities cited this factor.\n  I look forward to the early enactment of this legislation. Twelve \nmillion working Americans deserve a helping hand. No one who works for \na living should have to live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, we have had the opportunity, since the minimum wage \nwas increased in the last two years, to test the validity of the \nprincipal argument in opposition to this bill. We will hear this claim \nagain this year on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and that is, that this \nadds to the problems of inflation. Yet, we have had virtually no \ninflation over these last 18 months.\n\n  We will also hear that raising the minimum wage will cause the loss \nof hundreds of thousands of jobs. I can already hear the same tired, \nold arguments we have heard every time this body has debated an \nincrease in the minimum wage--an estimate that we will lose anywhere \nfrom 200,000 to 300,000 to 400,000 jobs. Those were the statements made \nthe last time we debated this issue on the floor of the Senate. And our \ngood Republican friends in the House of Representatives said there was \nabsolutely no way that their body was going to consider an increase in \nthe minimum wage, and there was strong opposition over here among the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate even to giving us an opportunity to \nvote on this measure. It was only after lengthy efforts that we were \nable actually to gain a vote and to develop bipartisan support for the \nminimum wage. Ultimately, the Senate of the United States and the House \nof Representatives responded after we added significant tax reductions \nfor businesses to the legislation.\n  Mr. President, if we do not take action now to increase the minimum \nwage, then the progress we made in the last two years is gradually \ngoing to deteriorate. Even with a three-year increase of 50 cents, 50 \ncents, and 50 cents, by the third year the about 40 cents of the value \nof that $1.50 would have dissipated because of inflation. We are \ntalking about working families who are trying to make it in this \ncountry, who have played an important role\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nin this whole economic expansion. But those at the bottom rungs of the \neconomic ladder have not gotten their fair share of the extraordinary \nprosperity that we are experiencing under President Clinton's \nleadership.\n  So I don't understand why there is such opposition to the very modest \nincreases that we are talking about, that even if implemented will \nhardly permit workers to provide for their families and be out of \npoverty. As a result of the 1996 welfare reform legislation, many, many \nmore people were thrown into poverty. In many instances, they are not \ngoing to get the health care or the day care that they need, depending \non a particular State's rules in this regard. But there will be \nmillions of Americans who will be out there in the job market without \nthe health care for their children that Medicaid would have provided or \nchild care coverage that welfare benefits would have provided.\n  What we are asking is that at least we pay them a livable wage. I \ndon't think a single parent, with $10,000 or $12,000, is going to have \nthe kind of child care that any of us would understand or respect. \nYesterday, I was in Dorchester, Massachusetts, meeting with parents \nabout an after school program, which has been in effect for a number of \nyears. It's going to be expanded. The mayor of Boston calls it the 2-\nto-6 program, and is trying to make available, in all parts of Boston, \nafter-school programs for children. It is a very ambitious program. We \nhave seen our Republican Governor indicate that he is supporting the \nafter-school program. I listened to the parents who were out there, who \ntalked about what happens after their children are 12 years old. The \nState of Massachusetts has a program that provides modest support for \nthis kind of program for children up to 12 years old, but cuts it off \nthere. Parents with tears in their eyes were saying, ``We work hard \ntrying to provide for our families, and we just can't make it. Our \nchildren are going home and staying in an empty house in the \nafternoon.'' They pray that they are not going to get themselves in \ntrouble, that the worst thing that will happen to them is they will \njust watch television. It might cost those parents $5 or $10 a week, \nmaybe $20 a month to be able to have an after-school program. I expect \nthat any single mom getting an increase in the minimum wage wouldn't \nthink that much of a problem. That is happening in many communities in \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the 10 minutes \nallocated to the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will have a chance to debate this \nissue. It is not one that should take a great deal of time to review. \nWe have been through this debate time and time again. It hasn't got the \ncomplexities of many of the proposals the President will be talking \nabout tonight. It is basic and fundamental. Every Member of this body \nhas addressed this issue and voted on it one way or the other. It is \ngoing to be really a reflection of our values.\n  Finally, Mr. President, by not increasing the minimum wage, we leave \nmany workers so poor that they are eligible for government assistance \nprograms, such as food stamps. These programs are being paid for by \nother workers' taxes. In effect, these employees are subsidizing the \nbusinesses that aren't paying a fair wage. I think that is wrong.\n  We will have a chance to review the latest economic information \navailable. We have to address that issue. We understand it. Some of us \nbelieve that Americans who work hard and play by the rules ought to be \nable to get a livable wage as a matter of principle. To achieve that \ngoal, we have to address the impact on inflation and job loss. We will \nmake that argument and we will make it with a great deal of enthusiasm. \nTwo articles from the Wall Street Journal show that the increase in the \nminimum wage did not cause job loss or increase inflation. I will \ninclude those articles in the Record at the appropriate place following \nmy remarks. Here was the newspaper that opposed it hammer and tong the \nlast time we had the increase. I do not suggest that they are going to \neditorialize in favor of it this time. But, nonetheless, the various \nstudies have shown that there is no evidence that modest increases in \nthe minimum wage would harm the economy or cause job loss.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know what will be in the President's State of \nthe Union speech tonight. There are some reports that he will indicate \nsupport for an increase in the minimum wage. And if he does I hope that \nour Chambers will show support for that proposal because I know it will \nmake all the difference in the world for millions of Americans and \ntheir families. Increasing the minimum wage will allow them to look to \nthe future with a greater sense of hope.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have a couple of questions that I may \nwant to put to my colleague in just a moment.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts touched on two concerns \nthat I want to speak about for a brief period of time. The Senator \nmentioned welfare. Earlier when I was speaking I didn't talk about the \nwelfare bill. But I want the Senator to know that as we see the reports \nthat this has been a huge success because there are 4 million fewer \npeople receiving welfare assistance, I think there has been a lot of \nconfusion. Welfare reform doesn't mean that there are fewer people on \nwelfare. It doesn't mean you reduce the number of people receiving \nassistance. It means you reduce poverty. That is what it is about. It \nworks if you are reducing the poverty for these families which are 90 \npercent women and children.\n  When I have been traveling around the country it is heartbreaking. \nThe Senator talks about after school. There are 3- and 4-year olds home \nalone right now. That should not be the case because mothers are told \nto work. There are also preschoolers who are in very ad hoc \narrangements with a relative for this week or that week, then somebody \nelse the next week. We don't have affordable child care. In East LA in \nLos Angeles there is a waiting list of 30,000 for affordable child \ncare. The President will be speaking about that tonight. Mr. President, \nthere are first- and second-graders.\n  I met a woman in Los Angeles who broke down crying because she is so \nscared because her first-grader goes home alone--she is at work--to a \nvery dangerous housing project, and is told to lock the door, and take \nno phone calls. There are children who don't play outside right now.\n  So when the Senator from Massachusetts talked about child care, I \njust want to emphasize the fact that welfare reform only means \nreduction of poverty. It means that children are in safe places \nreceiving good child care. That is not happening.\n  Mr. President, I also want to point out that there are too many \nmothers who in our community colleges who are now told, ``You cannot \npursue your education. You have to work.'' The job is $5.15, and if the \nminimum wage isn't higher one year later they will be worse off.\n  I am going to have an amendment for student deferment for those \nmothers because that is toward economic self-sufficiency, and another \namendment that is going to require States to provide to Health and \nHuman Services the data in 6 months as to how many families are moving \ntoward economic self-sufficiency because you just can't eliminate \npeople from assistance and cut off assistance if people do not have the \njobs and decent wages.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator this question. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was speaking to an issue that I hear about \neverywhere I go, and it sounds like the President is going to be \nspeaking to it, which is that I think people in our country believe \nthat if you play by the rules of the game and you work 40 hours a week \nor thereabouts 52 weeks a year you ought not to be poor in America. \nThat is what this is about. The last time we had a debate on the \nminimum wage the Senator from Massachusetts just insisted that the \nSenate would address\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nthis issue. Does the Senator intend to make this such a precise \npriority for his work that one way or another all Senators are going to \nbe voting on this? Are we going to have it on the floor of the Senate? \nAre we going to have the debate? Are we going to have a vote on it so \nall Senators can be held accountable to working families, or not?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely, Senator. We will vote on this issue, and the \nearlier the better as far as I am concerned, so that minimum wage \nearners can continue the progress that they have made during the last 2 \nyears. We will vote on this measure. I think that those who are opposed \nto it will give the Senate the opportunity to vote on it--at least I \ncertainly hope they will. But the Senator is quite correct. We will \nvote on it one way or the other, and I think we take to heart that \nCongressman Gephardt, Congressman Bonior and others have an identical \nbill. They are strongly committed. As Senators remember, there is a \nmore complicated rule process over in the House of Representatives. But \nthere is no reason in the world that we in the Senate cannot have an \nopportunity to vote on that measure and attach it to legislation and \nsend it over to the House. We will do that and continue to do it until \nwe are successful.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor. I am \npleased to hear that because that is part of what I am here for as a \nSenator.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts one final question. We \ndon't just look at polls. But does the Senator have, in terms of what \npeople in the country have been saying about raising the minimum wage \n50 cents a year over the next 3 years--and we index it after that--is \nthere broad public support that is a matter of simple elementary \njudgment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. It is interesting that studies \nfrom this month show even greater support for the increase than we saw \nwhen we began this debate in the last Congress. Most Americans \nunderstand that we have had this extraordinary prosperity for millions \nof Americans over the period of the last 6 years. Most Americans \nunderstand that it has been working families who have made a \ndifference. Those families include minimum wage earners--teachers' \naides, who work in classrooms; health care aides, who work in nursing \nhomes; and people who clean office buildings in communities across the \ncountry. Those men and women work hard, and they take pride in their \nwork. Many of them have children, and we all know how hard it is to try \nto raise a family on $5.15 an hour. All those workers ask is to be \ntreated fairly.\n  One of the most startling developments in the last few years is the \nnumber of working families who are using soup kitchens, food pantries \nand homeless shelters in cities across the country. The U.S. Conference \nof Mayors released a study showing that in 1996, 38% of those seeking \nemergency food aid are working--not unemployed. This is up from 23% in \n1994. And, officials in two-thirds of the cities cited low wages as a \nprimary reason for hunger. I don't know whether the Senator has this \nproblem in rural communities in his region of the Nation. But in urban \nareas, almost 40 percent of those seeking emergency food aid are \nworking, and they still can't make it.\n  All we are saying is that if you are working you shouldn't have to go \nto a soup kitchen. When you are working, you shouldn't have to bring \nyour children to a soup kitchen in order to be fed. The minimum wage is \ndesigned to prevent such problems. It has been a part of the fabric of \nour society since the late 1930's, and it has been something which has \nhad bipartisan support in the past. We are hopeful that it will have \nbipartisan support this time. Ultimately we will have it. But it had \nbipartisan support under President Bush, and President Nixon supported \nthe increase as well. And Republicans in this body have supported it, \ntoo.\n  Many of our colleagues are constantly talking about the importance of \nrewarding work in our society. But when you have people who are able-\nbodied, who want to work, and who have jobs--there is something wrong \nif they can't make it on their own. There is something wrong if we do \nnot try to address that problem.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have one final question.\n  The people who contribute don't have a lot. They are not the heavy \nhitters. They are not the ones always here in Washington to lobby us.\n  How does the Senator think we could win this fight?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a good point because the \norganizations, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the \nNational Restaurant Association and others are out there already trying \nto discourage people from supporting this program. We will have a \nchance to deal with their arguments when we see what has actually \nhappened in terms of the expansion of the restaurant industry and \nemployment among restaurant workers. The Senator is no less interested \nin expanded employment or adequate income for restaurant workers than I \nam, and they still have done better with our modest increases in the \npast, and they will in the future.\n  I want to ask if the Senator will agree with me on one other \nproposition. We will hear during the debate that at least a quarter of \nthese are teenagers who are making the minimum wage. In my State, \ntuition at the University of Massachusetts in Boston costs $4297. These \nstudents are still 18 and 19 years old. They are teenagers, and many of \nthem are working. These students need the money.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is my time. I ask unanimous consent \nto have 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Many of their parents never went to college. These are \nteenagers. These students are trying to earn enough to buy their books \nand maybe attend an athletic event once in a while or be able to pay in \norder to rent athletic equipment. These students--and yes, they are \nteenagers--are working long and hard, and they deserve the increase, \ntoo.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator asked about Minnesota. Just \ntwo final points.\n  One, I was speaking on the floor earlier and I said that I think most \nfamilies are focused on how you earn a decent living and how you give \nyour children the care you know they need and deserve. I think the \nminimum wage bill is an important step in that direction along with \nwhatever we can do on affordable child care and health care. That is \nthe key to family income in this country.\n  I spoke earlier about the record of inequality. Secretary Reich had a \nvery important piece in the New York Times about it. But now we see, \nMr. President, a merger with education because, as a matter of fact, I \nsay to my colleagues and my friend from Massachusetts what I find when \nI travel around Minnesota--and I was a college teacher for 20 years--is \nthat many students are taking 6 years to graduate and not 4 years \nbecause now students are working on the average of 25 or 30 hours a \nweek at two minimum-wage jobs.\n  So we now are talking about a piece of legislation that speaks to the \nissue of how families can have more income and also how students can \nafford their higher education. Many of these students are 18 and 19. \nBut let's not trivialize the teen part. They are young women and young \nmen who are working hard to be able to go to school. You had better \nbelieve that this minimum wage bill is really of critical importance to \nthese young people as to whether or not they are going to be able to \ncomplete their education and do well financially.\n  So the Senator is absolutely correct. There is the strongest \ncorrelation to education and affordable education which I think all of \nus agree is an absolutely crucial issue.\n  Mr. President, today I am co-sponsoring a bill introduced by my \ncolleague and friend Senator Ted Kennedy, cosponsored by a number of \nothers, a measure which I consider to be one of the most important \nitems we can pass and enact this year--the ``American Family Fair \nMinimum Wage Act of 1998.'' Our bill would increase the minimum wage by \n50 cents a year during each of the next three years. After that, it \nwould index further increases in the minimum wage to increases in the \ncost of living.\n  This 3-year increase of $1.50--raising the federal minimum wage to \n$6.65/hour by September 1 of the year 2000, and\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\npegging it to inflation in succeeding years--is the most immediate and \npractical step we can take to deliver to American working families a \nmessage of economic justice and principle. The message is this: if you \nwork hard and play by the rules in America, you should not live in \npoverty. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case today for many \nworking Americans with families. We need to address that problem.\n  Full time work at minimum wage generates an income of approximately \n$10,700 a year. That's $2,600 below the poverty line for a family of \nthree in this country. Minimum wage is not a living wage in America \ntoday. Even after the most recent increase, the federal minimum wage is \nworth far less in real dollars than it was in the 1960s and 1970s.\n  Remember, the minimum wage disproportionately affects women. Sixty \npercent of those earning the minimum wage are women. Teachers' aides, \nchild care providers, service-sector employees--some of the hardest \nworking people in America, performing crucial tasks. Many of these \nwomen are single heads of households with child. One of the quickest \nways we as a Congress could take a step toward real gender equity with \nregard to pay would be to pass an increase in the minimum wage and send \nit to the President. I am sure he will sign it. That would immediately \nimprove the economic situation of millions of working women, many with \nfamilies.\n  Increasing the minimum wage will benefit those who need it most in \nAmerica--adults, women, working families. Seventy-five percent of those \ncurrently receiving minimum wage workers are adults; 60 percent are \nwomen; 50 percent work more than 35 hours a week; 82 percent work at \nleast 20 hours a week.\n  Look at a few numbers which tell a story.\n  The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities recently released a \nreport showing that income inequality grew in 48 of 50 states since the \nlate 1970s. The decline in real incomes of the poorest one-fifth of \nfamilies with children in America averaged 21 percent, or $2,500.\n  Since 1968, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, grew by 115 \npercent while the purchasing power of the minimum wage declined by 30 \npercent.\n  To reflect the purchasing power it maintained in 1968, today's \nminimum wage would have to be at $7.33/hour, not $5.15. So even a \ncarefully charted increase to $6.65/hour will not make up the entire \ndifference, but it will put us back on a road to responsibly \nrepresenting our constituents.\n  For nearly the last two decades, the bottom 20 percent of income \nearners in this country haven't experienced growth like most Americans. \nInstead, they have lost 9 percent in real family income growth, while \nthe top 20 percent have gained more than 26 percent.\n  Our bill is about justice. In recent weeks and months, I have \ntraveled around this country: East and South Central Los Angeles, \nBaltimore, Chicago, the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, as well as in my \nhome state of Minnesota. I have repeatedly seen the struggles of hard \nworking, dedicated people who want to improve their lives, but they \ncan't find jobs that will pay them a livable wage.\n  Now increasing the minimum wage will not compromise the economy and \nit will not harm the falling unemployment rate. Consider that in \nSeptember 1996, just one month prior to the minimum wage increase from \n$4.25 to $4.75, the national unemployment rate was at 5.2 percent. By \nDecember 1997, two months after the second annual increase to $5.15, \nthe U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent. And retail trade jobs, \nwhere a disproportionate amount of low wage workers are employed, \nincreased slightly. Job opportunities in this country are not \ncompromised by this legislation. In fact, the very importance and value \nof job opportunities to all Americans is exactly what is enforced by \nthis legislation.\n  Today's economy continues to perform well. Yet the minimum wage--part \nof that same economy--has progressively fallen back. In 1996, we \nstarted to pave the right path to justice by increasing the minimum \nwage, but more must be done.\n  So I stand in support as the first co-sponsor of this bill and urge \nDemocrats and Republicans alike to support Senator Kennedy's initiative \nand to support the American workforce by passing the Family Fair \nMinimum Wage Act of 1998. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for 2 final minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this chart here illustrates very clearly \nthe purchasing power of the minimum wage since 1959. All of these \nfigures are in 1997 dollars, adjusted for inflation. In 1968 the real \nvalue of the minimum wage was $7.33. In 1995 it was down to $4.32 an \nhour. In the 1996 legislation, we added two additional steps. On \nSeptember 1, 1997, the second step took effect, raising the minimum \nwage's value to $5.15 an hour. If we do nothing, by the year 2000, it \nwill be $4.66 an hour. Our legislation proposes that it go up to $6.18, \nin three steps. Again, this is the what the minimum wage will buy in \n1997 dollars, if our legislation becomes law. Even that increase will \nleave minimum wage earners below where they were in the 1960s and \n1970s. The legislation is a very modest step forward, and I believe \nthat working families have earned it.\n  I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that the two articles that \nI mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Economists Alter Minimum-Wage View--New Data Show Small Increase \n                           Doesn't Cost Jobs\n\n                           (By David Wessel)\n\n       Washington.--Revisiting their own controversial research, a \n     pair of prominent economists concluded that better data \n     support their original assertion: Raising the minimum wage \n     moderately doesn't cost jobs.\n       In the new work, David Card of the University of California \n     at Berkeley and Alan Krueger of Princeton University used \n     reports filed by employers and collated by the U.S. Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics. Their earlier work, an influential element \n     in Democrats' successful campaign to lift the minimum wage, \n     relied on a telephone survey of employers that their critics \n     attacked.\n       With the new data, the economists looked at fast-food \n     employment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania at two key points: \n     first, after an 80-cent-an-hour increase in New Jersey's \n     minimum wage in April 1992 that didn't affect workers in \n     Pennsylvania and, second, after an October 1996 50-cent \n     increase in the federal minimum wage to $4.75. The federal \n     increase only affected Pennsylvania because New Jersey's \n     minimum wage was above the federal level.\n\n\n                          Little or No Effect\n\n       ``The New Jersey (1992) minimum wage increase had either no \n     effect, or a small positive effect, on fast-food industry \n     employment in New Jersey vis-a-vis eastern Pennsylvania,'' \n     the economists conclude. Between February and November 1992, \n     fast-food employment grew by 3% in New Jersey but fell by \n     between 1% and 3% in eastern Pennsylvania. What's more, after \n     the October 1996 wage boost that affected only Pennsylvania, \n     fast-food employment rose more sharply in that state than New \n     Jersey. Between December 1995 and December 1996, fast-food \n     employment grew by 11% in eastern Pennsylvania counties and \n     by 2% in New Jersey.\n       The argument by Mr. Card and Mr. Krueger, a former chief \n     economist in the Clinton Labor Department, challenged the \n     conventional wisdom among mainstream economists that raising \n     the price of workers' labor meant employers would buy less of \n     it. The Clinton administration embraced it. House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich derided it as ``spurious'' and House Majority \n     Leader Richard Armey, an economist, called it \n     ``counterintuitive.'' Several big-name economists dismissed \n     it.\n       The details of the analysis and data drew fire first from \n     an employers' group, the Employment Policy Institute, that \n     gathered data of its own to refute it. Later, economists \n     David Neumark of Michigan State University and William \n     Wascher of the Federal Reserve Board supplemented EPI's data \n     with data of their own and argued that fast-food payrolls did \n     what economic textbooks predicted; grew more slowly in New \n     Jersey than in Pennsylvania after the 1992 New Jersey wage \n     increase.\n\n\n                          Remains Unpersuaded\n\n       Mr. Wascher isn't persuaded by the new data. ``We never \n     found very strong negative effects of the minimum wage on \n     fast-food establishments,'' he said yesterday. ``We \n     speculated these franchise agreements are very restrictive \n     and that the bigger effects might be at mom-and-pop \n     establishments.'' He said BLS data for all eating and \n     drinking establishments, not just fast-food outlets, show \n     that payrolls in New Jersey generally rise more than those in \n     Pennsylvania between February and November, but that the \n     difference was smaller in 1992 when the New Jersey minimum \n     wage was raised than in 1991 or 1993.\n       The new Card-Krueger work, to be published shortly as a \n     working paper by Princeton, hasn't been widely circulated yet \n     among\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\n     their critics. The authors acknowledge that their data don't \n     tell whether employers facing higher minimum wages reduce the \n     average hours per worker; the figures only count how many \n     people were employed.\n       Despite assertions from employer groups and many mainstream \n     economists that lifting the minimum wage would reduce the \n     number of jobs available to young and unskilled workers and \n     increase unemployment, the recent strength of the economy has \n     pushed the jobless rate down. Retailers and other employers \n     of low-wage workers are complaining more about labor \n     shortages than wage increases.\n       The federal minimum wage was lifted to $5.15 an hour on \n     Sept. 1, 1997.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nChicken Feed: Minimum Wage Is Up, But a Fast-Food Chain Notices Little \n  Impact--Economic Boom Lifts Profit; Firm's Main Problem Is Hiring, \n             Retaining People--Pressures on Job Are Rising\n\n                        (By Bernard Wysocki Jr.)\n\n       Falls Church, Va.--The minimum wage was a hot issue 18 \n     months ago, pitting business against labor, Republicans \n     against Democrats.\n       In April 1996, David Rosenstein, a fast-food entrepreneur, \n     staunchly opposed a proposed two-step rise to $5.15 an hour \n     as ``a bad idea.'' The middle managers at his 13 Popeyes \n     Chicken & Biscuits restaurants didn't know how they would \n     cope.\n       How times have changed.\n       Today, despite the now-higher minimum wage, Mr. \n     Rosenstein's restaurants are prospering. Operating profits \n     are up 11% from last year on a 10% rise in sales, which are \n     running at a $14 million annual clip. He recently raised \n     prices. He has opened a new store. And in a sign of boom \n     times, he knocked out a wall and doubled the size of his \n     spacious office.\n       ``The economy is good. Business is good,'' says the 49-\n     year-old Mr. Rosenstein, whose restaurants are franchisees of \n     Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises. What about that minimum-wage \n     increase? ``I think we saw it in more dire terms than it \n     worked out,'' he says.\n\n\n                              few protests\n\n       Indeed, the minimum-wage increase has turned into one of \n     the nonevents of 1997, thanks mostly to the economy's \n     continuing strength. Low-wage Americans--nearly 10 million \n     workers, by some estimates--got a raise. But amid the current \n     prosperity, hardly anybody noticed. So, when the second step, \n     a 40-cent-an-hour raise, kicked in seven weeks ago, on Sept. \n     1, few cheered, but even fewer protested.\n       Critics had argued that higher wages would squeeze profits \n     because employers, beset by competitors, couldn't raise \n     prices. Nationwide, it is hard to generalize about that. But \n     Mr. Rosenstein recently raised nearly every price on his \n     menu--biscuits went up 20% and the average item 5%--with \n     hardly a peep from customers. ``I'm surprised, very \n     surprised,'' says Kenneth Hahn, the chain's director of \n     operations.\n       Others had warned that raising the minimum wage would \n     create inflated pay demands by those making slightly above-\n     minimum wages. Not here. Work crews at Mr. Rosenstein's \n     Virginia stores were averaging $5.54 an hour in 1996 and get \n     only $5.60 today--a raise of 1%.\n       And although some academics say higher wages draw better-\n     skilled teenagers out of school and into the workplace, \n     displacing lower-skilled people, the Popeyes managers see \n     nothing of the kind. If anything, their talent pool is \n     weakening, drained by the booming economy.\n\n\n                           collateral damage\n\n       Even though Mr. Rosenstein's worst fears weren't realized, \n     lots of other things have happened in the past 18 months.\n       A tour of these Popeyes stores and conversations with the \n     fry cooks and biscuit makers, the store supervisors and \n     managers indicate that while the minimum-wage issue has \n     retreated to the back burner of American politics, the big \n     issues now are, in a sense, the collateral damage of the \n     economic boom; intensified competition, a scarcity of good \n     workers, high staff turnover and job burnout.\n       The wage increase itself has had major impact at only one \n     outlet, at the Popeyes store on Rhode Island Avenue in the \n     District of Columbia. There, the local hourly minimum is set \n     at $1 over the federal minimum, and on Sept. 1, the \n     district's minimum went to $6.15. Managers have cut back \n     hours and piled more work on employees. Mr. Rosenstein says \n     the operating profits at this one outlet fell to $34,000 for \n     the 12 months ended Aug. 31 from $46,000 a year earlier.\n\n\n                          Escaping to Maryland\n\n       And so, when his Metropolitan Restaurant Management Co. \n     looked for expansion sites in and around Washington, he went \n     across the line into Maryland and opened there, largely to \n     escape the $6.15 wage.\n       As several U.S. cities propose a so-called living wage, \n     with minimums higher than the federal one, opponents such as \n     the employer-backed Employment Policies Institute in \n     Washington argue that low-wage employers will shun higher-\n     wage locales. There may be something to that, as shown by Mr. \n     Rosenstein's unwillingness to open another store in the high-\n     wage district.\n       The really gut issue facing his company, however, is \n     intensified competition. That may seem ironic: Its financial \n     results are good, and the price increases have held. But on \n     the darker side, the managers and the workers alike say that, \n     on a day-to-day operating basis, the competitive environment \n     has become tougher.\n       Back in the spring of 1996, Mohammed Isah, who manages the \n     Popeyes store on City Line Avenue in West Philadelphia, \n     fretted about the impending wage increase and wondered where \n     the extra productivity he would need would come from. He \n     vowed to scale back part-timers' hours and increase their \n     workloads.\n       And he did. Sitting at one of his tables, Mr. Isah, once a \n     bank manager in his native Nigeria, nods in the direction of \n     a middle-age employee sweeping the floor. When the wage went \n     up on Sept. 1 he halved her hours. Meantime, full-timers have \n     taken up that slack. Nowadays, one person sets up the \n     registers, then starts the biscuits, then does assorted \n     odd tasks before business picks up at lunch time. Mr. Isah \n     freely concedes that people are working twice as hard for \n     their modest raise.\n       Yet the increased minimum wage isn't what is really driving \n     Mr. Isah's hardball productivity drive. A few months ago, a \n     Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened just a half-mile down \n     City Line Avenue. Even the Popeyes managers agree that it's \n     quite a site for a fast-food place: a renovated old home with \n     fireplaces, walls sconces and a winding staircase.\n       When Kentucky Fried Chicken opened, Mr. Isah's sales \n     declined. Although some business has now returned, his sales \n     are running 2% below 1996 levels, and his operating profit is \n     down 10%. His bosses say he is a good, hard-working manager, \n     but the harsh business environment is putting pressure on him \n     and his staff. ``You have people doing two or three people's \n     jobs. Eventually, it gets to them,'' he says, and they are \n     burning out from overwork. Turnover is rising as good people \n     search for jobs elsewhere. Looking ahead, he sees more \n     problems. He even has a written list of his concerns: Morale \n     will drop. Quality of work will fall. Dependability will \n     wane. Absenteeism will rise.\n\n\n                         Risk of Vicious Circle\n\n       The Popeyes managers know that trimming staff can be self-\n     defeating, and they haven't eliminated any full-time \n     positions in the past 18 months. If hours drop, service \n     declines, and sales and profit can suffer. A vicious circle \n     can develop.\n       Mr. Rosenstein's New Castle, Del., outlet along busy Route \n     13 is gripped by more competition--not only for business but \n     also for talent. The store manager there left the company \n     earlier this year to run a Boston Market outlet. The Popeyes \n     chain, which pays its store managers $30,000 to $45,000 a \n     year, couldn't match the Boston Market pay, Frank Williams, \n     the district manager, says. Outer managers had to pitch in \n     until a replacement was found.\n       As the store suffered from patchwork management, business \n     faltered. In addition, crew hours were cut back, and \n     cleanliness suffered. That's the sort of thing that really \n     rankles Mr. Williams, and, on a recent day, he was sitting in \n     the New Castle restaurant, drawing up a long list of tasks \n     for his store manager.\n       Popeyes managers are in a bind. They can push their people \n     only so far, especially in an economy with so many job \n     opportunities. They need to keep their employees. In the more \n     prosperous locations, such as the Popeyes in Rockville, Md., \n     an acute labor shortage keeps pushing up the work crews' pay. \n     In April 1996, it averaged $6.01 an hour; today, it averages \n     $6.42 Managers there say the increase has nothing to do with \n     federal law and everything to do with supply and demand.\n       ``My senior fry cook, he makes $8.75 an hour,'' says Mohsen \n     Eghtesadi, district manager for Metropolitan's two Maryland \n     restaurants. He waves his hand toward the Rockville Pike, a \n     busy commercial strip. ``Look at all these sit-down \n     restaurants opening up. They can pay $10 an hour, $12 an \n     hour. For us to keep good employees, we really have to \n     increase their pay.''\n       ``It's a chicken war,'' Mr. Eghtesadi says. He adds, with a \n     wry smile, ``And we are chicken warriors.''\n\n\n                       much competition for staff\n\n       His problems are just a tiny example of the sharper \n     competition for talent. With much of the economy thriving, \n     the national unemployment rate has dropped below 5%. In the \n     fast-food business, expansion-minded chains need experienced \n     supervisors and managers. Even good fry cooks, earning $8 an \n     hour or so, are constantly vulnerable to raids by other \n     chains.\n       Mr. Hahn, the director of operations, spends far more time \n     these days weeding out the losers among job candidates. The \n     chain does extensive background checks on all supervisors and \n     puts managerial candidates through a series of psychological \n     pencil-and-paper tests. The Popeyes bosses try to find \n     candidates whose profiles match those of their successful \n     store managers. Matchups have become rare.\n       At entry-level employment, more applicants are young women \n     looking for jobs as part of the welfare-to-work movement. \n     With fast-food employers inundated by welfare recipients, the \n     minimum-wage issue takes a back seat to other concerns.\n       Seven weeks ago, Sharie Ross got a raise to $5.15 an hour, \n     serving up fast food at the New Castle outlet, up from the \n     $5-an-hour minimum in Delaware. She hardly noticed because, \n     as a welfare-to-work employee, her main worry is the gradual \n     loss of her welfare benefits.\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\n       ``I still get food stamps; that's $98 a month,'' says Ms. \n     Ross, 20. But when she started work five months ago, the \n     state of Delaware picked up the cost of day care for her two \n     children. To her, keeping that $200-a-month subsidy is more \n     important than a few cents an hour in extra pay.\n       Yet a booming economy can mask all sorts of operating \n     difficulties. That is true in many businesses, and it is true \n     at Mr. Rosenstein's fried-chicken empire. One rule of thumb: \n     If sales growth continues, all the other problems are \n     manageable. In the past 18 months, sales at many of Mr. \n     Rosenstein's stores have grown at double digits--and have \n     surprised him. ``You budget for a 2% or 3% rise. To budget \n     for a 10% rise is, well, irresponsible,'' he says.\n       But in his Prince William County, Va., stores, sales are \n     booming. He pulls out his sales projections--$3,751,000 this \n     year, up more than 10%. His hourly wage costs are up 7%, \n     mostly because hours worked are up 6%. His projected 1997 \n     profit at these stores is $270,000, up from $234,000 last \n     year.\n       Mr. Rosenstein thinks his company will continue to be \n     prosperous if the economy keeps booming. But, he adds, ``If \n     there's a downturn, it's going to be nasty.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

A bill to prohibit the cloning of humans; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   the human cloning prohibition act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprohibit the cloning of humans. This act would further extend last \nyear's efforts by last year's law which banned federal funding of human \ncloning. Under my bill, there would be an outright ban on human \ncloning, whether publicly or privately funded.\n  The scientific term for human cloning is ``human somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer.'' That is what my bill would ban. My bill would not undermine \nor stifle scientific research in the area of genetics that promises to \ncombat and cure disease in humans. This research includes the cloning \nof animals and human cells other than embryo cells.\n  I am not a scientist and do not wish to insert myself in the process \nof scientific research and advances, from which we all benefit. \nHowever, when science crosses over the boundary of what is ethically \nand morally appropriate research, I have an obligation to respond on \nbehalf of myself and my constituents. Congress--and its law-making \nauthority--is the only mechanism available to address the issue of \nhuman cloning and assert the will of the American people that it not go \nforward.\n  We have a responsibility to protect the moral and ethical foundation \nupon which this country was built. In recognizing that responsibility, \nboth the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction have carefully \nlooked at the implications of moving forward with legislation to ban \nhuman cloning. They have tapped the experts in the science of genetics \nand have confirmed what we as laymen believe--the cloning of humans is \nmorally unacceptable and scientifically dangerous.\n  During a March 12, 1997, House Committee on Science, Subcommittee on \nTechnology hearing, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission \ntestified that there is sufficient cause to warrant legislation because \na developing child would be subject to undue harm as a result of \ncurrent unscientifically plausible technology. In summarizing the \nCommission's report before the Subcommittee, its Chairman, Dr. Harold \nT. Shapiro, noted that this deficiency in the technology was coupled \nwith far-reaching concern that human cloning is not deemed morally \nacceptable by society as a whole.\n  A final hearing was held July 22, 1997, during which Dr. Hessell \nBouma, a professor of biology, said it best. The transcript states that \n``he stressed the uniqueness, freedom, and respect intrinsic to human \nlife. Cloning, Dr. Bouma testified, is in direct violation of all \nthree, and therefore should be prohibited by law.''\n  Mr. President, I don't think any of us can argue with that.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues to take swift action and impose a \nban on human cloning. We are all aware of the activities in Chicago to \nmove forward with a human cloning experiment, so time is of the \nessence. I would ask that we work together over the coming weeks to \npass a bill to prevent this and future efforts to wrongly clone humans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Human Cloning Prohibition \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that the Federal Government has a moral \n     obligation to the nation to prohibit the cloning of humans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Civil Penalties.--Whoever is found to be in violation \n     of section 2 shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more \n     than $5,000 for each such violation.\n       (b) Ineligibility for Federal Funds.--A individual found to \n     be in violation of section 2 shall not be eligible to receive \n     any Federal funding for research regardless of the type of \n

Res. 167\n\n       Whereas since becoming quarterback for the Denver Broncos \n     in 1983, John Elway has been involved in some of the most \n     striking comeback victories in the history of the National \n     Football League (referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``NFL'');\n       Whereas John Elway has been a Pro Bowl quarterback, was \n     named NFL Most Valuable Player in 1987 and the American \n     Football Conference's Most Valuable Player in 1993, holds \n     numerous NFL passing records, and is the all-time winningest \n     quarterback in the history of the NFL;\n       Whereas John Elway's leadership, dedication, and \n     perseverance symbolizes excellence in these qualities for the \n     entire Nation and represents these qualities for America to \n     the world; and\n       Whereas John Elway, an exceptional athlete, has sustained a \n     high level of personal competitiveness and has finally led \n     his team to the honor of a Super Bowl championship: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) recognizes the outstanding achievement of the Denver \n     Broncos' quarterback, John Elway; and\n         (2) congratulates John Elway as the winning quarterback \n     of Super Bowl XXXII.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United \nStates will outline some important issues for our consideration during \nthe second half of this Congress, and, as I have sat here for the last \n40 minutes listening to some of my colleagues, they have spoken with \ngreat emphasis on the importance of the points on which they are going \nto agree and disagree with him. But today I rise, with my friend \nSenator Allard, to submit two resolutions that are on a happier note. \nThese resolutions are to honor the outstanding achievement of the \nDenver Broncos in their winning of Super Bowl XXXII.\n  The first resolution recognizes the entire Broncos organization and \nthe other honors John Elway, the team's veteran leader, who happens to \nbe a personal friend of both Senator Allard and myself. For the first \ntime in 13 years, an AFC team has won the Super Bowl, and it is only \nthe second time a wild-card team has won since 1980. Indeed, they were \nthe underdog in the betting from Las Vegas to Atlantic City and all \npoints in between.\n  As those football fans among us might know, the Broncos have glimpsed \nvictory on four prior occasions, but had victory elude them each time. \nAll of that changed this past Sunday. With an inspiring team effort, \nthey beat the odds and the legendary Green Bay Packers, a team as \ntalented and formidable as any of the championship Packer teams before \nit.\n  So sure were some people that the Broncos would lose, one electric \nappliance merchant in Farmington, NM, and Durango, CO, offered \nunlimited free appliances to customers on the day before the game if \nthe Broncos won. Under the agreement, the customers would have only had \nto pay if the Broncos lost. Lucky for him, he had the foresight to take \nout a $300,000 insurance policy, which barely covered his losses to \njubilant customers as the unexpected happened and they showed up \nyesterday at both of his stores to collect on their free appliances.\n  In a brilliant athletic and strategic contest, both the Denver \nBroncos and the Green Bay Packers reflected qualities that we all value \nand admire: hard work, teamwork, preparation, dedication, and \nsportsmanship above all things. For that, and a beautiful display of \nterrific physical talent, both teams must be commended and applauded.\n  I want to highlight the Denver team, of course, because I am from \nColorado and because they displayed a resilience and perseverance in \novercoming four previous Super Bowl losses, qualities which any one of \nus must cheer who, in\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\nany type of endeavor, has ever tried and failed.\n  The Denver team succeeded with the leadership of John Elway, the MVP \nperformance of Terrell Davis, a skilled offensive line that proved \nconfidence and heart can compete with size, and a defense that proved \nas strong as it was fearless against a formidable offense.\n  Our second resolution specifically honors John Elway for his \noutstanding accomplishment in leading the Broncos to its fourth Super \nBowl appearance and its first Super Bowl victory. In bringing his team \na national championship, Mr. Elway has given us lessons in the game of \nfootball for years to come, and Sunday he gave us a new lesson in \nperseverance, dedication and true sportsmanship. He is certainly a \nhero.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the senior Senator from Colorado for yielding.\n  Mr. President, as a fifth generation Coloradan who has rooted for the \nBroncos since they were first organized in the early 1960's, I want to \ngive my Mile High Salute! A Super Bowl victory has been a long time \ncoming for Broncos fans. Broncos fans have searched for an identity \ntheme from ``Orange Crush'' in honor of one of their best defensive \nteams to ``the Mile High Salute.'' Many of the themes were lost in time \nthrough legal hassles or disappointing seasons. But ``the Mile High \nSalute'' is here to stay, etched in history with a Super Bowl Victory!\n  Rules limiting the celebration of success on the football field have \nmade it difficult for players and coaches to express their emotions. \n``The Mile High Salute'' has become the Broncos symbol of success on \nthe field. I do not believe there is a more honorable and appropriate \nway of celebrating in the game of football. The salute is honorable. \nDenver is the Mile High City. The Mile High Salute has come to mean \nmore than success and honor with the Super Bowl Victory. It has come to \nmean dedication, hard work, exceeding peoples' expectations, team work \nand unity, and giving the spirit of competition its just reward. It is \nin this context that I give my Mile High Salute.\n  I want to salute the Green Bay Packers organization. They are a great \norganization and Wisconsin can be proud of them. They made this Super \nBowl one of the best ever. They have a legacy in football that is \nhonored throughout America. I know both my colleagues in the Senate \nfrom Wisconsin are avid supporters.\n  My good friend Congressman Scott Klug, who I joined in the U.S. House \nof Representatives in 1991, got carried away with his enthusiasm for \nhis Green Bay Packers and placed a wager with me. Instead of me \nproviding him with Colorado beef he has the honor of bestowing on me \nsome great Wisconsin cheese. Scott is retiring and I will miss him in \nthe Congress because he has done such a great job in bringing about \ntrue reform. America is better because of his leadership in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I extend a Mile High Salute to the offensive and defensive Broncos \nlinemen. They truly exemplify the team spirit and exceeded expectations \nwith the smallest line in the National Football League. Known as the \n``Orange Hush,'' these are men that have an oath of silence, who \nroutinely arrive an hour early for morning meetings so they can watch \nextra videotape together, who eat meals together, who dress together in \nthe same locker room area, who study the Bible together, and who, most \nimportantly, show up on game day together.\n  An obvious Mile High Salute goes to both quarterback John Elway and \nrunning back Terrell Davis. They recognized that they didn't do it \nalone even though they have become heroes of the game.\n  John Elway is topping off his marvelous career with a Super Bowl win! \nMany top NFL quarterbacks never have the opportunity to claim a Super \nBowl victory. He will eventually be in the Football Hall of Fame. I \nknow him personally and cannot think of anyone more deserving of such \nan honor. He is supported by a wonderful wife Janet and family.\n  Fifteen years ago few people in the Denver community could have \nguessed the impact this young quarterback from Stanford would have on \nthe State of Colorado. Today, John Elway reigns as the king of the \ncomeback and the winningest quarterback in NFL history. He is one of \nthe most recognized figures in American sports. Aside from his \nconsiderable athletic accomplishments, Elway has proven himself \ntime and again to be the heart and soul of his team. As important as \nElway's role is in Colorado sports, he plays a greater role in the \ncommunity. Over the years he has worked tirelessly for the charities of \nColorado, and the Elway Foundation is responsible for hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in donations. I think that in the hearts and minds \nof all Broncos fans this one is indeed for John.\n\n  Terrell Davis returned to the San Diego area and his high school alma \nmater to demonstrate the can do attitude. I personally am amazed at his \ncourage, work ethic, and commitment to winning for the Broncos team. \nHis 157 yards rushing and record three touchdowns in a Super Bowl will \nbe remembered. But this was only the culmination of his best season \never. Davis has grown from a 196th pick in 1995 draft to a Super Bowl \nMVP and 1,750 yard rusher in 15 regular season games. Davis will long \nbe known by the nickname TD as he averaged one touchdown in every game \nhe played in the 1997-1998 season.\n  I salute the entire Broncos staff, owners, and coaches. Mike Shanahan \nhas done a great job and certainly is deserving of the honor as a \nwinning Super Bowl coach. Coach Shanahan and his staff have done an \nincredible job of taking what was a 7-9 team in 1994 to a 12-4 team \nwith the heart to persevere through one of the most difficult roads to \nthe Super Bowl with victories in Kansas City and Pittsburgh. The team \nstatistics speak for themselves, the Broncos offense was ranked number \none in the League with 367 yards per game and the defense was the top \nrated unit in the AFC only allowing 292 yards per game. I congratulate \nPat Bowlen because I know that good leadership starts at the top.\n  I want to recognize the general manager of the Broncos. John Beake is \na good friend and has a great family. He does a great job of \nrepresenting the Broncos organization. Both he and his wife Marcia need \nto be recognized for their fight to eliminate drug abuse. Just another \nexample of how the Broncos organization has reached out into the \ncommunity.\n  I give a Mile High Salute to the fans of the Broncos. They are the \nbest. Many, like my wife Joan, were attending Bronco games when they \nwere playing at the old University of Denver football stadium and wore \nvertically striped socks. Their enthusiasm has not waned over the \nyears.\n  It is an honor for me to represent everyone in Colorado in the U.S. \nSenate. It is especially exciting to be here while winning Super Bowl \nXXXII. While I was interviewed last week about the President's \nscandals. I stated a number of times that people in Colorado have their \npriorities straight. They want their Broncos to win the Super Bowl and \nthat's what they're talking about!\n  Joan and I only wish we could be in Colorado helping our friends and \nneighbors in giving the Broncos and their fans a Mile High Salute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S58-4", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S59-S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 168--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, STATES, AND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES SHOULD \n  SPEND A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL EDUCATION TAX DOLLARS IN OUR \n                         CHILDREN'S CLASSROOMS.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Coverdell, \nMr. Coats, Mr. Gregg, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Collins, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Murkowski, \nMr. Shelby, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Faircloth, \nMr. Helms, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Allard, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Roberts, \nand Mr. Mack) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n                              S.

Poling, Dutch Reformed;\n       Whereas witnesses have verified that during the approximate \n     18 minutes the ship was sinking after being torpedoed off the \n     coast of Greenland, the 4 chaplains went from soldier to \n     soldier calming fears and handing out life jackets and \n     guiding men to safety and when there were no more life \n     jackets, they removed their own life jackets and gave them to \n     others to save their lives and were last seen arm-in-arm in \n     prayer on the hull of the ship;\n       Whereas many of the 230 men who survived owed their lives \n     to these 4 chaplains, and witnesses among them recounted the \n     unique ecumenical spirit and love for their fellow man these \n     4 demonstrated that were later illustrated in a popular \n     postage stamp issued by the United States in 1948 with the \n     title ``Interfaith in Action'';\n       Whereas Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 90 in \n     1957 to honor these 4 chaplains and the men who died with \n     them, and President Truman and President Eisenhower issued \n     similar proclamations calling for national recognition and \n     participation in memorial services throughout the land that \n     have been observed annually by the American Legion on the \n     first Sunday in February;\n       Whereas Congress undertook to create a special medal for \n     valor given to the memory of the 4 chaplains in 1960 and \n     never to be repeated; and\n       Whereas memorials to the chaplains' heroic sacrifice abound \n     in many places throughout the country including the Heroes \n     Window in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) requests the President of the United States to issue a \n     proclamation designating February 3, 1998, as ``Four \n     Chaplains Day''; and\n       (2) invites the people of the United States, of all \n     religions and creeds and in all communities, to observe this \n     date with appropriate ceremonies, celebrations, and \n     commemorations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S60-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                permanent subcommittee on investigations\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, S. 1519, a bill to provide a 6-\nmonth extension of highway, highway safety, and transit programs \npending enactment of a law reauthorizing the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, was introduced and passed the \nSenate on November 10, 1997. The bill was passed by the House on \nNovember 12, 1997, and sent to the President for approval.\n  Because the measure was considered and passed on the same day as its \nintroduction, the Committee on Environment and Public Works was not \nreferred S. 1519, and a report was not filed. Subsequent to the passage \nof the legislation, however, the Congressional Budget Office issued a \ncost estimate, as required under the Senate rules. Therefore, I ask \nthat a letter from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \ndated December 1, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 1997.\n     Hon. Franklin D. Raines,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Raines: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed estimate\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\n     of the pay-as-you go effects of S. 1519, the Surface \n     Transportation Extension Act of 1997.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Clare \n     Doherty and Kristen Layman, both of whom can be reached at \n     226-2860.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n     Enclosure.\n\n Congressional Budget Office: Pay-as-You-Go-Estimate, December 1, 1997\n\n\n S. 1519: Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, As cleared by \n                   the Congress on November 12, 1997\n\n       S. 1519 would provide a temporary extension of highway and \n     transit programs authorized under the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). The bill would \n     provide contract authority of approximately $8.7 billion for \n     programs carried out by the Federal Highway Administration \n     (FHWA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     (NHTSA), and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Of \n     that total, $15 million would be for the FHWA minimum \n     allocation program, which is exempt from the obligation \n     limitation that applies to the bulk of FHWA's spending. In \n     addition to providing contract authority, S. 1519 would \n     authorize the appropriation of $372 million for the Federal \n     Transit Administration for the first half of fiscal year \n     1998.\n       The minimum allocation program is the only program \n     reauthorized in S. 1519 that has outlays that are classified \n     as direct spending. All other outlays from authorizations in \n     S. 1519 would be discretionary because they either would \n     result from discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 1998 \n     or would be subject to obligation limitations included in the \n     1998 appropriation act for transportation (Public Law 105-\n     66).\n       S. 1519 would provide $15.46 million for the minimum \n     allocation program for the six-day period from January 26, \n     1998, through January 31, 1998. For the purposes of \n     estimating the pay-as-you-go impact of the act, this amount \n     has to be extrapolated through 2002, based on the spending \n     authority provided in the legislation. This approach is \n     required under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which \n     stipulates that an expiring mandatory program with current-\n     year outlays in excess of $50 million be assumed to continue \n     at the program level in place when it is scheduled to expire.\n       The $15.46 million in contract authority for six days \n     translates into an annualized level of $639 million for \n     January 26 through the remainder of fiscal year 1998 and for \n     each subsequent fiscal year. By comparison, the current CBO \n     baseline for the minimum allocation program includes contract \n     authority of $639 million for 1998, but assumes annual \n     increases to reflect projected inflation for subsequent \n     years. Thus, CBO estimates that enacting S. 1519 would \n     produce pay-as-you-go savings of $62 million in outlays over \n     the 1998-2002 period, relative to the current baseline.\n       CBO's estimate of S. 1519's impact on outlays from direct \n     spending is summarized in the following table for fiscal \n     years 1998-2007. For purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go \n     procedures, only the effects in the budget year and the \n     succeeding four years are counted. Also, only direct spending \n     outlays are subject to pay-as-you-go requirements; the \n     discretionary outlays from contract authority subject to \n     obligation limitations are not considered for pay-as-you-go \n     purposes.\n\n                                                                  ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF S. 1519 ON DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS                                                                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                             By fiscal year, in millions of dollars                                             \n                                                               ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    1998         1999         2000         2001         2002         2003         2004         2005         2006         2007   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays............................................            0           -2           -8          -19          -33          -47          -63          -80          -97         -115\nChanges in receipts...........................................                                                                                                                                  \n(9) Not applicable                                                                                                                                                                              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Clare Doherty \n     and Kristen Layman, both of whom can be reached at 226-2860. \n     The estimate was approved by Robert A.

WALTER GAMEWELL ``CURLY'' WATSON\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe exemplary career and extraordinary life of one of South Carolina's \nmost beloved citizens: Dr. Walter Gamewell ``Curly\" Watson.\n  Dr. Watson, who will turn 88 in February, was born in Trenton, South \nCarolina, on the same farm he owns today. He graduated from The Citadel \ncollege during the height of the Great Depression. Although he earned \nthe highest grade point average in his class, he was--like so many of \nus during that time--unable to find work. So in order to earn money for \nmedical school, he taught math and coached football at high schools in \nEdgefield, South Carolina, and Bainbridge, Georgia, for the following \nseven years.\n  Finally, in 1939, he was able to enter medical school; and in 1943, \nhe graduated from the Medical College of Georgia. After interning and \ncompleting his residency at University Hospital in Augusta, Dr. Watson \nserved two years as an Army physician in Korea and the Philippines.\n  Before shipping out, Dr. Watson married Audrey Bazemore, a University \nHospital nurse whom he met during his residency. Today, the two remain \ndevoted to one another.\n  In fact, it was only at Audrey's insistence that Walter agreed to \nallow University Hospital to bear his name. He is notorious for \navoiding attention and eschewing praise. Indeed, Dr. Watson's life and \ncareer are marked by his humility.\n  Dr. Watson began his private practice 50 years ago, joining the \npractice established by Senator Strom Thurmond's late brother J. W. \nWhile delivering over 50 babies a month for most of the past 50 years, \nWatson also found time to serve his hospital, church, and community. He \nled Grace Methodist Church's efforts to build two new sanctuaries, as \nwell as its relief mission for the victims of Hurricane Hugo. And for \nover 40 years, Watson has served as the team physician for North \nAugusta High School.\n  Walter Watson also has received numerous accolades from his peers in \nthe medical profession. Among other honors, he was named Professor \nEmeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at the Medical College of \nGeorgia. And the hundreds of letters he has received over the years \nfrom friends, colleagues, and patients are testament to his unsurpassed \nbedside manner and deft human touch.\n  Perhaps greatest among Watson's accomplishments is his success as a \nfamily man. He raised five children, all of whom have grown up to be \nwell-respected members of their community. All four of his daughters \nbecame nurses; they received their first training from their father.\n  Today, Mr. President, the University of Georgia Hospital names its \nWomen's Center in Dr. Watson's honor. I can think of no more fitting \ntribute to this man who has given much to his community while asking \nnothing in return. At a time when many speak of the need to foster \nvolunteerism, Dr. Walter Watson's life serves as a lesson in humility, \nfaith, commitment, professionalism, and service. Beloved teacher, \nhealer, father, and husband: Walter Watson is an inspiration to us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S61-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BUILDING DEDICATION AT BAY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise in honor of Bay \nCollege in Escanaba, Michigan. This innovative educational institution \nis excited to celebrate the dedication of its new University Center. \nThe completion of this new building will provide many exciting \nopportunities for students and the college.\n  In addition to expanding higher education access to bachelor and \nmaster degree programs for area citizens, the Joseph L. Heriman \nUniversity Center houses eight new computer classrooms/labs in its \nstudent Computing Center; a net of nine new classrooms which include \nthe computer classrooms, three business classrooms, an interactive \ntelevision (ITV) classroom and one mobile ITV for distance education. \nThe Center also provides accommodations for industrial training and \ntechnology transfer, customized training for technical skills upgrade \nand professional development seminars and workshops.\n  The opening of this building will bring many benefits to the college \nand the local community. Again, I would like to congratulate Bay \nCollege and commend its administration, faculty and students on their \nefforts. Also, I would like to wish the college the brightest of \nfutures as they enter this exciting period in their history.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S61-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S62]]\n                    RETIREMENT OF MR. JOHN L. SMITH\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on February 27, 1998, the state of \nIllinois and our nation will lose a valuable public servant. After 23 \nyears as the Director of the United States Small Business \nAdministration's (SBA) Chicago District Office, John L. Smith is \nretiring. It is my honor to commend him on a distinguished career of \nservice to our nation.\n  Mr. Smith began a 47-year public service career in 1951 with a 4 year \nstint in the United States Navy. Following his discharge, Mr. Smith \nattended the Robert Morris School in his hometown of Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania where he received a degree in Business Administration.\n  In 1967, Mr. Smith began working in the civil service with the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce's Economic Development Administration where he \nworked as a loan specialist in several assignments throughout the East \nCoast. Prior to that, Mr. Smith had been the Director of Financial \nAssistance for the Business and Job Development Corporation in \nPittsburgh.\n  In 1973, Mr. Smith came to Chicago to serve as the Regional \nAdministrator for the Commerce Department's Office of Minority Business \nEnterprise. In that position, Mr. Smith admirably directed activities \nin 10 states and managed over $5 million in grant and contract funds.\n  In 1975, Mr. Smith began his long tenure as Director of the SBA's \nChicago District Office. Over the past 23 years, he has managed the \nChicago Office and a smaller branch office in Springfield. \nAdditionally, he has been responsible for overseeing both offices' SBA \nloans, management assistance, government contracting, and advocacy \nprograms for small businesses across Illinois. On his watch, small \nbusinesses in Illinois have received several billion dollars worth of \nloans and federal contracts.\n  In addition to his professional successes, Mr. Smith and his wife \nhave raised four adult children. John L. Smith has also worked to \nbetter his community and our nation through volunteering his time and \nabilities to organizations such as the American Heart Association, the \nBoy Scouts of America, the Kiwanis Club and the United Fund.\n  Without a doubt, the citizens and the economy of the state of \nIllinois have benefitted greatly from John L. Smith's able and \ndedicated leadership. He leaves behind a strong and proud record of \naccomplishment at the Small Business Administration, as well as a \nremarkable career of government service. I wish him good luck and God's \nspeed in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S62-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO DON TIBBETTS\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Don \nTibbetts, ``Dean of the New Hampshire State House Press Corps'' who \nrecently retired after 24 years of news reporting on national and state \npolitics for the Union Leader and the New Hampshire Sunday News.\n  Don has witnessed many historical events over his career, from the \nthrill of the first in the nation presidential primary to the comings \nand goings of countless Governors. He has endured seemingly endless \nhearings and press conferences, yet has reported on each of them with \nstyle, substance, and integrity.\n  In a state where people take their politics very seriously, Don was \nable to give the people of New Hampshire their daily diet of important \nfacts about the events, votes, meetings, and rulings that impact their \nlives. What is remarkable about Don in this time of editorial \njournalism is the way Don gave his loyal readers the facts in an \nunbiased way and let them make their own judgments.\n  In the State House, Don was constantly on the lookout for news, \nchurning out several stories each day. His ``Under the State House \nDome'' column was a must read for anyone who wanted to be informed \nabout the latest yet to break news and information about politics in \nNew Hampshire.\n  Although Don is a lifelong member of the Fourth Estate, which often \nhas a skeptical or even adversarial stance toward government officials, \nhe always went the extra mile to listen to both sides of the story and \nreflect these views in his stories.\n  The only time he did not play it down the middle was when he was on \nthe golf course, where he has been known to hit an occasional errant \nshot.\n  As someone who Don has covered for many years, I will miss him, and I \nknow that his colleagues at the Union Leader and in the press corps \nwill miss him too. The real questions is if Don will miss any of us. I \nwish both Don and Jane the best of luck in their future endeavors.\n  Those of us in government will greatly miss his reputation as an \nhonest broker of the facts, a perceptive historian and judge of people, \nand for helping to keep the job of governing enjoyable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S62-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN HONOR OF THE PALMIERIS' FIFTIETH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to call to your \nattention a most momentous and joyful occasion. Theresa and Joseph \nPalmieri of Brooklyn, New York will celebrate their fiftieth wedding \nanniversary on January 31, 1998.\n  Theresa and Joseph were wed at Saint Rosalie Catholic Church in \nBrooklyn, New York on January 31, 1948. The couple was introduced at a \n``Welcome Home'' for Joseph after his return from service during World \nWar II. Living and working on Long Island, New York for the past \nthirty-five years, the Palmieri family includes daughters Jo Ann and \nTheresa, sons Paul and Joseph, and seven grandchildren.\n  In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see \ntheir union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death \ndo us part . . .'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and the entire \nPalmieri family in recognizing the wonderful sense of achievement and \nhappiness that marks the golden wedding anniversary of Joseph and \nTheresa Palmieri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S62-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE TYRE LODGE MASONIC TEMPLE OF COLDWATER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nTyre Lodge Masonic Temple in Coldwater, Michigan. On January 17, the \nlodge celebrated its 150th anniversary. To put this in perspective, \nthis lodge was issued its charter 15 years before President Abraham \nLincoln delivered the historic Gettysburg Address.\n  The Tyre Lodge has been a pillar of its community for many years. \nVolunteering their time, efforts and talents into an organization, \nMasons have consistently provided invaluable services to their \ncommunity. The members of the lodge have always searched for new ways \nto provide opportunities for their fellow members and citizens of their \nlocal community. This strong commitment to helping other individuals is \noutstanding, and I commend each member of the association for all their \ntireless efforts.\n  On February 7, the lodge will be hosting a dinner and program to \ncelebrate this achievement, and I would like to express my warmest \nwishes for a successful evening. Again, I would like to thank the \nmembers of the lodge for their dutiful dedication to the Coldwater \ncommunity, and wish them the brightest of futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S62-4", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S62-S63]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARSHALL FLOYD\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and \npay tribute to a teacher in New Mexico who is an excellent example of \nservice and commitment to education and the students of Albuquerque, \nNew Mexico.\n  Marshall Floyd has been a teacher at Highland High School since 1953, \na member of numerous educational related boards, and has received a \nwide variety of educational honors, including being the recipient of \nthe Outstanding Biology Teacher of New Mexico by the National \nAssociation of Biology Teachers in 1974 and receiving the Science \nTeacher of the Year Citation from the New Mexico Science Teachers \nAssociation in 1981.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nHouse of Representatives on passage of S.1564, ``The Holocaust Victims \nRedress Act.''\n  The bill was passed by the Senate on November 13, 1997 and was \nreferred back to the House where it was originally introduced by my \ncolleagues, the Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Jim \nLeach, and Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, \nRep. Ben Gilman. I am very pleased that we have been able to work \ntogether to pass this important legislation enabling the correction of \na horrible injustice after the war. Now, needy survivors can obtain \nsome measure of justice and dignity.\n  Mr. President, this important bill contains two main provisions. \nFirst, the bill authorizes $25 million for a U.S. donation to the fund \nestablished by the United States and the United Kingdom at the London \nConference on Nazi Gold in December. Second, the bill authorizes $5 \nmillion for research into the issue and translation of foreign language \ndocuments coming from this effort. The Administration has been fully \nsupportive of this effort. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, \nparticularly, has played a vital role in this effort and without him we \nwould not be where we are today on the issue.\n  Regarding the $5 million authorized in the bill for research, it is \nmy strong belief that the management of these funds should be granted \nto the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This museum is the one \norganization uniquely capable of conducting research like this, \nresearch that is a core function of its mission. The Museum, I might \nadd, has been an invaluable aid to the Banking Committee during our on-\ngoing inquiry into the disposition of Holocaust-era assets by Swiss \nbanks from before, during and after the Holocaust. Accordingly, I can \nthink of no better group to manage the research funding from this bill \nthan the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank my colleagues for their help in \nobtaining passage for this important bill. If we are going to try to \nobtain justice for victims of the Holocaust. While much more needs to \nbe done on this issue, this is an important measure in this long \noverdue effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S63-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S63]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHILD SUPPORT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry) has been added as a cosponsor to S. 1293, the Child Support \nPerformance Improvement Act. Senator Snowe and I introduced this \nlegislation last year to call for critical ways to strengthen child \nsupport enforcement, including an effort to address the critical need \nfor medical support among children with absent parents.\n  It is an honor to have Senator Kerry, a long-time child advocate and \nleader, join Senator Snowe and me in our effort to promote effective \nand efficient child support enforcement. Senator Kerry's commitment to \nthis issue is well known, and he has been aggressive pushing for action \nthrough previous legislation.\n  Today, we are joining forces to promote our bill, S. 1293, and to \nwork together on a new initiative to resolve the lingering barriers \nthat prevent enforcement of medical child support, a crucial aspect of \nsupport and stability for children and families. Senator Kerry's \nspecial commitment to medical support is clear. Working with him and \nother colleagues, we want to eliminate the barriers which hinder state \nagencies from effectively implementing the 1984 federal law that \nrequires states to petition for medical child support, if it is \navailable from non-custodial parents. Our law says children should not \nbe discriminated against in health care coverage in cases of divorce, \nbut we need to work together to ensure that this obvious principle \nworks in practice. Public health coverage, through Medicaid or the new \nchildren's health initiative, should not be a substitute for private \ninsurance from parents when such insurance is available. We hope to \nensure that children get coverage they need and deserve.\n  To achieve our goals, we want to work with congressional colleagues, \nchild advocates, state leaders, interested business groups and the \nAdministration to ensure that we forge consensus on ways to tear down \nexisting barriers to health care coverage that is fair and streamlined.\n  The technical nature of this issue is complicated. But the reality \nfor children and families is clear--medical coverage means that parents \nhave the peace of mind that their children can obtain the health care \nthat is so vital for a healthy, successful childhood. I welcome Senator \nKerry's support and urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia as a cosponsor of this very important child \nsupport legislation. He has long been a leader on these issues and I am \ndelighted to work with him to ensure that children get the support they \nneed and deserve. I particularly look forward to working together to \npass medical enforcement legislation. At least 700,000 children \nnationwide have a health insurance order through an ERISA-protected \nplan where the noncustodial parent fails to provide the required \ncoverage. Providing an efficient, effective way for child support \nagencies to enforce the requirement for medical child support coverage \nthrough ERISA-protected plans would result in more children with \nprivate health insurance and reduced public costs for medical coverage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S63-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S63]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNITION OF ZION GROVE MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. BOND.

KEARNEY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I with to recognize and mourn \na loss for the working men and women of this country.\n  On Friday, January 2d, 1998, Mr. Daniel J. Kearney of Cohasset, \nMassachusetts, passed away. On that day the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts and the United States of America lost an individual who \nembodied and protected the most cherished principles of this nation.\n  From his military service to his fervent support of the labor \nmovement, Mr. Kearney led a quintessentially American life, one that \ncontained family and sacrifice, struggle and victory. He married the \nlate Mary A. MacGrath, and together they raised daughters Gail and \nLinda. His distinguished service in the U.S. Navy spanned the period \nfrom World War II through Korea, and he maintained this commitment to \nhis nation through leadership and service in the Veterans of Foreign \nWars and the American Legion.\n  Mr. Kearney began his long career in the labor community as an \napprentice blacksmith at the Boston Naval Yard in 1946, where he \ngraduated from the Boston Naval Shipyard Apprentice School. In 1952, he \nserved as a program\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\nengineer for the Navy, and this resulted in his becoming a contract \nnegotiator for shipbuilding in 1956. In this position, Mr. Kearney \nworked on the construction and conversion of nuclear attack and \nballistic missile submarines, helping navigate our nation's defense \nthrough a historic and complex transition.\n  His largest contribution to this country, however, was his relentless \nand passionate advocacy on behalf of working men and women, and his \nearly posts in the Navy yards of Massachusetts were the origin of his \nlife-long campaign for organized labor.\n  He went on to organize, and to serve as a union officer and local \npresident of, various American Federation of Government Employees \nlocals, lead the Philadelphia Council of the AFGE and serve as \nPresident of the Massachusetts State Council of Locals. He served as \nNational Vice President of the AFGE, and later as Vice President \nEmeritus of AFGE's New England District.\n  Dan Kearney's faith in the electoral processes of this country, both \nlocal and national, was another passion. Beginning back when John F. \nKennedy was first elected to Congress, and continuing through Senator \nEdward Kennedy's re-election in 1994 and my own re-election in 1996, \nMr. Kearney was a welcome fixture in the Democratic campaigns of \nMassachusetts. For him, coordination of grass roots politics was \nanother tool to help people improve their lives, and he gave it his \nall.\n  In later years, the issues facing senior Americans became his \ncampaign, and his sincere advocacy of fairness and decency resulted in \nan appointment to the White House Council on Aging. As recently as \nseveral weeks ago, he dropped by my Boston office with thoughts on \nissues facing seniors, retired government employees, and the labor \nmovement as a whole.\n  He leaves a loving family and many friends, and he leaves the world \nbetter for his efforts. As we celebrate his life, we offer our \ncondolences and sympathy to all who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S63-4", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S64]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA WHITE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nVirginia White, a public servant of outstanding integrity and honesty, \nwho is retiring after 25 years of service to her community. On January \n31, Virginia will end her tenure as Meridian Township Clerk.\n  In 1972, Virginia was first elected as Township Clerk on the promise \nto improve her community. Not only did she fulfill her pledge, but she \nbegan a long, meritorious career serving the people of Meridian \nTownship. During her time as clerk, she established a reputation for \nhard work and dedication to serving her community. While a clerk, \nVirginia's dedication to Meridian Township was unsurpassed and she \nmaintained the greatest of commitments to public service. Mr. \nPresident, Virginia White is one of few individuals I can think of who \ntruly embodies the ideals and principles that define the term ``public \nservant.''\n  Virginia's desire to better her community reached far beyond Meridian \nTownship. When she co-founded the Michigan Association of Clerks, a \nnetwork was formed which brought city and township clerks across the \nState of Michigan together. Additionally, in an effort to create better \nsystems of local governance, she wrote a national manual on conducting \nelections. Together, these efforts reflect Virginia's longstanding \npursuit to provide her municipality with the best possible clerk. I am \nproud to say she accomplished this goal with great distinction. \nAlthough Virginia will be greatly missed, I know she is looking forward \nto a well-deserved retirement. I join her family, friends, and \ncolleagues in wishing her all the best with her new endeavors and a \nbright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S64-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S64]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO RETIRED MAYOR BETTY JO RHEA\n\n   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \none of South Carolina's leading ladies, Betty Jo Rhea. Betty Jo retired \nas Mayor of Rock Hill, South Carolina on January 20. With her \nretirement, my state loses one of its most beloved politicians and \nprogressive leaders.\n  Betty Jo Rhea began her career of public service over 25 years ago, \nwhen she was appointed to the Rock Hill Parks and Recreation \nCommission. She was elected to the Rock Hill City Council in 1977, and \nhas spent the last 20 years in the thick of her city's political fray.\n  In 1986, Rhea became Rock Hill's first woman Mayor. When she retired \nin January after 12 years in the office, she also was one of the city's \nlongest serving and most popular mayors. During her tenure, Betty Jo \nfocused her prodigious energies on attracting jobs to the region and \npreventing economic collapse in the wake of the closing of the textile \nmills that had underpinned Rock Hill's economy.\n  She has been incredibly successful. Not only did she help prevent a \nsevere recession, she led Rock Hill in an economic rejuvenation. Under \nher leadership, the city built three business parks to attract large \nindustries, began a downtown revitalization and preservation program, \nand started a successful recycling program in cooperation with Rock \nHill Clean and Green.\n  But Betty Jo didn't stop there. She also went abroad to promote Rock \nHill, serving as the region's most successful ambassador. She was \nPresident of the Municipal Association of South Carolina, on the board \nof the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and active in the National League of \nCities.\n  In recognition of her achievements and dedication to her community, \nthe Municipal Association of South Carolina awarded Rhea the Allison \nFarlow Award, its highest honor. And in appreciation of her support for \nrecycling, conservation, and greenery programs, Rock Hill Clean and \nGreen created the Rock Hill Environmental Action (RHEA) award, named in \nher honor. For Rhea's contributions to the community, Winthrop \nUniversity bestowed on her an honorary doctorate.\n  As Betty Jo's friends and admirers know, her greatest attributes are \nher sunny disposition, charm, and complete devotion and loyalty to Rock \nHill and its people. Of course, these qualities haven't hurt her in \npolitics, either. They have won her many friends and allies; and no \ndoubt her success as Mayor has been aided by her habit of baking \nhomemade bread for City Council members at Christmas.\n  Fortunately for South Carolina, Betty Jo Rhea's retirement from her \nduties as Mayor is not a retirement from public life and community \nservice. She is set to begin her new career as head of a fund-raising \ncampaign for the arts, and she plans to volunteer with the Salvation \nArmy. Rhea's days of ribbon-cutting are over, but the people of Rock \nHill can look forward to many more years of her wise counsel and \nprogressive leadership.\n  Mr. President, I salute Betty Jo Rhea. She exemplifies all the \nvirtues of citizenship and political leadership. She has pursued \npolitics not out of egotism, but rather from the sincere desire to help \nher neighbors and strengthen her community. Thanks to her leadership, \nRock Hill has not only weathered economic hardship, it has ridden the \nstorm to ever-rising economic heights.\n  As one of her many fans remarked upon her retirement, Betty Jo Rhea \ntruly was ``a people's mayor.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S64-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S64-S65]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF REPRESENTATIVE BONNIE SUE COOPER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Missouri \nState Representative Bonnie Sue Cooper for her outstanding \ncontributions to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). As \nlast year's Chairwoman, Bonnie Sue set a new leadership standard that \nwill be a challenge for all future Chairpersons.\n  ALEC is the largest bipartisan, individual membership association of \nstate legislators in the country. After serving as Vice-Chairwoman for \ntwo years, Bonnie Sue was voted Chairwoman for the 1997 term. According \nto Arkansas Speaker of the House Bobby Hogue, ``In the year Bonnie Sue \nhas been Chairman there has been progress on every front at ALEC. It \nhas strengthened its policy making operations and raised its profile \namong both legislators and the private sector.'' Speaker Hogue replaced \nBonnie Sue as Chairman.\n  Bonnie Sue has been an incredible leader, not only in the State of \nMissouri, but also at a National level. I enjoy seeing leadership of \nBonnie Sue's caliber and know that there are only\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\nbigger things to come for her. I congratulate Representative Cooper on \nanother outstanding year and wish her success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S64-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S65-S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we continue to see positive signs \nreflecting the strength of our national economy. Thirty-year mortgage \nrates remain low, consumer confidence is high and unemployment is down.\n  In the midst of these sustained positive trends, America faces new \nchallenges as we approach a new century. Among them: meeting a critical \nneed for skilled technology workers and the continuing effort to move \nmore Americans from welfare to work.\n  We are an innovative people and I'm confident that we can meet new \nchallenges, in part via public-private partnerships. One of the key \npeople in America advancing the concept of public-private partnerships \nis Mr. Greg Farmer. As Florida's Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Farmer \npioneered public-private partnerships at the state level, doing more \nwith less tax dollars.\n  Now in the private sector, with Nortel, Mr. Farmer and his company \nare helping provide high-tech equipment to schools and technology \ntraining to help move people from welfare to work. On January 13, 1998, \nMr. Farmer testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \nResources. I commend his testimony to my colleagues and all those \ninterested in public-private partnerships as a means of reducing \nwelfare dependency and advancing job training. I respectfully ask that \nhis testimony be printed in the Record:\n  The testimony follows:\n\n  Statement of Greg Farmer, Vice President, Government Relations and \n                      International Trade, Nortel\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. My name is Greg \n     Farmer, and I am Vice President for Government Affairs and \n     International Trade for Nortel (Northern Telecom). It gives \n     me pleasure to be with you this morning to discuss some of \n     the things Nortel is doing in the Washington, D.C. area to \n     help prepare inner city youth for a fruitful life beyond high \n     school, whether it be college or acquiring a special skill.\n       Bell Atlantic is a household word and all of you are \n     certainly familiar with it. You might not be as well \n     acquainted with Nortel (even though--and I hesitate to say \n     this in case you had a telephone problem this morning--the \n     Senate does have our telephone switch). Nortel is the leading \n     global supplier of fully digital network solutions and \n     services. We design, build and integrate digital networks \n     that communicate voice, data, image and video for customers \n     in the information, communications, entertainment, education, \n     government and commerce markets. Our customers are local and \n     long distance telecommunications companies, businesses, \n     universities, governments, cable television companies, \n     competitive local access providers, Internet services \n     providers and other network operators around the world. We \n     operate in 150 countries around the globe. We have more \n     employees in the U.S. than anywhere else. Here, we are based \n     in Nashville, Tennessee and have major state-of-the-art \n     centers--including research and development, manufacturing, \n     semiconductor and software-engineering facilities--in nine \n     other states. And we have sales and services offices in every \n     state of the union. We count Bell Atlantic as a good \n     customer, and I am pleased to be on the panel today with my \n     friend Bill Freeman.\n       Yesterday the Administration announced a massive public-\n     private effort aimed at high tech training. This was in \n     response to concerns by economists and business leaders that \n     U.S. companies have a critical shortage of skilled technology \n     workers. The initiative, which will include millions of \n     dollars in grants to fund educational programs, comes as a \n     new survey shows that 1 in every 10 information technology \n     jobs in the U.S. is unfulfilled.\n       This comes as no surprise to Nortel. As with other \n     telecommunications companies, education and workforce \n     development is an essential part of Nortel's overall business \n     strategy. Our industry requires highly skilled workers at \n     even the most basic entry level positions. We are constantly \n     looking for opportunities to work with organizations that \n     provide training and enhance our workforce.\n       The Administration ought to take a good look at Capital \n     Commitment. It is a stellar example of a high tech training \n     program that works. It is a shiny gem; a diamond in a rusty \n     crown. And I hope some of those grants will go to Capital \n     Commitment so it can continue the incredible success it has \n     enjoyed in the past.\n       One only need hear the Ricky Mozee story to understand the \n     cascading good this program has for individuals and for our \n     community. Ricky Mozee is a walking, talking welfare-to-work \n     success story. Before finding Capital Commitment in 1992, \n     Ricky was a drug and alcohol abuser, living on welfare in the \n     tough streets of Anacostia. In his own words, he had no \n     future; his family had no future; he was afraid to dream. He \n     was fighting his addictions and looking at an 84 percent \n     unemployment rate in his community. Then he found Capital \n     Commitment. Today, he has a high paying job as a \n     telecommunications supervisor at National Airport. He owns a \n     house in suburban Maryland. He supports a wife and three \n     children. He is a poster boy for what the future could be, if \n     we get it right.\n       When LaVerne and Ernest Boykin established Capital \n     Commitment in 1991, their vision to train inner city youth in \n     telecommunications and life skills and to facilitate job \n     opportunities for them resonated well with our corporate \n     goals. Since that time, Nortel has been actively involved \n     with Capital Commitment. We have observed a dramatic increase \n     in employment opportunities for the unemployed, under-\n     employed, at risk youth and single parents from the District \n     of Columbia. As a result, we have also observed a significant \n     shift of money from public assistance to taxable income.\n       In those early days, we worked with the Capital Commitment \n     management team to identify factors critical for their \n     success and discovered their needs went far beyond financial \n     support.\n       Nortel's support of Capital Commitment since its inception \n     includes:\n       Providing well over $1 million in funding, equipment and \n     personnel resources (switches, computers and state-of-the-art \n     office equipment as well as technical expertise, training \n     materials);\n       Providing management advice and coaching;\n       Taking the lead in turning Capital Commitment into an \n     industry sponsored organization;\n       Establishing a fundraising golf tournament;\n       Working to replicate Capital Commitment in California & \n     Texas;\n       Serving on Capital Commitment's Board (Stuart Mapes, \n     Nortel's National Director of Minority and Women Business \n     Program).\n       In addition, I am pleased to announce today that Nortel \n     will donate and install a new Nortel Central Office Switch to \n     be used for advanced training.\n       We have also worked with Bell Atlantic and other private \n     companies to expand corporate funding of the program. I might \n     add here that one of the most telling successes of this \n     program is the fact that Nortel and other corporate sponsors \n     of Capital Commitment have been diligent in working \n     cooperatively. We work with our customers, such as Bell \n     Atlantic, MCI and Sprint, but also with our competitors, such \n     as Seimens and Lucent, in promoting this program. There is \n     something in it for each of us. Not only does it make us \n     sleep a little easier at night to know that we are being good \n     corporate citizens and helping disadvantaged youth become a \n     part of this dynamic industry; but also, in a cold business \n     sense, we are receiving great benefits too.\n       Nortel and the telecommunications industry in general are \n     in constant need of highly qualified technical employees. \n     Capital Commitment graduates students who are highly trained \n     in these skills. We have hired over 100 Capital Commitment \n     graduates who have proven to be well trained, competent and \n     reliable employees. As a matter of fact, Capital Commitment \n     graduates have a 90+ percent placement rate and an impressive \n     80+ percent retention rate! This welfare-to-work program \n     really works.\n       There is another aspect to this program which is missing \n     from other traditional welfare-to-work programs. The Boykins \n     teach their students critical lifeskills and stress to their \n     students the importance of ``paying back'' their communities. \n     Many of their graduates return to Capital Commitment to help \n     instruct students, or pay back their communities by being \n     role models for others. So the legacy of Capital Commitment \n     lives on in their graduates and provides long term benefits \n     to the community.\n       I am committed to spreading the word about Capital \n     Commitment. I have personally taken numerous Administration \n     officials through the program. I found that a tour of Capital \n     Commitment makes believers out of all who go there. My goal \n     is to find sources of federal, state and local funding to \n     help this incredible program expand. I would encourage each \n     of you to take time from your very busy schedules to visit \n     Capital Commitment, which is located a few short miles from \n     here. There is nothing any of us can say to you today that \n     will have the impact a personal visit will have. It will, I \n     know, be time well spent.\n       We at Nortel believe very strongly that Capital Commitment \n     is an important and solid example of how business can work \n     within the community to provide increased opportunity for \n     movement from welfare-to-work in highly paid, career oriented \n     jobs in a high growth industry. The need for skilled \n     technicians to enter this industry is growing rapidly so it \n     is incumbent upon us to accelerate efforts to assure \n     continued progress for this important program. Capital \n     Commitment provides opportunities for our most disadvantaged \n     citizens to become productive, well paid workers in this \n     dynamic industry.\n       Having said all of this, there is trouble in paradise. \n     Capital Commitment is a shiny gem but it sits in a rusty \n     crown, badly in need of attention by our policy makers.\n       We at Nortel believe that corporate-community partnerships \n     are the key to educating and gainfully employing a greater \n     number of high skilled workers. However, there\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\n     is a third critically important partner needed in these job \n     training programs if they are to be successful: the \n     government.\n       I worry that Capital Commitment might not be able to \n     continue because it is lacking financial support of any kind \n     by the government.\n       It is the government's role to encourage programs which \n     take people who are on welfare and turn them into gainfully \n     employed, responsible citizens who pay taxes and otherwise \n     contribute to their community. This is what Capital \n     Commitment does so well. And the corporate community by all \n     accounts has been extremely generous with financial and other \n     resources to help them achieve this goal. The corporate \n     community benefits from the program; we strongly support the \n     program. And while the Government also has much to gain from \n     these efforts, there has been little effort by the government \n     to encourage this activity.\n       Capital Commitment is a victim of its own success. Ernest \n     and LaVerne Boykin triumphed in setting up a high quality \n     welfare-to-work program that actually works. It takes people \n     off of welfare and helps them get jobs in a growing industry.\n       Capital Commitment is a public-private partnership without \n     the public. The government has simply not done its part in \n     encouraging this most successful program.\n       In my previous two stints at public service, I learned \n     first-hand the benefits of converting traditional \n     governmental functions into public-private partnership.\n       As Florida's Commerce Secretary I converted several \n     functions within the department to public-private \n     partnerships, including film and motion picture promotion, \n     sports promotion and tourism promotion. Finally the economic \n     development function was converted to a public-private \n     partnership (Enterprise Florida), completely eliminating the \n     Department of Commerce, which might appeal to some of you.\n       As U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism, \n     I convened the first-ever White House Conference on Tourism \n     charged with planning strategy for the industry for the next \n     five years. The number one recommendation was that the agency \n     be converted to a public-private partnership.\n       The reason is that a public-private partnership leverages \n     maximum resources in the most positive way possible. It \n     achieves the public purpose the government wants to achieve; \n     it brings the discipline of business to the operation; it \n     provides accountability; it is cost effective by nature \n     because business simply will not be a part of something which \n     is not effective. History shows public-private partnerships \n     are almost always more effective in terms of achievement and \n     cost than government working alone.\n       As an aside, you may all be aware that there is an effort \n     underway in D.C. to revive a plan endorsed by the White House \n     to create a National Capital Revitalization Corporation, a \n     separate legal entity that would oversee development \n     activities in struggling commercial areas across the city. \n     The corporation, a public-private partnership, would be \n     charged with drafting a strategic economic development plan \n     for the city and would have the power to acquire property, \n     issue bonds and conduct other activities which would ensure \n     economic growth happens.\n       I endorse this plan because I believe there is no where \n     else in this country that needs a public-private effort to \n     revitalize the economy more than the District of Columbia.\n       Capital Commitment would fit well into this new economic \n     plan. But what we have with Capitol Commitment now is a \n     public-private partnership in which the public has not been \n     present. The results have a tremendous public return. Over \n     500 former welfare recipients now are earning high wages, \n     paying taxes and contributing to the economic development of \n     their communities. A proven success record. Yet there has \n     been precious little government investment and apparently no \n     realization of the value this program has in achieving a \n     critical government goal.\n       Before I conclude, let me briefly tell you about some of \n     our other efforts to be helpful in D.C.\n       Nortel recognizes that computer-based learning is crucial \n     in preparing our students for the 21st Century. So, 18 months \n     ago, we began a program to assist the D.C. school system. We \n     began by providing computers to Burrville Elementary and Hine \n     Junior High School. Nortel also provided the expertise and \n     training necessary to ensure the computers were operable and \n     the teachers knew how to instruct the children. Access to the \n     Internet was an essential ingredient. The computers were most \n     successful at Burrville and Hine, well run schools with \n     excellent teachers and children eager to learn. However, we \n     soon learned that much more needed to be done.\n       To respond to this need, we assembled a coalition of \n     federal and city government officials and private \n     corporations aimed at providing inner city D.C. schools with \n     computers, software and Internet access. We met to discuss \n     how, working together, we could provide on an ongoing basis, \n     computers, access to the Internet, software and technical \n     support to inner city schools. It soon became apparent, \n     however, that there was no accounting system for tracking \n     what the D.C. schools presently have or what they need. So we \n     had to start from scratch. Before we could be truly helpful, \n     we first needed to get a handle on what the D.C. school \n     system already had, what was working and what was not and \n     exactly what was needed. A more structured organization was \n     required.\n       This led to the creation of Partners in Technology (PIT), a \n     non-profit foundation established to foster technology-based \n     public-private partnerships in the D.C. school system. I am \n     pleased to serve as Chairman of the Board of PIT.\n       The goal of PIT is to improve the quality of education in \n     our local educational institutions by increasing the level \n     and maximizing the impact of community investments made by \n     the private sector. We learned from experience that to be \n     most effective takes more than just donating equipment.\n       PIT is funded by corporate charter members and is seeking \n     matching funding for programs and operations from private, \n     public and federal sources.\n       Although in its infancy, PIT--in partnership with the \n     District Branch of Tech Corps--has already initiated:\n       Researching and developing plans for an ``acceptable'' \n     standard work station/computer that will meet the overall \n     education needs of the student. This includes working closely \n     with the D.C. Public Schools in providing assistance and \n     consultation on strategic planning and inventory management. \n     For instance, PIT is in discussions with DC Tech Corps in \n     looking at ways to develop effective technology training \n     programs for the faculty. PIT understands it cannot be \n     effective unless we have trained educators that can and want \n     to teach students how to use the tools of technology in order \n     to enhance their education.\n       Establishing a pilot project which is being tested to allow \n     schools to turn over obsolete computer equipment for a credit \n     by a computer remanufacturer. This credit may be used to \n     purchase state-of-the-art equipment and comprehensive \n     computer training for teachers. In addition, local non-profit \n     remanufacturers have expressed an interest in working to \n     provide repair training and intern opportunities for D.C. \n     students in the schools and at their facilities.\n       Coordinating the establishment of a computer program within \n     the D.C. public schools which will establish student clubs \n     with faculty-adult supervision.\n       These are just a few of the activities already undertaken \n     by PIT. High on our list is to assist the D.C. Public Schools \n     in compiling an accurate inventory of all computer/phone \n     equipment and systems. This will include an inventory of each \n     school's human and corporate resources. This is a critical \n     step in providing the necessary information for intelligent \n     and effective planning.\n       We plan to be more active as we develop and believe we can \n     become a highly effective link for the D.C. public schools. \n     We want to ensure that D.C. has the computer equipment they \n     need and the teachers have the resources they need to ensure \n     proper operation of the equipment, access to the super \n     highway and training so D.C. students are assured of having a \n     good, solid education which will prepare them for a good \n     future.\n       We have coupled our efforts with Capital Commitment and \n     PIT. Capital Commitment has arranged office space for PIT in \n     its facility, and we have provided computers for both \n     organizations to enhance their effectiveness.\n       Again, thank you for allowing me to present to you this \n     morning to discuss these two important programs, both of \n     which could be easily transported to other parts of the \n     country where there is also critical need.\n       We encourage other corporations to join us in ensuring that \n     organizations like Capital Commitment and PIT are securely \n     funded. And we would also encourage our policy makers to take \n     a careful look at programs like these for government funding. \n     These are programs where a little bit of funding can go a \n     very long way in enhancing economic development to the \n     betterment of all citizens.\n       We need to provide the shiny gem that is Capital Commitment \n     with a gleaming crown so it can beacon far and wide to others \n     who can copy this program and get into the business of \n     turning lives around.\n       I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S65-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S66-S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BRUCE AND KATHY CONTWAY\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend two Montana \nartists for their dedication and talent.\n  In the West, we are accustomed to western art whether in the form of \na Charlie Russell painting or a Frederick Remington bronze. But today I \nwould like to recognize the future of Western bronze sculpture art \ndefining our nation's roots and the hardy souls who lived off the land \nand gave us the rich history that will always be a part of our nation's \nbeginning.\n  Bruce and Kathy Contway of Whitehall, Montana, have helped to \npreserve that history as well as to find their own place in history as \nAmerican artists. These two artists are becoming well-known \ninternationally for their abilities and their works celebrating a \ncolorful Native American and Old West past. Their art has helped to \nmake accessible to all of us the distinctive culture and customs of \nthis nation's first inhabitants.\n  The Contways, have certainly earned the honors they have received. \nTheir dedication and hard work were recently rewarded when they each \nreceived the admiration of their peers and fans alike.\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n  1997 was a year of recognition for the Contways. Bruce was named the \nIndian Arts and Crafts Association (IACA) Artist of the Year and was \nalso awarded the steer wrestling and bareback riding bronze commissions \nduring the 1997 Calgary Stampede Trophy Bronze Competition. Kathy was \nawarded the envy of all artists participating in the Stampede \ncompetition--the Chuckwagon Race Outriders bronze. Mr. President, \nbronze artists everywhere understand the significance of these honors.\n  The work of Bruce and Kathy indicates a strong pride in their Native \nAmerican heritage. Their remarkable talent combined with modest self-\nrecognition is an inspiration to young artists across our country. And \ntheir desire to pass on their legacy and pride is a tribute to all \nMontanans.\n  Among their peers, Bruce and Kathy are considered world-class \nartists. Among their neighbors, Bruce and Kathy are considered friends. \nThe Contways are very involved in the local community. Accomplished \nhigh school and college rodeo stars, they enjoy working with local \nstudents in the high school's rodeo club.\n  Last December, the front page headline of the Whitehall Ledger read, \n`Contway art ``Stampedes'' to great year'. The article was a fitting \ntribute to two of Montana's best. Artists with this kind of talent are \ndifficult to find, and you can bet that a Contway bronze will be a \ntreasured work of art on any lucky owner's mantel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S66-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE CONGRESS-BUNDESTAG EXCHANGE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States \nCongress and the German Parliament have conducted an annual exchange \nprogram for senior staff members from both countries. The program gives \nprofessional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about each \nother's political institutions and convey Members' views on issues of \nmutual concern. The program is now in its 15th year and has strong \nsupport and participation from federal agencies as well as \ncorresponding support from the German government.\n  A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be chosen to \nvisit Germany March 22 to April 4 of this year. During the two week \nexchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, \nBundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous \npolitical, business, academic, and media agencies. Cultural activities \nand a weekend visit in a Bundestag Member's district will complete the \nschedule.\n  A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United \nStates for three weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings \nhere in Washington and visit the districts of Congressional Members.\n  The Congress-Bundestag Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is \none of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private \ninstitutions in the United States and Germany to foster better \nunderstanding of the politics and policies of both countries. The \nongoing situation in Bosnia, the future expansion of NATO and the \nproposed expansion of the European Union, as well as plans for a single \ncurrency will make this year's exchange particularly relevant.\n  The U.S. delegation should consist of experienced and accomplished \nHill staff members who can contribute to the success of the exchange on \nboth sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag sends senior staff \nprofessionals to the United States.\n  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. \nApplicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, \nalthough such a background can be helpful. The composite U.S. \ndelegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual \nconcern in Germany and the United States such as, but not limited to, \ntrade, security, the environment, immigration, economic development, \nhealth care, and other social policy issues.\n  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to help plan and \nimplement the program for the Bundestag staff members when they visit \nthe United States. Participants are expected to assist in planning \ntopical meetings in Washington, and are encouraged to host one or two \nBundestag staffers in their Member's district over the July Fourth \nbreak, or to arrange for such a visit to another Member's district.\n  Participants will be selected by a committee composed of U.S. \nInformation Agency personnel and past participants of the exchange.\n  Senators and Representatives who would like a member of their staff \nto apply for participation in this year's program should direct them to \nsubmit a resume and cover letter in which they state why they believe \nthey are qualified and some assurances of their ability to participate \nduring the time stated. Applications may be sent to Kathie Scarrah, in \nmy office at 706 Hart Senate Building, by Thursday, February \n12.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S67-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE GALLATIN AMERICAN LEGION POST 17 SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a physician I have long advocated \nmaintaining a healthy lifestyle. I'm always amazed when individuals \nprove that exercise and eating right are simple requirements for \nremaining healthy and staying young at heart. The Gallatin American \nLegion Post 17 Softball team is just such a group that is having fun \nstaying healthy and exercising regularly.\n  This is no ordinary softball team, these ladies are sixty-years of \nage and older. This special team is comprised of women from all over \nmiddle Tennessee. The team was formed in 1994. They practice each \nMonday in Gallatin and in the winter they keep up their stamina by \nusing the Gallatin Sports Complex for their weekly softball practices. \nThat same year they participated in the State tournament and won. Since \nthen they are proud to be a force to reckon with on the Senior's \nSoftball circuit.\n  This past spring the team traveled to Tucson, Arizona to participate \nin the International Senior Olympic Games. The competition drew more \nthan 12,000 seniors over sixty-years-old from all over the world who \ncompeted in a variety of athletic events. The Gallatin American Legion \nPost 17 Softball team, with 13 players and two coaches, faced \ncompetition from nine teams across the United States and Canada. These \nladies played hard and their dedication and determination paid off when \nthey came home with the gold medal. They won each of the six games in \nwhich they played and outscored their Olympic competitors 122-10.\n  Since winning the International Olympics gold medal these women have \nnot rested on their laurels. They're back on the field practicing and \nplaying the game. Because of the increase in interest in women's \nsoftball for seniors, leagues have cropped up across the country, and \nthey gather for yearly tournaments. The ladies of Gallatin American \nLegion Post 17 maintain their busy schedule with practices and games to \ndefend their international title.\n  This newly developed enthusiasm for senior athletic groups is truly \ninspiring. These women serve as role models for younger generations and \nencourage participation from other seniors. They are living examples of \nthe happiness that seniors can find in exercising and maintaining a \nhealthy lifestyle. I want to congratulate the Gallatin American Legion \nPost 17 Softball team not only for winning the gold medal at the \nInternational Senior Citizen's Olympics but for also winning in the \ngame of life. These ladies are active and healthy, taking advantage of \ntheir older years rather than letting old age take care of them. I wish \nthem the best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S67-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S67-S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE AND THANKS TO AL ALM\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in just a few days, the Department \nof Energy will lose one of its best, most able and selfless public \nservants. Al Alm, Assistant Secretary for the Department of Energy's \nEnvironmental Management program, is leaving federal service on January \n31.\n  Al epitomizes the best in public service. Integrity and \nresponsibility are his hallmarks. He has left those marks throughout \nthe government, in academia, and in private industry. Al's government \nservice has included positions in the Atomic Energy Commission, the \nBureau of the Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, the\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and two stints in the Department of \nEnergy. He has been a tireless advocate for the programs in which he \nhas been involved, most notably for me, cleanup of our nation's most \npolluted former defense nuclear production sites.\n  I personally found Al to be the most accessible and helpful assistant \nsecretary in the administration. He worked closely with me, other \nmembers of the Washington congressional delegation, our staffs, and our \nconstituents to ensure Hanford's most important programs received \nadequate funding and support. Al's steadfast support for Hanford, in \nthe face of so many competing needs, has been outstanding. Whether it \nis safety, funding, expediting work, or employee concerns, he has been \nout in front. I will sorely miss Al.\n  Al has accomplished a lot in the 20 months in which he has served as \nthe leader of Environmental Management. He has led the charge in \nrevitalizing management and focusing energy on getting sites--and \nprograms--closed, or well on their way to closure, by 2006. The \nbillions of dollars and decades of time saved are extraordinary in \nthemselves, but the public health and environmental protection are the \nreal, tangible results of his efforts. He has helped us develop a goal \nand start moving toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, I want to say a big thank you to Al Alm on behalf of \nmyself and my Senate colleagues. We will miss him and his leadership of \na very difficult, complex and controversial program. We wish him all \nthe best in whatever endeavors he undertakes and hope he leaves knowing \nhow much we have appreciated his enthusiasm and hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S67-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF STEVEN MILLER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Steven \nMiller whose dedication to Missouri athletics has earned him a place in \nthe Missouri State Track and Cross Country Coaches Hall of Fame. For \nmore than 20 years Coach Miller has strived to make his Francis Howell \nHigh School team in St. Charles, Missouri one of the best.\n  Under Coach Miller's guidance, The Francis Howell track team has won \n22 out of 39 Conference titles and the Cross Country team has won 10 \nout of 18. Even more impressive are the individual accomplishments by \nhis former athletes. Coach Miller has coached one pole vaulter who \nproceeded to the 1996 Summer Olympics, a woman distance runner who \nbecame a two-time NCAA Division I All-American, more than 50 athletes \nwho have become coaches, 14 state champions and a girl's cross country \nteam who won the state championship in 1987.\n  High school athletics is an area that I believe helps to teach very \nimportant values to young people and it is always encouraging to learn \nof a coach with the drive and commitment to excellence shown by coach \nMiller. Coaches, athletes and parents at Francis Howell High School are \nfortunate to have such an inspirational role model and educator.\n  I congratulate Coach Miller for his hard work and success. \nAdditionally, I commend his undying energy throughout his many years of \ncoaching and wish him continued success at Francis Howell High \nSchool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S68-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WATO RADIO\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I would like to congratulate WATO \nradio in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for 50 years of radio broadcasting \nexcellence. WATO got its start in 1948 when it was commissioned by the \nDepartment of Energy (DOE), which in those days was known as the Atomic \nEnergy Commission.\n  WATO was the first radio station established on a military \nreservation. It was created as a service to the growing community that \nresulted with the establishment of the DOE Oak Ridge Reservation in the \nearly 1940's. Over the years, WATO has kept Oak Ridgers in touch with \nthe DOE and other government related entities. The station has also \nmade the community an important part of their programing, through its \ncoverage of local events. Whether it be educational activities, \nathletic events or providing the community with important service \nannouncements, WATO is very much involved in the Oak Ridge community.\n  Mr. President. WATO has become a familiar voice to area residents. \nTheir support of the Oak Ridge community and their close relationship \nwith DOE, the areas most prominent employer, have made WATO a vital \npart of the community. I commend the time and commitment that WATO has \ninvested over the past 50 years in their programing and their \nrelationship with the people of Oak Ridge. I wish them another 50 years \nof success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S68-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          1997 YEAR END REPORT\n\n  The mailing and filing date of the 1997 Year End Report required by \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended, is Saturday, January 31, \n1998.

Res. 166\n\n         \n       Whereas on August 14, 1959, a passion was born in the heart \n     of the Rocky Mountain Region that brought such memories as \n     ``Orange Crush,'' ``The Drive,'' ``The Fumble,'' ``The Three \n     Amigos,'' and 4 previous Super Bowl appearances;\n       Whereas the fans of the Denver Broncos are recognized \n     throughout the National Football League (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``NFL'') for their unconditional allegiance \n     to the team, contributing to 229 consecutive sold-out stadium \n     home games;\n       Whereas the Denver Broncos' organization assembled a \n     championship caliber coaching staff who created a \n     championship caliber team;\n       Whereas the Denver Broncos played in 4 previous Super Bowls \n     without winning, represented the American Football Conference \n     in Super Bowl XXXII which had not won a Super Bowl in 13 \n     years, and was considered the underdog in the game; and\n       Whereas after almost 40 years, the Denver Broncos became \n     champions of the NFL with a victory in Super Bowl XXXII over \n     the defending national champions and perennial contenders, \n     the Packers from Green Bay, Wisconsin: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the outstanding achievement of the Denver \n     Broncos in winning Super Bowl XXXII on January 25, 1998; and\n       (2) congratulates the players, staff, and fans of the \n     Denver Broncos for a terrific football season and a thrilling \n     victory in Super Bowl XXXII.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate resolution No. 169, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Hatch and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       A resolution (S. Res 169) to designate February 3, 1998, as \n     ``Four Chaplains Day''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, S. Res. 169, commemorates the ``Immortal \nFour Chaplains'' whose brave sacrifice is an inspiring story of \npersonal honor and patriotism. Their heroism of 55 years ago stands \ntoday as an eloquent and enduring example of service, fellowship, and \nlove.\n  On February 3, 1943, a German U-boat torpedoed the American transport \nship Dorchester, sinking it off the coast of Greenland. Among the \nnearly 1,000 American soldiers aboard the Dorchester were four \nchaplains whose selfless acts of courage have left a distinguished \nlegacy, a legacy that we hope to honor and remember in this resolution.\n  Survivors' accounts describing the short 18 minutes that the ship was \nsinking report that Lieutenant George L. Fox, a Methodist minister; \nLieutenant Alexander D. Goode, a Jewish rabbi; Lieutenant John P. \nWashington, a Catholic priest; and Lieutenant Clark V. Poling, a Dutch \nReformed minister worked to alert the soldiers to the danger and direct \nthem to safety. They distributed life jackets until no more were \navailable. Then, these four Army chaplains removed their own life \njackets and gave them to four soldiers.\n  One soldier witnessed a chaplain giving his gloves to a panicked GI \nshivering in the Arctic air to prevent the young man from returning to \nhis cabin for his own. The chaplains helped 230 men to safety and then \nchose to remain to calm and comfort the nearly 700 who went down with \nthe ship. True to their faiths and to their fellowmen until the end, \nthey were last seen, arms linked in prayer, on the hull of the ship.\n  A postage stamp in 1948 entitled ``Interfaith in Action\" commemorated \ntheir bravery. Congress passed a concurrent resolution in 1957 to honor \nthese chaplains and those who died with them. Presidents Truman and \nEisenhower also issued proclamations calling for national participation \nin memorial services throughout the country. The American Legion holds \nan annual commemorative service on the first Sunday of February.\n  This coming Sunday, February 3, 1998 marks the 55th anniversary of an \nepisode in our history that is tragic yet uplifting. Let us remember \nthese acts of bravery which were not bound or limited by creed or rank. \nTheir timeless sacrifice reminds us that we should not be divided by \nour differences, but that we should face the travails of our nation \ntogether, with faith and strength.\n  I urge the speedy passage of S. Res. 169.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there are acts of courage and personal \nsacrifice that are so great that they should never be forgotten. There \nare acts which decades--even centuries--later still reverberate, and \ntouch our soul as a nation. Surely, the heroic deeds of the ``Immortal \nFour Chaplains'' count among such acts.\n  These four Chaplains sacrificed their lives to save the lives of \nothers when the Dorchester, a transport ship, was torpedoed by a German \nU-boat off the coast of Greenland on February 3, 1943. During the 18 \nminutes that the Dorchester was sinking, the four Army Chaplains--a \nJewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, and two Protestant ministers--worked \nto comfort the frightened men and direct them to safety. They \ndistributed life jackets, and when there were no more in the storage \nlocker, the Chaplains removed their own life jackets and gave them to \nwaiting soldiers.\n  Rabbi Alexander Goode did not ask whether the soldier that he was \ngiving his life jacket to was Jewish; Father John Washington did not \nask whether he was Catholic; Reverend George Fox did not ask whether he \nwas Methodist; and Reverend Clark Poling did not ask whether he was \nDutch Reformed. The Chaplains simply took off their own life jackets \nand gave them to the next in line.\n  The Chaplains were last seen on the hull, with their arms linked \ntogether in prayer, consoling the men who remained on the ship with a \nfinal service. The way that they died is so poignant because it \nreflects the way that they lived--full of devotion to God and serving \nthe needs of their fellow men. As one survivor noted, the Chaplains \n``were always together . . . they carried their Faith together.''\n  Of the 902 servicemen, merchant seamen and civilian workers aboard \nthe Dorchester, only 230 survived. Many of them owed their lives to the \nactions of the four Chaplains. Their heroic actions served as an \ninspiration to the survivors of the Dorchester; they should be an \ninspiration to us now.\n  The courage of these four Chaplains, and their service to our country \ndid not go unrecognized. Each was posthumously awarded the \nDistinguished Service Cross for services beyond the call of duty; \nmemorials to their sacrifice have been placed around the country, \nincluding in the Pentagon and the National Cathedral; a postage stamp \nentitled ``Interfaith in Action'' was issued in their memory; and in \n1957, Congress declared the anniversary of the sinking of the \nDorchester to be a day for the commemoration of the deaths and the \nheroic acts of the four Chaplains.\n  Tragically, however, the memory of their selfless acts has faded. \nAside from the American Legion, which has annually observed the \nanniversary of their deaths, few continue to recognize this somber \noccasion.\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\n  I am proud to say, however, that some very special individuals in \nMinnesota are working to ensure that the legacy of the Four Chaplains \nlives on through The Four Chaplains Foundation, including: David Fox of \nHopkins; Barbara Koch of Long Lake; Ardis Wexler of Edina; Kevin \nApplequist of St. Anthony; Phil Brain of Edina; Ambassador Robert \nFlaten of Northfield; Shiro Katagiri of Minneapolis; Representative Jim \nRhodes of St. Louis Park; Helen Fulford of Bloomington; John Swon of \nEdina; Bettine Clemen of Minnetonka; and Vice President Walter Mondale \nof Minneapolis. These Minnesotans, joined by equally dedicated people \naround this nation, and the world, have established the Four Chaplains \nHumanity Prize to ensure that the spirit of these Chaplains is \ncelebrated through a living memorial. This prize will be awarded to \nthose who have been willing to put their lives in danger to grant \nassistance to persons of a different creed or color.\n  Mr. President, it is fitting that on the 55th anniversary of the \nsinking of the Dorchester, and the 50th anniversary of the issuance of \nthe commemorative stamp, Congress once again honors the memory of these \nfour Chaplains by designating February 3, 1998 as ``Four Chaplains \nDay.'' We have a duty to make sure that a grateful nation never forgets \ntheir sacrifice, and continues to celebrate the ideals for which they \nstood.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble agreed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 169) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 169\n\n       Whereas February 3, 1998, is the 55th anniversary of the \n     sinking of the United States Army transport Dorchester, an \n     event that resulted in the loss of nearly 700 lives in 1943 \n     and for which witnesses have recounted in the Congressional \n     Record the heroism of 4 chaplains of different faiths, \n     Lieutenant George L. Fox, Methodist; Lieutenant Alexander D. \n     Goode, Jewish; Lieutenant John P. Washington, Catholic; and \n     Lieutenant Clark V. Poling, Dutch Reformed;\n       Whereas witnesses have verified that during the approximate \n     18 minutes the ship was sinking after being torpedoed off the \n     coast of Greenland, the 4 chaplains went from soldier to \n     soldier calming fears and handing out life jackets and \n     guiding men to safety and when there were no more life \n     jackets, they removed their own life jackets and gave them to \n     others to save their lives and were last seen arm-in-arm in \n     prayer on the hull of the ship;\n       Whereas many of the 230 men who survived owed their lives \n     to these 4 chaplains, and witnesses among them recounted the \n     unique ecumenical spirit and love for their fellow man these \n     4 demonstrated that were later illustrated in a popular \n     postage stamp issued by the United States in 1948 with the \n     title ``Interfaith in Action'';\n       Whereas Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 90 in \n     1957 to honor these 4 chaplains and the men who died with \n     them, and President Truman and President Eisenhower issued \n     similar proclamations calling for national recognition and \n     participation in memorial services throughout the land that \n     have been observed annually by the American Legion on the \n     first Sunday in February;\n       Whereas Congress undertook to create a special medal for \n     valor given to the memory of the 4 chaplains in 1960 and \n     never to be repeated; and\n       Whereas memorials to the chaplains' heroic sacrifice abound \n     in many places throughout the country including the Heroes \n     Window in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) requests the President of the United States to issue a \n     proclamation designating February 3, 1998, as ``Four \n     Chaplains Day''; and\n       (2) invites the people of the United States, of all \n     religions and creeds and in all communities, to observe this \n     date with appropriate ceremonies, celebrations, and \n     commemorations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/27/senate-section/article/S69-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S70]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECESS AND ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.
