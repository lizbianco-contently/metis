DENIAL OF FOOD STAMPS FOR DECEASED INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 11 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 \n     (7 U.S.C. 2020) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(r) Denial of Food Stamps for Deceased Individuals.--Each \n     State agency shall--\n       ``(1) enter into a cooperative arrangement with the \n     Commissioner of Social Security, pursuant to the authority of \n     the Commissioner under section 205(r)(3) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 405(r)(3)), to obtain information on \n     individuals who are deceased; and\n       ``(2) use the information to verify and otherwise ensure \n     that benefits are not issued to individuals who are \n     deceased.''.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than September 1, 2000, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall submit a report regarding the \n     progress and effectiveness of the cooperative arrangements \n     entered into by State agencies under section 11(r) of the \n     Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2020(r)) (as added by \n     subsection (a)) to--\n       (1) the Committee on Agriculture of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (2) the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \n     of the Senate;\n       (3) the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (4) the Committee on Finance of the Senate; and\n       (5) the Secretary of the Treasury.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made \n     by this section take effect on June 1, 2000.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The Secretary shall be entitled to receive the \n     funds and shall accept the funds, without further \n     appropriation.\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Food \n     Stamp Act of 1977 to require food stamp State agencies to \n     take certain actions to ensure that food stamp coupons are \n     not issued for deceased individuals, to require the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to conduct a study of options for the design, \n     development, implementation, and operation of a national \n     database to track participation in Federal means-tested \n     public assistance programs, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1733, as \namended, a bill to combat fraud and waste in the food stamp program. \nThis bill will do two things. First, it will require food stamp offices \nto match food stamp files with Social Security data to identify \noverpayments to deceased food stamp participants. Second, it will \nrequire the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explore \ndata on the development of a national database to identify overpayments \nresulting from individuals receiving benefits in two or more states at \nthe same time and implement other program interstate requirements.\n  This bill is the result of the last two General Accounting Office \nstudies that I requested dealing with groups of ineligible people \nreceiving food stamps. In the first report, the GAO reported that \n26,000 deceased individuals in four states were counted as members of a \nfood stamp household. According to the GAO, this resulted in \noverpayments of an estimated $8.6 million. In the second report, the \nGAO identified over 20,000 individuals who received benefits in at \nleast two states at the same time during 1996. Using administrative \nrecords from four states (California, Texas, New York, and Florida), \nthe GAO estimates overpayments of $3.9 million in those states alone.\n  Last year the GAO reported to the Agriculture Committee that over $3 \nmillion in food stamp benefits were overpaid to prisoners' households. \nIn response, we passed legislation to stop prisoners from receiving \nbenefits.\n  My bill will require state food stamp agencies to use the Social \nSecurity Administration's Death Master file to verify that no deceased \nindividuals are counted as members of food stamp households, either \nincreasing a households' benefits or allowing an individual to \nillegally receive benefits in the deceased person's name. To give SAA \nenough time to iron out Year 2000 problems, this provision will not be \neffective until June 1, 2000.\n  Current law requires that households notify their local welfare \noffice of any changes in the makeup of the household within ten days. \nThe GAO report showed that the deceased individuals were counted in \nfood stamp households for an average of four months; and, in a few \ninstances, the deceased individuals were counted as beneficiaries for \nthe full two years the review was counted. This is unacceptable, \nparticularly since this type of fraud can easily be prevented.\n   Mr. President, one federal agency has the information to prevent \nthis fraud and abuse, but is not sharing it with other agencies issuing \nfederal benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a Death \nMaster File that compiles death information available in the federal \ngovernment. According to the GAO, a match using SSA's Death Master File \ninformation could be a cost-effective method for identifying such \nindividuals in food stamp households and eliminating these \noverpayments. States already relay on the SSA to verify the social \nsecurity numbers of food stamp applicants. Therefore, a system already \nexists in one branch of the federal government that, with some \nmodifications, could stop these overpayments.\n  My bill will also require the United States Department of Agriculture \nto conduct a study to identify options for a national database to track \nfood stamp participants and combat interstate fraud. The GAO's report \nvalidates a Department of Health and Human Services computer match of \n15 states which found 18,000 potential duplicated Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families (TANF) cases. At present there is no appropriate \nnational database that tracks in means-tested benefit programs. States \nhave been working individually on the problem of benefits paid in \nmultiple jurisdictions. For example, some states have developed \ncooperative agreements with neighboring states to share data. Current \nstate efforts are effective, but anything short of a national system is \ninefficient.\n   Mr. President, the welfare reform bill required states to guard \nagainst fraud\n\n[[Page S12465]]\n\n and abuse, and specifically prohibited participants from receiving \nbenefits in two states. However, the bill did not give states tools to \ncombat this type of fraud. HHS has already fulfilled a congressional \nmandate to look into some of these issues, so I expect the USDA to use \nthe completed HHS report to Congress as a base upon which to build.\n  Further, I believe that the study should explore the possibility of a \n``real time'' database, so that eligibility workers will instantly know \nif there are any problems with an application. This will avoid the \n``pay-and-chase'' problem that forces states to recoup overpayments \nfrom beneficiaries after the fact--sometimes years later. This method \nof fraud enforcement is inefficient, and often a burden on the \nrecipient as well. A national database should not be seen as purely an \nenforcement tool. There are many cross program benefits for the poor, \nbenefits which may not be apparent today. As with any large \ngovernmental database, the study should address how the system will \nsafeguard recipients' privacy and limit unauthorized use and disclosure \nof data.\n  Means-tested benefits, including food stamps, provide a safety net \nfor millions of people. We cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine \nthe food stamp program and welfare reform. Integrity is essential to \nensure a program that can serve those in need. It is our responsibility \nto help end fraud and abuse in all federally funded programs. This \nlegislation is an important step in that direction and will help ensure \nthat welfare reform is a success.\n   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Harkin and me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at this point in the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3822) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1733), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12464-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Res. 124\n\n       Whereas intellectual property-dependent industries include \n     businesses that depend on protection of trademarks, trade \n     secrets, trade names, copyrights, and patents;\n       Whereas intellectual property-dependent industries have \n     become primary drivers of the United States economy, \n     contributing over $500,000,000,000 to the United States \n     economy in 1997;\n       Whereas the foreign sales and exports of United States \n     intellectual property-dependent goods totaled at least \n     $100,000,000,000 in 1997, exceeded sales of every other \n     industrial sector, and helped the United States balance of \n     trade;\n       Whereas international piracy of United States intellectual \n     property, which the Department of Commerce estimates costs \n     United States companies nearly $50,000,000,000 annually, \n     poses the greatest threat to the continued success of United \n     States intellectual property-dependent industries;\n       Whereas goods from many developing countries receive \n     preferential duty treatment under the Generalized System of \n     Preferences even though those countries do not protect \n     intellectual property rights of United States persons;\n       Whereas piracy of United States intellectual property is so \n     rampant in some developing countries that receive benefits \n     under the Generalized System of Preferences that it \n     effectively prevents United States intellectual property-\n     dependent industries from selling products in those \n     countries;\n       Whereas the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights requires its signatories to \n     provide a minimum of essential protections to the \n     intellectual property of citizens from all signatory nations;\n       Whereas the United States has fully implemented its \n     obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights, and in fact in many cases \n     offers stronger protection of intellectual property rights \n     than required in the Agreement;\n       Whereas it appears that at the current rate many developing \n     countries that receive benefits under the Generalized System \n     of Preferences may not be in compliance with their \n     obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights on January 1, 2000, as required; \n     and\n       Whereas many of the developing countries that receive \n     benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences and that \n     are not on track in complying with their obligations under \n     the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \n     Property Rights are responsible for substantial trade losses \n     suffered by United States intellectual property-dependent \n     industries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not give special trade \n     preferences to goods originating from a country that is not \n     making substantial progress towards adequately and \n     effectively protecting United States intellectual property \n     rights, particularly a developing country that has not met \n     its obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects \n     of Intellectual Property Rights by January 1, 2000;\n       (2) Congress should monitor the progress of developing \n     countries in meeting their obligations under the Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights by \n     January 1, 2000; and\n       (3) Congress should consider legislation that would deny \n     the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences to \n     developing countries that are not in compliance with their \n     obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights beginning on January 1, 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12466-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12467-S12477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ESTUARY HABITAT RESTORATION PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I would like to express my support of S. \n1222, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 which we \nare about to pass. I am co-sponsor of the original version of this \nbill, and I am also a co-sponsor of S. 1321, introduced by Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey, which reauthorizes and provides funding for \nthe National Estuary Program. A modified version of S. 1321 is included \nin the version of S. 1222 that we are reviewing today. The Estuary \nHabitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 will invigorate our \nexisting programs to protect and restore our nations' estuaries.\n  The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in \nthe world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and \nseagrass beds, provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many \nspecies, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing \nindustry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries \nfor the most commercially harvested fish.\n  Today, many of Florida's estuaries have been damaged from the impacts \nof increased development, non-point source pollution, and increased \nnutrient loads. Four of Florida's estuaries are currently a part of the \nNational Estuary Program (NEP)--Sarasota Bay, Indian River Lagoon, \nTampa Bay, and Charlotte Harbor. The NEP is charged with the \nresponsibility of addressing point and not-point sources of pollution \nin addition to restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and \nbiological integrity and maximizing the ecological and economic \nproductivity of our nation's estuaries. The NEP has been working over \nthe last twelve years to develop implementation plans for the 28 \nestuaries in the program that will achieve these goals. In testimony \nbefore the Appropriations Subcommittee on the VA-HUD and Independent \nAgencies, the Association of National Estuary Programs testified that \ntoday, 17 of the NEP estuaries are in the implementation phase of their \nprograms and it is anticipated that by 1999 the entire national program \nwill have reached the implementation phase.\n  Three of the four Florida estuaries in this program have reached the \nimplementation phase of their restoration plans. The Sarasota Bay \nNational Estuary Program began in 1988. It identified several key focus \nareas for restoration: reducing nitrogen pollution to increase sea \ngrass coverage; constructing salt water wetlands; and building \nartificial reefs specifically for juvenile fish habitat. Since 1988, \nnitrogen pollution to the Bay has been reduced by 28-38 percent, with \napproximately 22 percent of the lost sea grasses and 6 percent of the \nlost salt water wetlands being restored. It is estimated that Sarasota \nBay now supports an additional 49 million fish, 33 million crabs, and \n150 million shrimp than it supported 10 years ago.\n  The continuation of our success is essential to the state of Florida. \nAs I mentioned, our estuarine systems are home to marine and \nterrestrial species that form the cornerstone of critical natural \nhabitats. They also are extremely valuable to the state's economy. For \nexample, as Professor Walter Milon of the University of Florida \ntestified on July 9 before the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nthe Indian River Lagoon estuary stretches 156 miles along Florida's \neast coast, covering five counties which are home to more than 1 \nmillion permanent residents and more than 6 million visitors each year. \nThe number of residents in this region is expected to increase by 24 \npercent between 1995 and 2005, increasing stress on this fragile \nsystem. Dr. Milon indicated that recreational fishing contributes \napproximately $340 million per year to the local economy; swimming, \nboating, water sports, and nature observation activities contribute \napproximately $287 million each year; commercial fishing of clams, \noysters, and crabs contributed nearly $13 million annually; and \nresidential land values were enhanced by approximately $825 million or \nan annual value of $33 million. The lagoon is estimated to bring more \nthan $725 million to the local economy each year.\n\n  Together, the provisions of the original S. 1222 and S. 1321 will \nprovide authorization for much needed funding to be used for execution \nof these implementation plans. By establishing the concrete goal of \nrestoring 1,000,000 acres of estuary habitat by 2010 and providing a \nmechanism to achieve this goal, the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act of 1998 will energize existing local estuary programs \nto make forward progress on habitat restoration. I am particularly \npleased that provisions exist in today's version of S. 1222 to provide \nfunding priority for those estuary habitat restoration projects that \nare part of an approved Federal estuary management or habitat \nrestoration plan.\n  Today's version of S. 1222 has incorporated S. 1321, which \nreauthorizes the NEP to continue developing and implementing estuary \nrestoration plans. However, there are some modifications to the \noriginal language that Senator Torricelli introduced, including a \nreduction of the funding levels by 50 percent and the length of the \nauthorization from 5 years to 2. I understand that one of the items on \nthe agenda in the Environment and Public Works Committee for next year \nis to reauthorize the Clean Water Act which will provide an excellent \nopportunity to extend the NEP authorization. I look forward to this \ncritical project for the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Together, the provisions of today's Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act of 1998 will provide much needed support to estuary \nrestoration efforts in the state of Florida and throughout the nation.\n  In addition to the provisions pertaining to our Nation's estuaries, \ntoday's version of S. 1222 also includes provisions of a bill \nintroduced by Senator Faircloth, S. 1219, the Pfisteria Research Act. \nEarlier this year in the Indian River Lagoon area, the estuary system \nhad several outbreaks of pfisteria-like disease. This was attributed by \nsome to be caused by outbreak of toxic organisms due to increased \nnutrient loading in the estuary waters. In 1996, a ``red tide'' caused \nby algal bloom was believed to have caused the death of 151 manatees \noff the southwest coast of Florida. The research program\n\n[[Page S12472]]\n\nincluded in today's version of S. 1222 authorizes research into the \neradication or control of pfisteria and other toxins--an action that \nwill provide vital information that may be used to prevent future \noccurrences of aquatic toxin outbreaks.\n  I am pleased to offer my support of S. 1222, the Estuary Habitat \nPartnership Restoration Act of 1998.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1222 the \nEstuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998. This bill is the \nculmination of efforts by Senators Breaux, Faircloth, Sarbanes, \nTorricelli, and myself to address the serious problems facing our \nNation's estuaries. I would like to thank each of my colleagues for \ntheir diligent work. I would also like to express my appreciation \ntoward the 26 cosponsors who also support the bill. Such strong \nbipartisan support is a testament to the extent and severity of the \nproblems facing estuaries, and the need for action to restore estuary \nhabitat.\n  I believe that in order to understand the necessity of this bill, one \nhas to realize the immense value of estuaries and estuary habitat. \nEstuaries are formed by the mixing of salt water from the ocean and \nfresh water from rivers and streams. Commonly known as bays, lagoons, \nand sounds, these water bodies and their surrounding wetlands provide \nsome of the most ecologically and economically productive habitat in \nthe world. Many different plants, waterfowl, fish and wildlife make \ntheir home in estuaries. In fact, more than half of the neo-tropical \nmigratory birds in the United States and a large number of endangered \nand threatened species depend upon estuaries for their survival.\n  This high productivity also gives estuaries great economic \nimportance. 75 percent of the commercial fish and shellfish catch and \n80 to 90 percent of the recreational fish catch are dependent upon \nestuaries for their survival. The commercial industry contributes $111 \nbillion per year to the national economy. Tourism is another key \nsegment of the economy supported by estuaries. In 1993, 180 million \nAmericans, approximately 70 percent of the U.S. population, visited \nestuaries to fish, swim, hunt, dive, view wildlife, bike, and learn. In \ntotal, approximately 28 million jobs are generated by commercial \nfishing tourism, and other industries based near estuaries and other \ncoastal waters.\n  The wetlands, marshlands, and grasslands that surround estuaries also \nprovide important help and safety benefits. These areas improve water \nquality by filtering terrestrial pollutants before they can contaminate \nshellfish beds and coastal waters. Doctor J. Easly, a natural resource \neconomist at North Carolina State University, calculates that one acre \nof tidal estuary has the pollutant filtering and removal capabilities \nof a $115,000 waste treatment plant. Flooding is serious problem facing \nmany communities around the nation. Estuary habitat not only cleans the \nwater, but can also store large volumes of water and minimize the \ndamage caused by flooding. Finally, esturine wetlands and barrier \nislands also serve as buffer zones for coastal areas, reducing erosion \nand storm damage.\n  While these biological, economic, health and safety benefits help to \nillustrate the immense value of estuary habitat, I still believe they \nfail to provide a complete picture. Estuaries have a spiritual and \nsymbolic importance, demonstrated by the close connection between \nneighboring communities and the bays and sounds. The executive director \nof the Providence Rhode Island Save the Bay Inc., H. Curtis Spalding, \ncaptured this feeling when he testified that:\n\n       Narragansett Bay is our home. Even if we live miles from \n     its shores, it is part of what makes Rhode Island special. \n     The bay is our life line, it nourishes our environment, \n     strengthens our economy, enhances our leisure time, and \n     protects our children's future.\n\n  Tragically, this life line is unraveling. Commercial and residential \ndevelopment are resulting in the physical destruction of many estuaries \nfrom dredging, draining, bulldozing and paving. Invasive, alien plant \nspecies have displaced native plants and overgrown estuary systems. \nRestricted tidal flow and freshwater diversions interfere with tidal \naction, impairing the natural cleansing of the bay and harming \nimportant fisheries.\n  Elevated levels of toxics have also been detected in estuary \nsediments, water, and animals. Many of these substances undergo \n``bioaccumulation,'' a process by which toxics from the environment \nbecome concentrated in the tissue of living animals. Bioaccumulation of \ntoxics into seafood can pose a serious risk to human health.\n  Nutrient pollution from a variety of sources disrupts aquatic life by \ncontributing to an overabundance of algae, lox oxygen levels, and \nmassive fish kills. Disease causing microorganisms from animal and \nhuman waste contaminate productive shellfish beds and recreational \nbeach waters, necessitating shellfish bed and beach closings.\n\n  A recent and ominous development is the transformation of naturally \noccurring microorganisms from benign to toxic forms. A specific example \nis Pfiesteria piscicida. Massive fish kills in Maryland, Virginia, and \nNorth Carolina have been traced to the emergence of a new, predatory \nform of Pfiesteria. This new form actively injects toxins into fish and \nmay have the potential to harm human health.\n  The impact of these problems on Narragansett Bay is painfully \napparent. Eel grass beds have declined from thousands of acres to \nroughly 100 acres. Salt marsh acreage has been reduced by half, and all \nof the remaining marshland needs some level of restoration. Fish runs, \nthe freshwater rivers and streams needed by many fish to reproduce, \nhave been reduced to 15 out of the original 50. In 1996, 36,000 acres \nof shellfish beds were permanently closed or harvest restricted due to \npathogen contamination. These declines in habitat have contributed to \nthe near collapse of many Narragansett Bay fisheries in the past 20 \nyears, and the loss of millions of dollars in revenue.\n  The problems facing Narragansett Bay are not unique to Rhode Island. \nThe decline of estuaries is a national tragedy. According to the EPA's \nNational Water Quality Inventory, 38 percent of the surveyed estuarine \nsquare miles are impaired for one or more uses. From colonial times to \nthe present, over 55 million acres of coastal wetlands in the \ncontinental United States have been destroyed. Recent population growth \nin coastal areas has resulted in extensive loss of estuary habitat. San \nFrancisco Bay in California has lost 95 percent of its original tidal \nwetlands, and Galveston Bay in Texas has lost 85 percent of its \noriginal sea grass meadows. Almost half of the U.S. population now \nlives in coastal areas, and the rate of population growth in coastal \nareas is three times that of noncoastal areas. As America's coastal \npopulation increases, so will the pressures placed upon coastal waters \nand estuaries.\n  In response to the grave threats facing our estuaries, the Estuary \nHabitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 seeks to both preserve and \nrestore these ecological treasures. The bill sets a national goal to \nrestore one million acres of estuary habitat by the year 2010. In \nsupport of this goal, $315 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 \nwill be authorized to carry out estuary habitat restoration projects. \nGiven the large scope of our mission, simply handing out money will not \nsolve the problem. We must maximize the environmental benefit obtained \nfrom each dollar spent. By emphasizing coordination, cooperation and \nimplementation, the bill ensures that we make the most out of limited \nFederal resources.\n  The key to the efficient use of funds is improved coordination. The \nbill establishes an interagency Collaborative Council to facilitate \ncoordination between Federal, State, and local programs. The council \nwill be composed of the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Under Secretary of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \nFish and Wildlife Service. The Army Corps of Engineers, due to its \nexpertise in engineering and management, will chair the council.\n  The council, in consultation with State, tribal, and local \ngovernments as well as nongovernmental entities, will develop a \nnational strategy for habitat restoration. One of the primary goals of \nthis strategy will be to prevent overlap between programs and insure \nthe efficient utilization of resources.\n\n[[Page S12473]]\n\n  The Collaborative Council will also disperse funds to assist \ncommunity groups and other non-Federal entities in developing and \nimplementing estuary restoration projects. Applicants will be required \nto obtain approval of State or local agencies, where such approval is \nappropriate, to prevent conflict with local and regional management \nstrategies. The Collaborative Council will select estuary habitat \nrestoration projects to receive Federal funding. The criteria used to \nselect projects will encourage and emphasize several factors. Priority \nwill be given to the projects implementing approved Federal estuary \nmanagement restoration plans, and projects with monitoring plans to \nensure that restoration goals are achieved and sources of pollution \nthat would otherwise re-impair the restored habitat are addressed. The \nCouncil will also consider the quantity and quality of habitat restored \nin relation to the economic cost of the project.\n  In order to maximize the benefit of limited Federal resources, and  \nencourage partnerships between Federal and non-Federal entities, the \nact will establish a Federal cost-sharing requirement. The Federal \nportion of a restoration project will not exceed 65 percent of the \ntotal costs, and priority will be given to applications that minimize \nthe Federal contribution to the project. The cost-sharing provision of \nthe act will preserve the essential role of the Federal Government in \nsupporting estuary restoration, while highlighting the importance of \nregional and local involvement. Successful restoration efforts depend \nupon cooperation between public and private sectors. By distributing \nthe costs of conservation and restoration, the act will reaffirm the \nimportance of States, tribes, local communities, and concerned parties \nin preserving their natural heritage and resources.\n\n  Monitoring and evaluation is a key provision of the bill. The Under \nSecretary of Oceans and Atmosphere will maintain a data base of \nrestoration projects to ensure that available information will be \ncontinually incorporated into habitat restoration projects. In addition \nto maintaining a database, the Council will publish a report to \nCongress detailing the progress made under the act. This report will \nallow for an assessment of the successes and failures of current \nmanagement strategies, with the goal of continually improving \nrestoration efforts.\n  This legislation will also amend the National Estuary Program \nprovision of the Clean Water Act to emphasize implementation and action \nas well as planning. The National Estuary Program was established by \nthe 1988 amendments to the Clean Water Act. The program is an important \npartnership among Federal, State, and local governments to protect \nestuaries of national significance threatened by pollution. Under the \nprogram, governors work with the EPA to designate areas as a National \nEstuaries. Federal money is then provided to State and local \ngovernments to develop comprehensive conservation and management plans. \nTo date, 28 conservation plans have been prepared for designated \nestuaries. While this program has achieved remarkable results, the law \ncurrently restricts EPA to only funding the development of plans, not \ntheir implementation. This bill will amend the National Estuary Program \nto allow the EPA to support both the development and implementation of \nconservation plans, and will authorize $25 million for each of fiscal \nyears 1999 and 2000. It is important to note that while the Federal \nGovernment will increase its support for this valuable program, the \nprimary responsibility for the implementation of conservation plans \nwill rest with State and local governments.\n  Key provisions of the bill will also continue and expand existing \nprograms. The Chesapeake Bay Program has become a model for other \nestuary restoration and protection programs around the world. EPA`s \nChesapeake Bay Program office will continue its leadership and \ntechnology transfer to other groups participating in the National \nEstuary Program. The Chesapeake Bay Program commits States in the bay \nand the Federal Government to reducing the level of nutrients in the \nbay and addressing other key issues in natural resources, water \nquality, population growth, and public access. The bill will authorize \n$30 million for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to help achieve \nthese goals. The money will be distributed as implementation grants to \nsignatory jurisdictions, and as technical assistance grants to \nnonprofit private organizations and individuals, State, and local \ngovernments, and interstate agencies. Signatory jurisdictions will also \nbe required to update, expand, and begin implementing their tributary \nspecific management strategies. EPA will also be provided with new \nauthority to ensure that Federal facilities in the watershed \nparticipate in the Chesapeake Bay Program and contribute to local \nefforts to restore and protect the bay.\n  Another positive change in the program will be the addition of the \nChesapeake Bay gateways and watertrails network. The network will \nconsist of important natural, cultural, historical and recreational \nresources linked together in a manner that enhances public education \nand access to the bay. The act will authorize $3 million for each of \nfiscal years 1999 through 2003 in matching grants for bay conservation \nand restoration. The Department of the Interior, in cooperation with \nthe EPA, will identify ecologically or culturally significant areas of \nthe bay and designate these resources as Chesapeake Bay gateway sites. \nThese agencies will then work in partnership with State and local \ngovernments, nonprofit organizations, and other interested parties, to \nconserve and restore these sites.\n  The act also will continue to support is the effort to restore the \nLong Island Sound. A comprehensive conservation and management plan has \nalready been developed for this important ecological resource. Over the \nnext 15 years, the Long Island sound conservation plan calls for a \nreduction in the amount of nutrients reaching the sound by 60 percent. \nThe plan also sets a goal of restoring 2,000 acres of coastal habitat \nand 100 miles of river used by migratory fishes. In support of these \nimportant efforts, the act will authorize $10 million for each of \nfiscal years 1999 through 2003 to implement this plan.\n  Finally, this bill will address the threat that pfiesteria piscicida \nposes to the Nation's waterways. The first toxic outbreak occurred in \nNorth Carolina in the late 1980's. In recent years, toxic outbreaks \nhave occurred in tributaries leading into the Chesapeake Bay. The act \nwill authorize $5 million for each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to \nestablish an interagency research program for the eradication or \ncontrol of pfiesteria and other aquatic toxins.\n  When evaluating this bill, I believe it is important to focus on what \nthe bill does, and does not, do. The bill does not impose mandates. The \nbill does not create more regulations. And the bill does not require \nthe Federal Government to foot the entire bill for estuary restoration. \nWhat the bill does is provide incentives for States, tribes, local \ngovernments, and other interested parties to enter into partnerships \nwith the Federal Government for environmental preservation. This bill \nbuilds upon years of planning and focuses on action and implementation \nat the local level, by encouraging communities and individuals to \nbecome involved in estuary restoration. In short, the bill is a simple \nand direct approach to preserving and restoring some of our Nation's \nmost valuable natural resources. By passing this legislation, we are \nmaking a responsible investment in our Nation's natural and economic \nfuture. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, last night there was an interesting \ndiscussion on CNN. It went something like this:\n  The White House is now spending the surplus--the surplus that the \nPresident, a few months ago, said had to be guaranteed for only Social \nSecurity. I am told that the White House immediately responded by \nsaying: Oh, no, no, no, the White House isn't spending the surplus. \nSurpluses don't exist until after you have had all of the emergency \nspending you need.\n  In other words, the White House has now come to the Hill to ask for \nupwards of $20 billion worth of surplus\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\nspending that is now emergency spending, that isn't called surplus and, \ntherefore, doesn't count against application to the trust funds of \nSocial Security.\n  Now, while the President's legions are up here in negotiations over \nin Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, the President is still out on the \nstump accusing Republicans of wanting to spend the surplus. The \nPresident has effectively, by Democrat action here on the floor, denied \nthe taxpayers a reasonable tax cut this year. And while there are some \nnecessary moneys to be spent in surplus spending for emergencies--such \nas disaster-related emergencies, the emergency of the commodity price \ncrises in agriculture--nobody has denied that that wasn't surplus money \nand that in fact we are spending a little bit of that surplus, a very \nsmall amount of that surplus, to address some very real national needs. \nBut no Republican has even tried to suggest that the surplus isn't the \nsurplus until we have spent all of it, or a portion of it, and that \nwhat is left over becomes the surplus.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a doublespeak of yours that we are somehow, as \na Nation, getting used to: Is ``is''? No; the surplus is the surplus. \nThat is the money that remains unappropriated at the end of a fiscal \nyear. That is the money that, collectively, the budget process of \nCongress, the appropriating process of Congress, says is not needed; it \nis not necessary to spend that money.\n  So now we are attempting something uniquely different. Now we are \nattempting to once again redefine, at least in the eyes of the \nPresident and this administration, what a surplus is. I think we will \nlet the American people decide what that is. You see, we know what \n``is'' is. And ``is,'' in this case, is the money that the budget \nprocess suggests is not appropriated beyond its normal channels, and \nthat we have determined can be upward of $60 billion worth of surplus \nthis year, that the President in his budget message to Congress \nemphatically said had to be spent on Social Security, and that this \nCongress, in a very real and bipartisan way, said, yes, it is a good \nidea and should be done, because most of us agree that we are in a \nunique time--if not a historically opportune time--in our country, and \nthat is to use our surplus, to use the surplus that was produced by a \nbalanced budget that we worked so hard to accomplish--can be used to \nmake major changes, not only in our tax law and tax policy, but now the \nunique opportunity to reform Social Security, not only to save it, \nsecure it, and maintain it for those who become the immediate \nrecipients of it, but so that our children and our grandchildren will \nbe investing in a Social Security system that is worth investing in, so \nthat they are not denied real return on their investment--25 cents on \nthe dollar, as will be the case for our grandchildren today if we don't \nreform Social Security. We want them to get $1.50 or $2 back on their \ninvestment, as they should be allowed to do.\n  So what is ``is,'' Mr. President, and what is surplus doesn't allow \nyour definition. It isn't what is left over when you get through \nspending on all of the additional social programs that you want to \nspend it on.\n  Just a few moments ago, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nheld a very interesting press conference. They called it a ``do-nothing \nCongress.'' They denied that we had spent the money necessary to fund \nall of the social programs. Mr. President, in 1994 the American people \nspoke most profoundly when they changed Congress and said they wanted a \nnew agenda, they wanted a balanced budget, they wanted us to reform \nSocial Security, and they wanted the influence and the impact of the \nFederal Government on our lives and on our pocketbooks lessened. That \nis exactly what this Congress has been doing. Yet, of course, now that \nwe have accomplished those goals, now that our economy and our lessened \nGovernment spent less of the money and our economy generates more money \nand we have a unique opportunity of surplus, the President now sees \nthat opportunity--sees it or seizes it, I am not sure at this moment.\n  Let me suggest, Mr. President, that what is is. Surplus is surplus. \nIt isn't what is left over after you get through spending. That is \nexactly what the President and the White House tried to engage in last \nnight, a whole new definition. We have watched this President try to \nredefine a lot of things over the last good number of months--from the \nword ``is,'' now to the word ``surplus.'' Mr. President, surplus is \nsurplus. It is when the Congress works the budget process, and that is \nconcluded in a bipartisan fashion, that we determine what surplus is. \nSo I think it is terribly important that we finalize our work here. \nThose negotiations are now underway. Yes, some surplus money will be \nspent in emergency. What is left over at the end will be surplus. But \nyou don't start the game by redefining the fact. That is how we deal \nwith it. That is how we must deal with it. And it is very important \nthat we stay with that.\n\n  I am proud of the record of the Republican Congress--a balanced \nbudget, welfare reform--major changes--and new dollars into education, \neducation controlled at the local and State level and not new, grand \nprograms here at the national level. Those are the issues about which \nwe are talking. Those are the issues with which we must deal.\n  I hope we can conclude those quickly, adjourn this Congress, and be \nable to announce to the American taxpayer that they can rest assured \nthat our effort is to control Government spending, the size of \nGovernment, and the impact it has on their pocketbook.\n  With those comments, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12477-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to make some comments with \nrespect to the question of the allocation of resources to assist our \nState and local governments in meeting their challenge in the provision \nof education for grades K through 12.\n  First, in this war of words it should not be overlooked that there \nwas no disagreement last year in establishing education as a priority \nwhen we enacted the Balanced Budget Act. We entered into an agreement \nonly one year ago with this administration where we indicated that yes, \nwe agree that education is a priority for all. We have honored that \ncommitment.\n  Under the balanced budget agreement from last year, we agreed to \nincrease spending on education by 15 percent, or $3 billion. We did \nthat.\n  This year in the budget resolution adopted by the Senate we agreed to \nincrease education spending over the next 5 years by an amount equal to \ninflation which would result in spending increases of $6.6 billion in \nbudget authority and $4.1 billion in outlays over the next 5 years. \nAlmost all other discretionary programs were frozen.\n  In addition, earlier this year we passed a bill--with bipartisan \nsupport--the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act to expand the \neducation IRA which we enacted last year as part of the Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997.\n  Under this provision the annual contribution limit for education IRAs \nwould be increased from $500 under current law to $2,000 and expand the \nuse of the proceeds from these accounts for elementary and secondary \neducation expenses.\n  Education expenses, it is important to note, under the provisions of \nthe bill were broadly defined to include after school-programs, \nexpenses for special needs children, computers, tutoring, uniforms--in \nsum, virtually any expense associated with improving the totality of a \nchild's education.\n  The benefits of this provision were large for a very small cost, and \nI would note most importantly, with no Federal interference. Mr. \nPresident, this one provision was anticipated to generate $5 billion \nfor education over a 5-year period and $10 billion over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  It was thought that 14 million families would utilize the savings \nbenefit and 20 million school children would benefit. All at minimal \ncost and interference. The administration vetoed this good and \nimportant bill.\n\n[[Page S12479]]\n\n  As I see it where we are today is not in disagreement over the \nimportance of education or the investment in education, but rather a \nvery different philosophical approach in the best way to provide \nassistance. As a staunch believer in State and local control of \neducation it is my firm belief that the assistance we provide to our \nState and local educational agencies must be given with the maximum \namount of flexibility.\n  Time and time again, the evidence has shown that a one size fits all \ndirective from Washington is not the tonic to cure any ills within our \neducational system. I therefore believe the administration's insistence \non their school construction and class room size reduction initiative \nis wrong, and actually may be harmful.\n  A policy briefing issued in June of this year by the Progressive \nPolicy Institute states it best: ``It makes little sense to dictate in \nacross the board class-size reduction policy from Washington. A \nnational policy can only expect average gains, which appear to be very \nsmall at great expense.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \npolicy briefing ``Improving Student Achievement--Is Reducing Class Size \nthe Answer?'' be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, an additional problem with inflexible \nmandates from Washington is that it directs resources from the State \nand local level to areas which a State or local school board might not \nthink is the best use of resources.\n  Some schools or districts may wish to have smaller class sizes or \ndevote resources to capital projects, others may feel that their school \nreform efforts can best be served by adding computers, newer textbooks, \nteacher training, or after school programs or other ideas. This is \nwhere I think directives become harmful.\n  We do not have the solutions in Washington, We must let our State and \nlocal educational agencies, parents, and teachers, have the freedom to \nput their resources where they feel they will do the most good for the \nbenefit of our children. An editorial from the News Journal from my \nState entitled ``Misguided Mandate: Micromanagement by Legislators Is \nMockery of Real School Reform'' is illustrative of this point, though \nthey were editorializing on an action taken by the State legislature in \nDelaware.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in full at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in conclusion, Mr. President, I would say \nthat I am disappointed in the rhetorical excess surrounding the issue \nof educational excellence.\n  Our focus should not be on inputs and micromanagement, but on how we \ncan best deliver assistance which will result in positive outcomes \nreflected by improved student achievement. I suggest that the solution \nto this problem rests in our communities, with those closest to the \nproblems at hand.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Editor's Note: Silver bullet ideas for school reform come and \n     go, usually warranting little more than passing attention. \n     However, one idea seems to be taking hold among many camps: \n     class-size reduction. In light of the attention and support \n     this idea has received, the Progressive Policy Institute \n     asked University of Rochester's Eric Hanushek--a renowned \n     education scholar--to review the evidence on the impact of \n     class-size reduction policies. This is his analysis.\n\n   Improving Student Achievement--Is Reducing Class Size the Answer?\n\n                         (By Eric A. Hanushek)\n\n       Growing numbers of Americans are dissatisfied with our \n     nation's schools and are demanding reform. Recently, results \n     from an international study showed U.S. students trailing the \n     world in twelfth grade math and science. Faced with the \n     daunting task of reforming education, politicians in both \n     parties, including President Clinton, are seizing on a cure-\n     all that appeals to interest groups and enjoys public \n     support: reducing class size.\n       This is by no means a new idea; teachers' unions have \n     fought for smaller classes for decades.\n       All other things being equal, smaller classes are \n     preferable to larger ones because teachers can give students \n     more individual attention. However, all things are seldom \n     equal, and other factors, such as the quality of the teacher, \n     have a much more decisive impact on student achievement. \n     Moreover, the huge expense of class-size reduction may impede \n     the ability of schools to make other important investments in \n     quality. Here lies the fundamental question: What effect do \n     broad policies of class-size reduction have on overall \n     student achievement levels?\n       Supporters of broad class-size reductions generally point \n     to a few studies or a few experiences that suggest improved \n     performance with smaller classes and then rely on the \n     ``obviousness'' of the proposed policies to carry the day. To \n     be sure, there are U.S. classrooms that are overcrowded. But \n     not every school ranks reducing class size as the highest \n     priority. Some schools may prefer to invest in smaller \n     classes, but others might opt for reading tutors, after-\n     school programs, computers, higher salaries for teachers, or \n     increased professional development. In fact, a thorough \n     review of the scientific evidence shows a startling finding; \n     class-size reduction may be one of the least effective \n     educational investments.\n       Historical and international evidence also shows that a \n     national policy to reduce class size could displace more \n     productive investments in schooling. The United States has \n     already significantly reduced class sizes over the past 40 \n     years and student performance has remained stagnant, at best. \n     The overall pupil-teacher ratio fell by 35 percent from 1950-\n     95 (from about 27-to-1 to 17-to-1).\\1\\ Aggregate student \n     performance has shown no improvement over this period. \n     Similarly, these changes have done nothing to boost our \n     standing on international achievement tests.\n       Federal policy should aim to improve teacher quality, not \n     quantity. Rather than reducing class size, a better use of \n     federal money would be to encourage states to boost teacher \n     quality by developing meaningful teacher tests and \n     alternative certification programs. Better yet, federal funds \n     could be used to encourage stronger performance incentives in \n     our schools.\n\n\n               the bipartisan rush to reduce class sizes\n\n       The widespread belief that lowering class size immediately \n     improves education has been echoed by politicians in both \n     parties during this election year. About 20 governors are \n     either proposing or actively considering class-size reduction \n     initiatives. These states are following on the heels of \n     California, which reduced K-3 class sizes under Republican \n     Governor Pete Wilson after the state generated a revenue \n     windfall in 1996. GOP proposals both in Congress and in many \n     states to shift education dollars from ``administration'' to \n     ``classrooms'' are also often promoted as enabling school \n     districts to reduce class sizes.\n       Its status as the hardy perennial of teachers' union \n     proposals has further made class-size reduction popular among \n     many Democratic politicians. But this tendency was given a \n     powerful new impetus this year when President Clinton--\n     previously identified with such performance-oriented reforms \n     as charter schools, high standards, and national tests--made \n     hiring more teachers to reduce class sizes in early education \n     a major feature of his State of the Union Address.\n\n\n                          the clinton-proposal\n\n       The President proposed to spend $12 billion in federal \n     funds over seven years to reduce class sizes in grades 1-3. \n     These initiatives are designed to help bring classes in the \n     early grades down to 18 students per class, an undertaking \n     estimated to require 100,000 additional teachers.\n       Federal funding for class-size reduction would be \n     distributed to states on the basis of the Title I formula. \n     Within the state, each high-poverty school district would \n     receive the same share of these funds as it received under \n     ``Title I, and the remaining funds would be distributed \n     within the state based on class size. Participating school \n     districts would be required to match federal funds, on a \n     sliding scale raning from 10 percent to 50 percent.\n       The initiative also emphasizes teacher certification \n     requirements, an important concern described below. Its \n     approach, however, overlooks the systemic defects of our \n     current certification practices and ignores a critical aspect \n     of teacher quality; recruitment.\n       More importantly, the President's initiative represents a \n     detour from past initiatives to promote educational results \n     rather than just education spending. The classsize reduction \n     initiative uniquely promotes new educational ``inputs'' \n     (i.e., money) without a corresponding commitment to \n     educational ``outputs'' (i.e., results). All these \n     shortcomings might be overcome if it were truly clear that \n     reducing class sizes in and of itself improves education. \n     Unfortunately, the evidence says otherwise.\n\n\n                     the evidence on class size \\2\\\n\n       A wide range of perspective can be taken in attempting to \n     pinpoint the effectiveness of reduced class sizes. No matter \n     what the source of evidence, the answer about effectiveness \n     is the same: broad policies of class-size reduction are very \n     expensive and have little effect on student achievement.\n       1. The United States has extensive experience with class-\n     size reduction and it has not worked. Between 1950-95, pupil-\n     teacher ratios fell by 35 percent, from about 27-to-1 to \n     about 17-to-1 overall. These reductions have been an \n     important component of the dramatic increases in school \n     spending that have occurred over this period. Table 1 shows \n     the pattern of pupil-teacher ratios, teacher attributes, and \n     real spending per pupil since 1960. The one-third fall in \n     pupil-teacher ratios is a significant contributor to the near \n     tripling in real spending per student in average daily \n     attendance (ADA). (The table further shows that other teacher \n     attributes--i.e., advanced degrees and experience--also grew \n     significantly.)\n\n[[Page S12480]]\n\n\n\n                                             TABLE 1.--PUBLIC SCHOOL RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1961-91\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Resource                              1960-61      1965-66      1970-71      1975-76      1980-81      1985-86      1990-91\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPupil-Teacher Ratio..........................................         25.6         24.1         22.3         20.2         18.8         17.7         17.3\nPercent Teachers with Master's Degree........................         23.1         23.2         27.1         37.1         49.3         50.7         52.6\nMedian Years Teacher Experience..............................           11            8            8            8           12           15           15\nCurrent Expenditure/ADA (1992-93 $'s)........................       $1,903       $2,402       $3,269       $3,864       $4,116       $4,919       $5,582\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       While we lack information about student achievement for \n     this entire period, the information that we have from 1970 \n     for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) \n     indicates that our 17-year-olds were performing roughly the \n     same in 1996 as in 1970. There are some differences by \n     subject area. For science, the average scale score of 17-\n     year-olds falls 9 points between 1969-96. For math, 17-year-\n     olds improve 3 points between 1973-96. For reading, they \n     improve 2 points between 1971-96. Writing performance, which \n     is only available since 1984, shows a fall of 7 points, by \n     1996. Only the fall in science (and in writing since 1984) is \n     a statistically significant difference. There have been \n     improvements at earlier ages, but they are not maintained and \n     are not reflected in the skills that students take to college \n     and to the job market. The overall picture is one of stagnant \n     performance.\n       One common explanation for why the lower pupil-teacher \n     ratio hasn't resulted in increased overall performance is \n     that more students are now designated as special education \n     students, whose classes are much smaller than regular ones. \n     About 12.5 percent of students are now identified as having \n     disabilities covered under special education legislation (up \n     8 percent at the introduction of programs in the late 1970s). \n     Indeed, the federal and state mandates for the education of \n     handicapped students have placed significant requirements on \n     hiring staff and providing extensive services. On average, \n     these students cost somewhat more than twice that of those \n     undergoing regular instruction. While these programs could \n     account for as much as a *COM041*third of the increased \n     intensity of teachers over the 1980s, substantial \n     reductions in class size have been directed at regular \n     class room instruction as well.\n       In sum, the proposals to reduce class sizes are nothing \n     new. We have been pursuing these policies for decades. The \n     aggregate evidence shows no improvements in student \n     performance that can be related to the overall pupil-teacher \n     ratio reductions.\n       2. International comparisons suggest no relationship \n     between pupil-teacher ratios and student performance. The \n     recent results measuring the performance of U.S. students on \n     international math and science examinations have sobered \n     many. Our high school seniors performed near the bottom of \n     the rankings of the 21 nations participating in the Third \n     International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This \n     showing has nothing to do with more selective students taking \n     the tests in other countries--our best students performed \n     badly.\n       At the same time, the dramatic differences in pupil-teacher \n     ratios and in class sizes across the countries are unrelated \n     to measures of mathematics and science achievement. Of course \n     there are many differences across countries that are \n     difficult to adjust for in any analysis, but if smaller \n     classes were strongly related to high student achievement, \n     then one would expect U.S. class sizes to be much larger than \n     those in other countries. In fact, just the opposite is true. \n     Asian countries that routinely outperform the U.S. generally \n     have much larger class sizes. Ironically, the international \n     differences suggest that there is a slight positive \n     relationship between pupil-teacher ratios and student \n     achievement.\n       3. Extensive econometric investigation shows no \n     relationship between class size and student performance. Over \n     the past three decades, there has been significant research \n     in deciphering what factors affect student achievement. This \n     work, employing sophisticated econometric techniques, \n     provides considerable evidence about the effects of class \n     size on performance.\n       These extensive statistical investigations show almost as \n     many positive as negative estimates of the effects of \n     reducing class size. Table 2 summarizes the 277 separate \n     published estimates of the effect of pupil-teacher ratios on \n     student achievement. Only 15 percent give much confidence \n     (i.e., are statistically significant) that there is the \n     expected improvement from reducing class sizes. The bulk (85 \n     percent) either suggest that achievement worsens (13 percent) \n     or gives little confidence that there is any effect at all.\n\n                 TABLE 2.--PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATED INFLUENCE OF TEACHER-PUPIL ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE, BY LEVEL OF SCHOOLING\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        Statistically        Statistically insignificant (in percent)--\n                                                                                       significant (in     ---------------------------------------------\n                            School level                              Number of          percent)--\n                                                                      estimates  --------------------------   Positive     Negative      Unknown sign\n                                                                                    Positive     Negative\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll Schools........................................................          277           15           13           27           25                  20\nElementary Schools.................................................          136           13           20           25           20                  23\nSecondary Schools..................................................          141           17            7           28           31                  17\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Because of the controversial nature of these conclusions, \n     they have been carefully scrutinized--and the policy \n     conclusions remain unaffected. The subsequent discussions \n     have clarified one important aspect of these analyses. The \n     existing studies do show that sometimes variations in class \n     size have significant influences on performance. The \n     difficulty, when thought of in terms of making policy from \n     Washington or from State capitals, is that nobody has been \n     able to identify the overall circumstances that lead to \n     beneficial effects. This finding has important policy \n     implications that are discussed below.\n       These studies are important because they provide detailed \n     views of differences across classrooms--views that separate \n     the influence of schools from that of family, peers, and \n     other factors. As a group, they cover the influence of class \n     size on a variety of student outcomes, on performance at \n     different grades, and on achievement in different kinds of \n     schools and different areas of the country. In sum, they \n     provide broad and solid evidence.\n       4. Project STAR in Tennessee does not support overall \n     reductions in class size except perhaps at kindergarten. Much \n     of the current enthusiasm for reductions in class size is \n     based on the results of a random-assignment experimental \n     program in the State of Tennessee in the mid-1980s. The \n     common reference to this program, Project STAR, is an \n     assertion that the positive results justify a variety of \n     overall reductions in class size. This study is the primary \n     reference in the Clinton proposal as well as Governor Pete \n     Wilson's dramatic class-size reductions in California in \n     1996.\n       The study is conceptually simple, even if some questions \n     about its actual implementation remain. Students and teachers \n     in the STAR experiment were randomly assigned to small \n     classes (13-17) students) or large classes (22-25) students) \n     with or without aides. Each participating school had one of \n     each type of class. Students were kept in these small or \n     large classes from kindergarten through third grade, and \n     their achievement was measured at the end of each year.\n       The STAR evidence showed that the gains made were mainly in \n     kindergarten. The STAR data are summarized by Figures 1 and \n     2. (Graphs were not reproducible in the Record.) At the end \n     of kindergarten, children in small classes score better than \n     those in large classes. They then maintain this differential \n     for the next three years.\n       If smaller classes were valuable in each grade, the \n     achievement gap would widen. It does not. In fact, the gap \n     remains essentially unchanged through the sixth grade, even \n     though the experimental students from the small classes \n     return to larger classes-for the fourth through sixth grades. \n     The inescapable conclusion is that the smaller classes at \n     best matter in kindergarten and perhaps first grade. The data \n     do not suggest that improvements will result from class-size \n     reductions at later grades.\n       The STAR data suggest that perhaps achievement would \n     improve if kindergarten classes were moved to sizes \n     considerably below today's average. In addition, the effects \n     were greater fro minority students during the first two \n     years. The President`s plan gives greater assistance to Title \n     I schools and targets the early grades, but not kindergarten.\n       Nonetheless, the STAR evidence pertains to a one-third \n     reduction in class sizes, a reduction approximately equal to \n     the overall decline in the pupil-teacher ratio between 1950 \n     and today. As we have seen, that reduction has not led to \n     overall improvement in student achievement.\n\n\n                interpreting the evidence on class size\n\n       None of this says that smaller classes never matter. The \n     class size evidence refers to the normal ranges observed in \n     schools--roughly between 15 and 40 studens per class. A class \n     of 100 would likely produce different effects than a class of \n     five, but such a comparison is irrelevant for purposes of the\n\n[[Page S12481]]\n\n     broad policies currently being considered. Indeed, the micro-\n     evidence, which shows instances where differences in pupil-\n     teacher ratios appear important, suggests just the opposite. \n     All things being equal, teachers are probably more effective \n     with fewer students because they can devote more attention to \n     each child. But all things are not equal. Existing teachers \n     may well not adjust their classroom behavior with fewer \n     children in the classroom, and new teachers hired to staff \n     the additional smaller classes may not be as good as existing \n     teachers. There may be situations--of specific teachers, \n     specific groups of students, and specific subject matters--\n     where the huge expense of smaller classes may be very \n     beneficial for student achievement. At the same time, there \n     are other situation where a large scale class-size reduction \n     policy could take away from other education priorities and \n     result in stagnant or worse student achievement.\n       The complexity of the situation is that we do not know how \n     to describe a prior situation where reduced class size will \n     be beneficial. It makes little sense to dictate an across-\n     the-board class-size reduction policy from Washington. A \n     national policy can only expect average gains, which appear \n     to be very small, at a great expense.\n       It is also important to remember that bad implementation \n     can actually worsen achievement. When California implemented \n     its large-scale class reduction last year, the state \n     scrambled to hire thousands of new teachers; 31 percent of \n     Claifornia's new teachers are working with only emergency \n     credentials, with a disproportionate number working in urban \n     districts. Due to lack of space, some schools have resorted \n     to placing two teachers in a single classroom with forty \n     students.\\3\\\n       Much of the case for reduced class size rests on ``common-\n     sense'' arguments. With fewer students, teachers can devote \n     more attention to each child and can tailor the material to \n     the individual child's needs. But consider, for example, a \n     movement from class size of 26 to class sizes of 23. This \n     represents an increase in teacher costs alone of over ten \n     percent. It is relevant to ask whether teachers would in fact \n     notice such a change and alter their approach. The \n     observational information from Project STAR suggested no \n     noticeable changes in typical teacher behavior from the much \n     larger changes in the experiment.\n       The small classes in California have 20 students in them--\n     about the size of the large classes in STAR. No evidence from \n     STAR relates to the likely effects of such a policy change. \n     Indeed, the STAR study was based on previous research which \n     suggested that a class size of 15 or fewer would be needed to \n     make a significant improvement in classroom performance. The \n     Clinton Administration proposals point to class sizes of 18, \n     instead of the 20 in California, but they still do not get \n     down to the STAR levels.\n       The policy issue is not defined exlusively by whether we \n     should expect positive effects from reducing class sizes. \n     Even if we were confident of positive effects, the case for \n     general policies to reduce class size would not yet be made. \n     Class-size reduction is one of the most expensive \n     propositions that can be considered. The policy experiment of \n     Project STAR involved increasing the number of classroom \n     teachers by one-third, a policy with massive spending \n     implications if implemented on a widescale basis. In \n     recognition of fiscal realities the expense of such policies \n     puts natural limits on what is feasible, leading many \n     reductions to be in the end rather marginal . Marginal \n     changes, however, are even less likely to lead to underlying \n     changes in the behavior to teachers.\n\n\n                     teacher quality, not quantity\n\n       Considerable evidence shows that teacher quality is one of \n     the most important factors in student achievement. Whether or \n     not large-scale reductions in class size help or hurt will \n     depend mostly on whether the new teachers are better or worse \n     than the existing teachers. Unfortunately, class-size \n     reduction proposals usually are not accompanied by plans to \n     recruit qualified teachers, and the current organization \n     of schools and incentives to hire and retain teachers do \n     little to ensure that the teacher force will improve. \n     Reducing class sizes may likely have a negative effect by \n     increasing the quantity of teachers at a time when what we \n     need most is to increase teacher quality.\n       Furthermore, although there is an overall teacher surplus \n     in the United States, high poverty districts often face \n     teacher shortages. In California, this situation has been \n     exacerbated by the state's class-size reduction policy where \n     wealthier districts have raided teachers from poorer \n     districts.\n       The Clinton Administration proposal call for states to \n     adopt training and certification procedures that have been \n     evaluated and tested. Simply trying to raise certification \n     standards in the current system is unlikely to raise teacher \n     quality. Indeed, certification as practiced today already \n     deters too many talented individuals from teaching, and \n     teachers are rarely held accountable for student performance. \n     Moreover, some states may actually have to lower \n     certification standards just to attract enough teachers for \n     each classroom. If we are to have a real impact on teaching, \n     we must evaluate actual teaching performance and use such \n     evaluations in school decisions. We cannot rely on \n     requirements for entry, but must switch to using actual \n     performance in the classroom.\\4\\\n\n\n                          superior approaches\n\n       The states and federal government are in a unique position \n     to initiate programs that promise true improvement in our \n     schools. They are not programs that mandate or push local \n     schools to adopt one-size-fits-all approaches--such as \n     lowering overall class sizes or altering the certification of \n     teachers. Instead they are programs that develop information \n     about improved incentives in schools.\n       The largest impediment to any constructive change in \n     schools is that nobody in today's schools has much of an \n     incentive to improve student performance.\\5\\ Careers simply \n     are not made on the basis of student outcomes. The flow of \n     resources is not related positively to performance--indeed it \n     is more likely to be perversely related to performance. Let \n     us return to class size proposals for a moment. Given that \n     school incentives do not push toward better student \n     performance or toward conserving on expenditures, it is \n     little wonder that decisions about class size are made on the \n     basis of ``fairness'' and not productivity. After all, would \n     it be fair to some teachers to have to teach large classes or \n     to some students to have less attention in a larger \n     classroom? If schools were more motivated toward performance, \n     the discussion might shift to identifying those situations \n     where changing class sizes would have their largest impact. \n     For example, reducing kindergarten class sizes might be \n     important in communities that lack preschools; communities \n     that face teacher shortages might instead raise teacher \n     salaries in order to improve their applicant pools and \n     recruit more qualified teachers.\n       The unfortunate fact is, however, that we have little \n     experience with alternative incentive structures. A very \n     productive use of state and federal funds would be to conduct \n     a series of planned interventions that could be used to \n     evaluate improvements. Minimally, instead of funding lowered \n     class sizes everywhere, the states and federal government \n     could team together to mandate more extensive random-\n     assignment trials and evaluation of the benefits of \n     lowered class sizes, a la Tennessee.\n       More usefully, they could work to develop a series of \n     experiments that investigates alternative incentive schemes--\n     from merit pay to private contracting to wider choice of \n     schools. A new program of trials with altered performance \n     incentives could place an indelible positive stamp on the \n     nation's future by committing to learning about how schools \n     can be improved. Today we do not know enough to develop an \n     effective program of improvement. Nor will continuation of \n     past research programs help, because they must rely upon the \n     existing structure of schools with the existing incentives \n     (or lack of incentives).\n       The issues of incentives and of devising ways to obtain \n     appropriate information is set out in more detail in Making \n     Schools Work.\\6\\ These are clearly complicated issues that \n     would require considerable change in focus by the federal and \n     state governments--turning from trying to dictate how schools \n     do their jobs to setting up incentives for good performance. \n     Contributors to Making Schools Work also openly admit that \n     there are many gaps in our knowledge and that improving \n     education is more likely if we attack the knowledge problems \n     directly instead of continuing policies that we know do not \n     work.\n\n\n                          investing in schools\n\n       There are powerful reasons to expand and improve investment \n     in human capital. Educational investments are in fact very \n     important for the U.S. economy, which has been built on a \n     skilled labor force and has capitalized on the presence of \n     skills, making human capital investments very important to \n     the economy. Moreover, many authors show that the labor \n     market value of the increased skills, as measured by \n     schooling level, has increased dramatically in recent years. \n     This valuation demonstrates that the economy continues to \n     need an evermore skilled labor force. Economists have \n     recently spent considerable time and effort trying to \n     understand why some countries grow faster than others, and \n     the majority opinion is that a nation's stock of human \n     capital is an important component of differential growth \n     rates. In addition, Americans have long thought of education \n     as a primary ingredient in providing equality of opportunity \n     to society--as a way of cutting down or breaking \n     intergenerational correlations of income and of trying to \n     provide opportunity to all of society. Taken together, these \n     provide important and relatively uncontroversial reasons for \n     us to continue our attention to education.\n       Acknowledging the need for investment does not, however, \n     lead to unqualified support for any policies labeled \n     ``investment in our youth'' or ``school improvement.'' Recent \n     policy discussions have been laced with programs that \n     fundamentally involve haphazard and ineffective spending on \n     schools and that offer little hope for gains in achievement. \n     The current set of class size proposals falls into this \n     category. President Clinton should leave class size policy to \n     schools and districts, and remain faithful to his greatest \n     achievement in education policy: redefining the goal of \n     school reform as results, not merely spending.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Pupil-teacher ratios differ from class size for a variety \n     of reasons including the provision of specialized instruction \n     (as with special education), the use of teachers in \n     supervisory and administrative roles,\n\n[[Page S12482]]\n\n     and the contractual classroom obligations of teachers. \n     Nonetheless, even though we have little longitudinal data for \n     class sizes, average class size will tend to move with pupil-\n     teacher ratios.\n     \\2\\ A more detailed discussion of the evidence along with \n     citations for the relevant work can be found in Eric A. \n     Hanushek, The Evidence on Class Size, Occasional Paper No. \n     98-1, W.

It offers politicians a way to make \n     headlines that please constituents.\n       But most respected academic research suggests that reducing \n     classes by one or two students has virtually no impact on the \n     quality of instruction.\n       Nonetheless, this year the General Assembly mandated that \n     Delaware's public school classrooms be limited to 22 \n     students. The idea was pushed by Rep. Timothy Boulden, R-\n     Newark, who no doubt thought he was doing the right thing. He \n     wasn't. He was pandering to parents who don't understand the \n     issue any more than he does. Research suggests that a home \n     environment that encourages learning is the most important \n     factor in success in school. But the government can't do much \n     about that.\n       Next comes teachers. It's no surprise that a highly \n     qualified teacher has enormous impact on students. And that's \n     a factor state government can do something about. But \n     legislators and other reformers have refused to deal with it \n     in any meaningful way this year.\n       There is discussion about increasing qualifications for \n     teacher certificates, regular recertification thereafter and \n     continuing professional development.\n       Teachers' salaries also must be part of improving this \n     standard. Delaware pays its teachers too little. We're losing \n     some of the best and brightest to neighboring states. This, \n     too, is something the General Assembly can do something \n     about--but doesn't.\n       Instead, it micromanages school systems with bills like \n     Rep. Boulden's class-size measure. It's quick, easy, \n     relatively inexpensive and popular. But smaller classes \n     aren't significant unless the numbers go down to 15 or fewer \n     students. That would cost hundreds of millions of dollars \n     (The current 22-student mandate cost $6.5 million.)\n       Most school districts are having difficulty meeting that \n     mandate as it is, in part because it came well after they had \n     planned the 1998-1999 school year. Many more classrooms are \n     required in some districts, and others have had to shift art, \n     music and physical education. Others might have to dismiss \n     librarians and counselors.\n       It's ridiculous. The General Assembly does the most harm \n     when it micromanages state agencies. It should set broad \n     goals and high standards, and then give the professionals the \n     tools they need to achieve them.\n\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been talking about the budget and \nthe way that the President of the United States wants to spend Social \nSecurity--the surplus. I want to talk to you about that in another \nline--the way that the White House wants to raise your taxes, and the \nway they are going to do it in November in a very subtle way. I am \ngoing to talk to you about jobs--your jobs--and the effort that is \nunderway by the White House to shift your job overseas. The White House \nhas been denying that. I know that the Energy Information \nAdministration confirms it, and how we will not only shift your job \noverseas, but we are going to charge more for everything that you buy.\n  Let me explain how this works. The new Energy Information \nAdministration estimate is very important for a couple of reasons. It \nproves that the White House is using funny numbers on global warming. \nIn my opinion, it also points out that we are spending a lot of time \ndebating the details of a treaty that is fundamentally flawed. I have \nalways said that something not worth doing at all is not worth doing \nwell. The administration has already bought the global warming treaty, \nand now we are trying to figure out how to pay for it. We are trying to \nfigure out how to make it work. It is as if we decided to sink the \nmother ship and now we need to figure out the cheapest way to rescue \nall of the people.\n  Mr. President, it is easy. Don't sink the ship. Sink the treaty. It \nis like saying that the Titanic is going down and we need to reorganize \nhow the deck chairs are placed.\n  I came to the floor in July and raised serious doubts about the \nnumbers that were dreamt up by the Council of Economic Advisers. The \ncouncil chairman, Janet Yellen, has testified twice that Kyoto would \ncost American families somewhere between $70 and $110 per year. I don't \nknow how you feel about it, but the people in Wyoming think that $70-\nodd to $110 per year more for Government taxes is a lot. But I want to \npoint out that the independent economists put those costs as high as \n$2,100 per year per household. That is a pretty good, hefty tax. And it \nis a $2,000 difference from what the administration is saying that it \nwill amount to.\n  I have tried to get the real numbers on this before. I have been \nstonewalled by the White House. Then I finally got some numbers that \nwere rather unintelligible. I asked questions about them. I got a \nletter from the White House Counsel's Office that said that public \ndisclosure of the real terms would set an unfortunate precedent that \ncould chill the free flow of internal discussions essential to \neffective executive decisionmaking.\n  In other words, the White House can't really share the numbers with \nus because we, the Congress, would have a chilling effect on policy-\nmaking? That is our realm. We need to have the data on which to \noperate. And the White House is the one in charge of providing that \ndata.\n  We have a credibility gap. We have a credibility gap with the \nadministration.\n  I think it is interesting to compare the cost estimates from the \nWhite House with the cost estimates from the independent Energy \nInformation Administration, part of the administration. The White House \nsays the annual average increase in household energy would be $70 to \n$110.\n  I have a little chart. This shows a few of the studies that have been \ndone on global warming. The red line is the administration. You will \nnotice that all of them that have been done are on the very bottom \nlevel. This is the one that says it is only going to cost you $70 to \n$110 a year. The blue line is the Energy Information Administration, \npart of the administration. This blue line, you will notice, appears at \nthe top of the list. That is what they say it is going to cost you --\n$335 to $1,740 per year per family.\n  The White House says gasoline would only go up to $1.31 a gallon. The \nEnergy Information Administration says $1.91 a gallon.\n  How about fuel oil? That is something our friends in the Northeast \nworry about. The White House says, ``Don't worry, it will only go up to \nabout $1.17 a gallon.'' The Energy Information Administration says it \nwill go up to $1.90 a gallon. Who do you want to believe? The \nadministration's low numbers or the administration's high numbers? You \nare the one paying the bill; which one would you trust?\n  I wanted you to know what kind of assumptions the Council of Economic \nAdvisers used. How did they get things to look so rosy? It turns out \nthey brought the cost down using two tricks. Their own internal report \nsaid they had to figure out some way to bring down the cost or it would \nnot be feasible. They already bought the treaty, now they have to \nfigure out why they bought the treaty. They want the American people to \nthink they got a good deal for you.\n  The two tricks they use are electricity deregulation and emissions \ntrading. That is how they make it seem to cost less, even though I \nthought we wanted to deregulate electricity to save the people back \nhome money. What we are going to do is deregulate it and use that money \nto pay for the global warming treaty. I guess now we\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\nneed to go back and tell them that the money is already spent if we \nderegulate, and it has to be deregulated because we have to spend the \nmoney. That seems to happen a lot around here.\n  Then the emissions trading scheme, that one takes the cake. Each of \nthe cost estimates I have seen include a range of credit trading \nscenarios. The assumption is the more credits we can buy, the cheaper \nit will be to meet our Kyoto commitments. That is the assumption: The \nmore we buy, the cheaper it gets. That is like going to the mall and \nsaving money by taking advantage of as many sales as you can. You still \nspend the money.\n  The Energy Information Administration says the credits will cost us \n$70 to $350 a term. In people terms, that is 15 cents to 70 cents a \ngallon of gas, up to an 80 percent increase in your electrical bill. \nAnd we thought deregulation would save us some money.\n  The range is as a result of not knowing how many countries will \nparticipate. If we have to buy all our credits only from Europe and \nRussia, they are going to be very expensive. That puts us in the $350-\nper-ton range. If we get countries like China and India to sell us \ntheir emission credits, we can get that cost down to $70. That is the \nassumption.\n  Do you know why they will sell us theirs for so low a price? They \ndon't have any ceiling. Last year I went to Kyoto. I got to meet with \nthe Chinese delegation. By the year 2012 they are going to be the \nbiggest polluters in the whole world and they will not be a part of the \ntreaty. Why not? They are a developing nation. They cannot be put under \nthose constraints. I asked them when they would be done being a \ndeveloping nation. They said, ``Never.'' Good negotiating. They even \ndeveloped a fine system so that if we pollute, we get fined, and the \nmoney goes to, guess who, the developing nations. They get the money \nthat way.\n  Now there is another scheme--sell credits. We buy the right to \npollute from China and the developing nations. They will sell it to us \nfor just $70 a ton because they have no limit. They are not really \nselling a quantity. They can sell as many units as they want. They are \nalready polluting; they can continue to pollute. Good deal for us? That \nis what the White House says we can do. We will pay China so we can \nhave the right to drive our cars and turn on our lights. We will pay \nChina so we can drive when we want to and where we want to. Just pay \nChina and you can turn on all your Christmas lights whenever you want. \nThey will already have the jobs.\n  In theory, China will limit its own emissions at some future level. \nIn the meantime, they will sell us permits, in theory. In theory the \nwhole world would participate and we would reduce the growth of carbon \nemissions and save the Earth from certain devastation--in theory.\n  I got to meet with those nations that are island nations; if global \nwarming happens, they will be inundated by water. They are not going to \nbe a part of the treaty. If this were a real problem and your country \nwas going to be inundated by water, wouldn't you sign the treaty? \nWouldn't you push every nation in the world to sign the treaty? I can \ntell you, they are not, which tells you what they think about global \nwarming.\n  It is a way to get jobs. It is a way to sell emission credits. The \nwhole world is not participating and the Earth will not be saved \nbecause the treaty will not reduce carbon emissions. In fact, we cannot \neven get the developing world to abide by copyright treaties, what \nmakes anybody think they will abide by an emissions treaty even if they \nsign it? Oh, no, the joke will be on us. It will be on the American \npeople. We are planning to pay China for a piece of paper that says, \n``We reduced our emissions by 1 ton so you can increase yours by 1 \nton.'' And we will pay them for that right. That is what it says.\n  What are we going to do if they just take the money and keep on \npolluting? And they have assured us they would. Are we going to send in \ntroops and demand our money back? The Energy Information Administration \nhas pointed out that this treaty would cost American families between \n$350 and $1,740 per year. That is what the private economists have been \nsaying. And it will eliminate jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to get a copy of this report and read it. In \nNovember the administration will go to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to \ncontinue negotiations on the Kyoto treaty. They plan to work out \nemissions trading enforcement provisions. These are two critical parts \nof how this treaty will hurt American families. People need to be \nmindful of this process. People need to protest this process. Now is \nthe time, not during the negotiations, not after the President has \nsigned and sent a treaty here that we have already said, 95 to 0, does \nnot meet the requirements for the economy in the United States, that it \nis just selling our economy.\n  A study conducted by DRI-McGraw-Hill estimated Kyoto could cost us \n1.5 million jobs. Charles River Associates put that figure as high as \n3.1 million jobs by 2010.\n  Even the Argonne National Laboratory, pointed to job losses in a \nstudy on the impact of higher energy prices on energy-intensive \nindustries. Argonne concluded that 200,000 American chemical workers \ncould lose their jobs. All of the American aluminum plants could close, \nputting another 20,000 workers out of work. Cement companies would move \nanother 6,000 jobs overseas. And nearly 100,000 U.S. steel workers \nwould be out of work.\n  Americans have a right to know what is going on, even if the Office \nof White House Counsel does not think so. They should have a chance to \nsee who is playing with their livelihoods.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Under a previous order, the \nSenator from Ohio is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first congratulate my colleague \nfrom Wyoming for a very eloquent and very thoughtful statement about a \nvery serious issue, a very serious problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12482-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12483-S12486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WESTERN HEMISPHERE DRUG ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago we introduced the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act. This bipartisan legislation, which now \nhas over one-third of the Senate as cosponsors, calls for an additional \n$2.6 billion investment in international counternarcotics efforts over \nthe next 3 years. With the additional resources provided in this \nlegislation, we can begin to restore a comprehensive eradication, \ninterdiction, and crop substitution strategy. I say ``restore.'' I say \nrestore because we currently are not making the same kind of effort to \nkeep drugs from entering the United States that we used to. Drugs are \nnow easy to find and easy to buy. As a result, the amount of drugs sold \non our streets and the number of people who use drugs, particularly our \nyoung people, is at an unprecedented high level. The facts demonstrate \nthe sobering trends.\n  The August 1998 National Survey of Drug Abuse report by the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Administration lists the following disturbing \nfacts: One, in 1997, 13.9 million Americans age 12 and over cited \nthemselves as ``current users'' of elicit drugs, a 7 percent increase \nover 1996's figure of 13 million Americans. That translates to nearly a \nmillion new users of drugs each year.\n  Second, from 1992 to 1997, the number of children age 12 to 17 who \nwere using illegal drugs has more than doubled and has increased by 27 \npercent, just from 1996 to 1997 alone.\n  For children age 12 to 17, first-time heroin use--which as we all \nknow can be fatal--surged an astounding 875 percent, from 1991 to 1996. \nThe overall number of past-month heroin users increased 378 percent \nfrom 1993 to 1997.\n  We cannot in good conscience and with a straight face say that our \ndrug control strategy is working. It is not. More children are using \ndrugs. With an abundant supply, drug traffickers now are seeking to \nincrease their sales by targeting children age 10, 11, 12. This is \nnothing less than an assault on the future of our children, on our \nfamilies, and on the future of our country itself. This is nothing less \nthan a threat to our national values and, yes, even our national \nsecurity.\n  All of this, though, begs the question: What are we doing wrong? \nClearly there is no one, simple answer. However, one thing is clear: \nour overall drug strategy is no longer balanced; it is imbalanced. To \nbe effective, our national drug strategy must have a\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\nstrong commitment in the following three areas. One is demand \nreduction, which consists of prevention, treatment and education \nprograms. These are, of course, administered by all levels of \ngovernment: Federal level, State level, and the local community as well \nas nonprofit and other private organizations. The second component is \ndomestic law enforcement which, again, has to be provided by all three \nlevels of government. And finally, No. 3, international eradication and \ninternational interdiction efforts, which is the sole responsibility of \nthe Federal Government, our sole responsibility.\n  These three components are really all interdependent--you need them \nall. A strong investment in each of them is necessary for each to work \nindividually and to work collectively. For example, a strong effort to \ndestroy or seize drugs at the source or outside the United States, both \nreduces the amount of drugs in the country and drives up the street \nprice. As we all know, higher prices will in fact reduce consumption. \nThis, in turn, helps our domestic law enforcement and demand reduction \nefforts.\n  As any football fan can tell us, a winning team is one that plays \nwell at all three phases of the game--offense, defense, and special \nteams.\n  The same is true with our antidrug strategy. All three components \nhave to be effective if our strategy is going to be a winning effort.\n  Mr. President, while I think the current administration has shown a \nclear commitment to demand reduction and domestic law enforcement \nprograms, the same, sadly, cannot be said for the international \neradication and interdiction components. This was not always the case. \nLet me turn to a chart.\n  In 1987, a $4.79 billion Federal drug control budget was divided as \nfollows: 29 percent for demand reduction programs; 38 percent for \ndomestic law enforcement; and 33 percent, one-third, for international \neradication and interdiction efforts. This balanced approach worked. It \nachieved real success. Limiting drug availability through interdiction \ndrove up the street price of drugs, reduced drug purity levels and, \nconsequently, reduced overall drug use.\n  From 1988 to 1991, total drug use declined by 13 percent, cocaine use \ndropped by 35 percent, and there was a 25-percent reduction in overall \ndrug use by adolescent Americans.\n  This balanced approach, however, ended in 1993, and by 1995 the $13.3 \nbillion national drug control budget was divided as follows: 35 percent \nfor demand reduction, 53 percent for law enforcement, but only--only--\n12 percent--only 12 percent for international interdiction efforts.\n  Though the overall antidrug budget increased almost threefold from \n1987 to 1995, the percentage allocated for international eradication \nand interdiction efforts decreased dramatically. This disruption only \nrecently has started to change. Unfortunately, the imbalance is still \nthere, and the figures still show that.\n  In the President's proposed $17 billion drug control budget for 1999, \n34 percent will be allocated for demand reduction, 52 percent for law \nenforcement, and 14 percent for international and interdiction efforts. \nThose are the numbers. But what really matters is what these numbers \nget you, what they buy, in terms of resources. The hard truth is that \nour drug interdiction presence --the ship, the air, and the manpower \ndedicated to keeping drugs from reaching our country--has eroded \ndramatically, and here are just a few examples.\n  One, the Department of Defense funding for counternarcotics decreased \nfrom $504.6 million in 1992 down to $214 million in 1995. That is a 57-\npercent decrease in only a period of 3 years. As a result, flight hours \nby our AWACS planes dropped from 38,100 hours in 1992 down to 17,713 \nhours by 1996, a 54-percent reduction.\n  Another example: At the beginning of the decade, the U.S. Customs \nService operated counternarcotics activities around the clock. This \nmade sense because drug trafficking is a 7-day, 24-hour enterprise. \nToday, the Customs Service does not have the resources to maintain \nthese around-the-clock operations. In a recent hearing on our \nlegislation, the original piece of legislation we introduced, a \nrepresentative of the U.S. Customs Service testified that the Customs \nService has 84 boats in the Caribbean in drug apprehension efforts, and \nthat is down from 200 vessels in 1990--200 down to 84.\n  The Customs Service estimates that they expect to have only half of \nthe current fleet of 84 vessels by the year 2000, if present trends and \nprojections continue--half again.\n  These, I believe, are shocking statistics, and, perhaps more than the \nbudget numbers themselves, these statistics demonstrate the imbalance \nin our overall drug strategy. We have to have a balanced strategy. All \nportions are needed.\n  I have witnessed the lack of our resources and commitment in the \nregion firsthand. This past year, I traveled to the Caribbean several \ntimes to see our counternarcotics operations there. I met with the \ndedicated people on the front lines of our drug interdiction efforts. I \nwitnessed our strategy in action and sat down with the experts, both \nmilitary and civilian--our experts who are charged with carrying out \nthe monitoring, the detection, and the interdiction of drugs.\n  On one of my recent trips, I saw, in particular, Haiti has become the \nattractive rest stop on the cocaine highway. You can tell, when looking \nat the map, why that would be. It is strategically located about \nhalfway between the source country, Colombia, and the United States. As \nthe poorest country in the hemisphere, it is extremely vulnerable to \nthe kind of bribery and corruption that the drug trade needs in order \nto flourish.\n  Not surprisingly, the level of drugs moving through Haiti has \ndramatically increased. A U.S. Government interagency assessment on \ncocaine movement found that the total amount of cocaine coming from the \nUnited States through Haiti jumped from 5-percent in 1996 now up to 19 \npercent by the end of 1997.\n  In response to that, we initiated a U.S. law enforcement operation \ncalled Operation Frontier Lance. Operation Frontier Lance utilized \nCoast Guard cutters, speed boats, and helicopters to detect and capture \ndrug dealers on a 24-hour-per-day basis. This operation was modeled \nafter another successful interdiction effort that was first done off \nthe coast of Puerto Rico, and that operation was called Operation \nFrontier Shield. Both these operations were done in two different time \nperiods. Operation Frontier Shield utilized nearly 2 dozen ships and \naircraft, and Operation Frontier Lance utilized more than a dozen ships \nand helicopters.\n  To make Operation Frontier Lance work ultimately required that we \nborrow a few ships and helicopters from operations elsewhere in the \nCaribbean. Because of our scarce resources, frankly, we had to rob \nPeter to pay Paul, as they say. But these operations produced amazing \nresults. The 6-month operation in Puerto Rico resulted in the seizure \nof more than 32,000 pounds of cocaine and 120 arrests. The 3-month \noperation in Haiti resulted in 2,990 pounds of cocaine seized and 22 \narrests.\n  Mr. President, these operations demonstrate we can make a big \ndifference--a big difference--if we provide the right levels of \nmaterial and the right levels of manpower to fight drug trafficking. \nThey worked.\n  Having had this success, one would think that these operations would \nserve as a model for the entire region, that we would be able to \nduplicate them, replicate them. Instead of maintaining these \noperations, we ended them. This potential roadblock on the cocaine \nhighway is no more. Now in Puerto Rico, we only have a combined total \nof six air and sea assets doing maintenance operations.\n  So this figure, Mr. President, represented by these helicopters and \nships has been dramatically changed. That is what has happened. That \nhas been the change--down to six in that region.\n\n  In Puerto Rico today, we only have a combined total of six air and \nsea assets doing maintenance operations.\n  In Haiti and the Dominican Republic--off the coast of Haiti and the \nDominican Republic--we only have one ship and one helicopter devoted \nfor the drug operation. That is what we are down to here--just one. So \nwe can take all of these off at once.\n  We should keep in mind also that since refugees remain a major \nproblem in this area, these very few vessels are not dedicated solely \nand exclusively to the antidrug effort. Amazingly, no sooner than we \nbuilt an effective wall against drug traffickers we tore it down.\n\n[[Page S12485]]\n\n  While in the region, I was surprised to learn in the eastern Pacific, \noff the coast of Mexico and Central America, the coast is literally \nclear for the drug lords to do their business. This is, without a \ndoubt, unacceptable. That whole region--that whole region--is literally \nclear for the drug lords, the entire eastern Pacific.\n  Again, we have no presence there because we lack the resources. An \ninterdiction plan does exist for the region which would involve the \ndeployment of several ships and planes in the region. This operation, \nhowever, unfortunately, was canceled. It was canceled before it even \ngot started because the resources were needed elsewhere. To date, the \ncoastal waters in the eastern Pacific remain an open sea expressway for \ndrug business.\n  Mr. President, through my visits to the region I have seen firsthand \nthe dramatic decline in our eradication and interdiction capacity. The \nresults of this decline have been a decline in cocaine seizures, a \ndecline in the price of cocaine, and an increase in drug use. This has \nto stop. It is a clear and imminent danger to the very heart of our \nsociety. That is why this legislation is timely. We need to dedicate \nmore resources for international efforts to help reverse this trend.\n  I want to make it very clear, as I think I have time and time again, \nthat I strongly support our continued commitment in demand reduction \nand in law enforcement programs. In the end, I believe that reducing \ndemand is the only real way to permanently end illegal drug use. \nHowever, this is not going to happen overnight. That is why we need a \ncomprehensive counterdrug strategy that addresses all components of \nthis problem.\n  There is another fundamental reason, why the Federal Government must \ndo more to stop drugs, either at the source or in transit, as they are \ncoming into the United States. If we do not, no one else will. Let me \nremind my colleagues that our antidrug efforts here at home are done in \ncooperation with State and local governments and scores of nonprofit \nand private organizations. However, only the Federal Government has the \nability and the responsibility to keep drugs from crossing into this \ncountry. Only the Federal Government has the ability to help deal with \nthe problem at the source level. Only the Federal Government has the \nability to stop drugs in the transit routes. That is our \nresponsibility, and the buck should stop here.\n  But, it is not just an issue of responsibility. I think it is an \nissue of leadership. The United States has to demonstrate leadership on \nan international level if we expect to get the full cooperation of \nsource countries, where the drugs originate, countries such as \nColombia, Peru and Bolivia, as well as countries in the transit zone, \nincluding Mexico and the Caribbean island governments. There is little \nincentive for these countries to invest their limited resources and \nrisk the lives of their law enforcement officers to stop drug \ntrafficking unless we provide the leadership and the resources \nnecessary to make a serious dent in the drug trade.\n  Our bill is designed to provide resources and to demonstrate to our \nfriends in the Caribbean and in Central and South America that we \nintend to lead once again. With this legislation, we can once again \nmake it difficult for drug lords to bring drugs to our country and make \ndrugs far more costly to buy.\n  It is clear drug trafficking imposes a heavy toll on law-abiding \ncitizens and communities across our great country. It is time we make \nit a dangerous and costly business once again for drug traffickers \nthemselves. A renewed investment in international and interdiction \nprograms will make a huge difference, both in the flow and the cost of \nillegal drugs. It worked before and we believe it can work again.\n  As I said at the beginning, my colleagues and I reintroduced this \nlegislation a few weeks ago. Since we introduced our original bill in \nJuly, we have received a number of suggestions on ways to improve the \nlegislation, including several provided in conversations I personally \nhad with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Director of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes to \nconclude my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleagues and I thank the Chair.\n  Some of these suggestions we incorporated in the House bill first \nintroduced by Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida and Congressman \nDennis Hastert of Illinois. The House passed the McCollum-Hastert bill \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support. The final vote was 384-39. \nClearly, the overwhelming bipartisan show of support for the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act is a wake-up call--a wake-up call--for \nleadership. It is time the United States once again led the way in a \ncomprehensive and balanced strategy to reduce drug use; and the time \nfor leadership is now.\n  Since House passage of the bill, I have reached out once again to the \ndrug czar and to my friends on the Democrat side of the aisle to try to \ndetermine how we can work together to strengthen our drug interdiction \nefforts and our overall antidrug strategy. Again, we have received very \nconstructive suggestions, and I am hopeful this dialogue will yield \npositive results in the future.\n  Mr. President, the resources we would provide in our legislation \nshould be of no surprise to anyone involved in our drug control \npolicies. The vast majority of the items in this bill are the very \nitems which the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Coast Guard and \nCustoms Service have been requesting for quite some time. Many of these \nitems are detailed, practically item per item and dollar amount, in the \nUnited States Interdiction Coordinator report, known as USIC, which was \noriginally requested by the drug czar.\n  The new drug bill that we have introduced represents a good-faith \neffort by the sponsors of this legislation to get something done this \nyear. It includes almost all of the changes made in the House-passed \nbill and incorporates virtually every suggestion made by the drug czar. \nOf central concern to the general, as he expressed in his recent \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was the need \nfor greater flexibility. And I agree and I understand.\n  Our new bill provides flexibility for the agencies to determine and \nacquire the assets best needed for their respective drug interdiction \nmissions. It also provides more flexibility for the administration in \nproviding needed resources to Latin American countries.\n  Mr. President, thanks to the suggestions we have received, the bill \nis a better bill. It has far more bipartisan support than the first \nversion. Again, the growing support for this legislation is not \nsurprising. This is not a partisan issue. We need to do more to fight \ndrugs outside our borders.\n  But let's be frank. In this antidrug effort, Congress is the antidrug \nfunder but the agencies represented here--the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, Customs, Coast Guard, State and Defense Departments, \nand the Drug Czar's Office--they are the antidrug fighters. They are \nthe ones who are doing the job. The dedicated men and women of these \nagencies are working to keep drugs out of the hands of our children. \nAnd all we are trying to do is to give them the additional resources \nthey requested to make that work result in a real reduction in drug \nuse. This bill is just the first step in our efforts to work with the \nagencies represented here. I expect to do more in the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that while this bill \nis an authorization measure, I have already started the process to \nrequest the money needed for this bill over 3 years. Even though we \nintroduced the bill for the first time in late July, we have already \nsecured $143 million through the Senate passed fy 1999 appropriation \nmeasures. Senators Coverdell, Graham of Florida, Grassley, Bond, \nFaircloth, and myself requested these funds through the various \nappropriation measures.\n  Given that it will take some time to dedicate some of our larger \nassets, such as boats, airplanes, and helicopters, we need to start \ninvesting in these resources as soon as possible.\n  I recognize that even as we finally are beginning to balance our \nbudget, we still have to exercise fiscal responsibility. I believe \neffective drug interdiction is not only good social policy, it is sound \nfiscal policy as well. It is important to note that seizing or \ndestroying a ton of cocaine in source or\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\ntransit areas is more cost-effective than trying to seize the same \nquantity of drugs at the point of sale. But more important, are the \nshort and long term costs if we do not act to reverse the tragic rise \nin drug use by our children.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that there are more than twice the number \nof children aged 12 to 17 using drugs today than there were 5 years \nago. With more kids using drugs, we have more of the problems \nassociated with youth drug use--violence, criminal activity, and \ndelinquency. Children are dying--either from drug use or drug-related \nviolence. We will have more of the same unless we take action now to \nrestore a balanced drug control strategy. We have to have all the \ncomponents of our drug strategy working effectively again.\n  We did it before and we succeeded.\n  If we pass the Western Hemisphere drug elimination bill we can take \nthe first step toward success. We can provide the resources, and most \nimportantly, the leadership to reduce drugs at the source or in \ntransit.\n  In the end, Mr. President, that is what this bill is about--it is \nabout leadership--effective leadership. We have an opportunity with \nthis legislation to show and exercise leadership. I hope we can seize \nthis opportunity to stop drug trafficking, and more important, to save \nlives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, if the Senator knows of a Senator who wishes \nto speak, that is one thing. I know Senator Gramm wants to speak for 30 \nminutes. He inquired through a staff person as to whether or not I \nwould make the request for him. I hope the Senator will not object to \nMr. Gramm following the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will not object.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for allowing me to go first. Mr. President, \nthe reason I didn't say anything initially is because I hoped to be \nable to still make my commitment in Delaware and hear the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I mean that sincerely. It is rare for the Senator from \nWest Virginia ever to take the floor if he does not have a serious \npiece of business to conduct. He is going to speak on the same subject \nI am speaking to. I will not get to hear his speech, but I am sure I \nwill read it in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I had originally intended today to introduce a \nresolution authorizing United States airstrikes against Yugoslavia in \nconnection with the Kosovo crisis because I believe our Constitution \nrequires the President to come to us for that authority. I have \ndecided, however, not to offer the resolution because of recent \ndevelopments, not on the constitutional front, but recent developments \non the ground. The reality is that we are about to go out of session, \nand my ability to get a vote on this issue is problematic, at best.\n  Instead, I rise to discuss the implications for U.S. policy regarding \nthe agreement on Kosovo worked out 2 days ago by Ambassador Richard \nHolbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, after more than a \nweek of intensive negotiations.\n  I might note that it seems at every important point in our history we \nhave diplomats and elected officials who rise to the occasion to meet \nthe needs of the Nation. I would like to suggest that Richard Holbrooke \nis the right man, at the right time, at the right spot. I compliment \nhim. We are fortunate to have his diplomatic skills available to this \nNation at this moment.\n  On Monday, NATO's 16 member nations voted unanimously for what they \ncall an ACTORD. That is military terminology for an activation order, \nwhich allowed the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. General Wes \nClark, to order airstrikes, which reportedly would begin with cruise \nmissiles and escalate to a phased bombing campaign that would move \nbeyond Kosovo.\n  Because this action order was taken, I believe, and only because of \nthis, our negotiator, Mr. Holbrooke, was able to get an agreement from \nMr. Milosevic, the criminal President of the Republic of Yugoslavia, to \nagree to certain of NATO's demands. In response, the alliance has \npostponed launching the airstrikes, which have been authorized for 4 \ndays, in order to assess whether or not he, Mr. Milosevic, will comply. \nI assure you that he will not comply if he believes we are not serious \nabout using significant force. The cruise missiles are now on immediate \nstandby; B-52s stand ready on the runway equipped with cruise missiles \nto move if Milosevic fails to meet his commitments. The cruise missiles \nare now in immediate standby until Friday evening, U.S. eastern \ndaylight time.\n  In addition, more than 400 allied aircraft, the majority of them \nAmerican, remain available for a phased air campaign, should that later \nbecome necessary.\n  Mr. President, let me give my assessment right up front. As I said, I \nbelieve that Ambassador Holbrooke has done a good job. The agreement he \nnegotiated in Belgrade is a good one, as long as we can be sure that if \nMilosevic does not keep his word, NATO air power will be used against \nthe Yugoslav military and security forces.\n  I must tell you, as the senior member in the minority on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have mixed emotions about Milosevic's having \nagreed. I believe he only understands force. I believe that he is the \nproblem. I believe that, ultimately, force will have to be used. And, \nquite frankly, I wish we had just used this force.\n  Mr. President, this agreement has, at least temporarily, averted NATO \nairstrikes against Yugoslavia, which, as I indicated, I strongly \nsupport. I support them recognizing that they would have endangered the \nlives of American military personnel, which I do not take\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\nlightly. But we must honestly and forthrightly point out to the \nAmerican people that although the risk was low for high casualties, it \nwas high for some casualties. No one wants war, and this agreement may, \nin fact, begin to lay the foundation for a political settlement of the \ncrisis in Kosovo. We must understand, though, that war has not been \npermanently averted in Kosovo.\n  I would like to review the substance of the agreement negotiated, \nwhose broad outlines are clear, but whose details understandably remain \nto be hammered out over the next several days. Milosevic, according to \nthe agreement, must take several steps:\n  First, he must maintain a cease-fire and scale back the presence of \nboth the special police, the so-called MUP, and of the Yugoslav Army, \nor VJ, to February 1998 levels, dropping the regular army presence from \n18,000 to 12,500 and the MUP from 11,000 to 6,500. I, and others, I am \nsure, including Ambassador Holbrooke, would have liked to have seen it \ntaken back further. But I acknowledge that this was what was possible.\n  Second, Milosevic must sign an agreement with the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe--the so-called OSCE--to allow up to \n2,000 ``compliance verifiers'' full access on the ground in Kosovo to \nmake sure that Milosevic is keeping his promises.\n  Third, Milosevic must sign an agreement with NATO to allow unarmed \naircraft to fly over Kosovo to verify compliance with the cease-fire.\n  Fourth, he must begin serious negotiations with the Kosovars by \nNovember 2, with a goal of giving Kosovo at least autonomy within \nSerbia.\n  Fifth, he must allow complete access for humanitarian organizations \nto deliver assistance to the hundreds of thousands of internally \ndisplaced persons within Kosovo. These are the people you see on \ntelevision, huddled in tents in the middle of fields and out in the \nforests.\n  I believe it is unrealistic to think that Milosevic can draw down the \nspecial police and the Army units in Kosovo to February levels by the \ntime the Serb-Kosovar negotiations begin on November 2, but he will \nhave to have shown substantial movement in that direction by that time.\n  Within a day or two, we can expect a statement by Milosevic proposing \na timetable for negotiations with the Kosovars. These negotiations are \nsupposed to be without preconditions. But the United States has made it \nclear that it expects Kosovo to regain a substantial part of the \nautonomy within Serbia that it lost in 1989. Although we do not presume \nto negotiate for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA, or for Dr. \nIbrahim Rugova, the moderate Kosovar leader, that is the minimum we \nexpect.\n  Yesterday, Serbia's President, a Milosevic puppet, announced support \nfor elections to a Kosovo parliament, a general amnesty, and the \nformation of a Kosovar police force to maintain order over the ethnic \nAlbanian community that comprises more than 90 percent of Kosovo's \npopulation.\n  President Clinton has described the verification regime that \nMilosevic has agreed to as intrusive. It gives the OSCE verifiers a \nbroad mandate, including the authority to establish a permanent \npresence in locations of their choosing in Kosovo, to accompany \nremaining Serb military units on patrol, and to coordinate humanitarian \nrelief efforts. These verifiers would be backed up by American U2 spy \nplanes and lower altitude P3 Orions and British Canberra photo \nreconnaissance planes to verify that compliance was underway. The \nverifiers will be unarmed, but NATO is putting together what we refer \nto as an over-the-horizon Quick Reaction Force, which will be ready to \nintervene on short notice if problems arise.\n  Let me explain what was meant by that. There will be armed NATO \nmilitary on the ground--not in Kosovo, not in Serbia--ready to react \nand cross the border if, in fact, Milosevic goes back to his ways of \nethnic cleansing.\n  Although the basing of this Quick Reaction Force has not yet been \nannounced, I am told that there is an increasing likelihood that \nMacedonia, rather than Hungary or Italy, will be chosen as the \nlocation. Obviously, military requirements must dictate the basing \ndecision, but in my view the choice of Macedonia would provide a needed \npolitical and psychological boost for that small country, which itself \nhas a restive ethnic Albanian minority.\n  I feel our European allies should take the lead on this Quick \nReaction Force. I have reason to believe that the United Kingdom, which \nis in the best position of our allies to play such a role, may step up \nto the plate and take on this responsibility.\n  Meanwhile, Milosevic has, as expected, orchestrated the crisis to \nmove against domestic opposition within Serbia. Democratic politicians \nin Serbia--and there are some--have been threatened. Many independent \nradio stations have been forced off the air, and dozens of university \nprofessors who find Milosevic's conduct abhorrent, have been dismissed.\n  Diplomacy is not an easy art. Ambassador Holbrooke, as I said \nearlier, is to be congratulated for his persistence and stamina in \ncrafting this agreement. As yet, no text has been released, and many of \nthe details remain to be worked out in the coming days.\n  Although all Kosovar politicians, from the nonviolent leader Dr. \nRugova to the KLA, vociferously maintain their insistence on \nindependence for Kosovo, I believe most are prepared to accept the \nreturn of the pre-1989 autonomy, with the decision on the final status \nto be deferred for several years.\n  My supposition is that between now and November 2, U.S. diplomats \nwill work on a fresh draft that will be accepted by Milosevic and the \nKosovars as the basis for negotiations. This will not be an easy task.\n  Assuming that the Belgrade agreement holds, where are we, and what \nare the implications for U.S. policy?\n  In the short term, the Belgrade agreement will be seen by some in the \nBalkans as a victory for Milosevic, since Kosovo will remain part of \nSerbia and the KLA, temporarily at least, will be denied its goal of \nindependence. I might add, though, that in the short term, a NATO air \ncampaign, most likely would also have redounded to Milosevic's credit, \nsince the Serbs' first reaction would have been to rally round their \nflag.\n  It is important to note, however, that if the Belgrade agreement is \nimplemented, Serbian sovereignty will be undermined by the large \ninternational presence with wide powers and, eventually, I believe, by \nsome sort of stipulation regarding a decision on final political status \nfor Kosovo after a period of several years.\n  As I have said many times on this floor, I do not favor independence \nfor Kosovo. It would send the message in the region that state \nboundaries should be determined by ethnicity. The first casualty of \nindependence of Kosovo at this moment would be the multiethnic, \nmultireligious, democratic Bosnia-Herzegovina that underpins Dayton and \nis the goal of American policy. I believe it would also seriously \ndestabilize neighboring Macedonia.\n  Instead of independence, I have argued for a status in Kosovo between \nthat of autonomy within Serbia and independence. But that is for the \nparties to work out. This could possibly take the form of republic \nstatus within Yugoslavia, but within a democratic Yugoslavia, not the \ncurrent plaything of the thug named Milosevic.\n  That brings me to the fundamental Balkan policy point that we should \ncease regarding Milosevic as part of the solution rather than as the \nproblem incarnate. There is simply no chance for peace in the long term \nin the region until Milosevic is replaced by a democratic government in \nBelgrade that is willing to grant cultural and political rights to all \nof its citizens, Serbs and non-Serbs alike, and to respect the \nsovereignty of its neighbors.\n  I have no illusions that Belgrade is full of politicians who read \nJefferson and Madison in their spare time. Nonetheless, I do not think \nwe have paid adequate attention to the democratic opposition that does \nexist. Let's not forget that a democratic coalition did win control of \n17 major city councils, including that of Belgrade, in the elections of \nNovember 1996. Even now, despite many divisions within the democratic \nranks, there are significant elements in Serbian politics, in the \nSerbian Orthodox Church, among journalists, and in academe that could \nand should be assisted in a major way by the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\n  For now, Milosevic has strengthened his grip on power by suppressing \nmuch of the opposition and spinning the news to emphasize his defiance \nof the West and NATO's supposed backing down, but that will be short \nlived. As Serbia's already pathetic economy worsens, opportunities will \nreemerge for a broad-based democratic opposition to challenge \nMilosevic.\n  We should be patient while protecting life.\n  We should lay the groundwork for that day by continuing to insist \nthat the Serbian authorities lift the onerous restrictions under which \nthe independent media chafe, by funding those independent media, and by \nencouraging intensive contact between democratic Western political \nparties and trade unions and their Serbian counterparts.\n  In my first visit to Serbia, when I had a long meeting in Belgrade in \n1993 with Milosevic, I indicated to him then as forthrightly as I could \nwhen he asked what I thought of him, I said to him in the privacy of \nhis office, ``Mr. President, I think you are a war criminal and should \nbe tried as such.''\n  I then met with over 100 people in opposition to Milosevic of all \nstripes, some extreme nationalists in opposition and some Democrats.\n  The only point I wish to make is that there are roots for democratic \ngrowth in Serbia, and we should seek them out.\n  In the coming days, NATO must watch Milosevic like a hawk and not be \nafraid to act militarily if he fails to fulfill the terms of the \nBelgrade agreement, particularly the movement toward reducing the \nnumbers of his special police in Kosovo and sending the army back to \nits barracks and its heavy weaponry into cantonments.\n  One must not forget, Mr. President, who have been the big losers in \nthe tragedy of the last eight months. They are the approximately one-\nthird of the Kosovar population whose ranks include perhaps one \nthousand killed, over three hundred thousand driven from their homes, \nand over four hundred villages destroyed.\n  All this in order for Milosevic, whose legacy already includes \nhundreds of thousands of Bosnian and Croatian dead, to cling to power \nby once again diverting the attention of the Serbian people from the \nfailure of his ignorant and hopelessly inept domestic policies.\n  At least we can be thankful that if the Belgrade agreement is \nimplemented, international relief supplies should reach the hundreds of \nthousands of displaced Kosovars, including many living in the open, \nthereby preventing massive fatalities this winter.\n  On the wider stage, NATO has set the important precedent that in \ncertain circumstances it has the right to intervene in the internal \naffairs of a European state, without an explicit U.N. Security Council \nauthorization.\n  This is a big deal.\n  NATO has also made clear to Russia that, in accordance with the 1997 \nNATO-Russia Founding Act, negotiated by NATO Secretary General Solana \nand the President of the United States, Moscow has ``a voice, not a \nveto'' over NATO policy. That has been reemphasized here as well.\n\n  Nevertheless, partly because of Russian objections and partly because \nof the congenital Western European aversion to using force to achieve \npolitical ends, NATO waited several months too long to create the \ncredible threat necessary to compel Milosevic to stop his brutal \nrepression notwithstanding U.S. urging.\n  In effect, the delay enabled Milosevic to complete the short-term \ndestruction of the KLA and the ethnic cleansing in western and central \nKosovo that he desired.\n  If similar crises arise in the future, we should give ad hoc bodies \nlike the Contact Group one chance to get its act together.\n  If it doesn't, then we should, without delay, go to NATO and call for \nresolute action.\n  The kind of ethnic conflict we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo was \nspecifically mentioned in NATO's so-called Strategic Concept nearly \nseven years ago as the prototype for threats to the alliance in the \npost-Cold War era.\n  So this is not a surprise to NATO. For that reason--not to mention \nthe thousands of lives that can be spared--we must never again allow \nracist thugs like Milosevic to carry out their outrages while the \nalliance dawdles.\n  The Belgrade agreement on Kosovo is a first step in the right \ndirection. And President Clinton should be complimented. Its details \nneed to be fleshed out.\n  After they are we must brook no more opposition from Milosevic on its \nimplementation. To use a domestic American term, we must adopt a policy \nof ``zero tolerance'' with the Yugoslav bully.\n  Many of us had hoped that the mistakes that enabled the Bosnian \nhorrors to take place would teach us a lesson.\n  Unfortunately, we have repeated many of those errors and have thereby \nallowed Milosevic and his storm troopers to repeat their atrocities in \nKosovo.\n  Twice is enough. There must not be a third time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I particularly thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, my \nleader.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the first time in weeks, the news from \nBelgrade regarding Kosovo is encouraging. It would appear--with \nemphasis on the word ``appear''--that Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to \nNATO's terms to withdraw his forces, begin peace negotiations, and \nallow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo.\n  If Mr. Milosevic can be taken at his word, this is truly a turning \npoint in the negotiations. Unfortunately, as we know from the trail of \nbroken promises and from the trail of tears he has left in his wake, \nSlobodan Milosevic's word is worthless. Hopefully, the concurrent \naction NATO has taken to authorize air strikes if Mr. Milosevic does \nnot abide by the agreement will be sufficient to persuade him to \ncooperate. I have my doubts.\n  As welcome as these new developments are, they do not let Congress \noff the hook. Over the past several weeks, as we have rushed to \ncomplete our work prior to adjournment, we have tiptoed carefully \naround the role of Congress in authorizing military intervention in \nKosovo without ever mustering up the courage to confront the issue head \non.\n  On the topic of Kosovo, we have lectured, we have criticized, we have \nurged this or that action, but we have been strangely silent on the \nsubject of introducing and voting up or down on a resolution that would \nfulfill our duty, under both the Constitution and the War Powers \nResolution, to authorize the use of force in Kosovo and throughout \nSerbia.\n  The Constitution invests in Congress the power to declare war. The \nWar Powers Resolution prohibits the President from waging war beyond 60 \ndays without Congressional authorization. Whether we are acting \nunilaterally, or as part of a multinational force, or as one member of \na formal alliance such at NATO, the burden of responsibility on the \nCongress is the same.\n  The bottom line here is that Congress has a duty to authorize the use \nof force if and when offensive military action is called for. By \nblinking at the prospect of an authorization of force resolution, we \nare abdicating our responsibility to the Executive Branch and shirking \nour duty to the nation.\n  For weeks, Congress has wrung its hands over conditions in Kosovo \nwhile NATO was moving toward a military showdown in the region and \nwhile some of us were making solemn speeches condemning the brutality \nof Mr. Milosevic, our NATO allies were moving to authorize air strikes \nin and around Kosovo. The agreement reached with Milosevic has, at the \nvery least, bought some time, but it has by no means removed the threat \nof military intervention in Kosovo. If NATO chooses to move forward \nwith air strikes in the next few days or weeks, Congress, the only \nbranch of Government with the power to declare war, will be just \nanother bystander, watching from the sidelines as U.S. troops are \nplaced in a hostile environment.\n  Mr. President, none of us wants to rush this nation into military \nconflict. None of us wants to place the life of even one American at \nrisk. None of us\n\n[[Page S12489]]\n\nwants to give the order to shoot. But we do not have the luxury of \navoiding such decisions. Whether we like it or not, Congress cannot \nbury its head in the sand when faced with tough issues like declaring \nwar or authorizing military action overseas. And whether we wish to \nadmit it or not, that is exactly what Congress is doing. When it comes \nto tough issues like Kosovo, Congress seems to want it both ways: we \nwant to be able to criticize the administration, but we do not want to \nstep up to the plate and take the responsibility of giving the \nadministration any guidance.\n  Now, this matter of responsibility is a two-way street. Congress has \nresponsibility, but so does the administration--at the other end of the \navenue. The administration has the responsibility--the duty--to consult \nwith Congress before committing to military action. And the \nadministration has been woefully remiss in accepting its share of the \nresponsibility.\n  This administration, like so many before it, seems to have confused \nthe concept of consultation on the one hand with the act of advising on \nthe other. Advising Congress of what the administration has already \ndecided to do does not constitute consultation. And charging ahead \nwithout making a case to Congress and to the American people does not \neven constitute common sense.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have been troubled by several aspects \nof the proposed military intervention in Kosovo by the United States \nand NATO, particularly by the absence of a clear-cut game plan beyond \nthe initial air strikes. Given the complexity of the problem and the \npotential consequences of any action we take, it is inexcusable and \nfrankly foolhardy for the administration to wait until the eleventh \nhour to make its case to Congress.\n  Yes, Congress has the responsibility to exercise its constitutional \nauthority, but that does not give the administration the right to toss \nwhat amounts to a live grenade into Congress's lap and expect action \nbefore that grenade explodes. Yet, that is the situation with which we \nwere forced to deal. We were told by the administration that air \nstrikes could come at any time once NATO reached consensus on such \naction. We were alerted that American citizens were being evacuated \nfrom Yugoslavia. We watched American diplomats ping-ponging back and \nforth between Washington and Belgrade and Brussels. And we were given \nto understand that the administration would like for Congress to \nendorse its efforts.\n  Mr. President, this is no way to conduct grave matters of war and \npeace. I congratulate the administration officials who have been \ntirelessly working to find a solution to the perilous situation in \nKosovo. I am convinced that Secretary of Defense Cohen and Special \nEnvoy Richard Holbrooke have gone the extra mile--literally--to end the \nbloodshed and turmoil in Kosovo, and to bring Mr. Milosevic to the \nbargaining table. I spent over an hour meeting with Secretary Cohen \nthis past week, and I believe he understands fully the stakes involved \nin attempting to broker peace through the use of force in the Balkans. \nI am confident that he is well aware of the risks and uncertainties \nassociated with the actions that have been taken and those being \ncontemplated by the United States and our allies.\n  I am not ready to give the administration a blanket endorsement--or a \nblank check--to carry out any plan for NATO air strikes on Kosovo. I \nbelieve there are too many loose ends, too many uncertainties. But I am \nequally unwilling to close my eyes to the problem and simply let the \nchips fall where they may. I commend Senator Daschle and Senator Biden \nand Senator Levin and others for the efforts they have made to deal \nwith this situation. They are among a number of Senators who have \nworked to craft a resolution authorizing U.S. intervention in Kosovo, \nif wisdom dictates such intervention. I appreciate their taking my \nconcerns into account as they worked to draft a resolution. They took \nmy concerns into account by incorporating into the resolution \nprovisions that would place some restraints on the administration, \nguard against an open-ended mission, in terms of its length and scope, \nand inject some accountability into the operation, without \nmicromanaging the process. The result may or may not have been the best \nsolution; it may or may not have been a resolution that I or a majority \nof my colleagues could have supported after reasonable debate, but at \nthe very least, it was an effort to acknowledge our constitutional \nresponsibility and articulate our concerns.\n  Unfortunately, the clock up there on the wall is ticking, and this \nSenate has neither the time nor the inclination to take up such a \nresolution, particularly in light of the recent breakthrough in \nnegotiations. I sincerely hope that the agreement Mr. Holbrooke has \nachieved in Belgrade means that military intervention will be averted, \nbut I have little confidence that Mr. Milosevic will honor his \ncommitment.\n  I have a feeling he may do the same as Saddam Hussein has done in \nIraq. Just watch.\n  I would recommend that the sine die adjournment resolution contain \nauthority to call Congress back into session. I am not talking about \nthe President calling us back. He has that right under the \nConstitution. I am talking about our own leadership calling Congress \nback into session in order to deal with any crisis that might erupt \nover the period between the end of this Congress and the beginning of \nthe 106th Congress. I further recommend that the administration \nimmediately institute new procedures to truly consult with Congress \nbefore committing American troops to hostilities overseas.\n  Mr. President, I have heard this old record played and replayed over \nand over and over again; a process in which we Senators on both sides \nof the aisle will be notified that there will be a meeting in room 407, \nwhere classified information can be divulged, at such and such a time, \nsuch and such a date. And the administration will appear there, the \nadministration's Representatives will appear there. I have been to \nseveral of those meetings.\n  Very, very seldom have I found anything, any information divulged in \nthose meetings that I haven't already read in the newspapers. And yet \nthe administration, whether it be this one or a preceding \nadministration, feels that the administration has consulted with \nCongress. The administration hasn't consulted at all. They appear up \nthere, and many times they appear to be talking down to us as though we \nare new kids on the block, they know it all and we should just be nice, \nnice boys and girls; they will handle everything; they know everything.\n  For me, as far as I am concerned, for the most part, it has become an \nempty exercise to go up to room 407 and listen to the administration's \npeople. Consultation involves far more than that.\n  In addition to the elected leadership of the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives, I think the administration should consult--and I do \nmean consult, not merely advise--the chairmen, no matter what their \ngender, and the ranking members of the Appropriations, Armed Services, \nForeign Relations and Intelligence Committees.\n  If military action becomes necessary in Kosovo, the administration \nwill have to come back to Congress to pay for the operation, and the \nattitude which most administrations appear to have is that if they put \nAmerican men and women into areas where hostilities are either already \ngoing on or imminent, Congress certainly will not turn its back on \nthose men and women; Congress will fork over the money. So the \nadministration always--most administrations in recent years--certainly \nseemed to have the idea, ``Well, once we get our men in there, Congress \nwill have to come along,'' and we do. Congress isn't going to turn its \nback on our men and women who are in harm's way. But it doesn't breed \nconfidence between the two bodies. We were told we would only be in \nBosnia, oh, something like a year, about a year. That was 3 years ago, \n3 or 4, several years back.\n  I predict that administration officials would find the task a good \ndeal easier if, when they come back before Congress and ask for money, \nthey had truly counseled with Congress, built a case for their request \nand sought the advice of the pertinent committee leadership beforehand.\n  Mr. President, I understand absolutely the serious nature of the \nhumanitarian crisis in Kosovo and the threat to regional stability in \nthe Balkans that are posed by Mr. Milosevic's brutal repression of the \nethnic Albanian\n\n[[Page S12490]]\n\nKosovars. With winter closing in on Kosovo and up to 70,000 ethnic \nAlbanians hiding in the mountains without food or shelter, we are \nlooking at the virtual certainty of a humanitarian catastrophe if \nsomething is not done to bring relief to those people and to ensure the \nsafety of the other 250,000 to 400,000 Kosovars who have been forced \nfrom their homes by the fighting.\n  There is a strong case to be made that dealing with the situation in \nKosovo now will help to prevent it from becoming a flashpoint that \ncould draw other nations into the conflict like moths to a flame.\n  Viewed in that light, Kosovo is much, much more than a humanitarian \nendeavor. But we in the Congress have no right to wring our hands over \nthe plight of the Kosovars while refusing to even debate whatever role \nwisdom may dictate that Congress should play. We have no right to be \nbold when it comes to criticizing NATO's proposed action while being \ntimid when it comes to doing our job. Regardless of what anyone else \ndoes, Congress has a constitutional duty to authorize whatever action \nit deems necessary.

Mr. President, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a \ntime when we work to heighten people's awareness of breast cancer and \nthe importance of early detection through mammography and self \nexamination.\n  Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women with one in \nnine women at risk of developing breast cancer over her lifetime. That \nis up from a risk that, in 1960, was just one in fourteen! In West \nVirginia, the American Cancer Society estimates that this year 1,200 \nwomen will be diagnosed with breast cancer, while nearly 300 women in \nthe State will die from the disease. Across the country, more than \n43,000 women will lose their battle with the disease this year, while \nmore than 178,000 women will just begin their fight. Too many people \nknow the pain of losing a loved one to this devastating, terrible \ndisease.\n  The startling statistics on the incidence of breast cancer call for a \nstrong Federal response, and that is what Congress has worked to \nprovide. Since 1990, the Congress has increased cancer research funding \nby 54 percent. For this new fiscal year, I believe that the Senate is \nheading in the right direction with its version of the Departments of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill. This measure contains more than $15.5 billion for \nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is an increase of $2 \nbillion over the level appropriated last year. Within that amount, the \nNational Cancer Institute (NCI) would receive almost $3 billion--a 15-\npercent increase over last year. It is my hope that the final \nappropriations measure for the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, \nand the NCI, the National Cancer Institute, will retain these sizable \nincreases. The research performed and funded by NIH is crucial to our \nNation, crucial to those suffering from this dreadful disease, and \ncrucial to the families of those who are suffering.\n  The strong national investment in cancer research is producing some \npromising results. For instance, an exciting new avenue being tested \nfor breast cancer prevention is the drug tamoxifen. This therapy \npotentially promises to prevent 50 percent of breast cancer cases in \nwomen who run a high risk of developing the disease.\n  Additionally, there are a number of new treatment options being \nstudied, including such practices as gene therapy and hormonal agents. \nThis combination of research and new therapies is lending hope to the \nmany women and their families who are blighted by this devastating \ndisease. Let us continue to invest in programs to address the scourge \nof cancer, breast cancer in women in particular.\n  Early detection of breast cancer is critical, and, according to \nmedical experts, mammography is the best way to find the disease in its \nearly stages. In West Virginia, about 73 percent of women have had a \nclinical breast examination and mammogram. That is good, but not good \nenough. West Virginia still lags behind the national median of 77 \npercent. So we need to do more.\n  In an effort to boost breast and cervical cancer prevention, I helped \nto launch the first-ever West Virginia cancer prevention, education, \nand screening project in 1990. As a result of this effort and other \nprograms that have partnered with it, between 1989 and 1995, West \nVirginia experienced a 45 percent increase in the number of women \nreceiving mammograms. We need to continue working together to increase \nthe number of women having mammograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. When a breast cancer tumor is found in its earliest stages, \na woman has a better than 90 percent chance of long-term survival. \nPlaces like the Mary Babb Randolph Cancer center in Morgantown play an \nimportant role in early detection and community education. The center \nproved to be a life-saver for Jorie Florek. She is a professional \ngolfer from New York State who played in a West Virginia golf \ntournament to raise money for the cancer center. During the tournament, \ndoctors and nurses from the center provided women with breast cancer \ninformation, including instructions on how to perform self \nexaminations. Using that information, Jorie detected a lump that, \nunfortunately, turned out to be malignant. However, through early \ndetection and aggressive treatment at the cancer center, Jorie is now \ncancer free.\n  Another West Virginia success story is that of Stephanie Juristy. \nStephanie was working, going to school, raising her teenage son, and \nplanning a wedding when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995. \nShe received treatment at the cancer center, undergoing surgery and \nchemotherapy, and participated in clinical trials of new treatments. \nStephanie is now married, working full-time, and preparing to graduate \nfrom school. She is also an advocate for patients in Morgantown, \nsharing her experiences and knowledge with other women.\n  Early detection, treatment, and research are all important components \nin the war against breast cancer. Strides are being made in each of \nthese areas, and, hopefully, one day will lead to a cure for all \ncancer. And that will be a glorious--glorious--day. However, until \nthen, we must remain vigilant and continue to encourage women to get \nmammograms and to self screen, and we must continue to make a strong \ninvestment in cancer research to press forward for a cure. As we \nrecognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month, let us redouble our efforts to \ntackle this disease that takes such a devastating toll on our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized, under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Before he leaves the floor, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor the unanimous consent request that he made that ensured I would \nhave the opportunity to speak now and also to thank him for all that I \nhave learned from him during my first years in the Senate.\n  It is one thing to take out a book that describes some of the \nprocedures and the rules of the Senate, but it seems to me that there \nis no better way to learn about the Senate and the very high standards \nthat are so important here than to simply watch the Senator from West \nVirginia for a few hours on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for his very gracious \nfelicitations. He is a far better student than I am a teacher. I thank \nhim.\n\n[[Page S12491]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12490-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12491-S12492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OREGON'S ASSISTED SUICIDE LAW\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I take the floor this \nafternoon because it is my understanding that democracy in Oregon has \nwon at least a temporary victory. I have been informed that there will \nbe nothing attached to the comprehensive spending bill that would \noverride Oregon's assisted suicide law.\n  While I intend to be very vigilant to monitor any further discussions \nthat take place on this matter, I come today to talk about why this \nissue is so important not just to my constituents but to all Americans. \nAnd I also thank the participants in the budget negotiations for their \nwillingness to leave out this matter that is so complicated and \ncontroversial.\n  I had informed the leadership of both political parties that I was \nprepared to speak at considerable length if there had been an effort as \npart of the final budget bill to toss Oregon's ballot measure on \nassisted suicide into the trash can. I was prepared to do this in spite \nof the fact that I have personal reservations about assisted suicide. I \nwas prepared to do this because I believe that nothing is more \nimportant than the people's right to govern themselves.\n  When the people of our States have made difficult decisions, \ndifficult moral decisions about matters that have historically been \nwithin the purview of the State governments, it is out and out wrong \nfor the Congress to butt in and override those decisions of voters in \nthe States.\n  The voters of my State have spoken clearly. In two separate \nreferendums, the verdict was clear: Physician-assisted suicide should, \nunder limited circumstances, be legal in the State of Oregon. If the \nCongress of the United States, meeting 3,000 miles away, had tossed \nthose decisions aside, in a last-minute backroom deal, it would have \nbeen a great insult to the people of Oregon and in my view would have \ncontributed mightily to skepticism and cynicism about Government.\n  It would have been a mistake because there were many questions raised \nabout the measure drafted by the Senator from Oklahoma who, it seems to \nme, is very sincere about his interest in this subject. In addition to \noverriding the popular will of the people of my State, his measure \nwould have also set back considerably the cause of better pain \nmanagement for patients in end-of-life care.\n  That would have had serious consequences for the treatment of \npatients in severe pain across this country. His measure would have \ngreat implications not just for the people of Oregon, but for the \npeople of all our States. More than 55 groups representing the medical \ncommunity, many of whom oppose physician-assisted suicide, joined \ntogether in an unprecedented coalition to oppose the legislation of the \nSenator from Oklahoma because of their fear that doctors and other \nmedical providers would be hampered. They feared that the cause of \nproviding pain care to their patients would be set back by the way the \nlegislation by the Senator from Oklahoma was written. I thank all of \nthese groups for their commitment to humane care and for their hard \nwork on this issue.\n  The key groups that led the coalition were: The Americans for Better \nCare of the Dying, the American Geriatrics Society, the American \nPharmaceutical Association, the National Hospice Organization, the \nAmerican College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, \nand the American Medical Association.\n  One of the reasons that so many of these groups worked so hard with \nrespect to keeping out of the spending bill legislation that would \noverturn Oregon's law was their sincere belief that the legislation by \nSenator Nickles would have harmed the effort to promote good pain \nmanagement.\n  The Nickles legislation would have given the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration new authority to look at every prescription of a \ncontrolled substance to determine for what it was intended. In \naddition, doctors and pharmacists under this legislation have had to be \nmind readers about what their patients were going to do with one of the \ndrugs that was used under the Controlled Substances Act. Was the \npatient going to take a medication as prescribed for pain management, \nor would they have sought to use it to kill themselves?\n  There is ample scientific evidence that pain management is not \nperformed as well as it might be at this time. And to add further \ncomplexities and a broader role for an agency like the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration to step into an area where it has never been before \nwould have, in my view, added additional barriers and complexities to \nthe effort to promote hospice care, palliative care, comfort care, and \nadvance the science of pain management.\n  Recently, the findings of a study in Oregon done in 1997 were \npublished that show that families reported relatively constant levels \nof moderate to severe pain during their loved one's final week of life. \nDuring the final months in 1997, families reported higher rates of \nmoderate to severe pain for those dying in acute care hospitals. There \nwas one exception, which was when a loved one died in an acute care \nhospital in late 1997. An important study showed a statewide trend \nindicating that there were in so many cases moderate to severe pain for \nthese individuals in the last week of life who would have required a \nphysician and others to step in and advocate for those patients.\n  I have received many letters and a great deal of e-mail from chronic \npain patients. These stories are heartbreaking. They point out that it \ncould be any one of us or any one of our loved ones or constituents who \nfinds themselves in chronic, excruciating pain as a result of an \naccident or through the development of some painful, chronic disease.\n  Unfortunately, pain patients in the current regulatory environment \nfeel in many instances--and they have told me--as if they are treated \nlike junkies, and that their providers are extremely nervous about how \nto use pain management in a climate where, had the Nickles legislation \nbeen adopted, certainly you would have had the Federal Government \nlooking over the shoulders of doctors and pharmacists with respect to \ntheir motivation in prescribing drugs for those who are suffering these \nacute health and chronic ailments.\n  We need to do a great deal more. We can do it on a bipartisan basis \nto advance the cause of pain management. I have had a number of \ndiscussions on this matter with Senator Mack, who has done, in my view, \nexcellent work on a number of health issues. Senator Smith of my State \nis greatly interested in these matters. I believe we ought to work \ntogether so that early next year we can bring before the health \ncommittees--and I see our friend from the State of Texas, the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Health Care, is here; he has a great interest in \nthese issues --a bipartisan package to promote good pain management \nbefore the Senate next year. We do need to do more to help the dying \nand those who suffer from chronic pain.\n  I believe that the mere threat of legislation would put the Drug \nEnforcement Administration into such an intrusive role that physicians, \npharmacists, and other health providers would be reluctant to use these \nmedications and future medications that promote pain management, \ncomfort care, and hospice care. The mere threat of this legislation \nwould be a real setback to the kind of health care services that the \nvast majority of Americans want to see expanded.\n  Certainly Americans can have differences of opinion on the issue of \nassisted suicide. I voted against our ballot measure once. I voted for \nthe repeal of it the second time. I voted against Federal funding of \nassisted suicide. My reservations with respect to this topic are clear. \nBut I think it is wrong for the Federal Government to butt in and \noverride the voters of my State, on a matter that has historically been \nleft to the States. It is especially wrong to do it in a way that is \ngoing to allow the Federal Government, particularly through the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, to play such an intrusive role that \ndoctors, pharmacists, and other health providers will feel \nuncomfortable and reluctant to assist their patients who are suffering \nchronic and extraordinary pain.\n  We have heard reports in Oregon from hospices where doctors have been \nreluctant to prescribe needed amounts of pain medication because they \nwere\n\n[[Page S12492]]\n\nfrightened about the implications of being visited by a Government \nagency that would second-guess them.\n  I am very pleased that the Nickles legislation will not be included \nin the comprehensive spending bill. I intend to remain vigilant \nthroughout the remaining hours of the negotiations. I wanted to come to \nthe floor this afternoon to talk about why this issue is so important \nnot to just the people of my State, but to the people of this country.\n  Finally, I am under no illusion that there will not be further \ndiscussions on the floor of the U.S. Senate about this topic. I know \nthat the Senator from Oklahoma feels very strongly and sincerely about \nthis issue. I know that there will be an effort to bring forward that \nproposal, and others like it, next year. I am aware that there are a \nnumber of Members of the U.S. Senate who would be willing to see \nOregon's law set aside.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to think just for a few moments over the \nnext few months about their reaction if their State passed a law on a \nmatter that the States have historically led on, and then a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate sought to step in and lay that aside. That is, in \neffect, what some in the U.S. Senate are trying to tell the people of \nOregon. I think that is a mistake. I think that Senators who would be \nwilling to toss aside a vote of the people of Oregon ought to think \nabout the implications of the precedent they will be setting that will \nhave their voters and the popular will of their States set aside if \nthis Senate, in the future, tosses aside the Oregon law.\n  There is a better way. The better way is the approach that Senator \nMack, Senator Smith and Members of the House, such as Congresswoman \nDarlene Hooley, and I are talking about. The better way is to say that \nthere will be differences of opinion in our country about assisted \nsuicide, but let us come together on that broad swath of policy that we \nall can agree on--which is to promote better hospice care, pain \nmanagement, and comfort care in the use of advanced directives.\n  Many of these services in many of our communities are utilized very \nrarely. So there is much we can do that will bring our citizens \ntogether, that will help us improve the conditions of our patients, \nreduce their suffering, without setting a dangerous precedent of \noverriding a law passed by the voters of my State that could redound to \nthe detriment of other States and our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I thank the negotiators who are dealing with the \nomnibus appropriations bill. I am pleased that it was not necessary for \nme to speak at length on the omnibus appropriations bill. Our voice \nwill be heard when we are challenged in Oregon. We will be heard each \ntime our rights are challenged.\n  I will conclude my remarks. I see the Senator from Oklahoma here. He \nhas been very gracious to this Senator in terms of discussing this \nmatter and keeping me apprised of his intentions. We do have a \ndifference of opinion on this issue and, at the same time, he has made \nit clear that he wants to work with this Senator, Senator Mack, and \nothers, on a variety of issues that we can agree on relating to pain \nmanagement. I know that we will be back on this Senate floor debating \nthis topic in the future. But I want the Senator from Oklahoma to know \nthat not only do I appreciate his courtesy in keeping me apprised of \nhis intentions, but of my desire to work with him on a variety of \nissues relating to this topic where I think we can agree.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma might speak, and that at the conclusion of his remarks, I \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12491-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12492-S12494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         USING FEDERALLY CONTROLLED DRUGS FOR ASSISTED SUICIDE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas. I want \nto make a couple of comments in regard to the legislation that my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Wyden, alluded to dealing with assisted \nsuicide.\n  Mr. President, I introduced legislation to correct a mistake that \nAttorney General Reno made in June of this year when she overruled the \nDrug Enforcement Act and its interpretation that controlled substances \ncould not be used for assisted suicide.\n  Let me make sure that everybody understands the picture of this. The \nControlled Substance Act is a Federal law. It is not a State law; it is \na Federal law. It is a Federal law that controls very strong drugs--\ndrugs that are illegal, drugs that can kill, drugs that are very \naddictive. They are controlled by Federal law. They can't be used \nexcept for legitimate medical purposes. That is what is defined in the \nFederal law in the Controlled Substance Act. They can only be used for \nlegitimate medical purposes.\n  What constitutes a legitimate medical purpose? History has it that a \nlegitimate medical purpose is, or can be, the alleviation of pain, to \nreduce pain, give comfort. It can be used for palliative care, but it \nis never--let me restate this--the Drug Enforcement Agency, which is in \ncharge of enforcing this act, has never been used for assisted suicide. \nThese drugs are strong drugs. If they are abused, used in heavy \nquantities, they kill people.\n  Unfortunately, some people want to use these drugs for assisted \nsuicide. The Drug Enforcement Administrator, Mr. Constantine, a year \nago, in November, wrote a letter to Congress and said that assisted \nsuicide is not a legitimate medical purpose.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nstatement a letter from Mr. Constantine, Administrator of the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the letter says they have reviewed it, \nand assisted suicide is never a legitimate medical purpose. These drugs \ncan only be used for a legitimate medical purpose.\n  The State of Oregon, by referendum, passed a law that says assisted \nsuicide is OK. They had a couple of them. The State of Oregon can do \nwhat it wants, but that doesn't overturn Federal law. What if the State \nof Massachusetts said they were going to legalize heroin? That is a \ncontrolled substance. Does that make it legal? No. There is a reason \nwhy we have a Federal law dealing with these very strong drugs, and it \nis called the Controlled Substance Act. And just because one State has \na referendum or petition or the legislature passes a bill, it doesn't \noverturn Federal drug law, period.\n  For some unknown reason, the Attorney General--and I still don't know \nwhy--gave one of the most absurd rulings in June, where she said, well, \nwe still believe we have control of the Federal Controlled Substance \nAct, so assisted suicide is illegal for some States, except for those \nwhich have legalized it. Now, that is an absurd conclusion. I guess if \nyou take that to its conclusion, any State can do whatever they want on \nthese substances. That is absurd. Why have a Federal law? Why have a \nFederal law in any way, shape, or form.\n\n  Now we have several States--and Oregon is the pioneer in this--like \nMichigan and other States that are saying they want assisted suicide. I \njust beg to differ. I don't think that should be the purpose. The whole \npurpose of these drugs is to alleviate pain. For those organizations \nthat say we are not sure if we support this bill because maybe it would \nhave a chilling impact on pain, that is false. They haven't read the \nbill. If they want us to help write it in a stronger way--we put very \nclearly in the bill that these drugs can be used to alleviate pain. We \nencourage use of these drugs for the alleviation of pain, for \npalliative care. But they are licensed by the Federal Government and \nshould not be used to kill people. They should not be used for assisted \nsuicide. These are federally controlled drugs.\n  Are we going to give that kind of license? What happens if somebody \ndoes it? Tradition has it and history has had it that the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, if somebody misuses these drugs--one, they have to \nget a Federal license to distribute the drug, and if they misuse them, \nthey lose that license. I think it is only appropriate to do so. They\n\n[[Page S12493]]\n\nshould not have the ability to distribute these drugs if they are going \nto use these drugs for assisted suicide.\n  So I say to my colleagues and anybody who has an interest in this \nthat I want to work this out. I met with the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services today, Secretary Shalala, and we talked about this. We \nneed to make sure that these drugs can be used for palliative care. We \nalso need to make sure that they are controlled by the Federal \nGovernment. They should not be used for assisted suicide.\n  Mr. President, let me make a couple of general comments. This is \nabout this administration, and it is about life in general, or maybe \ntheir lack of respect for life.\n  On two or three issues, I think this administration seems quite bent \non devaluating life. I am talking about unborn children, where the \nadministration has been eagerly trying to bring forth the distribution \nof RU486, an abortion pill that aborts fetuses up to 9 or 10 weeks, \nwhere there is a beating heart; they want to legalize that. There \nwasn't a pharmaceutical company in the country that wanted to make the \ndrug, and the administration bent over backwards trying to recruit this \ndrug coming into the country.\n  Now, you find the administration, through the Attorney General, \ncoming up with a ruling that is totally contrary to the Drug \nEnforcement Agency's history of controlling controlled substances and \nsaying, oh, well, we think assisted suicide is OK. Even though the \nPresident of the United States says he is against it, his \nadministration and the Attorney General say maybe it is OK if the State \nsays it is even though the drugs are controlled by the Federal \nGovernment. So you have the administration recruiting people to bring \nin abortion drugs for young people--an administration that wants to \nfund and subsidize abortion for unborn children, and then an \nadministration now that, through the Attorney General's ruling, says we \nthink these drugs that have been controlled by the Federal Government, \nunder Federal law--we think it is OK if States want to legalize the use \nof these federally controlled drugs for assisted suicide. I don't think \nthat makes sense.\n  I think it is pathetic when you think that the Federal Government's \npurpose should be to protect people, and they are actually trying to \nbring in drugs that will kill unborn children. And, then, also at the \nsame time, ``Oh, yes. You can use these very strong drugs to kill \nsenior citizens.'' It is hard to believe that they would take that \nposition. That is the position of this administration. They are wrong. \nHopefully, this Congress will vote.\n  I might mention that this is not the first issue that we have had \nwith this. We passed legislation in the last Congress. We passed it \nunanimously through the Senate. It was my bill, or my language, that \nsaid no Federal funds were to be used for assisted suicide. Now we have \npeople saying, ``Well, we want to use Federal drugs for assisted \nsuicide.'' I think not.\n  We are going to vote on it. We are going to have significant debate \non it. I look forward to that debate. I regret we are out of time to \nget a significant debate on it this year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon. I understand \ntrying to represent one's State. I believe very strongly in States \nrights. But I don't believe so strongly in States rights that if the \nState of Oklahoma wanted to legalize heroin, or other controlled \nsubstances--I don't think that supersedes Federal law.\n  I would tell my colleague from Oregon that if the State of Oklahoma \nsaid, ``We think we want to legalize assisted suicide and have it be \npublic,'' I say that is fine, you can do it with any drug that is \ncontrolled by the State, but not drugs controlled by the Federal \nGovernment, because we don't want Federal Government policy to be that \nwe are going to basically acquiesce in assisted suicide. That should \nnot be Federal policy.\n  Again, there is a Federal Controlled Substance Act. It is not State. \nThe State could do whatever they want. But not with Federal law, not \nwith Federal drugs, not with the Federal Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, which controls the licenses and controls the use of \nthese substances. The act is written OK. The act says these substances \ncan only be used for legitimate medical purposes. I agree with that. If \nanybody thinks that legitimate medical purpose is assisted suicide, I \ndisagree with that. That is not in the law. The Attorney General's \nreading of the law is totally contrary to that of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration. I believe she is wrong.\n  We will give all Members of this body a chance to vote on it in the \nnot-too-distant future--if not this Congress, certainly the next \nCongress.\n  I thank my colleagues, particular my colleague from Texas, for \nallowing me to proceed to respond to my colleague from Oregon.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Drug Enforcement Administration,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Hyde: Thank you for your letter of July \n     29, 1997. In that letter, you requested the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration's (DEA) view as to ``whether delivering, \n     distributing, dispensing, prescribing, filling a \n     prescription, or administering a controlled substance with \n     the deliberate intent of assisting in a suicide would violate \n     the Controlled Substance Act (CSA), applicable regulations, \n     rulings, or other federal law subject to DEA enforcement, \n     notwithstanding the enactment of a state law such as Oregon's \n     Measure 16 which rescinds state penalties against such \n     prescriptions for patients with a life expectancy of less \n     than six months.''\n       I apologize for the delay in responding to you. As you \n     know, the CSA authorizes DEA to revoke the registration of \n     physicians who dispense controlled substances without a \n     legitimate medical purpose. Historically, DEA's experience \n     with the phrase ``without a legitimate medical purpose'' has \n     focused on cases involving physicians who have provided \n     controlled substances to drug addicts and abusers. The \n     application of this phrase to cases involving physician-\n     assisted suicide presented DEA with a new issue to review.\n       Since receiving your inquiry, my staff has carefully \n     reviewed a number of cases, briefs, law review articles and \n     state laws relating to physician-assisted suicide, including \n     the documents referenced in your letter. In addition, my \n     staff has conducted a thorough review of prior administrative \n     cases in which physicians have dispensed controlled \n     substances for other than a ``legitimate medical purpose.'' \n     Based on that review, we are persuaded that delivering, \n     dispensing or prescribing a controlled substance with the \n     intent of assisting a suicide would not be under any current \n     definition a ``legitimate medical purpose.'' As a result, the \n     activities that you described in your letter to us would be, \n     in our opinion, a violation of the CSA.\n       Because physician-assisted suicide would be a new and \n     different application of the CSA, a number of issues remain \n     unresolved. For example, suspicious or unnatural deaths \n     require a medico-legal investigation. The first priority in \n     such an investigation would be a comprehensive forensic \n     inquiry by a state or local law enforcement agency, which is \n     traditionally supported by the efforts of a medical examiner, \n     forensic pathologist, and/or coroner. At the conclusion of \n     this stage of the inquiry, the evidence often is submitted to \n     a grand jury or similar process for a determination of \n     potential criminal liability of the person who assisted in \n     the death.\n       This initial determination as to the cause of death is not \n     DEA's responsibility. Rather, DEA would have to rely on the \n     evidence supplied to us by state and local law enforcement \n     agencies and prosecutors. If the information or evidence \n     presented to DEA indicates that a physician has delivered, \n     distributed, dispensed, prescribed or administered a \n     controlled substance with the deliberate intent of assisting \n     in a suicide, then DEA could initiate revocation proceedings \n     on the grounds that the physician has acted ``without a \n     legitimate medical purpose.''\n       In addition to moving to revoke a physician's registration \n     for dispensing controlled substances ``without a legitimate \n     medical purpose,'' please also be aware that the CSA provides \n     a number of other grounds upon which DEA might revoke the \n     registration of a physician who assisted in a suicide. For \n     example, DEA will revoke the registration of any physician \n     whose state license to practice medicine has been revoked for \n     assisting suicide. Similarly, DEA has authority to revoke the \n     registration of any physician whose acts in assisting a \n     suicide result in a conviction under state controlled \n     substances laws.\n       DEA must examine the facts on a case-by-case basis to \n     determine whether a physician's actions conflict with the \n     CSA. If the facts indicate that a physician has acted as set \n     forth in your letter, however, then DEA would have a \n     statutory basis to initiate revocation proceedings.\n       I trust that this response addresses your inquiry. If you \n     have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Thomas A.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--In furtherance of the Act of August 25, 1916 \n     (commonly known as the National Park Service Organic Act; 16 \n     U.S.C. 1 et seq.), which directs the Secretary to administer \n     units of the National Park System in accordance with the \n     fundamental purpose of conserving their scenery, wildlife, \n     and natural and historic objects, and providing for their \n     enjoyment in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for the \n     enjoyment of future generations, the Congress hereby finds \n     that the preservation and conservation of park resources and \n     values requires that such public accommodations, facilities, \n     and services as have to be provided within such units should \n     be provided only under carefully controlled safeguards \n     against unregulated and indiscriminate use, so that--\n       (1) visitation will not unduly impair these resources and \n     values; and\n       (2) development of public accommodations, facilities, and \n     services within such units can best be limited to locations \n     that are consistent to the highest practicable degree with \n     the preservation and conservation of the resources and values \n     of such units.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the Congress that the \n     development of public accommodations, facilities, and \n     services in units of the National Park System shall be \n     limited to those accommodations, facilities, and services \n     that--\n       (1) are necessary and appropriate for public use and \n     enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which \n     they are located; and\n       (2) are consistent to the highest practicable degree with \n     the preservation and conservation of the resources and values \n     of the unit.\n\n     SEC. 403. AWARD OF CONCESSIONS CONTRACTS.\n\n       In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section \n     402, and except as provided by this title or otherwise \n     authorized by law, the Secretary shall utilize concessions \n     contracts to authorize a person, corporation, or other entity \n     to provide accommodations, facilities, and services to \n     visitors to units of the National Park System. Such \n     concessions contracts shall be awarded as follows:\n\n[[Page S12496]]\n\n       (1) Competitive selection process.--Except as otherwise \n     provided in this section, all proposed concessions contracts \n     shall be awarded by the Secretary to the person, corporation, \n     or other entity submitting the best proposal, as determined \n     by the Secretary through a competitive selection process. \n     Such competitive process shall include simplified procedures \n     for small, individually-owned, concessions contracts.\n       (2) Solicitation of proposals.--Except as otherwise \n     provided in this section, prior to awarding a new concessions \n     contract (including renewals or extensions of existing \n     concessions contracts) the Secretary shall publicly solicit \n     proposals for the concessions contract and, in connection \n     with such solicitation, the Secretary shall prepare a \n     prospectus and shall publish notice of its availability at \n     least once in local or national newspapers or trade \n     publications, and/or the Commerce Business Daily, as \n     appropriate, and shall make the prospectus available upon \n     request to all interested parties.\n       (3) Prospectus.--The prospectus shall include the following \n     information:\n       (A) The minimum requirements for such contract as set forth \n     in paragraph (4).\n       (B) The terms and conditions of any existing concessions \n     contract relating to the services and facilities to be \n     provided, including all fees and other forms of compensation \n     provided to the United States by the concessioner.\n       (C) Other authorized facilities or services which may be \n     provided in a proposal.\n       (D) Facilities and services to be provided by the Secretary \n     to the concessioner, if any, including public access, \n     utilities, and buildings.\n       (E) An estimate of the amount of compensation, if any, due \n     an existing concessioner from a new concessioner under the \n     terms of a prior concessions contract.\n       (F) A statement as to the weight to be given to each \n     selection factor identified in the prospectus and the \n     relative importance of such factors in the selection process.\n       (G) Such other information related to the proposed \n     concessions operation as is provided to the Secretary \n     pursuant to a concessions contract or is otherwise available \n     to the Secretary, as the Secretary determines is necessary to \n     allow for the submission of competitive proposals.\n       (H) Where applicable, a description of a preferential right \n     to the renewal of the proposed concessions contract held by \n     an existing concessioner as set forth in paragraph (7).\n       (4) Minimum requirements.--(A) No proposal shall be \n     considered which fails to meet the minimum requirements as \n     determined by the Secretary. Such minimum requirements shall \n     include the following:\n       (i) The minimum acceptable franchise fee or other forms of \n     consideration to the Government.\n       (ii) Any facilities, services, or capital investment \n     required to be provided by the concessioner.\n       (iii) Measures necessary to ensure the protection, \n     conservation, and preservation of resources of the unit of \n     the National Park System.\n       (B) The Secretary shall reject any proposal, regardless of \n     the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary determines that \n     the person, corporation, or entity is not qualified, is not \n     likely to provide satisfactory service, or that the proposal \n     is not responsive to the objectives of protecting and \n     preserving resources of the unit of the National Park System \n     and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and \n     services to the public at reasonable rates.\n       (C) If all proposals submitted to the Secretary either fail \n     to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the \n     Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract \n     requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection \n     process pursuant to this section.\n       (D) The Secretary may not execute a concessions contract \n     which materially amends or does not incorporate the proposed \n     terms and conditions of the concessions contract as set forth \n     in the applicable prospectus. If proposed material amendments \n     or changes are considered appropriate by the Secretary, the \n     Secretary shall resolicit offers for the concessions contract \n     incorporating such material amendments or changes.\n       (5) Selection of the best proposal.--(A) In selecting the \n     best proposal, the Secretary shall consider the following \n     principal factors:\n       (i) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of \n     protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the unit \n     of the National Park System and of providing necessary and \n     appropriate facilities and services to the public at \n     reasonable rates.\n       (ii) The experience and related background of the person, \n     corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including the \n     past performance and expertise of such person, corporation or \n     entity in providing the same or similar facilities or \n     services.\n       (iii) The financial capability of the person, corporation, \n     or entity submitting the proposal.\n       (iv) The proposed franchise fee, except that consideration \n     of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the \n     objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving \n     resources of the unit of the National Park System and of \n     providing necessary and appropriate facilities to the public \n     at reasonable rates.\n       (B) The Secretary may also consider such secondary factors \n     as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (C) In developing regulations to implement this title, the \n     Secretary shall consider the extent to which plans for \n     employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and \n     involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian tribes, or \n     Native Alaskans in the operation of a concession, contracts \n     should be identified as a factor in the selection of a best \n     proposal under this section.\n       (6) Congressional notification.--The Secretary shall submit \n     any proposed concessions contract with anticipated annual \n     gross receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or a duration of more \n     than 10 years to the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate. The Secretary shall not award any \n     such proposed contract until at least 60 days subsequent to \n     the notification of both committees.\n       (7) Preferential right of renewal.--(A) Except as provided \n     in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall not grant a \n     concessioner a preferential right to renew a concessions \n     contract, or any other form of preference to a concessions \n     contract.\n       (B) The Secretary shall grant a preferential right of \n     renewal to an existing concessioner with respect to proposed \n     renewals of the categories of concessions contracts described \n     by paragraph (8), subject to the requirements of that \n     paragraph.\n       (C) As used in this title, the term ``preferential right of \n     renewal'' means that the Secretary, subject to a \n     determination by the Secretary that the facilities or \n     services authorized by a prior contract continue to be \n     necessary and appropriate within the meaning of section 402, \n     shall allow a concessioner qualifying for a preferential \n     right of renewal the opportunity to match the terms and \n     conditions of any competing proposal which the Secretary \n     determines to be the best proposal for a proposed new \n     concessions contract which authorizes the continuation of the \n     facilities and services provided by the concessioner under \n     its prior contract.\n       (D) A concessioner which successfully exercises a \n     preferential right of renewal in accordance with the \n     requirements of this title shall be entitled to award of the \n     proposed new concessions contract to which such preference \n     applies.\n       (8) Outfitter and guide services and small contracts.--(A) \n     The provisions of paragraph (7) shall apply only to the \n     following:\n       (i) Subject to subparagraph (B), outfitting and guide \n     concessions contracts.\n       (ii) Subject to subparagraph (C), concessions contracts \n     with anticipated annual gross receipts under $500,000.\n       (B) For the purposes of this title, an ``outfitting and \n     guide concessions contract'' means a concessions contract \n     which solely authorizes the provision of specialized \n     backcountry outdoor recreation guide services which require \n     the employment of specially trained and experienced guides to \n     accompany park visitors in the backcountry so as to provide a \n     safe and enjoyable experience for visitors who otherwise may \n     not have the skills and equipment to engage in such activity. \n     Outfitting and guide concessioners, where otherwise \n     qualified, include concessioners which provide guided river \n     running, hunting, fishing, horseback, camping, and \n     mountaineering experiences. An outfitting and guide \n     concessioner is entitled to a preferential right of renewal \n     under this title only if--\n       (i) the contract with the outfitting and guide concessioner \n     does not grant the concessioner any interest, including any \n     leasehold surrender interest or possessory interest, in \n     capital improvements on lands owned by the United States \n     within a unit of the National Park System, other than a \n     capital improvement constructed by a concessioner pursuant to \n     the terms of a concessions contract prior to the date of the \n     enactment of this title or constructed or owned by a \n     concessioner or his or her predecessor before the subject \n     land was incorporated into the National Park System;\n       (ii) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has \n     operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract \n     (including any extension thereof); and\n       (iii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal \n     for a proposed new contract which satisfies the minimum \n     requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to \n     paragraph (4).\n       (C) A concessioner that holds a concessions contract that \n     the Secretary estimates will result in gross annual receipts \n     of less than $500,000 if renewed shall be entitled to a \n     preferential right of renewal under this title if--\n       (i) the Secretary has determined that the concessioner has \n     operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract \n     (including any extension thereof); and\n       (ii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal \n     for a proposed new concessions contract which satisfies the \n     minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to \n     paragraph (4).\n       (9) New or additional services.--The Secretary shall not \n     grant a preferential right to a concessioner to provide new \n     or additional services in a unit of the National Park System.\n       (10) Secretarial authority.--Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to \n     determine whether to issue a concessions contract or to \n     establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the \n     policies expressed in this title.\n       (11) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding the provisions of this \n     section, the Secretary may award, without public \n     solicitation, the following:\n       (A) A temporary concessions contract or an extension of an \n     existing concessions contract for a term not to exceed 3 \n     years in order to avoid interruption of services to the \n     public at a unit of the National Park System, except that \n     prior to making such an award, the Secretary shall take all \n     reasonable and appropriate steps to consider alternatives to \n     avoid such interruption.\n       (B) A concessions contract in extraordinary circumstances \n     where compelling and equitable considerations require the \n     award of a concessions contract to a particular party in the \n     public interest. Such award of a concessions contract shall \n     not be made by the Secretary until at least 30 days after \n     publication in the Federal Register of notice of the \n     Secretary's intention to do so and the reasons for such \n     action, and submission of notice to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Resources of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 404. TERM OF CONCESSIONS CONTRACTS.\n\n       A concessions contract entered into pursuant to this title \n     shall generally be awarded for a\n\n[[Page S12497]]\n\n     term of 10 years or less. However, the Secretary may award a \n     contract for a term of up to 20 years if the Secretary \n     determines that the contract terms and conditions, including \n     the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a \n     longer term.\n\n     SEC. 405. PROTECTION OF CONCESSIONER INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Leasehold Surrender Interest Under New Concessions \n     Contracts.--On or after the date of the enactment of this \n     title, a concessioner that constructs a capital improvement \n     upon land owned by the United States within a unit of the \n     National Park System pursuant to a concessions contract shall \n     have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital \n     improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:\n       (1) A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender \n     interest in each capital improvement constructed by a \n     concessioner under a concessions contract, consisting solely \n     of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the \n     extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender \n     interest in the capital improvement.\n       (2) A leasehold surrender interest--\n       (A) may be pledged as security for financing of a capital \n     improvement or the acquisition of a concessions contract when \n     approved by the Secretary pursuant to this title;\n       (B) shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection \n     with any transfer of the concessions contract and may be \n     relinquished or waived by the concessioner; and\n       (C) shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other \n     termination of a concessions contract and may not be taken \n     for public use except on payment of just compensation.\n       (3) The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a \n     capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial \n     value (construction cost of the capital improvement), \n     increased (or decreased) in the same percentage increase (or \n     decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the \n     Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment \n     in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of \n     payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, \n     less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by \n     the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison \n     with a new unit of like kind.\n       (4) Effective 9 years after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary may provide, in any particular new \n     concession contract the Secretary estimates will have a \n     leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that \n     the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital \n     improvement shall be based on either (A) a reduction on an \n     annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of \n     years as the time period associated with the straight line \n     depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the \n     capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal \n     income tax laws and regulations in effect on the day before \n     the date of the enactment of this Act or (B) such alternative \n     formula that is consistent with the objectives of this title. \n     The Secretary may only use such an alternative formula if the \n     Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and \n     other circumstances involved in this particular concession \n     contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register \n     and opportunity for comment), that such alternative formula \n     is, compared to the standard method of determining value \n     provided for in paragraph (3), necessary in order to provide \n     a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for \n     the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to \n     make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers \n     are received in response to a solicitation that includes such \n     an alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be \n     resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as \n     described as paragraph (3).\n       (5) Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a \n     concessions contract, makes a capital improvement to an \n     existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a \n     leasehold surrender interest, the cost of such additional \n     capital improvement shall be added to the then current value \n     of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.\n       (b) Special Rule for Existing Possessory Interest.--\n       (1) A concessioner which has obtained a possessory interest \n     as defined pursuant to Public Law 89-249 (commonly known as \n     the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; 16 U.S.C. \n     20 et seq.), as in effect on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, under the terms of a concessions \n     contract entered into before that date shall, upon the \n     expiration or termination of such contract, be entitled to \n     receive compensation for such possessory interest \n     improvements in the amount and manner as described by such \n     concessions contract. Where such a possessory interest is not \n     described in the existing contract, compensation of \n     possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with \n     the laws in effect on the day before the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (2) In the event such prior concessioner is awarded a new \n     concessions contract after the effective date of this title \n     replacing an existing concessions contract, the existing \n     concessioner shall, instead of directly receiving such \n     possessory interest compensation, have a leasehold surrender \n     interest in its existing possessory interest improvements \n     under the terms of the new contract and shall carry over as \n     the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest \n     (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value \n     of the existing possessory interest as of the termination \n     date of the previous contract. In the event of a dispute \n     between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of \n     such possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved \n     through binding arbitration.\n       (3) In the event that a new concessioner is awarded a \n     concessions contract and is required to pay a prior \n     concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements, \n     the new concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender \n     interest in such prior improvements and the initial value in \n     such leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction \n     cost), shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing \n     possessory interest as of the termination date of the \n     previous contract.\n       (c) Transition to Successor Concessioner.--Upon expiration \n     or termination of a concessions contract entered into after \n     the effective date of this title, a concessioner shall be \n     entitled under the terms of the concessions contract to \n     receive from the United States or a successor concessioner \n     the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital \n     improvement as of the date of such expiration or termination. \n     A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender \n     interest in such capital improvement under the terms of a new \n     contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender \n     interest in such capital improvement (instead of construction \n     cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is \n     required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold \n     surrender interest under the terms of the prior concessions \n     contract.\n       (d) Title to Improvements.--Title to any capital \n     improvement constructed by a concessioner on lands owned by \n     the United States in a unit of the National Park System shall \n     be vested in the United States.\n       (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Consumer price index.--The term ``Consumer Price \n     Index'' means the ``Consumer Price Index--All Urban \n     Consumers'' published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of \n     the Department of Labor, unless such index is not published, \n     in which case another regularly published cost-of-living \n     index approximating the Consumer Price Index shall be \n     utilized by the Secretary; and\n       (2) Capital improvement.--The term ``capital improvement'' \n     means a structure, fixture, or nonremovable equipment \n     provided by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a \n     concessions contract and located on lands of the United \n     States within a unit of the National Park System.\n       (f) Special Reporting Requirement.-- Not later than 7 years \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the \n     House of Representatives containing a complete analysis of \n     the concession program as well as--\n       (1) an assessment of competition in the solicitation of \n     prospectuses, fair and/or increased return to the Government, \n     and improvement of concession facilities and infrastructure; \n     and\n       (2) an assessment of any problems with the management and \n     administration of the concession program that are a direct \n     result of the implementation of the provisions of this title.\n\n     SEC. 406. REASONABLENESS OF RATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each concessions contract shall permit the \n     concessioner to set reasonable and appropriate rates and \n     charges for facilities, goods, and services provided to the \n     public, subject to approval under subsection (b).\n       (b) Approval by Secretary Required.--A concessioner's rates \n     and charges to the public shall be subject to approval by the \n     Secretary. The approval process utilized by the Secretary \n     shall be as prompt and as unburdensome to the concessioner as \n     possible and shall rely on market forces to establish \n     reasonableness of rates and charges to the maximum extent \n     practicable. The Secretary shall approve rates and charges \n     that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and \n     appropriate. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the \n     reasonableness and appropriateness of rates and charges shall \n     be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and \n     charges for facilities, goods, and services of comparable \n     character under similar conditions, with due consideration to \n     the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by \n     the Secretary: length of season, peakloads, average \n     percentage of occupancy, accessibility, availability and \n     costs of labor and materials, and type of patronage. Such \n     rates and charges may not exceed the market rates and charges \n     for comparable facilities, goods, and services, after taking \n     into account the factors referred to in the preceding \n     sentence.\n       (c) Implementation of Recommendations.--Not later than 6 \n     months after receiving recommendations from the Advisory \n     Board established under section 409(a) regarding concessioner \n     rates and charges to the public, the Secretary shall \n     implement the recommendations or report to the Congress the \n     reasons for not implementing the recommendations.\n\n     SEC. 407. FRANCHISE FEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A concessions contract shall provide for \n     payment to the government of a franchise fee or such other \n     monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary, upon \n     consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of \n     the privileges granted by the particular contract involved. \n     Such probable value shall be based upon a reasonable \n     opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested \n     and the obligations of the contract. Consideration of revenue \n     to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives \n     of protecting and preserving park areas and of providing \n     necessary and appropriate services for visitors at reasonable \n     rates.\n       (b) Amount of Franchise Fee.--The amount of the franchise \n     fee or other monetary consideration paid to the United States \n     for the term of the concessions contract shall be specified \n     in the concessions contract and may only be modified to \n     reflect extraordinary unanticipated changes from the \n     conditions anticipated as of the effective date of the \n     contract. The Secretary shall include in concessions \n     contracts with a term of more than 5 years a provision which \n     allows reconsideration of the franchise fee at the request of \n     the Secretary or the concessioner in the event of such \n     extraordinary unanticipated changes.\n\n[[Page S12498]]\n\n     Such provision shall provide for binding arbitration in the \n     event that the Secretary and the concessioner are unable to \n     agree upon an adjustment to the franchise fee in these \n     circumstances.\n       (c) Special Account.--All franchise fees (and other \n     monetary consideration) paid to the United States pursuant to \n     concessions contracts shall be deposited into a special \n     account established in the Treasury of the United States. \n     Twenty percent of the funds deposited in the special account \n     shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without \n     further appropriation, to support activities throughout the \n     National Park System regardless of the unit of the National \n     Park System in which the funds were collected. The funds \n     deposited into the special account shall remain available \n     until expended.\n       (d) Subaccount for Each Unit.--There shall be established \n     within the special account required under subsection (c) a \n     subaccount for each unit of the National Park System.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1693, the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998. Let me begin \nby acknowledging the work of the sponsor of this legislation, Senator \nThomas. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic \nPreservation and Recreation, he has been willing to compromise and work \nwith all involved parties, including Secretary Babbit, my friend and \ncolleague Senator Bennett, Congressmen George Miller and Don Young in \nan effort to enact a meaningful and comprehensive bill for our national \nparks. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this important \nlegislation and I am very pleased that this bill will pass before I \nleave the Senate this year. I would also like to particularly thank \nSenator Bennett, who has once again been very helpful and constructive \nin developing a bill that can garner such broad bipartisan support, as \nI believe this bill has.\n  Although this is a comprehensive bill that makes a number of positive \nchanges in the way national parks are managed, for me, the most \nsignificant provisions are found in title IV--the National Park Service \nConcessions Management Improvement Act.\n  Mr. President, for almost 19 years I have worked to reform the \nconcessions policies of the National Park Service to increase \ncompetition, provide better services, and to ensure a better return for \nthe American public. Over the past two decades, we have held dozens of \nhearings, and we've debated this issue in markups and on the Senate \nfloor.\n  As you know, during the 103d Congress Senator Bennett and I sponsored \na bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 90-9, and passed in the \nHouse of Representatives with only minor changes by a vote of 368-30. \nDespite the overwhelming vote margins, we were unable to pass a final \nbill before the Congress adjourned. Given the magnitude of those votes, \nit is very frustrating to be here once again debating park concession \nreform.\n  While I support passage of this bill and believe it will enhance the \nPark Service's ability to better manage our National Park System, the \nbill before us today is a true compromise worked out between Senator \nThomas and myself in the Senate and with Congressmen Miller, Don Young, \nand Jim Hansen in the House. Each of us gave something up in order to \nget a bill passed. The bill--particularly the concession title--does \nnot contain all of the policy changes that I would like to see made. \nHowever, passage of this bill will finally allow the Park Service to \nhave meaningful competition for park concession contracts.\n  Most importantly, the bill will repeal the 1965 Concession Policy \nAct--a 30-year-old anachronism--including its most anticompetitive \nprovision, the granting to incumbent concessioners of a preferential \nright to renew their contract by simply matching the terms and \nconditions of a superior offer.\n  Other important provisions in the concession reform title include: \nMaintaining existing statutory protections for outfitter and guide \ncontracts and small contracts with less than $500,000 in annual gross \nrevenue; a prohibition against giving any concessioner a preferential \nright to provide new or additional services; and language linking the \nvalue of facilities built by a concessioner to actual construction \ncosts, adjusted for inflation, rather than the ``sound value'' \npossessory interest allowed under current law.\n  During the consideration of this bill in the House, possessory \ninterest was the most contentious issue to be resolved. While Senator \nThomas and I had agreed on a formulation in the Senate passed bill that \nsatisfied us, come in the House, particularly the ranking Democrat on \nthe Resources Committee, George Miller, preferred the approach taken in \nthe bill I mentioned earlier that passed the Senate in 1993. Under that \nformulation, a concessioner's possessory interest would be depreciated \nover time on a straight line basis. While I too prefer this approach, \nit is clear that the concessioners are adamantly opposed to this method \nof calculating possessory interest. More importantly, a major change to \nthis key provision would put at risk the agreement we have reached to \neliminate the preferential right of renewal, by far the most \nanticompetitive provision in the existing law.\n\n  After lengthy discussions between Congressman Miller, Secretary \nBabbitt, Senator Thomas, and others, another compromise has been agreed \nto that gives both sides some of what they want. As passed the House, \nthe legislation provides that the Secretary is to value possessory \ninterest as described in the bill for 9 years. At the end of year 7, \nthe Secretary is to send Congress a report on the concessions program \nin general and, in particular, how this new method of calculating \npossessory interest has worked. Congress can examine the report and \nmake legislative changes if necessary based on the track record of the \nprevious 7 years. Then, at the end of the 9th year, if no changes in \nthe law have been made, the Secretary will have the discretion, under \ncertain limited circumstances, to require concessioners to use other \nmethods of valuing possessory interest, including but not limited to, \nstraight line depreciation. I think this is a reasonable compromise and \nvery much appreciate the hard work on the part of all parties in \nworking it out.\n  While the concession title has been of particular interest to me, the \nbill before us today includes several other titles which I believe will \ngreatly enhance the Park Service's management authorities. The bill \nincludes directives for the Park Service to improve career development \nand training for its employees and to establish a strong scientific \nresearch program in national parks. It codifies criteria for the Park \nService to use in evaluating areas proposed for addition to the \nNational Park System. I must say that I very much regret the decision \nof the House to remove the provisions contained in the Senate bill that \ngave the Park Service much needed authority to collect and retain fees \nfor commercial filming activities in national park units, and which \nwould have extended the Recreational Fee Demonstration Progam for park \nfees for another 6 years. These provisions were included in the Senate \nbill to help get badly needed money directly to the parks--something \nthat everyone says they want to do. Deleting these provisions that \nwould have provided literally hundreds of millions of dollars to the \nparks over the next 5 or 6 years will not help restore our badly \ndeteriorating parks and public lands.\n  The bill before us today will allow the Park Service to develop and \nmarket annual park admission passports to increase public awareness \nabout parks and to raise new revenues. There are a few other titles \nincluded in the bill, but those are the most significant provisions.\n  Mr. President, the concession reform provisions in this bill are a \ngreat step forward for the National Park Service and the taxpayers. I \nstrongly support these and the other provisions in this legislation, \nand I hope my colleagues will join me in helping to pass this bill.\n  In closing, I want to thank several people who worked very hard on \nthis legislation, in particular title IV related to park concessions. \nDavid Brooks and Tom Williams on the Energy Committee Democratic staff \nhave worked with me for years on this issue and I appreciate their \nefforts very much. Jim O'Toole and Gary Ellsworth of the majority staff \nhave been very helpful to me on this and other bills and I thank them \nboth for their help and cooperation. Dan Naatz on Senator Thomas' staff \nand Tim Stewart with Senator Bennett were crucial to Senate \nnegotiations on this bill and provided constructive and substantive \ninput on a number of occasions. Finally, John\n\n[[Page S12502]]\n\nLeshy, Destry Jarvis, and Lars Hanslin in the Interior Department \ndeserve much of the credit for putting together the final compromise on \npossessory interest that got this bill moving again in the House. Along \nwith John Lawrence and Rick Healy of the Democratic staff on the House \nResources Committee, these gentlemen worked tirelessly to put the \nfinishing touches on a very delicate compromise. I very much appreciate \ntheir dedication to this effort and their willingness to go the extra \nmile to get this bill passed.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nagree to the amendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12494-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12502-S12511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to--\n       (A) live independently;\n       (B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;\n       (C) benefit from an education;\n       (D) pursue meaningful careers; and\n       (E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, \n     political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of \n     society in the United States.\n       (2) Technology has become 1 of the primary engines for \n     economic activity, education, and innovation in the Nation, \n     and throughout the world. The commitment of the United States \n     to the development and utilization of technology is 1 of the \n     main factors underlying the strength and vibrancy of the \n     economy of the United States.\n       (3) As technology has come to play an increasingly \n     important role in the lives of all persons in the United \n     States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of \n     government, in the fostering of communication, in the conduct \n     of commerce, and in the provision of education, its impact \n     upon the lives of the more than 50,000,000 individuals with \n     disabilities in the United States has been comparable to its \n     impact upon the remainder of the citizens of the United \n     States. Any development in mainstream technology would have \n     profound implications for individuals with disabilities in \n     the United States.\n       (4) Substantial progress has been made in the development \n     of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to \n     existing devices that facilitate activities of daily living, \n     that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of \n     all ages. Such devices and adaptations increase the \n     involvement of such individuals in, and reduce expenditures \n     associated with, programs and activities such as early \n     intervention, education, rehabilitation and training, \n     employment, residential living, independent living, and \n     recreation programs and activities, and other aspects of \n     daily living.\n       (5) All States have comprehensive statewide programs of \n     technology-related assistance. Federal support for such \n     programs should continue, strengthening the capacity of each \n     State to assist individuals with disabilities of all ages \n     with their assistive technology needs.\n       (6) Notwithstanding the efforts of such State programs, \n     there is still a lack of--\n       (A) resources to pay for assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services;\n       (B) trained personnel to assist individuals with \n     disabilities to use such devices and services;\n       (C) information among targeted individuals about the \n     availability and potential benefit of technology for \n     individuals with disabilities;\n       (D) outreach to underrepresented populations and rural \n     populations;\n       (E) systems that ensure timely acquisition and delivery of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services;\n       (F) coordination among State human services programs, and \n     between such programs and private entities, particularly with \n     respect to transitions between such programs and entities; \n     and\n       (G) capacity in such programs to provide the necessary \n     technology-related assistance.\n       (7) In the current technological environment, the line of \n     demarcation between assistive technology and mainstream \n     technology is becoming ever more difficult to draw.\n       (8) Many individuals with disabilities cannot access \n     existing telecommunications and information technologies and \n     are at risk of not being able to access developing \n     technologies. The failure of Federal and State governments, \n     hardware manufacturers, software designers, information \n     systems managers, and telecommunications service providers to \n     account for the specific needs of individuals with \n     disabilities in the design, manufacture, and procurement of \n     telecommunications and information technologies results in \n     the exclusion of such individuals from the use of \n     telecommunications and information technologies and results \n     in unnecessary costs associated with the retrofitting of \n     devices and product systems.\n       (9) There are insufficient incentives for Federal \n     contractors and other manufacturers of technology to address \n     the application of technology advances to meet the needs of \n     individuals with disabilities of all ages for assistive \n     technology devices and assistive technology services.\n       (10) The use of universal design principles reduces the \n     need for many specific kinds of assistive technology devices \n     and assistive technology services by building in \n     accommodations for individuals with disabilities before \n     rather than after production. The use of universal design \n     principles also increases the likelihood that products \n     (including services) will be compatible with existing \n     assistive technologies. These principles are increasingly \n     important to enhance access to information technology, \n     telecommunications, transportation, physical structures, and \n     consumer products. There are insufficient incentives for \n     commercial manufacturers to incorporate universal design \n     principles into the design and manufacturing of technology \n     products, including devices of daily living, that could \n     expand their immediate use by individuals with disabilities \n     of all ages.\n       (11) There are insufficient incentives for commercial \n     pursuit of the application of technology devices to meet the \n     needs of individuals with disabilities, because of the \n     perception that such individuals constitute a limited market.\n       (12) At the Federal level, the Federal Laboratories, the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other \n     similar entities do not recognize the value of, or commit \n     resources on an ongoing basis to, technology transfer \n     initiatives that would benefit, and especially increase the \n     independence of, individuals with disabilities.\n       (13) At the Federal level, there is a lack of coordination \n     among agencies that provide or pay for the provision of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services. In addition, the Federal Government does not \n     provide adequate assistance and information with respect to \n     the quality and use of assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services to targeted individuals.\n       (14) There are changes in the delivery of assistive \n     technology devices and assistive technology services, \n     including--\n       (A) the impact of the increased prevalence of managed care \n     entities as payors for assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services;\n       (B) an increased focus on universal design;\n       (C) the increased importance of assistive technology in \n     employment, as more individuals with disabilities move from \n     public assistance to work through training and on-the-job \n     accommodations;\n       (D) the role and impact that new technologies have on how \n     individuals with disabilities will learn about, access, and \n     participate in programs or services that will affect their \n     lives; and\n       (E) the increased role that telecommunications play in \n     education, employment, health care, and social activities.\n\n[[Page S12503]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide financial assistance to States to undertake \n     activities that assist each State in maintaining and \n     strengthening a permanent comprehensive statewide program of \n     technology-related assistance, for individuals with \n     disabilities of all ages, that is designed to--\n       (A) increase the availability of, funding for, access to, \n     and provision of, assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services;\n       (B) increase the active involvement of individuals with \n     disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, \n     and authorized representatives, in the maintenance, \n     improvement, and evaluation of such a program;\n       (C) increase the involvement of individuals with \n     disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members, \n     guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in \n     decisions related to the provision of assistive technology \n     devices and assistive technology services;\n       (D) increase the provision of outreach to underrepresented \n     populations and rural populations, to enable the 2 \n     populations to enjoy the benefits of activities carried out \n     under this Act to the same extent as other populations;\n       (E) increase and promote coordination among State agencies, \n     between State and local agencies, among local agencies, and \n     between State and local agencies and private entities (such \n     as managed care providers), that are involved or are eligible \n     to be involved in carrying out activities under this Act;\n       (F)(i) increase the awareness of laws, regulations, \n     policies, practices, procedures, and organizational \n     structures, that facilitate the availability or provision of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services;

and\n       (K) increase the capacity of public agencies and private \n     entities to provide and pay for assistive technology devices \n     and assistive technology services on a statewide basis for \n     individuals with disabilities of all ages;\n       (2) to identify Federal policies that facilitate payment \n     for assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services, to identify those Federal policies that impede such \n     payment, and to eliminate inappropriate barriers to such \n     payment; and\n       (3) to enhance the ability of the Federal Government to--\n       (A) provide States with financial assistance that \n     supports--\n       (i) information and public awareness programs relating to \n     the provision of assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services;\n       (ii) improved interagency and public-private coordination, \n     especially through new and improved policies, that result in \n     increased availability of assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services; and\n       (iii) technical assistance and training in the provision or \n     use of assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services; and\n       (B) fund national, regional, State, and local targeted \n     initiatives that promote understanding of and access to \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services for targeted individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, let me begin with education. First of all, \nI want to express some concern about the fact that the administration \nhas decided, in the waning hours of this Congress, to suddenly bring \neducation up as an issue in this omnibus spending bill that we are \nworking on. I want to explain why I have concerns about this.\n  First of all, so far as I am aware, the administration never \nmentioned education as an issue, despite the fact that we have been \nnegotiating now for several weeks, until last Friday. All the time we \nwere working, trying to finish the business of the American people, the \nadministration never raised education as an issue, and suddenly on \nSaturday the President brings it up in his radio address, and now every \nday the President is somewhere doing a photo opportunity, or a press \nconference, or having a fundraiser on the education issue.\n  I want to say a little bit about that because part of what makes it \npossible for you to finish your work, under very difficult \ncircumstances at the end of a session, is when you have mutual trust, \nwhen you believe that both sides to the negotiation are acting in good \nfaith and that we are trying to do the work of the American people and \nnot gain political advantage. I am afraid that in this case the \nPresident is not acting in good faith in dealing with us on this issue.\n  A second reason I was surprised this issue surfaced so late in our \nnegotiations is that the President, in January, proposed in his initial \nbudget that we spend $32 billion in appropriations on education. When \nwe reported our funding bill, we spent $32 billion on education. So it \nseems strange to me to now have this issue raised about education when, \nin fact, we have provided almost exactly the amount of money that the \nPresident sought in January. But whether we think it is political or \nnot, whether it makes any sense, given that we have funded almost \nidentical levels to those requested by the President, the President has \nraised the education issue and I thought it was important to give a \nbrief response of what the difference is.\n  The dispute is not about how much money is going to be spent on \neducation. As I said earlier, the President requested $32 billion; we \nhave provided $32 billion. The question is not about how much money is \ngoing to be spent but the debate is about who is going to do the \nspending. Despite all the rhetoric of the President and the \nadministration, the debate is not about the level of spending but who \nis going to do the spending. They want the Federal Government to do the \nspending. They want bureaucrats in Washington, DC, to do the spending. \nAnd what Republicans have done in the first change in national \neducation policy in over 30 years is, we have voted to pass money back \nto local school districts so that local parents, local teachers, and \nlocally elected school board members can set education priority. So the \ndebate is not about how much money is going to be spent, the debate is \nabout who is going to do the spending.\n  Since the President has raised the issue, let me tell you our side of \nthe story. Our side of the story first points out that we spend a lot \nof money on education, and we should. In 1969, we were spending $68.5 \nbillion on primary and secondary education in America.\n\n[[Page S12534]]\n\n Today, we are spending a whopping $564.2 billion. So, in dollar terms, \nwe have almost increased education funding tenfold.\n  But yet, while education funding has exploded since 1969, we have \nseen SAT scores, which measure high school achievement, stagnate, we \nhave seen reading stores stagnate, and we have seen, since 1969, a \nsystematic decline of American student performance on international \ntests, where we have gone from virtually the top of each major learning \ncategory to near the bottom on each learning category.\n  In fact, I just pick two here. This last year on international tests \non physics, of all the nations that participated in the program, the \nUnited States of America ranked dead last. On math, a critically \nimportant ability given the modern era we live in--and we all \nunderstand the importance of mathematical skills in the information \nage--America ranked second to last of all nations that participated in \nthe math testing program. This despite the fact that, on a per capita \nbasis, we are one of the largest spenders on education in the world, \nspending in some cases two or three times as much per student as the \nnations that achieved the top scores on these tests.\n  One of the reasons we are spending so much money and getting so \nlittle for it is really encapsulated in this chart. What this chart \nseeks to do is to show the 23 different federal government agencies \nthat we have funding education through 300 different Federal programs, \nin trying to provide money for teachers, for at-risk students, and for \nyoung children. As you can see, looking at this chart, what we have \ncreated is a massive bureaucracy which has overlapping responsibilities \nand where we have 300 different programs basically all trying to \nachieve the same thing.\n  Looking at this chart, you will not be shocked by the next chart. The \nnext chart really is the measure of how efficient we are in getting the \ndollar we spend in Washington through to the classroom where the child \nis learning. What this tries to show is, starting out with $1 we spend \nhere--not just through the Department of Education, but all federal \neducation spending--how much of it actually gets to the classroom. \nFifteen cents of every dollar we spend never gets to the school \ndistrict because, for all practical purposes, it never gets out of the \nState and Federal bureaucracy. It basically is consumed here and in \nvarious State capitals, with Federal bureaucracies that we are \nbasically paying to tell people how to run education. Forty-eight cents \nout of every dollar can go to support local bureaucracies--support \nstaff, administration staff, people who are not directly involved in \nclassroom instruction.\n  So the bottom line is, from all of this mass of bureaucracy, we are \ngetting 37 cents out of every dollar the federal government is spending \non education into the classroom. So no wonder we are spending all this \nmoney with such poor results. This is the existing system. It is the \n37-cent solution. And the President says, many of our colleagues say, \ngive this system more money.\n  Our answer has been, look, if this system can only get 37 cents out \nof every dollar to the classroom, this system is fundamentally broken \nand it needs to be changed. What we would do in changing it is, \nbasically, we want to go to a block grant system which takes much of \nthe money that we spend in Washington, except for the amount that is \ntargeted to critical needs such as children with special learning \ndisabilities, special education programs, and what we would like to do \nis take $10.2 billion of the money we are spending in Washington and, \nrather than giving 63 cents out of every dollar of it to bureaucrats, \nwhich we do now, we would like to take the $10.2 billion and give it \ndirectly to local school systems. So local parents, local teachers, and \nlocally elected school board members would determine how that money is \nspent. That gives us a 100-cent solution, because then every dollar \nwill go to local teachers, local parents, and locally elected school \nboard members.\n  The President and, obviously, many people in Washington believe we \nknow better; that it is worth having a program where only 37 cents out \nof every dollar gets to the classroom because the bureaucracy is adding \nso much value by telling parents and teachers and locally elected \nschool board members, who do not understand education, how to do it.\n  If anybody ever believed that, surely when we are in a situation \nwhere our test scores have stagnated, our reading scores are flat or \ndeclining, and where we are ranking last, or near last, in every \nachievement test given internationally, I just think it is \nunconscionable and hurtful to the country and to the children to stay \nwith a system where only 37 cents out of every dollar we spend gets \nthrough to the classroom.\n  That is what the debate is about. When you hear the President say, \n``We want Congress to act on education,'' we have already acted. The \nPresident wanted $32 billion. We have given the President $32 billion. \nBut where the difference is, the President wanted the Federal \nGovernment to spend the money, the President wanted to keep a system \nwhere 63 cents out of every dollar gets lost before it gets to the \nclassroom, and what we are trying to do is to give the money directly \nto local school systems and cut the bureaucrats out of it.\n  When you hear the President talking about this issue, understand \nthat, despite what he appears to be saying, the dispute is not about \nhow much money is going to be spent, the dispute is about who is going \nto do the spending. Bill Clinton and our Democrat colleagues want the \nFederal Government to do the spending with an old system where \nbureaucrats get 63 cents out of every dollar. We want local parents, \nlocal teachers, locally elected school board members to do the \nspending, because we believe that people love their children more than \nthe Government does. We believe that parents know better about \neducation than the Government does.\n  Let me also say for those who say, ``Where are the education bills \nthat have been passed in this Congress?'' let me just remind those who \nare interested that we passed a bill in this Congress, this year, that \nprovided parents with the ability to set aside tax free up to $2,000 a \nyear to use to send their children to summer school or to get \nafterschool tutoring or to buy education equipment, like a computer, or \nto send their children to parochial or private schools, if they choose. \nThe President vetoed that bill.\n  We passed literacy funding. The President vetoed that bill.\n  We passed a teacher merit pay program. The President, standing with \nthe teachers unions and not with the students, vetoed that bill.\n  We passed a bill giving low-income families some choice in education. \nThe President sent his child to private school in the District of \nColumbia, and he had every right to do it. The point is, however, that \nwe wanted to give working families the same rights the President had, \nand the President vetoed it.\n  We had tax relief for parents whose children use the State tuition \nprepaid plan where you can start paying, even before your child is \nborn, for him or her to go to Texas A, and you can do it at a \ndiscount because your money is building up. If they pass the test and \ncan get in, you have paid for it. We wanted to give tax advantages to \nencourage families to do that. The President vetoed it.\n  We had tax relief for employer-provided education assistance. We have \nall heard employers everywhere saying to us, ``The kids who come to \nwork for us out of high school don't have the skills they need. They \ncan't read, they can't write, they can't reason.'' So employers are \nbeginning to pay their own money to reeducate their workers. We wanted \nto encourage it by making it tax free if they do that, because they \nknow the skills they need. The President vetoed it.\n  Finally, we now are trying to give local school systems more control, \nto take control away from Federal bureaucrats. The President says he \nwill veto it unless we change it to spend the money his way, which is \n63 cents for bureaucrats and 37 cents for classrooms. That is not good \nenough for America anymore.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes left.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12533-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12535-S12536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12535]]\n            HOME HEALTH CARE, R TAX AND THE WORLD ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me now turn to home health care, R \ntax credit and the world economy.\n\n\n                            Home Health Care\n\n  We put together a bill in the Finance Committee to provide $1 billion \nto the home health care industry, which has been hit by a failure of \nHCFA to implement a workable program to try to control the exploding \ncost of home health care.\n  As my colleagues will remember, we passed a bill to have a simple $5 \ncopayment for home health care. That copayment would not apply to \nmoderate-income people who would have their cost paid by Medicaid. The \nadministration said, no, that they could save the money in another way, \nthat they could reform the system. So in the omnibus reconciliation \nbill for the 1997 budget last Congress, we gave them the ability to do \nthat. Now they have come up with a totally unworkable program which \nthey say they can't fix.\n  We responded in two ways: No. 1, we in the Senate Finance Committee \ncame up with a bill to provide $1 billion for home health care, and we \npaid for it by going back and correcting a technical error in the 1997 \nbill. We meant in that bill to require the Federal Government to reduce \npayments to health care providers for bad debt because it was producing \nperverse incentives where they were not trying to collect debts, since \nthe Government paid them off 100 cents on the dollar, and where they \nwere basically extending credit where there was no hope of collection \nbecause, again, it wasn't their money.\n  We meant to do that for every health care provider, but by a \ntechnical drafting error, it only applied to hospitals. So we were \ngoing to expand it to every other health care provider. It saved us \nabout $1 billion from current law, and we were going to provide $1 \nbillion for home health care relief to give the administration another \nyear or 18 months to try to fix the problem that they have created. We \nhave now had Members of the Senate--at least one Member--object to that \nfunding mechanism.\n  Look, I don't object to the fact that Senators have a right to stop a \nbill in the waning hours of the session. I think that represents part \nof the strength of the Senate and, quite frankly, if you are going to \nmake laws in the last hour of the session, you ought to have unanimous \nagreement.\n  I am disappointed, because I thought that was a reasonable way to try \nto fix the problem. We now have many other people trying to come up \nwith ways of funding this $1 billion, including some proposals that we \nhave a bunch of little tax increases.\n  I don't think that is the way to go. I hope we can work out a \ncompromise, but there has been so much said about this issue that I \nwanted to come to the floor and go on record as saying I am for the \nsolution that we reached in the Finance Committee that would pay for \nanother $1 billion of aid to home health care by changing the 1997 law \nto stop payments for bad debt so that if you don't collect your bills, \nyou have to pay for it, and not the taxpayer. I hope we can work out \nsomething.\n  I certainly believe it is possible to come up with a solution. I \nthought we had a good one. Someone objected to it. So now we are \nscrambling trying to find another solution.\n\n\n                               R Credit\n\n  I am for the R tax credit. I think it should be extended. I think \nthe House has come up with a good extender bill. I am for the House \nbill. I am afraid that if we fool around trying to add items, like tax \ncredits for biomass energy, which I think is a wasteful subsidy, that \nwe are going to end up with one bill in the Senate, one bill in the \nHouse, and we are not going to get the tax extenders. I hope we can \njust adopt the House bill which deals fundamentally with the major \nissue in the tax extenders, and that major issue is the R tax credit.\n\n\n                             World Economy\n\n  Finally, in the few minutes I have left, let me say a little bit \nabout the world economy. I think that something fundamentally is \ngetting lost in all of this discussion in the last couple of weeks \nabout the world economy. One would think in listening to the \nadministration and the many commentators that the problem in the world \neconomy is that there is some economic equivalent to the flu which is \ngoing around the world and it is being caught randomly.\n  The plain truth is, the collapse of the economies in Asia was due to \ncrony capitalism where government was directing capital politically \nrather than economically. That system failed. As a result, it pulled \ndown the economies, first of Thailand, and now several countries in \nAsia, including Japan.\n  The solution to the problem is to end crony capitalism. The solution \nto the problem is to open their markets for competition from American \ngoods and goods produced all around the world, and eliminate the crony \ncapitalism in places like Japan, where American goods had been kept out \nand in the process it has weakened their economy and it has hurt the \nworld economy. The solution is not to engage in capital controls. And \nthe solution is not to simply have the world use its money to support \neconomic systems that do not work.\n  So I think it is important to remember that the problem in the world \neconomy is that we had countries practicing crony capitalism. I think \nin the end this can turn out to be a good thing, not a bad thing. I \nthink if we reform economies in Asia, if we learn the lesson in America \nthat the Government should not be deciding where investments are made, \nI think the world economy can come back and be strong.\n  I am very concerned about the International Monetary Fund. It was set \nup at the end of World War II as part of the Bretton Woods agreement. \nIn those days, we had fixed exchange rates, and the IMF was supposed to \nprovide financing to make the system work. The United States, in 1969, \nwent on flexible exchange rates. The Bretton Woods agreement died. We \nhave not had an international financial crisis come out of America \nsince. So IMF has been scrambling to try to find something to do.\n  I do not believe they have done a good job. I think in Russia they \nprovided money most of which was simply stolen. I think they did not \nget the economic reforms they sought, and they squandered their money \nand ours. I am very concerned about what is happening in much of Asia. \nBut I have decided, with some concrete reforms, to go along with \nadditional money for IMF. But they are going to have to make the \nreforms to get the money.\n  The reforms are: If you want to use your money, you can do anything \nyou want to do economically in the world. If you want to shoot your \neconomy in the foot, or someplace worse, you have a right to do it, but \nyou do not have a right to do it with our money. If you want our money, \nyou are going to have to set out a plan to open up your economy for \nworld trade, you are going to have to have movement toward free trade \nand free capital movement, you are going to have to set up a system \nwhere you give everybody equal justice under the law in areas like \nbankruptcy, and you are going to have to end crony capitalism where the \nkinfolks of rulers, where politically favored members of political \nparties, end up getting ownership of property and end up getting \ninvestment under their control.\n  The point is, these reforms are critically important if we are to \navoid a world financial crisis. And these reforms are going to have to \nbe made if we are going to provide the IMF the money.\n  I just want to respond very briefly to the representative from \nFrance, and others, who said, ``How dare the United States of America \ntry to tell us what to do.'' Let me make it clear, we do not care what \nthey do with their money. But if they are going to spend our money, \nthey are going to have to use it on programs that we believe can work. \nAnd if they do not want to do it our way, that is great, just do not \ntake our money; and they are not going to get it unless they do it our \nway.\n  Finally, I think in some ways we are adding to the world financial \ncrisis by using rhetoric that seems akin to the sort of ``The sky is \nfalling'' logic. Crony capitalism failed. Government does not work as \nan allocator of capital. That is hardly a surprise, but it is a lesson \nthat is proven in Japan and all over Asia.\n  I remember not long ago sitting down with a President and with a \nCabinet Member and another Member of the Senate, and there was really a \ndiscussion about our Government funding\n\n[[Page S12536]]\n\nhigh-definition television as part of industrial policy; the Japanese \nwere doing it, and we could lose our cutting edge in technology.\n  Well, what happened? Fortunately, we did not do it. I opposed it. The \nJapanese invested over $1 billion in their technology, which failed. \nThe world adopted our private technology, and we now dominate the world \nmarket. Crony capitalism does not work in America, it does not work in \nJapan, it certainly did not work in Korea and Thailand, and the sooner \nthey change their system, the better off they are going to be.\n  If they want to set their economy right by using a system that we \nknow works--capitalism and democracy--then we want to help. If they \nwant to keep trying crony capitalism and socialism, we wish them good \nluck, we will include them in our prayers, but we will not fund that \nexperiment, because we know it does not work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the budget process and the status of events now pending between \nthe Congress and the Administration.\n  We have come to a stage on appropriations where so many decisions are \nleft, in the final analysis, to negotiations which involve only four \nMembers of Congress and now the Chief of Staff of the President's \nadministration, which I believe is far removed from the regular order \nof the United States Congress and the regular order as envisioned by \nthe Constitution where the Congress legislates, presents bills to the \nPresident, and the President either signs or vetoes those bills.\n  We have, as we all know, 100 Members of the Senate and 435 Members of \nthe House of Representatives. And it is my view that, if \nunconstitutional, it is certainly an unwise de facto delegation of \npower to four Members of Congress: The Majority and Minority Leaders of \nthe Senate, the Speaker, and the Minority Leader of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  My bill is illustrative. I chair the appropriations subcommittee \nwhich has jurisdiction of three major Departments: The Department of \nEducation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nDepartment of Labor. And my staff and I worked during the month of \nAugust, a recess month, so that when we came back into session on \nAugust 31 we would be prepared, as we were on September 1, to have the \nsubcommittee act. The full committee then acted on September 3 in an \neffort to have this complex and important bill considered early on by \nthe Senate.\n  The bill never came to the Senate floor because of other pressing \nbusiness and candidly, because the bill was so controversial that it \nwould likely be tied up in matters which might not be resolved. \nHowever, I believe that had these issues been debated on the Senate \nfloor, I think that they would have had chance, a realistic chance. \nUltimately, with enough time and effort, we could have prevailed. \nSimilarly, in the House of Representatives there was never floor \nconsideration to the legislation covering these three important \ndepartments.\n  So the subcommittee chairman and the ranking members met and tried to \nwork out many of the points of contention. The matters have never been \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate where under our procedures \nSenators have the right to offer amendments, the right to modify \nfigures in the regular legislative consideration.\n  We are going to have to take a hard look at our procedures when we \nreconvene next January so that we go back to the regular order and to \nthe process under which this body, the Senate, considers the \nlegislation we have handled on the floor and then in the conference \nreport and then present it to the President for his signature or for \nhis veto, as he exercises his Presidential judgment.\n  We had a conference last Friday with representatives from the Office \nof Management and Budget and the chairmen of the Appropriations \nCommittees from both Houses, as well as the chairmen of the \nsubcommittees and ranking members. At that time we were considering an \nobjection which the President had raised to the appropriations bill \ncovering education. The President had just had a rose garden news \nconference and was very, very critical of Congress for failing to meet \nhis demands, his requests, his priorities on education.\n  I was asked to participate in a responsive news conference which, \nunlike the President's power of the bully pulpit, received virtually no \nattention. The facts are these: The President has requested for \neducation $31,185,302,000; on Friday the House-Senate Conference \nCommittee had come to a figure of $31,832,358,000. Rounding off the \nnumbers, the President was at $31.2 billion and the House-Senate \nconference was at $31.8 billion. We were $600 million over the \nPresident's figure. It led me at that news conference to comment that \nthe President either did not know what the figures were or was \nnegotiating not in good faith in representing that the Congress had not \nmet his requests for an education funding figure.\n  A further controversy developed, and I believe is still pending, \nalthough those negotiations are ongoing. And minute by minute we do not \nknow whether agreements are made or not until we hear their final \nreport. The President asked for $1.1 billion for classroom size. The \nPresident proposed paying for that item with the proceeds from the \ntobacco settlement, except there never was a tobacco settlement and we \nnever had those proceeds to work with.\n  My subcommittee had anticipated that problem and had, in the report \nwhich we filed, provided for reduction in classroom size to meet what \nthe President considered a priority. We agreed with him that it was a \npriority. We allocated some $300 million for that effort. According to \nthe information presented in our conference, the maximum expenditure \nfor the next fiscal year would have been $50 million. So we had \nadequately taken care of the President's priority and we had more than \nenough funding to proceed for the first year.\n  It was our concern that the congressional authorizing committees had \nnot taken up the item, which should be done in the context where we saw \nthere was adequate funding. Had we had the tobacco proceeds, I think a \ngood bit more attention would have been paid to this. When the funding \ndid not come through, the subcommittee made its best efforts. I believe \nthe facts are illustrated on these items, which were the bones of \ncontention. The subcommittee had provided more funding for education \nthan the President had requested, and it made an appropriate allocation \nfor classroom reduction size. Congress had done its job on education.\n  It is obvious that when the President speaks from that bully pulpit \nhe may even get more attention than when a Senator addresses the same \nsubject on the Senate floor, seen by very few people on C-SPAN2. But at \nleast we do what we can to establish the record for the propriety of \nour congressional action.\n  The business of having 535 elected Members of the Congress delegate \nauthority to four individual Members, short-circuiting our process, is \nnot in the national interest.\n  One of the items which has been under consideration in the \nsubcommittee has been a complex question of organ transplants. The \nsubcommittee has adopted the recommendation of the administration, put \nforward by Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, to \nestablish regulations issued by her Department. We held a hearing on \nthe subject and tried to\n\n[[Page S12537]]\n\ncome to grips with that issue. A differing point of view was put forth \nby the House of Representatives.\n  I concede that while the House advocates had parochial interests of \ntheir State, I, too, had an interest in Pennsylvania on this issue. \nLooking at the broader national aspects, it really is a matter to be \ndecided by the medical experts. I think that was provided for in the \nregulations proposed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The \nSecretary had no parochial interest and was speaking for the national \ninterest. If the Secretary was wrong, that is a matter which ought to \nbe decided by the authorizing committee. It ought not to be left to the \nappropriators.\n  That is only illustrative of many, many riders we have where the \nappropriators are called upon to decide very, very complex questions \nwhich ought to be resolved after hearings, analysis, floor debate, and \na decision on what is public policy. They really are not issues to be \ndecided by how much money ought to be allocated to a specific line, \nwhich is the function of appropriations.\n  It is my hope that these procedures will be corrected when the \nCongress reconvenes next January, to find a way to return to regular \norder and to have these issues considered by the full Senate, \nconsidered in a Conference Committee, and presented to the President.\n  When we had our conference last Friday, I raised the question head on \nwith members of the Office of Management and Budget where this \neducation item was a matter for veto. He had some difference of opinion \nof some $330 million, which is not insignificant, but is not enormous \non a $32 billion budget. The representative of the administration \ncouldn't answer the question. If we had passed a bill and submitted it \nto the President, I think he would not have vetoed. My instinct is if \nwe passed a bill and submitted it to the President, the funding figure \nwhich he wished for, classroom size reduction, which has now been \nconceded by the congressional negotiators, but it left open the issue \nof whether it would be decided by the States and local government or \ndecided by the Federal Government, with the President pressing to have \na mandate from the Federal Government operated out of Washington \ninstead of leaving it to local government.\n  Here again, I think the President would not have exercised his veto, \nor at least had we followed regular order and the constitutional \nprocedure without having the President in the negotiations on the \nappropriations bill--where he ought not to be, his representative ought \nnot to be--we would have had a determination as to whether it rose to \nthe magnitude of a Presidential veto.\n  Our institutions have been well served, as we know, when we follow \nconstitutional procedures, when you follow regular order on what has \nbeen established. I do believe that these shortcuts are not in the \npublic interest and we ought to return to the tried and tested ways of \nthe appropriations process.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the chart I \nreferred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                                    LABOR, HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         House committee  Senate committee      Tentative         Tentative\n                                                                     1998 comparable   Budget request         bill              bill        agreement--House  agreement--Senate   Open issues UA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle II--Department of HHS, current year (federal)...............      162,167,174       177,149,724       176,289,059       176,178,717       178,665,109        178,695,109            30,000\n    Prior year advances...........................................       31,036,993        31,718,189        31,718,189        31,718,189        31,718,189         31,718,189   ...............\n    Trust funds, current year.....................................        1,798,072         1,951,665         1,951,665         1,694,715         1,955,665          1,955,665   ...............\n                                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.......................................................      195,002,239       210,819,578       209,958,913       209,591,621       212,338,963        212,368,963            30,000\n                                                                   =============================================================================================================================\n    Mandatory, current year.......................................      132,981,566       145,960,968       146,055,968       146,040,968       146,230,968        146,230,968   ...............\n        Prior year advances.......................................       29,099,993        29,618,189        29,618,189        29,618,189        29,618,189         29,618,189   ...............\n                                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Subtotal: Mandatory.....................................      162,081,559       175,579,157       175,674,157       175,659,157       175,849,157        175,849,157   ...............\n                                                                   =============================================================================================================================\n    Discretionary.................................................       29,185,608        31,188,756        30,233,091        30,137,749        32,434,141         32,464,141            30,000\n        Prior year advances.......................................        1,937,000         2,100,000         2,100,000         2,100,000         2,100,000          2,100,000   ...............\n        Trust funds, current year.................................        1,798,072         1,951,665         1,951,665         1,694,715         1,955,665          1,955,665   ...............\n        Projected HCFA user fee collections.......................  ................

Mr. President, we have seen the issue of hate crimes \nagain tragically before the American people with a horrendous event in \nLaramie, WY, on October 6, just last week, where a young man, Matthew \nShepard, was kidnaped, robbed, severely beaten, and left tied to a \nfence in freezing weather. He died 5 days later from his wounds.\n  Two men have been charged with the murder. It appears that the attack \nwas motivated at least in part by an antigay bias. Police have stated \nthat while robbery was the main motive for the attack, that Mr. Shepard \nwas apparently chosen as a victim because he was gay.\n  It has been reported by the investigators that the two suspects lured \nMr. Shepard from the bar by stating that they, too, were gay and wanted \nto meet with him. The girlfriend of one of the two suspects has stated \nthat Shepard was targeted because he had flirted with the suspect \nearlier that evening and allegedly embarrassed him.\n  The issue of hate crimes was very much a national focus months ago, \non June 7 of 1998, when Mr. James Byrd, Jr., an African-American, was \nkidnaped and killed by being dragged from the back of a pickup truck. \nThree white men have been charged with the murder. The evidence \nindicates that there was racial motivation for the attack. Authorities \nhave stated that all three suspects were white supremacists and had \nwhite supremacist tattoos on their bodies. All three were identified as \nbelonging to the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate Knights of America \nwhile serving in prison. Racist literature was seized from the home \nshared by the suspects.\n  The current hate crime legislation was deemed inadequate on the \nmurder of Mr. Byrd because the victim was attacked in a way where he \nwas not seeking to exercise a federally protected right.\n  On November 13, 1997, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wyden, and I \nintroduced the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has not moved forward. \nIt is my view that there is no place in America for\n\n[[Page S12538]]\n\nhate. There is just no place in America for hate. There is no place for \nhatred of African-Americans, hatred of Asians, and there is no place \nfor hatred of Jews, Muslims, gays, or anyone else. That is antithetical \nto America, antithetical to the concepts of the melting pot. We see \naround the world what has happened in places like Bosnia, and we see \nwhat has happened in Kosovo, and we have seen what has happened in \nAfrica. But in the United States, there is no place for hate.\n  I have asked both leaders in the Congress and the President to push \nto have this legislation included in the final Omnibus Appropriations \nAct. I know it is difficult to do. Let's see what happens on it. There \nought to be a very, very strong stand taken against hate. Gays ought to \nbe included in the protection, and we ought not to have the highly \ntechnical, legalistic concepts of the exercise of a federally protected \nright.\n  I served for 8 years as district attorney of Philadelphia and 4 years \nas assistant district attorney before that, and crime was horrendous. \nBut when hate is added to the crime, it becomes an intolerable \ncircumstance, something which should be acted upon by the Congress of \nthe United States. The legislation has been modified to arrive at a \nsituation where local authorities would call for Federal assistance. I \nam not sure that is a wise provision, because so frequently we find \nlocal authorities unwilling to act, and that is really the reason for \nthe necessity for Federal action. But the legislation has been modified \nin a number of important respects to try to give an impetus for \nenactment. We should not await the next tragedy on hate--whether it is \ndirected to someone of Asian ancestry, or someone who is Jewish, or a \nMuslim, or a gay, or an African-American--to motivate us to take the \nappropriate steps and be very, very tough in the response and \nprosecution of those offenses.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of anyone else seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12537-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12538-S12539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk about education \nin the last few days, especially from the White House, and about \nadequate funding for education. I think no item more clearly defines \nthe difference between the two parties on the issue of funding \neducation than the issue of special education.\n  This White House has been so enthusiastic for creating new programs, \nthat are controlled here in Washington, which tell the teachers, \nprincipals, parents, and students back in my State, and in the State of \nMississippi, where the occupant of the Chair comes from, and every \nState of this country, how they shall run their schools on a day-to-day \nbasis, how to manage curriculums, whom they shall hire, when they shall \nhire them, what they will do after school. This administration has been \nso insistent in trying to move the control of education to the Federal \nlevel and now has come forward with a new series of efforts to \naccomplish that. But this administration has failed consistently to \nfund the most fundamental obligation of the Federal Government in the \narea of education--specifically, the obligation under special \neducation.\n  Back in 1976, I think, when the special education bill was passed, \nwhich was a major step forward in this Nation toward caring for kids \nwho have special needs, the Federal Government committed to the local \ncommunities of this country that it would pay 40 percent of the cost of \nthose children's educational needs. But what has happened? Well, when \nthe Republican Congress took control of Congress 4 years ago, at that \npoint, the obligations being paid by the Federal Government weren't 40 \npercent of the cost of special ed needs, they were only 6 percent of \nthe costs. The difference, 34 percent, which was supposed to be picked \nup by the Federal Government, was being borne by the local taxpayer.\n  What was the practical effect of that? The practical effect of that \nwas that the local tax burden was skewed and the local school \ndistricts' ability to support their educational agenda was controlled \nnot by what they wanted to do but by their need to meet a Federal \nmandate that was not being paid for by the Federal Government--\nspecifically, special education. So where a local school board might \nhave wanted to add new teachers, or an afterschool program, or a new \nlanguage program, or put in new computers, they could not do it. Why? \nBecause they had to pay the cost of the special education students, \nwhich costs were supposed to be borne by the Federal Government, at \nleast to the extent of 40 percent.\n  So you would have thought that this ``education Presidency''--as it \ntries to proclaim itself--would have wanted to correct that problem, \nwould have recognized that as the first step in its efforts on \neducation, and would have fulfilled the underlying obligation to \nspecial needs kids and paid the 40 percent the Federal Government is \nobliged to pay under the law.\n  What actually happened? In every budget that the President of the \nUnited States has sent up to this Congress since this Congress was \ntaken over by the Republican Party, there has been essentially no \nincrease in funding for special education. As a result, what this \nadministration has said is: Rather than funding the needs of special ed \nkids, we want to create brand new programs, we want to go out and tell \nthe school districts what they are going to have to do with Federal \ndollars, rather than using the Federal dollars to fund the needs of the \nspecial needs kids the way we are supposed to under the law.\n  So they set up this scenario where they say to local school \ndistricts: We are not going to pay you what we are supposed to and \nallow you to free up your money to spend it on what you need, such as \nbooks and teachers--or whatever the local school district thinks it \nneeds. Rather, we are going to tell you what you need, and we are going \nto make you come to the Federal Government, come to the Federal \nbureaucrat, and say, ``Please, Federal bureaucrat, give us back some of \nour money so we can pay for new educational initiatives.'' But we have \nto do exactly what you tell us in initiating those initiatives. It \nobviously makes no sense.\n\n  What did the Republican Congress do? It said let's live up to our \nobligations as a Congress first. So we made a priority. In fact, S. 1, \nthe No. 1 bill of the Senate, made as its priority setting a course to \nfully fund special education at the 40 percent required under the law. \nWe made great strides in this under the leadership of the majority \nleader, under the leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is \nthe head of the appropriations subcommittee, with the strong effort of \nthe coalition here on our side of the aisle.\n  We have increased funding for special education dramatically in the \nlast 3 years, with no help from the administration. Three years ago, we \nput it up; we increased special education funding by almost $700 \nmillion. Last year, we increased it by almost $690 million. This year, \nwe have increased it again by $500 million. So we have taken the \npercentage which the Federal Government is paying for special education \nfrom 6 percent when we took control of the Congress up to over 10 \npercent now, and it is moving in the right direction.\n  Now, one more time this week, we hear this disingenuous argument \ncoming from the administration that if we are going to have good \neducation, we have to create a new program where the Federal \nGovernment, the President, and his friends at some national labor union \nand down here at the Department of Education tell local educators how \nto spend their dollars and what they must spend their dollars on.\n  If the President really wanted to address the educational needs of \nthis country, he would say to local school districts: I want another $1 \nbillion, but I want to give it back to the local school districts to \nhelp them with special education, and that will free up the local \nschool districts to be able to spend money for what they think they \nneed.\n\n[[Page S12539]]\n\n  Not every school district in this country needs more teachers. Not \nevery school district in this country has a terrible school building. \nSome school districts need more computers. Some school districts want \nto expand their language programs. Some school districts want to expand \ntheir dance programs. Some may want to expand their math programs. That \ndecision should be made at the local level. Only the parents, only the \nteachers, only the principals really know what a local school district \nneeds in order to make it a better place for kids to learn in. We don't \nknow in Washington.\n  Yet, the President and his friends and his supporters seem to feel \nthat they know best, that they can run all the school districts in this \ncountry out of some building down here on Constitution Avenue. It \ndoesn't work that way.\n  If we really want to help out local school districts, what we will do \nis relieve them of having to fulfill the obligations of the Federal \nGovernment by paying the costs of special education and free up those \ndollars so that the local school districts can spend them where they \nsee fit, where they feel they will get the best return. If we really \nwant to help local education, what we will do as a Congress and what \nthe President should be suggesting is that we will fund the special \neducation needs of kids in this country to the tune of 40 percent, \nwhich we committed to.\n  Ironically, if you take the dollars being proposed by the President \nto be spent on his new categorical programs where he tells everybody in \nthe country how to run their school districts, and you add them up, in \n5 years--which is the goal that we have set as a Republican Congress--\nin 5 years, you will be at just about the 40 percent that the Federal \nGovernment said it was going to spend on special education. If you take \nthose dollars and you move them over to special education, you will be \naccomplishing what we said we were going to do back in the 1970s. But, \nmore importantly, we will be freeing up the local school districts to \neducate kids the way they know they must be educated rather than the \nway some bureaucrat down here in Washington thinks they should be \neducated.\n  That is the difference. That is what the debate is about. The \nRepublicans believe that schools should be operated at the local level, \nthat it should be the parents, the teachers, and the principals who \nmake the decisions on education. Regrettably, some of our colleagues on \nthe other side, and clearly the people down on Pennsylvania Avenue, \nfeel that they know better than parents, teachers, and principals--they \nshould be the ones operating our schools.\n  This is not a dollar fight. It is not a question of putting more \ndollars in education. It is a question of where the dollars go, how \nthey are better managed, how they can give the best return for the \ndollars spent for education which we need.\n  So there is the difference.\n  The Republican Congress is showing the right way. We have put our \nmoney in the right programs. We have committed to special education the \nhuge increase in spending. I just wish the President would join us in \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12538-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I can do no better than to echo the \neloquent remarks of my friend and colleague from New Hampshire. The \ndebate over education today is not a debate over its importance. It is \nnot a debate over the relative commitment of Republicans and Democrats \nto increase the educational opportunities for our children. The debate, \nas we have it today, is over who determines how and where that money \nshould be spent--bureaucrats in Washington, DC, or the parents, \nteachers, principals, and elected school board members in thousands of \nschool districts across the United States. That debate is a vitally \nimportant one.\n  In his 1997 state of education speech, Secretary Riley said, ``We \nshould not cloud our children's future with silly arguments about \nFederal Government intrusion.'' But that is exactly what this debate is \nabout. It isn't silly, and it couldn't possibly be more important.\n  Secretary Riley may feel it very natural that he and the President \nand his bureaucrats in the Department of Education here in Washington, \nDC, should set those priorities for all of the thousands of school \ndistricts across the country. We do not. We believe in the wisdom of \nschool board members and in the dedication of principals and teachers \nand parents to the quality of their children's education.\n  I want to emphasize once again, the President in his budget this year \nasked for $31.4 billion for education. The budget passed by the Senate \nof the United States has $31.4 billion for education. Later, the \nPresident came back and asked for an additional $1.1 billion. \nRepublicans have agreed that that $1.1 billion is appropriate.\n  But in negotiations, of which I have been a part, the President has \nnarrow prescriptions for the use of that $1.1 billion. In fact, when I \nlooked at the statutory language that the President's people asked for, \nthe first two lines were about the appropriation of $1.1 billion. All \nof the rest of the language was designed to restrict the discretion of \nState and local education agencies in connection with the spending of \nthat $1.1 billion, narrowly focused on teachers, focused even more on \nteachers in the first three grades; subject to the rules and \nregulations of the Federal Department of Education at every possible \nturn, the distribution formula and the set of rules already adopted for \nthe spending of money from the pot into which this $1.1 billion is to \ngo, according to the President. The formal rules take up just 15 pages \nof regulations--perhaps 15 pages too many. But the nonregulatory \nguidance for those regulations is another 171 pages. And, of course, \nthere would have to be additional regulations on top of those, and \nadditional guidance on top of those, for this program as the President \nhas recommended it.\n\n  In its publication called ``Education At The Crossroads,'' the \nEducation Committee of the House of Representatives reports that there \nare now 760 Federal education programs, requiring something over \n48,600,000 hours of paperwork per year--48,600,000 hours of paperwork. \nWe simply need not add to that burden. Mr. President, 90 percent of \nthose hours now paid for out of the education budgets of our school \ndistricts and of our States, 90 percent of those hours could be far \nmore profitably spent on additional instruction for our students or the \nmoney spent on improving the physical quality of our schools or the \nequipment that our schools and our teachers use to train our children. \nBut those moneys are now spent meeting the regulations of the Federal \nGovernment accompanying the modest amount of money--some 7 percent to 8 \npercent--the modest amount of money that the Federal Government \nsupplies as against the States and local taxpayers for the maintenance \nand the instruction in our public school program.\n  We, on the other hand, without a debate with the President over the\n\n[[Page S12540]]\n\namount of money to be spent on education, prefer that it be distributed \nthrough an existing Federal program, the one existing Federal program \nthat carries very few regulations with it, directly to the school \ndistricts of the United States, to be spent in the way that each of \nthose school districts feels most appropriate. More teachers? Yes, \nwhere those school districts feel that is their No. 1 priority. Focused \non special education where, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed \nout, we have imposed innumerable burdens and regulations on our school \ndistricts but supply less than 10 percent of the money to meet those \nregulations? On other matters that may be more significant to \nparticular school districts across the country? Yes.\n  In discussion of this issue in the course of the last 24 hours with a \ndistinguished Democratic Member of the House of Representatives on the \ncommittee there dealing with education, we were told that even in that \nRepresentative's own district, the school boards could not be trusted. \nThis Representative was eloquent on the tumbled-down nature of many of \nthe schools in his city, eloquent on the lack of adequate teaching in \nthat school district, but he was totally unwilling to let the people \nwho elected both him and the school board members in his city--he was \nunwilling to allow those elected school board members to decide how \nthis new money should be used. He was convinced, for some reason or \nanother, that they would ignore the condition of their schools and the \nquality of their teachers and find something else to spend the money \non.\n  Between that idea and ours, there is a great gulf fixed. We feel that \nif the school boards are allowed to determine how this money should be \nspent, it will, in the vast majority of all cases, be spent more wisely \nthan it could possibly be spent under a set of one-size-fits-all \nregulations from Washington, DC, and we feel that there will be more \nmoney in the schools because less of it will be used for this 48-plus \nmillion hours of filling out paperwork.\n  Those are the two principal reasons for our perspective on this \nissue--a trust in the dedication of the parents and teachers and \nprincipals and superintendents and school board members to the \neducation of the children committed to their care, and to the belief \nthat the less the paperwork, the fewer the regulations, the more \ndollars that can get actually into the classroom.\n  That may be the last major issue separating us from the President in \ncoming up with an overall omnibus budget and allowing this Congress to \nfinish its work. But it is an issue of profound importance to every \nAmerican--our students and our parents and all other Americans who wish \nto bequeath to their children and their grandchildren an even stronger \nAmerica than the one they inherited from their parents.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today and come to the floor to \nthank the Senate and the House for the passage of S. 1693, the Vision \n2020 bill, national parks reform. I think it is a great day for the \nCongress and for our national parks. Parks are one of the real \nresources, one of the real treasures that we have in this country that \nI think all of us have feelings for. There are lots of different parks \nand lots of different kinds of parks, but they are all our heritage. \nThey are our culture.\n  I think we have known for some time that the parks have needed some \nassistance. They are more visited now than ever. They are more \nutilized, as they should be, by Americans than ever. The Park Service, \non the other hand, thinks that they are at least $10 billion in arrears \nin infrastructure costs and they need to change. I think there is a \nwillingness to change on the part of the Park Service. So through hard \nwork and bipartisan compromise we forged a bill that will preserve and \nhelp protect our parks now and well into the next century.\n  I have a special place in my heart for parks. I grew up right outside \nof Yellowstone Park near Cody, WY. We have the first park, Yellowstone, \nthat is more than 125 years old now, also Grand Teton Park, which is, \nof course, a spectacular and unusual place, Devil's Tower. So parks are \nvery much a part of the West. They also are very much part of the rest \nof the country. Right here in Virginia, last week my wife and I went to \nPhiladelphia, Independence Park, one of the great treasures of our \nhistory. So I am very pleased with this legislation and I think it will \nbe helpful.\n  Let me mention a few of the major provisions of S. 1693. First, it \nrequires the Department to develop a strategic plan and comprehensive \nbudget for the individual units. It is a large business. The budget is \n$1.2 billion. So there has to, now, in addition to the management of \nresources, be management of a large financial issue. We need plans. We \nneed a Park Service that has transparency in terms of its plans and in \nterms of its budget. There needs to be a budget. There needs to be \nassurance that the expenditures are the same as the appropriations \nrequests. That has not always been the case.\n  We need to establish a process for developing new parks. There are \ncriteria for parks and they need to be followed. We have a proposition \nwhere there would be a study to see if, indeed, that park does square \nwith the criteria that we have set forth. Too often, I think, Members \nof Congress have been able to bring parks into the system to be \nsupported by Federal dollars when, frankly, they really perhaps did not \nmeet the criteria that they should.\n  The bill provides for enhanced training opportunities for Park \nService employees. Many of them have very specialized jobs, very \nspecialized work to inventory and to understand what the resources are \nand to protect them. In my experience of working with Government and in \nthis Government, I don't know of an agency that has a more dedicated \nstaff than does the Park Service. They are people who are really \ncommitted to what they are doing and committed to the preservation of \nparks and making them useful. We need to help with opportunities for \ntraining.\n  We are providing for increased scientific study and research to \nensure park resources are inventoried and they are, indeed, protected.\n  There are two purposes: The first purpose of the park, of course, is \nto maintain the resources, whether they be cultural or natural \nresources. The second is to provide for its owners, the American \npeople, to visit. One of the elements of that, of course, is the \nconcessions that provide the services that are necessary.\n  We have worked at changing the concessions policy and making it more \ncompetitive so that new businesses can have an opportunity to provide \nthem, to provide them more efficiently, to provide more of an \nopportunity, and to pay some of the income to the park as a means of \nsustaining it.\n  We have eliminated the preferential right of renewal so that there is \ncompetition for those services as they are renewed.\n  We have authorized the new national park collectible passport which \nprovides an opportunity for supporters of a park to pay a little \nsomething and to have in their car window or their house window this \nattractive passport that will allow us to help support the parks.\n  We provide for increased philanthropic support for individual units \nto help Friends of Yellowstone, for example, to raise money, and they \nraise significant amounts of money for parks.\n  We have authorized some studies for the Park Police which is \nnecessary. We have some 400 Park Police right here in the Capital who \nhave large responsibilities.\n  These are some of the changes that we have worked at. This is the \nfirst time in 18 years that we have had a generic parks bill that is \ndesigned not to deal with some specific park but rather to deal with \nthe whole idea of a system\n\n[[Page S12541]]\n\nthat will preserve and strengthen the parks. It is the culmination of \nmore than 2 years of work by the subcommittee. We have had hearings \ncoast to coast. We have been in Colorado. We have been out in San \nFrancisco. There are many different kinds of parks. We had the same \nreaction at the hearings: that there needs to be more resources; they \nneed to be managed better; we need to have more support; we need to \ndeal with gateway communities; and have better communications. I think \nthese things will be strengthened. We passed a bill that, I think, will \ndo much of that.\n  I want to take a moment to thank some of the people who were \ninvolved. We hear a lot about the difficulty of passing legislation, \nand it is difficult. Everyone has, legitimately, different ideas about \nhow things ought to be done; indeed, philosophies of how they might be \ndone. The media, of course, emphasizes the conflicts that we have, and \nwe have conflicts. Here, although most everyone will agree with parks, \nthere are conflicts about how we resolve these things.\n  I am so pleased we had an opportunity to come together with people on \nboth sides of the aisle, with people in the administration, with people \nin the Congress. No one got everything they wanted. We had to make \nconcessions. We had to make changes, give up some things, add some \nthings. But that is the way the legislative process has to work.\n  I particularly thank Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, for all of his guidance on this \nlegislation. Without his help, of course, we wouldn't have had this \nbill before the Senate. The chairman went out of his way to ensure that \nnegotiations stayed on track. As you know, Alaska has some unique \nthings. He helped to make this thing work.\n  I also thank Senator Bumpers, the ranking minority member of the \ncommittee. I know personally that he has worked on some of these \nthings. He has worked on the issue of concessions in particular for at \nleast 10 years. He made some concessions on this issue. Without him, \nfrankly, we wouldn't have a bill, particularly over in the House where \nhe worked at it. I just say to the Senator from Arkansas that I really \nappreciate his help and appreciate the attitude that he brought here to \nthis debate.\n  I thank Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt. It is no secret that we \ndon't always agree with a lot of things, like public lands. Bruce \nBabbitt worked as hard as anyone could be asked to work. He came from \nCalifornia to work with our staff on this. He helped form a compromise.\n  Also, I thank Assistant Secretary Don Barry--these folks worked very \nhard--as well as Bob Bennett. There is a whole list of people. Over in \nthe House, Jim Hansen and Chairman Don Young worked very hard as well.\n  Finally, I thank the staff, of course, at all levels in the Senate, \nin the committee, particularly my personal associates: Liz Brimmer, my \nchief of staff; Dan Naatz, legislative director; Jim O'Toole, who is \nthe director of the committee staff; and Steve Shackelton, a fellow, \nwho worked originally with us on the bill.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to say a couple of things. One is, I am \nvery pleased we passed this. I think it is going to help parks.\n  Second, I am impressed with the system when we really do work \ntogether and cooperate to come up with something that is a compromise \nand reach the goals with which we began.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and say, again, I am very \npleased we were able to bring this to passage in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12540-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12541-S12542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VISION 20-20 LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today is a historic day for the \nCongress, the National Park Service and the American people. After two \nyears of intense negotiations, hearings from coast to coast, and a \ngreat deal of hard work I am pleased to inform my colleagues that we \nhave National Park Service Reform.\n  More importantly, after eight years of disagreement, and as part of \nthe National Park Service reform package, we have achieved victory; we \nhave come together in true bi-partisan fashion, and we have reformed \nthe management and administration of concession operations in the \nNational Park Service System.\n  Under this legislation, and in addition to concession reform, we have \nprovided the National Park Service with increased opportunities, in \ncooperation with colleges and universities, to conduct scientific \nresearch in our parks so that in future years resource management \ndecisions can be based more on sound science as opposed to emotion and \nguess work.\n  We direct the Secretary of the Interior to develop a comprehensive \ntraining program for employees in all professional careers in the work \nforce of the National Park Service to ensure that personnel have the \nbest, up-to-date knowledge, skills and abilities with which to manage, \ninterpret and protect the resources of the National Park System.\n  As we all know the management and administration of parks is becoming \nmore complex. We require managers who are fully prepared to take on the \nchallenges that the next century will offer. The Secretary is directed \nto develop a training program which will ensure that future park \nmanagers will come from the cream of the crop and will be fully \nprepared to assume the responsibilities that management and \nadministration of multiple park programs will demand.\n  We have established procedures for the establishment of new units of \nthe National Park System to ensure that only those areas of truly \nnational significance are authorized.\n  Mr. President, the original bill passed by the Senate contained new \nfee authorities which would have allowed the actual users of the System \nto shoulder more of the responsibility to decrease the $8 billion \ndollar back-log in maintenance and infrastructure repair needed in our \nparks. Unfortunately, the other Body decided to delete these provisions \nfrom this legislative package. I regret this decision; however, I want \nyou to know that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is going \nto address the fee systems for all of the agencies under our \njurisdiction early in the next Congress. There are needs to be met and \nproblems to be resolved in this specific arena.\n  Senator Thomas came up with a park passport and stamp as an entrance \npass to our National Parks. The winning design of the stamp will be \nthrough a competitive process each year, a similar process to the \npopular Duck Stamp that we are all familiar with. It's a great \nmarketing tool and should increase revenues. Along that same line we \nare directing the National Park Foundation to assist other park friends \ngroups. The Foundation possesses a great deal of expertise in fund \nraising and philanthropic activities. Sharing that expertise will \nbenefit hundreds of parks across this Nation.\n  We also direct the Secretary and provide him the authority to lease \nunused Park Service buildings and enter into expanded cooperative \nagreements in the hope that the private sector will take advantage of \noccupying and maintaining some of these unused structures, thereby off-\nsetting expenditures by the Service.\n  Mr. President, Senator Thomas, Senator Bumpers, Senator Bennett, and \nSecretary Babbitt entered into negotiations on concession reform. The \nend result is before you today. All of these gentlemen deserve our \ncongratulations and thanks for the time and energy each put into the \neffort.\n  This bill is a direct result of discussions amongst the House and \nSenate Committees, representatives of the concession industry, and \nother interest groups. It reflects, I believe, a fair and just \nresolution of some issues about which there is legitimate disagreement. \nThe recent amendment offered by Representative Miller alters the terms \nof that agreement to some degree, but it remains a piece of legislation \nI can still support and endorse. However, I do think the amendment does \ngive rise to a need for some clarification.\n  Protection of the existing possessory interests of concessioners is \nan important element of this legislation. Possessory interest is a \nsignificant and valuable right. It reflects the capital investment of \nthe concessioner. It was one of the foundations on which the 1965 \nConcessions Act was built and it\n\n[[Page S12542]]\n\ncan not be simply eliminated. The concessioners are entitled to the \nprotections which the 1965 Act promised.\n  For those reasons I think we must make clear what the Miller \namendment does not do. In authorizing the Secretary to, in the future, \nalter the treatment of possessory interests, it does not empower him to \ndo what Congress has specifically chosen not to do, by which I mean \ndeny those concessioners the value of their existing possessory \ninterest. Regardless of what the Secretary may ultimately decide, those \nexisting possessory interest will remain a valuable and legally \nprotected right for which concessioners must be compensated. They will \nremain entitled to see their investment protected and to receive the \nbenefit of their bargain.\n  Mr. President, on another point, we have just received a GAO study \nthat tells us that many of our existing concession facilities are below \nstandard and deteriorating. Visitors to our parks should not expect to \nstay in a facility that cannot pass the minimum requirements that apply \nto those hotels and motels on the borders of our parks. On that note, \nand as I have previously stated the negotiations that lead to this \ncompromise were difficult to say the least. Each had to come across the \ntable, no one got everything they wanted except the American people, \nand they got a lot.\n  The provisions of this compromise mean that we will have the \nexpertise of the private sector to assist and advise the National Park \nService in the management and administration of concession operations. \nI am confident that under this scenario concession operations have no \nwhere to go but to produce better quality services.\n  The private sector will be more than glad to provide major \ninvestments in new and existing facilities because they are able to \nmaintain a financial interest in the properties. There is a great \nincentive for the operators to maintain their facilities and \ninfrastructure to the highest standards possible. If they don't, the \nprovisions provide for a decrease in the dollar amount of interest they \nare entitled to receive.\n  Finally, concession operators will be paying more in fees which go \nback to the parks.\n  Mr. President, I personally want to thank Senator Thomas for the \nextreme effort that he has put forth in this endeavor. In my years in \nthe Senate I have never seen a Senator work harder on this contentious \nissue. He has done the impossible.\n  And, last but not least, I want to say thank you to the Committee \nstaff, for the hard work, the lost weekends, the evenings and for the \ngreat work.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business. I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for the next 15 \nminutes uninterrupted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \nSenator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12541-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12542-S12543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and as the ranking member on the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee--\nmy chairman is the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter--we have been involved, as I am sure everyone knows, in a lot \nof negotiations over the last several days regarding the education \nportion of the bill. There are some other items there also, but \nbasically on education.\n  After reading some of the newspaper accounts and listening to some of \nthe speeches on the Senate floor, I can only come to the realization \nthat perhaps the American people are a little bit confused now about \nwhat is going on. I respectfully submit that may be the point of what \nis going on--to try to confuse the American people. I am going to try \nto set the record a little bit straight here, in my limited amount of \ntime.\n  I was in my office a little while ago listening to the Senator from \nTexas talk about education. He had a chart. He went on to say that only \n37 cents of every dollar that comes in here, I think in the Department \nof Education, actually gets back out to the local schools.\n  Having been involved both on the authorizing committee for now 14 \nyears and on the Appropriations Committee, an equal amount of time on \nEducation, I was quite astounded by this figure because I never heard \nthis figure before.  So I decided to go back and find out exactly what \nwere the facts.\n\n  So I guess the best place to look is in the committee report, \ncompiled not by the Democrats but by the Republicans,--by Senator \nSpecter for the Committee on Appropriations. Of course, I will say \nthis, and most gratefully say, he and his staff have worked very \nclosely with me and our appropriations staff in putting out this \nreport.\n  So I looked in the report, to check on administrative costs for the \nDepartment of Education, because I never heard that figure, 37 cents. I \nthought, ``Boy, if that's the truth, I might join the Senator from \nTexas in this argument.'' So I looked it up. In this report--this is \nthe document right here; big and thick, has a lot of numbers in it, \nvery boring reading--the committee recommendation for the Department of \nEducation is $34.4 billion. That number is likely to increase as a \nresult of the negotiations on the final bill.\n  So then I said, ``OK, how much does the Department of Education spend \nadministering these programs?'' Well, here is the line item. It is \nright here in the book. You do not have to go very far. General \nDepartmental Management: $101 million. Well, I am not the best at math, \nbut I tried to figure this out. And as best I can come, that is less \nthan one-half of 1 percent of the total money that we appropriate to \nthe Department of Education goes for administration--less than one-half \nof 1 percent.\n  I then asked my staff to find out how much of was spent for \nadministration at the State level. And that is about 2 percent. So 2.5 \npercent of all the money we take in that we give the Department of \nEducation goes for administration; therefore providing 97.5 percent to \nlocal school districts and students. That is right; out of every $1 \nthat goes to the Department of Education, 97 cents-plus goes out to \nschools and to students.\n  Where the heck that 37-cent figure, that the Senator from Texas had, \ncame from, I have not the foggiest idea. I have his comments. I still \ndo not understand where he got that figure. The only thing I can expect \nis that maybe he did not take into account Pell grants that go directly \nto students that are paid to schools. I do not know. Whatever the \nreason is, that is not the correct figure. It is not chewed up in \nadministration.\n  The documentation is right here in black and white in the committee \nreport. It just seems that all we have is we just have a lot of \nrhetoric around here and somehow we are supposed to take the rhetoric \nfor substance.\n  The substance is there. It is not a secret. You can find out how much \ngoes for administration, and it is not as much as the Senator from \nTexas said. Fully 97 cents of every dollar that goes to the Department \nof Education goes out to schools, goes out to students.\n  Again, it seems now that what I am hearing is that the Republicans, \nin the negotiations, are saying that they are going to match us dollar-\nfor-dollar, but they just want to throw the money out there in the \nTitle VI block grant to the States, so they can do with it basically \nwhat they want. So the sort of hue and cry is ``We'll give money to the \nStates and let the States do what they want.''\n  There is a better way. To deal with class size, the President has an \ninitiative to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size in this \ncountry. The President and those of us on this side of the aisle, what \nwe want to do is put that money through title I reading and math \nprogram to reduce class sizes. I am told the Republicans want to send \nit out through the Title VI block grant.\n  Again, I am sure that the American people watching me speak here are \nsaying, ``Gobbledygook, Title I, Title VI,\n\n[[Page S12543]]\n\nso what?'' Well, so what is a big difference in whether more money gets \nout to the students or not.\n  There is a big difference. For example, in title I, we have a cap by \nlaw that says that no more than 1 percent of the money that goes out to \nTitle I can be used for administration at the State level. One cent of \nevery dollar, that is all, no more; so that 99 cents actually gets to \nthe schools and the students.\n  However, under Title VI, 15 percent of the money that goes out to the \nStates is held at the State level; 15 cents out of every dollar is held \nat the State level. The remaining 85 cents then goes out to the school \ndistricts.\n  Title I is more efficient and will get more resources into the \nclassrooms and schools--99 cents of every dollar, to actually hire the \nteachers and reduce class size. What the Republicans are saying is, \nturn it over to the States. They keep 15 cents and send only 85 cents \nto the schools.\n  So I submit, Mr. President, that if you really want to cut \nadministrative costs, if you want to get the most money out there to \nget the most bang for the buck, let's put the money in Title I and not \nthe Title VI program.\n  There seems to be another strain going on around here and that is \nthat ``the Federal Government is doing too much in education. The \nFederal Government should do less. We have got leave this to States and \nlocal communities.''\n  I would be the first to defend and the last person standing in \ndefense of the right of local jurisdictions to control their schools. \nThat does not mean that the Federal Government does not have a role to \nplay in helping those schools. I believe it does; a significant role. \nAnd we have owned up to that over the years. But to say that the \nFederal Government is doing too much, I think, is to ignore what we \nhave done in the past.\n  In 1980--of every dollar that went for elementary and secondary \neducation in America, for every dollar that went out, the Federal \nGovernment provided about 10 cents. So about 10 cents of every dollar \nthat went out for elementary and secondary education came from the \nFederal Government. That was 1980.\n  To those who say that today, in 1998, the Federal Government is doing \ntoo much in elementary and secondary education, I point out that from \nthat point in 1980 to now the Federal Government is only providing \nabout 6 percent of the money for elementary and secondary education. In \nother words, in the intervening 18 years, the Federal role in support \nof elementary and secondary education has been cut by almost.\n  I always tell my constituents in Iowa, and other places, obviously, \nyou wonder why your property taxes are going up. That is why. In order \nto keep the schools up and to meet their constitutional requirements to \nprovide for new technology, to help fix up crumbling schools, the \nStates then have to put it back on the local jurisdictions, and they \nhave to raise property taxes. That is why the property taxes seem to be \ngoing up all over this country.\n  So I always say to people, if you want property tax relief, the best \nthing is to get the Federal Government back up to where we were in \n1980. You do that and you will find out we will be able to fix our \ncrumbling schools, we will be able to hire 100,000 teachers and reduce \nclass size, we will be able to wire the schools for the Internet, and \nget the technology these kids need at an early level.\n  Mr. President, if we had just held constant from where we were in \n1980 to today--do not increase but do not decrease; simply held \nconstant--the Federal Government's share of elementary and secondary \neducation would be about a 44-percent increase. We would be providing \nan additional $10 billion more each year our local schools. And any way \nyou cut it, that spells property tax relief. That spells more \ntechnology for our schools.\n\n  If I might digress just a moment, there are some who think that our \nkids in elementary school have to learn the basics first and then they \ncan get on to computers. There are some who say that what our kids need \nis a No. 2 lead pencil and a Big Chief tablet; they learn that first, \nand then they can go into computers. They fail to recognize that the \nNo. 2 lead pencil and the Big Chief tablet of today are the desktop \ncomputer.\n  I know the occupant of the Chair is a little bit younger than I am, \nbut when I was a kid in a two-room country schoolhouse in rural Iowa \nback in the 1940s and early 1950s, we had a blackboard and a piece of \nchalk. That was our computer. We used that blackboard and a piece of \nchalk; we had our Big Chief tablet and No. 2 lead pencil. That might \nhave been OK for my generation. It is not OK for this generation; it is \nnot OK for the kids today. It is not something they use after they get \nsmart, it is something they use to help them learn smart, to understand \nwhat we are going to need in the 21st century to meet our needs.\n  We could have that if the Federal Government would meet its \nobligations, if we just held constant where we were in 1980. That is \nwhat we are trying to do. We are trying to support the President's goal \nof reducing class size and getting 100,000 teachers out there. We are \ntrying to support the President in his goal of getting money out to \nhelp fix our crumbling schools, so the kids don't have to go out and \nlearn in trailers, so we don't have 30 to 35 kids in the class but \nsomething like 18 or 19, at the maximum, in any class.\n  Last, we hear all the speeches about turning the money over to the \nStates and let them decide how to respond. That all sounds good. What \nabout all of the bipartisan accomplishments that we also hear about in \nthis Congress? We passed the Higher Education Act; we reauthorized the \nvocational and technical education bill; we expanded the Federal \nCharter Schools Program. Senators on both sides of the aisle brag about \nthis. How can you brag about it in one breath and turn around and say \nthat we have to turn over all the money to the States? I am a little \nconfused about that. If you are proud of the vocational and technical \neducation and the fact that the Federal Government has supported it and \nwe just reauthorized it, how can you then turn around and said we \nshouldn't do any of this?\n  There is a role, a limited role, for the Federal Government, but a \nvery powerful and important role. I believe this Congress is turning \nits back on its responsibilities, unless in the closing days of this \nsession we can get an agreement to provide resources to reduce class \nsize and fix our crumbling schools. We need the money in there right \nnow so the kids don't have to go out in trailers in the back of the \nschool to learn.\n  I hope in the closing days we will be able to get the education \nfunding that we need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12542-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12543-S12545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I turn my attention to another issue that \nis closely akin to education, an issue I have been working on for a \nlong time, one which has come to the front now because of all the \nnegotiations going on. That is the issue of child labor.\n  In January of this year, my staff, Rosemary Gutierrez, and I traveled \nto Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to look at the issue of child \nlabor. While we were in Nepal, the exotic city of Katmandu, I met with \na young man who had been a former child laborer. He told me about the \nawful conditions that were in some of these countries, yet the official \ngovernment line is, there is no child labor; it is prohibited.\n  On a Sunday evening, right after it got dark, about dusk, we got into \nan unmarked car--the former child laborer, a driver, my staff person, \nand I--and drove to the outskirts of Katmandu to a carpet factory. It \nwas thought by my host, this young man who had been a former child \nlaborer, that the owner of the factory was not going to be there. He \nkind of knew the guard at the gate and said we could get through. So we \ndrove out to the outskirts. Sure enough, there was a gate, there was a \nwire fence. The guard let us through. We went up, and the young man \ntalked to him in Nepalese, since I don't speak Nepalese, and we were \nlet through.\n  What was on the outside of the gate before we entered? This sign \nright here, in Nepalese and in English. This is the sign; I took this \npicture with my camera. The brick wall states:\n\n       Child labor [sic] under the age of 14 is strictly \n     prohibited.\n\n  Right on the gate it says this. I took the picture. We went through a \ngate,\n\n[[Page S12544]]\n\ndown a long hallway, turned left; there were doors; we opened the doors \nand walked in.\n  Remember:\n\n       Child labor under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited.\n\n  Here are some more pictures I took. These are kids working at the \nlooms. We asked our host to ask them their ages. We have a boy here who \nis 9 and a girl about 12. That is just two of them. This place was \nloaded with kids that age, working on a Sunday at 7 o'clock in the \nevening; it was getting dark. They are still working full-time in \ndirty, dusty conditions, making these carpets.\n  Here is another picture I took. Again, don't tell me these are phony \npictures. I took them with my camera. I was there. More kids are \nworking at their looms--kids, 11, 12, 13, 10, 9 years old. And I have \nother pictures. I had my staff take a photo with me included with the \nkids to show that I was there. Again, there are other kids--not the \nsame kids--other kids in the same place, all of whom basically are \nunder the age of 14--there were some older, I admit, but a lot of them \nunder the age of 14, working.\n  What we are trying to do is do something about the issue of child \nlabor. What can we do? In 1930, Congress passed what was infamously \nknown as the Smoot-Hawley bill. Aside from the bad things Smoot-Hawley \ndid in terms of restricting trade, there was section 307, which is part \nof the law today, which has been in existence since 1930. I will read \nthe first sentence:\n\n       All goods, wares, articles, and merchandise, mined, \n     produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign \n     country by convict labor or/and forced labor, or/and \n     indentured labor, under penal sanctions, shall not be \n     entitled to entry at any of the ports of the United States, \n     and the importation thereof is hereby prohibited, and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to \n     prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the \n     enforcement of this provision.\n\n  It covers forced and indentured labor. We have prohibited that ever \nsince.\n  A couple of years ago, I made an inquiry of the Department of the \nTreasury. I asked if any items made with forced or indentured child \nlabor had been prohibited from entering the United States under this \nsection on forced labor. To my surprise, the answer was no. \nFurthermore, the Department of Treasury was not sure whether or not \nforced or indentured child labor was included in the definition of \n``forced or indentured labor.''\n  This is outrageous. The law says ``forced or indentured labor,'' but \nwe don't know if it covers kids.\n  Last year, during consideration of the fiscal year 1998 Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill, I inserted a provision which instructed the \nU.S. Customs Service to block from entry into the United States any \nimports made by forced or indentured child labor as they are inherently \nimports made with forced and indentured labor.\n  However, this was only a 1-year provision. It was on an \nappropriations bill. But it passed. It was supported by the House and \nSenate. But it only lasted 1 year. That year is now up. That provision \nno longer is valid because it was only good for 1 year.\n  In order to ensure that goods made with forced and indentured child \nlabor are treated the same as goods made with forced or indentured \nadult labor, we need to change the law permanently. Well, this summer, \nthe Senate approved my amendment to reflect the intent of Congress to \ninclude forced and indentured child labor under this umbrella. My \namendment was quite simple. The Tariff Act already says that goods made \nwith forced or indentured labor are prohibited from entering the U.S. \nmarket. I included the words ``forced and indentured child labor,'' so \nthere is no ambiguity in the statute's interpretation.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was struck from the bill during \nconference because Members did not feel a tariff measure belonged on \nthe defense authorization bill. I was told to find a more relevant \nmeasure. Well, I have it. Congress is considering a tariff measure, \nH.R. 4342, the Miscellaneous Tariff and Technical Corrections Act of \n1998, which passed the House on August 4. It has a lot of provisions in \nit. There is page after page after page of technical corrections to the \ntariff laws. Examples: Over 100 provisions that would suspend or reduce \nthe tariff applicable to certain specified products, most of these \nbeing a wide variety of chemicals and organic pigments, including a \ntemporary suspension on the duties for a variety of HIV medications and \nanticancer drugs and other trade-related provisions--hundreds of \nprovisions.\n  Here is the report. As you go through it, there is page after page, \nincluding things like pigment yellow No. 151, pigment yellow No. 175, \nchloroacetone, benzenepropanal. Section 2143, textile machinery. \nSection 2144. Here are some things and chemicals I can't even pronounce \nthat are being changed here. A lot of chemicals. Here is 4-\nhexylresorcinol. I don't even know what it is.\n  My point is this: There are hundreds of tariff changes in this bill. \nThis is a tariff bill. My amendment on child labor amends the Tariff \nAct of 1930--a tariff measure. So we have the right vehicle. But, Mr. \nPresident, because the House passed it on suspension, it came over here \nand it was never brought out on the floor for debate so that I could \noffer this amendment--an amendment which is noncontroversial. It passed \nthe Senate twice, and passed the House once. It has been in effect for \none year because it was on an appropriations bill. I just want to get \nan amendment to the tariff bill to indicate that forced and indentured \nlabor includes forced and indentured ``child'' labor.\n  Well, I don't know why we can't include it. I did have a conversation \non the telephone with the chairman of the Finance Committee last week. \nI asked why this noncontroversial provision couldn't be put in. I don't \nknow that anyone would come to the floor and object to taking the \nTariff Law of 1930, which forbids the importation of goods made by \nforced and indentured labor, and adding the words ``child labor,'' so \nthat forced and indentured labor would cover forced and indentured \nchild labor. Would someone come to the floor and say, OK, we have to \nkeep everything out of this country made with forced and indentured \nadult labor, but if you have forced and indentured child labor, that's \nOK, we will bring it in. Does anybody want to come to the floor and \nmake that argument? I doubt it. I don't think anybody would want to \nmake that argument, because it doesn't make sense. I think we are all \nfairly reasonable people around here.\n  So I would like to get my amendment on the tariff bill--an amendment \nthat, as I said, passed both Houses--it passed this body twice--and has \nbeen in effect for one year. I didn't hear any hue and cry from anyone. \nAs far as I know, I never had one corporation, one business, one \nimporter yell about it or say that ``this is awful that we are keeping \ngoods out made with forced and indentured child labor.'' My amendment \ngives our Treasury Department, our Customs people, is a permanent law \nwhereby it would say, in unambiguous terms, forced and indentured labor \nmeans forced and indentured child labor, also.\n  Now, could there be an objection that costs money? Well, I have an \nopinion here from CBO, from back on July 16 of this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope not to even take that long. Here is \nthe analysis from CBO on my amendment: ``This proposal would not affect \ndirect spending or receipts, so there would be no pay-as-you-go scoring \nunder section 252 of the Balanced Budget Act.''\n  There you are. It doesn't cost any money. It has no effect on the \nbudget. It has been passed. All I want to do is get it added to this \nbill and, since I didn't have a chance to offer it as an amendment, I \nonly have one recourse. I put a hold on the tariff bill. I don't want \nit to pass by unanimous consent. Am I opposed to the tariff bill? No. I \nassume everything in it is fine. It has all been cleared. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee assured me that it has been cleared by \neverybody. I don't know every section and title, but I assume it's all \nright. I want the opportunity to put this into permanent law on a \ntariff bill. I don't know when the next tariff bill will come across \nthe\n\n[[Page S12545]]\n\nSenate floor. I don't believe this language can be held hostage simply \nbecause the Senate didn't do its work. The House passed this on August \n4. We had plenty of time to take it up here, but we never brought it \nup. So I am left in the position of having to do something that I don't \nlike to do, which is to put a hold on the bill and not give my consent \nto pass the bill by unanimous consent, unless we can get this amendment \nadded. An amendment, which I swear, I would like to know one person \nthat could come over here and argue against it. I don't think you could \nfind such a person.\n  So I see no reason why it can't be added. It's time that we say about \nkids what we said in 1930--in 1930--what we said about adults. This \nCongress said that no goods, no merchandise, or anything that is mined \nby forced or indentured labor can come into this country. Here we are, \n68 years later, and we can't add the words ``forced and indentured \nchild labor.''\n  Nonsense. I hope that those who are working on the tariff bill would \nbe so kind as to include this amendment so that we can take away any \nambiguity, clean it up once and for all, and prohibit the importation \nof goods made with child labor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12543-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DALE BUMPERS OF ARKANSAS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk in as \nglowing terms as I can about a great friend, a great Senator, and a \nperson I have admired both as a Senator and as a plain good person for \nall the years I have been in Washington. And he is leaving us. He is \nretiring at the end of this session. I am speaking about perhaps the \nepitome of what I believe to be a good Senator, and that Senator is \nDale Bumpers of Arkansas.\n  I am really going to miss him, and this country is going to miss him \nas well. So will this Chamber. He is truly one of the finest Senators \nto have ever graced this body. He has done so many good things over the \nyears. It is hard to know where to begin.\n  I know he started out as someone in the Marine Corps. As a Navy \nperson I will not hold that against him. I can overlook that. But then \nhe came back to Arkansas and practiced law, had a small business, and \neven raised some cattle. He had good practical experience, and knows \nthe people of Arkansas and he knows the people of this country. The \npeople of Arkansas rewarded that--first as Governor, and now finishing \nhis tenure as a Senator. He was elected by more than 60 percent of the \nvote in the last two terms.\n  Senator Bumpers came to the Senate at the same time I came to the \nHouse in 1974. For 24 years he has been here.\n  Someone said once about Senators in general that some Senators come \nhere to coin a phrase, or coin a slogan, and think they have solved the \nproblem. But not Dale Bumpers. He has worked very hard to solve the \nproblems of this country.\n  He has been a close friend, a person of immense common sense. When it \ncomes to helping farmers, seniors, working people, and children there \nis no better person to have as an ally than Dale Bumpers. He stuck to \nwhat he believed. He had the determination to get the job done with a \nstrong commitment to the people of Arkansas. He is certainly one of the \nfinest orators and debaters this Chamber has ever seen. He has led the \nfight in the Senate against government waste.\n  I loved to listen to his speeches on that $12 billion boondoggle \ncalled the superconductor super collider. And he won. Unfortunately, we \nwasted a lot of money on it. But, the people finally came to their \nsenses and saw it as the boondoggle that it was.\n  I wasn't in the Senate at the time. I was in the House working to \nkill that other boondoggle called the Clinch River breeder reactor. \nBoy, you would think at that time it was the most important thing to \ncivilization that we built that breeder reactor. But finally people \ncame to their senses, and we stopped it. And we are better and we are \nstronger because of it. We saved billions of dollars that would have \nbeen wasted. Dale led the fight on that in the Senate.\n  He has led the fight against other wasteful spending such as star \nwars and the space station.\n  I believe that he has finally brought home to the American conscience \nthe issue of mining interests and the abuse of our public lands and the \nfact that we need to update our laws.\n  Anyway, with a common sense approach he has been a strong ally on the \nAppropriations Committee where we need that kind of common sense \napproach.\n  On the Agriculture Committee, he placed the needs of America's rural \ncommunities at the top of the national debate including rural housing \nand rural economic development. He has been the strongest fighter for \nprotecting the environment. On the Clean Air Act, and Clean Water Act, \nDale Bumpers has been in the forefront of America's fight to keep our \ncountry clean.\n  As the National Journal put it, Dale Bumpers is the Senator to whom \n``other Senators pay attention.''\n  In numerous polls of Senate staffers, Dale Bumpers has consistently \nranked as one of the best liked Senators.\n  So we are going to miss him when we start the 106th Congress in \nJanuary. We are going to miss Dale and his eloquence, his determination \nand his stick-to-itness.\n  So to the entire Bumpers family, Dale and Betty, their children--\nBrent, Bill and Brooke--and their five grandchildren, I want to extend \nmy gratitude, and the gratitude of the citizens of my State, that I am \nso proud to represent, for loaning Dale to us for the past 24 years. \nAmerica is a much better place because of Dale's service in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I want to close on the one note--the one area in which \nDale has devoted so much of his time and effort, along with Betty on \nprotecting our children from illnesses and diseases that have ravaged \nkids since time immemorial.\n  No one has fought harder for childhood vaccinations, and to make them \nuniversal, affordable, and accessible than Dale and Betty Bumpers.\n  So in recognition of their contributions, the Appropriations \nCommittee, on which Dale served, voted unanimously, Republican and \nDemocrats, to name a new vaccine facility at the National Institutes of \nHealth after Senator Bumpers and his wife, Betty. This new facility, \nnow under construction, will be named the ``Dale and Betty Bumpers \nVaccine Research Facility.''\n  As I said, Dale has been our resident expert on immunization since \nearly in his Senate career. He has been a tireless advocate for funding \nto purchase vaccines and provide the public health system with the \nresources necessary to deliver those vaccines to the children who are \nmost in need. He advocated a grant incentive program in the Senate that \nthe Appropriations Committee has used each year to reward States that \nhave been successful in preventing unnecessary diseases.\n  So there have been a lot of tributes that have been paid to Dale. \nBut, the most lasting tribute will be his and Betty Bumpers' name on \nthat research facility at NIH because, that is truly where his heart \nhas been in making sure that kids in places like rural Arkansas and \nrural Iowa, and all over America--including our inner cities--to make \nsure they have a healthy start in life by getting immunized. To me that \nsays it all about Dale Bumpers.\n  We are going to miss him. I hope that he doesn't go too far away. I \nfor one look forward to his continued advice and counsel as I serve out \nmy career in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent to proceed in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12545-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12545-S12546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

But I cannot afford \nto.''\n  It took me a while to fully understand and appreciate what they were \nsaying. Simply put, the current system of cash payments and health care \ncoverage in the Social Security Act do not encourage individuals with \ndisabilities to work, or to work to their full potential. Common sense \nis on our side with regard to Social Security reform. Our country has \nsucceeded in providing Federal and State support for children and \nadults with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and recently the \nWork Investment Act of 1998.\n\n  But although our Nation has shown its commitment to prepare children \nand adults with disabilities for work--in fact, in the work incentive \nbill I referred to, we have the Rehabilitation Act reauthorization \nthere; we put it in the Workforce Act to bring closure, to bring \ntogether all of these bills that help people to work--we have \nconditions that, unfortunately, do not allow or encourage those \nindividuals with disabilities to work.\n  If someone told you, ``Look, you can work, but if you earn over $500 \nmonthly, in 12 months''--that is $6,000 a year--``your health insurance \nwill stop, unless you pay for it yourself,'' after a period of time \nwould you work and exceed those thresholds? I doubt it.\n  If someone told you, ``We will cover the cost of personal assistance \nservices and prescription drugs that you need in order to work, but you \ncannot have more than $2,000 in assets, or accumulate more than $2,000 \nin assets,'' do these conditions appear to help individuals be self-\nsufficient? Clearly not.\n  The facts are on the side of those of us who want to pass the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1998. We want it included in the omnibus \nappropriations bill, and there is great effort going on to accomplish \nthat.\n  There are 7.5 million individuals with disabilities who receive cash \npayments from the Social Security Administration and receive health \ninsurance coverage through Medicare or Medicaid. According to GAO, in \n1996 cash payments were about $1.21 billion weekly. These payments do \nnot include payments made under Medicare or Medicaid. If these payments \nare factored in, the costs exceed $70 billion annually.\n  It has been estimated that the number of Social Security \nbeneficiaries with disabilities increased 83 percent between 1989 and \n1997, and this number will continue to grow by a rate of about 3 to 6 \npercent a year.\n  If just 1 percent of these beneficiaries were to become successfully \nemployed, savings in cash payments would total $3.5 billion over their \nlifetime for that 1 percent. The Work Incentives Improvement Act is a \ncredible, viable solution in terms of both fiscal responsibility and \npersonal responsibility.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act gives States discretion to offer \nhealth care benefits to individuals with disabilities on the Social \nSecurity rolls when their earned income exceeds that now in the Social \nSecurity Act. As a result, more of these individuals will work and will \nwork for more hours.\n  The legislation allows States to impose cost-sharing obligations on \nthese individuals. The legislation would cost $200 million a year over \na 5-year period--a small price to pay when you consider this \nlegislation has a potential to turn 8 million individuals into \ntaxpayers. There ought to be a substantial gain--no cost. The \nlegislation includes offsets to pay for it.\n  The legislation includes Representative Bunning's ``Ticket to Work'' \nbill that will give people with disabilities more choices when they \nneed job training before going to work.\n  All major disabilities organizations support the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act but will not support the enactment of the ``Ticket to \nWork'' alone. They have to come together.\n  Many of our colleagues in the administration support this \nlegislation. I especially want to thank my friend Senator Grassley for \nhis support in these important last weeks.\n  The insurance industry fully supports the legislation. The Work \nIncentives Improvement Act will help reduce the $70 billion annual \ndrain on the budget caused by 8 million individuals with disabilities, \nmany of whom want to work but do not because of their fear of the loss \nof access to health care.\n  At this point we cannot say, again, we will try to get something \nthrough next Congress. We cannot hide behind excuses. We must pass the \nWork Incentives Improvement Act now. This is a special time. The \nmomentum is with us. People with disabilities expect us to deliver now. \nThey want to be free to go to work.\n  If we do, the lives of millions of Americans will be transformed, \nboth disabled and nondisabled Americans. Individuals with disabilities \nwill work and pay taxes. They will experience the true meaning of \npersonal dignity, freedom, independence, and choices. Their family \nmembers and friends will be freed from caretaking responsibilities and \nreenter the workforce or expand their work hours. Decisions about the \nquality of life and living circumstances of an individual with \ndisabilities will no longer be made for that individual but will be \nmade by and with that individual.\n  The only down side to the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998 is \nit has taken us so long to get to this precious moment. Let's make it \ncount. Let us deliver, and let us deliver now.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have and I am now ready to \nproceed.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12545-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12546-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF AN AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA CONCERNING \n    FISHERIES OFF THE COASTS OF THE UNITED STATES--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 162\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; referred jointly, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1823, to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement \nbetween the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the Republic of Lithuania extending the Agreement of \nNovember 12, 1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United \nStates, with annex, as extended (``the 1992 Agreement'').

unless extended by an Act of Congress, the \n     President shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, a report

rights under the Treaties or the Berne Convention and \n     that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not \n     authorized by the copyright owners concerned or permitted by \n

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan investment credit to promote the availability of jet aircraft to \nunderserved communities, to reduce the passenger tax rate on rural \ndomestic flight segments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   regional jet investment tax credit\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto help bring much-needed regional jet service to underserved \ncommunities. This legislation is designed to help restore air service \nto underserved communities and to stimulate airline competition by \noffering an investment tax credit to new entrant carriers to provide \nregional jet service to underserved markets. My bill also significantly \nreduces the current airline ticket tax on passengers flying in and out \nof rural America. Together, these tax incentives will encourage new \nentrants to enter thinner rural markets.\n  This legislation has two objectives: (A) incentivize the purchase and \ndeployment of regional jets for under-served markets; and (B) stimulate \ncompetition in rural areas by providing financial incentives for new \nentrants to serve underserved markets with regional jets. Using tax \ncredits is a fair and effective means to accomplish these goals.\n  Most small communities have not benefitted from airline deregulation. \nIn fact, airline deregulation has been a steady decline for much of \nrural America. Since 1978, when the Congress deregulated the airline \nindustry, more than 30 small communities have had jet service replaced \nwith turbo prop service; out of the 320 small communities served by a \nmajor airline in 1978 declined from 213 to 33 by 1995; and the number \nof small communities receiving service to only one major hub airport \nnearly doubled, increasing from 79 in 1978 to 174 in 1995.\n  Countless studies from the General Accounting Office and the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation have documented that as the airline \nindustry grows more and more concentrated under deregulation, small \nrural communities are being left behind with less service and higher \nfares. Several GAO studies have pointed to the correlation between \nindustry concentration and higher air fares and that small rural \ncommunities are being hit especially hard as a result of the chilling \nof competition in the industry. In 1990, the GAO identified several \nmarket barriers thwarting the emergence of competition. In 1996, the \nGAO found that not only do the same problems continue to exist, but \nhave gotten worse.\n  In the present deregulated environment, small rural communities see \nvery little to give them hope that air service will improve. The advent \nof regional jets holds some promise, but most RJs are presently being \npurchased by the major carriers who are using them to serve high \ndensity markets. Thus, if air service to rural America is going to be \nrevitalized, we must find a way to incentivize the deployment of \nregional jets in underserved markets.\n  Last August, Northwest Airlines had a pilot strike and therefore a \nshutdown of their airline service. That might not have meant much to \nsome. In some airports, Northwest was one of a number of carriers that \nwas serving certain airports and serving passengers. But in\n\n[[Page S12559]]\n\nNorth Dakota, the State which I represent, Northwest Airlines was the \nonly airline providing jet service to my State. That is a very \ndifferent picture than the last time we had an airline strike, which \nwas over 25 years ago.\n  Nearly a quarter of a century ago when Northwest had another strike \nand a shutdown prior to deregulation of the airlines, we had five \ndifferent airline companies flying jets into the State of North Dakota. \nAt roughly the same time, we had folks in Congress saying: ``What we \nreally need to do is foster competition. We need to deregulate the \nairline industry.'' Thus, Congress deregulated the airline industry \nabout 20 years ago. I wasn't here at the time, but the results for \nNorth Dakota was that we went from five jet carriers to one and we pay \nsome of the highest fares of anywhere in the country.\n  All those folks who swallowed the goal to deregulation in order to \nstimulate competition are now choking on the word ``competition.'' \nToday, stimulating competition is likened to re-regulation. What a \ntwist. But, the fact is that competition is more the exception than the \nrule.\n  If you live in Chicago and you are flying to New York or Los Angeles, \nGod bless you, because you are going to have a lot of carriers to \nchoose from and you are going to find very inexpensive ticket prices. \nYou have a choice of carriers and ticket prices that are very \nattractive to you. You live in a city with millions and millions of \npeople and you want to fly to another city with millions and millions \nof people. This is not an awfully bad deal for you; more choices and \nlow fares. But if you get beyond those cities and ask how has this \nairline deregulation affected other Americans, what you will find is \nless selection, fewer choices, and higher prices.\n  North Dakota is just one example, and the recent shutdown of our \nstate's only jet carrier highlighted the problem. When the strike was \ncalled and the airline shut down, just like that, an entire State lost \nall of its jet service.\n  A complete shutdown of all jet service chokes the economy very \nquickly. People can't move in and out. Now, I happen to think Northwest \nis a good carrier. I believe the same about all the major carriers. \nMost of them are well-run, good companies.\n  What I do not admire is what they have done by retreating into \nregional monopolies--dominating the access points of our Nation's air \ntransportation system. The major carriers have retreated into fortress \nhubs where one airline controls 60 or 70 or 80 percent of all the \ntraffic at a major hub airport. With that level of market dominance, \ndoes anyone believe that another carrier is going to be able to come in \nand take them on? Competition is not flourishing. It's dying. This is \nnot a free market--new entrants cannot access these dominated hubs and \nthe result is that we now have regional monopolies without any \nregulation.\n  What sense does that make, to have monopolies without regulation? The \nminute I say ``regulation,'' we have people here having apoplectic \nseizures on the floor of the Senate. Oh, Lord, we cannot talk about \n``regulation!'' I am not standing here today talking about regulation \nand I am not suggesting to re-regulate the airlines. All I want to do \nis see if we can provide some sort of industrial-strength vitamin B-12 \nshot right in the rump of those airlines to see if we cannot get them \ncompeting again. How do we do that? We do it by creating the conditions \nthat require competition. This legislation is one attempt to do just \nthat.\n  In order to encourage new startup regional jet service, I am \nproposing a 10 percent investment tax credit for regional jet \npurchases. That is, those startup companies that want to begin regional \njet service to fly these new regional jets between certain cities and \nhubs that are not now served with regional jet service, we would say to \nthem that we will help with a 10 percent investment tax credit on the \npurchase or lease of those regional jets. We will help because we want \nto provide incentives for the establishment of regional jet service \nonce again in our country.\n  Under this legislation, qualifying carriers would be eligible for an \ninvestment tax credit--up to ten percent of the purchase or lease \nprice--of regional jet aircraft that are used primarily to serve under-\nserved markets. To receive the investment tax credit, an air carrier \nmust have less than $10 billion annual revenue passenger miles and the \naircraft for which the tax credit applies must be used primarily (over \n50% of its flight segments) to serve underserved markets for 5 years. \nAn under-served market is defined as a community served by an airport \nwith fewer than 60,000 annual emplanements.\n  The investment tax credit would be offset by closing a corporate tax \nloophole regarding the deductible liquidating distributions or \nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. The \nremaining revenue available from the offset would be used to reduce the \nairline ticket tax for the domestic segment serving a rural airport.\n  Under current law, an 8 percent ad velorem tax is imposed on all \ndomestic flights, plus a $2 flight segment tax. Beginning in fiscal \nyear 1999, the ad velorem tax is reduced to 7.5 percent and the flight \nsegment tax is increased to $2.25. In subsequent years, the ad velorem \ntax remains at 7.5 percent while the flight segment tax increases $0.25 \nper year through 2003 at which point is capped at $3.00 per flight \nsegment. Current law provides that the flight segment tax is not \nimposed on domestic flights to and from rural airports, which are \ndefined as an airport with fewer than 100,000 passenger departures and \nis not located within 75 miles of another airport (that has fewer than \n100,000 passenger departures) or is receiving EAS subsidies. Under this \nlegislation, the 7.5 percent ad velorem tax on domestic flights to \nrural airports would be reduced in proportion to the amount remaining \nfrom the revenue offset after the regional jet aircraft investment tax \ncredit has been provided.\n  It is targeted, it makes good sense, and it will stimulate investment \nin an activity that this country that very much needs more competition. \nThe so-called free market is clogged--a kind of an airline cholesterol \nhere that clogs up the arteries, and they say, ``This is the way we \nwork, these are our hubs, these are out spokes, and you cannot mess \nwith them.''\n  My legislation simply says we would like to assist areas that no \nlonger have jet service but could support it. We would like to \nencourage companies that decide they want to come in and serve there to \nbe able to purchase the regional jets and be able to initiate that kind \nof service.\n  My legislation has a second provision which reduces the airline \nticket tax for certain qualified flights in rural America. This \nproposal also has a revenue offset so it would not be a net loser for \nthe Federal budget.\n  We are not in a situation in rural areas of this country where we can \njust sit back and say what is going to happen to us is going to happen \nto us and there is nothing we can do about it. There are some, I \nsuppose, who sit around and wring their hands and gnash their teeth and \nfret and sweat and say, ``I really cannot alter things very much, this \nis the way it is.''\n  The way it is not satisfactory to the people of my State. It is not \nsatisfactory to have only one jet carrier serving our entire State. Our \nState's transportation services and airline service, especially jet \nairline service, is an essential transportation service. It ought not \nbe held hostage by labor problems or other problems of one jet carrier. \nWe must have competition. If all of those in this Chamber who mean what \nthey say when they talk about competition will weigh in here and say, \n``Let's stand for competition, let's stand for the free market, let's \ntry to help new starts, let's breed opportunities for broader based \neconomic ownership and more competition in the airline industry,'' then \nI think we will have done something important and useful and good for \nStates like mine and for many other rural States in this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na special rule regarding allocation of interest expense of qualified \ninfrastructure indebtedness of taxpayers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nremedy a problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of \nU.S. electric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National \nEnergy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities \nwishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. \nU.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business \nopportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and \nthe need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy \ndemands abroad.\n  Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments \nin utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, \nthe Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities \nhave created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, \nengineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also \nallow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments \nby subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign \noperations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to \nforeign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise \nresult from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of \nthese foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. \ntax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized \nfor tax credit purposes.\n  Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses \nbetween the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book \nvalues of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business \nrealities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this \nallocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until \nrecently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and \nequipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been \nmuch depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in \nmost cases fully-depreciated. Thus a disproportionate amount of \ninterest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign \nincome base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of \nthe corresponding foreign tax credits.\n  As the allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign \nincome by reducing foreign tax credits, they also increase domestic \ntaxation by shifting interest deductions from U.S. to foreign \noperations. The unfairness of this misallocation is magnified by the \nfact that interest expenses are usually associated with domestically-\nregulated debt, which is tied to domestic production and is not as \nfungible as the tax code assumes.\n  The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very \nhigh effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of \nU.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, \nsome U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and \nothers have pulled back from their initial investments.\n  One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am \nintroducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest \nallocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. \nutility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the \nUnited States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing \n``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In \nboth cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and \nspecific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable \nfrom the typical risks of general credit lending transactions.\n  The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical \nelement of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the \nsame tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my \nbill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest \non debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling \nelectricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation \nis a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the solution I am proposing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2630\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a toll free number in the Department of \nCommerce to assist consumers in determining if products are American-\nmade; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              made in america consumer hotline legislation\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I introduce common-sense \nlegislation which will greatly benefit America's manufacturers and \nconsumers. My colleague, Senator DeWine of Ohio, is joining me as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill. The ``Made In America'' Consumer \nHotline bill will establish a toll free number in the Department of \nCommerce to assist consumers in determining whether the products they \nbuy are American-made. The House has passed this legislation and I urge \nmy colleagues to move this bill swiftly in our remaining days of the \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S12562]]\n\n  As the world economy becomes more inter-related, determining to what \nextent a product is ``Made in America'' is increasingly difficult for \nAmerican consumers. We have come to expect access to information about \nso many of the products and services we rely on every day, information \nto help us make decisions about what's best for our families, our \ncommunities and our economy. With auto parts, computers, clothing, or \nappliances, American consumers know that the ``Made in America'' \ndesignation on products represents quality, reliability, and value.\n  This legislation would establish a pilot program for the operation of \na three-year, toll-free number to assist consumers in determining what \nproducts are ``Made in America.'' This legislation will have no cost to \nAmerican taxpayers. Instead, fees collected from manufacturers who \nvoluntarily choose to register their product will fully fund the toll-\nfree line. In the past, I cosponsored this hotline legislation in the \nHouse and I applaud my House colleagues for passing this bill.\n  Providing consumers access to accurate and reliable information on \nthe content of the products they buy is common-sense legislation that \nis long overdue. Some may object to the creation of such an information \nhotline as a protectionist endeavor. On the contrary, I believe there \nis nothing more conducive to fair trade than providing consumers the \nfreedom to decide what product is best for them. This legislation is \nnot about telling consumers what to buy, it's about providing consumers \nthe resources they need to make their own decisions.\n  I have worked hard to advance the issue of freedom of information on \ncountry of origin labeling, but we need to do more to facilitate \nconsumer access to information. As you and I know, we can easily \ndetermine which country manufactured the automobiles we drive. We trust \nthe tags on our shirts or trousers and we can see where our computers, \nstereos, and telephones were made by simply looking at the products' \nlabel. But many areas remain void of information on product origin. For \nexample, when we go to the grocery store to purchase meat products for \nour families to eat, we have no idea where that meat originated.\n  Throughout my service in the United States Congress, I have been a \nstrong believer in country of origin labeling for all types of consumer \nproducts. I have been an especially strong supporter of country of \norigin labeling for meat products because of its common-sense nature, \nits benefits to ranchers, farmers, and consumers, its strong bipartisan \nand agricultural group support, its cost-free benefit to taxpayers as \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and its trade friendly \nprovisions. I don't intend to stop at agricultural products. The \nlegislation I am introducing today targets general consumer products \ngreater than $250 in value.\n  Freedom of information about country of origin labeling is fair trade \nbecause it provides global consumers with freedom of choice. In today's \nglobal economy, consumers deserve access to information on where the \nproducts their families use are from. By passing this ``Made in \nAmerica'' toll-free hotline legislation, Congress will help consumers \nassert their right to know.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2632. A bill for the relief of Thomas J. Sansone, Jr.; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Relations.\n\n\n               private relief bill for tommy sansone, jr.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill for \nmyself and for Senator Moynihan that will provide compensation under \nthe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to Tommy \nSansone, Jr. Tommy was injured by a DPT vaccine in June 1994 and \ncontinues to suffer seizures and brain damage to this day. Tommy is the \nunintended and helpless victim of a drug designed to help him. He needs \nour help because while the Vaccine Injury Program is meant to make \nreparations for these injuries, it is hampered by regulations that \nchallenges the worthiest of claims.\n  Let me be clear, I am not advocating against our national \nimmunization program. Vaccines are an integral part of our preventive \nhealth program, and in no way should we stop vaccinating our kids. \nHowever, in rare instances, a child will receive a shot designed to \nkeep him safe from whooping cough or measles or other illness but react \nviolently to the serum and end up crippled or sometimes killed. The \nanswer is not to stop inoculating our children. We must review the \nprogram to ensure we provide our children with the greatest protection \npossible against the tragic diseases that older generations of \nAmericans knew all too well, and we must review the Vaccine Injury Act.\n  Back in 1986, Congress passed the Vaccine Injury Act to take care of \nvaccine injuries because the shots that we required our children to get \nwere not as safe as they could have been. Since the program was \nestablished, more than 1100 children have been compensated. Over the \nfirst ten years, a great percentage of those with seizures or brain \ndamage or other symptoms were recognized to be DPT-injured, and, they \nwere summarily compensated. But, by 1995, the Institutes of Medicine \n(IOM) and others concluded that because the symptoms had no unique \nclinical profile, they were not necessarily DPT injuries. So, HHS \nchanged the definitions of encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain), \nand of vaccine injury. Those new definitions had unintended \nconsequences. Now, the program that we set up to be expeditious and \nfair, uses criteria that are so strict that the fund from which these \nclaims are paid pays fewer claims than before and the fund has \nballooned to over $1.2 billion. As a result, families of children like \nTommy find it nearly impossible to win a claim against the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program. Most importantly, the program is failing \nits mission.\n  Today, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is seen as a Fort Knox \nof government funds that not even the worthiest claim can access \nwithout a high-priced lawyer to guide it through a labyrinth of \nbureaucratic regulations. It is no longer the ``no-fault compensation \nprogram under which awards can be made to vaccine-injured persons \nquickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity,'' as we originally \nintended in 1986.\n  To be clear, VICP is not a medical insurance policy. The program is \nnot designed to take care of those who cannot get or receive care. VICP \nis a compensation program, where the government makes amends for a \nfailure in the system that it established. Claims are paid from a trust \nfund established from surcharged that are paid on each shot a child \nreceives. The fund serves as an insurance policy against vaccine \ninjuries. But, following the regulatory changes made in 1995, the \ngovernment is not recognizing even the most legitimate of claims. We \nare failing the very children we are trying to protect.\n  Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Senate Labor Committee and I \nhave commissioned the GAO to study the vaccine injury program. We asked \nthem to examine the overall operation and effectiveness of the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program and the National Vaccine Program. They will \nlook at how revenues in the compensation fund are being managed and \ndispersed and whether vaccine injury claims are reviewed and processed \nin a fair and timely manner. They will look for those barriers, if any, \nthat petitioners face in proving vaccine-related injuries. We've asked \nthem to look into how well information about vaccine safety and \ninjuries is collected, maintained and distributed, and to recommend \nchanges (legislative or regulatory) to improve the Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program and the National Vaccine Program. We want to fix \nVICP for children nationwide who needlessly suffer twice at the hands \nof the federal government; once with an adverse reaction to a vaccine \nthey are required to receive and a second time when they cannot hold \nthe federal government liable for their pain and suffering. But, there \nis something we can do now. We need to take care of this little guy, \nTommy Sansone, Jr.\n  Over the years after his DPT shot (the combined shot for diphtheria, \npertussis and tetanus), Tommy suffers severe seizures and from brain \ndamage that has hampered his mental development. When he wakes in the \nmorning or from a nap, either his mother or father is at his side \nwaiting for the inevitable. Tommy's eyes tear and his face cringes in \nagony as his entire body is wracked with a muscle-clenching seizure. \nHis parents hold him helplessly\n\n[[Page S12563]]\n\nuntil the seizure subsides, sometimes for as long as five minutes. \nTommy will then look into his mother's loving eyes, and say, ``No more, \nmommy. Make them stop.''\n  At the very least, Tommy's parents know that the strain of vaccine \nused on Tommy is now being phased out because of the rash of adverse \nreactions it caused. But, this does nothing for Tommy or his parents \nwho have been in and out of countless hospitals, and consulted with \ndoctors and experts at the Centers for Disease Control and the Health \nResources and Services Administration. Their claim for compensation was \ndismissed in the Federal Court of Claims, but they and Tommy's doctor \nfeel (and I agree with them) that they should have known more about the \npotential dangers of the DPT vaccine that Tommy received on June 1, \n1994. No one told them that there was a chance that the DPT vaccine \ncould cause such trauma. No one told them about ``hot lots,'' an \nunofficial team for a batch of shots that has had an abundance of \nadverse reactions. The lot that Tommy received is known to have had 44 \nsuch reactions from March-November 1994, including 2 deaths. These are \nreactions beyond the short-lived fever and rashes that accompany many \nvaccines. Their doctor didn't know about the availability of the \n``new'' acellular strain of pertussis vaccine that is replacing the \nwhole cell version that has been used since the 1930s. Sure, it costs a \ncouple of dollars more, but who wouldn't choose that for their child--\ngiven the choice?\n  Tommy's claim would have been covered before the 1995 changes, but \nthat is not the case any longer. He's the victim of a bad DPT vaccine, \nyet his case continues to be denied because the first seizure didn't \noccur within 72 hours of the shot. It occurred 18 days later, and he \nsuffers to this day. Tommy also has brain damage (encephalopathy) \nbecause of the DPT shot, but it doesn't fit that new definition either. \nHe cried and moaned at a shrill pitch from the moment of the shot until \nhis first seizure, but that doesn't matter either. For the first six \nmonths of his life, tommy was in all ways normal, but for 4 and a half \nyears since the DPT vaccine he and his family have suffered. As a \nparent and grandparent, I would do anything to protect my family from \nsuch pain and suffering. Tom Senior has done everything he knows how to \nhelp his son. Now he has turned to me because he knows I am in a \nposition to help and I will not relent in my pursuit of relief for the \nSansone family. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program should take \ncare of Tommy, but it doesn't. This bill will enable us to ensure that \nit does.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nregistered venders to administer claims for refund of kerosene sold for \nhome heating use; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      tax claims for refund of kerosene sold for home heating use\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will \ncorrect a grave injustice to users of kerosene for home heating. My \nbill would amend last year's change to the tax code concerning kerosene \nto allow registered vendors to administer claims for the refund of \nkerosene sold for home heating use.\n  As many of you know, on July 1, 1998, new regulations regarding the \ntaxation of kerosene went into effect, and I have heard from many \nTennesseans who are concerned about the new tax policies. These \nprovisions were included in the House version of the ``Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997.'' While these provisions were not included in the Senate \nversion of the bill, the House language prevailed when the Senate and \nHouse worked out the conference agreement on this bill. Prior to the \n1997 change in law, kerosene was not taxable unless it was blended with \ntaxable diesel fuel or used as an aviation fuel, nor was it subject to \ndyeing requirements.\n  There have been continued problems with the use of untaxed kerosene \nbeing blended with taxable highway fuel, like diesel. As a result, some \nmembers of the House of Representatives determined and diesel fuel \ncompliance measures, like dyeing, should be extended to kerosene. \nAccording to the new law, kerosene is taxed at 24.4 cents per gallon \nunless it is indelibly dyed and used only for a nontaxable use like \nhome heating.\n  I am concerned about these changes, especially since kerosene is \noften used as a heating oil or in space heaters. This is a nontaxable \nuse; however, it is unclear whether dyed kerosene may be used in space \nheaters due to health concerns. In addition, many small oil companies \nand kerosene venders do not have sufficient facilities to sell both \ndyed and undyed kerosene, and many states have regulations mandating \nthat only undyed kerosene may be used in home heaters. As a result, \nmany consumers of kerosene for non-taxable home heating purposes will \neither be forced, or will choose for safety reasons, to purchase the \ntaxable undyed kerosene. Under current law and IRS regulation, only the \ntaxpayer is allowed to file a claim for a fuel credit if he or she \npurchases taxable kerosene for a non-taxable purpose other than from a \nblocked pump.\n  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has provided refund and credit \nprocedures for vendors and/or purchasers of the clear, taxed kerosene \nwhen the kerosene is intended for nontaxable purposes like home \nheating. This process, however, is complex and potentially unwieldy. \nIndividual purchasers may claim a credit on line 59 of the 1040 tax \nform for whatever amount of tax they paid on clear kerosene bought for \na nontaxable use. It is true that an individual must file a return, \neven if he or she otherwise would not, in order to receive the credit \nfrom the IRS. Vendors may claim a credit on their tax returns or may \nclaim a quarterly refund if at least $750 is owed.\n\n  Because many of these kerosene consumers do not file tax return form \n1040, this provision is an undue burden on hundreds, perhaps thousands, \nof Tennesseans, and many thousands of Americans. The complex nature of \nthe kerosene tax refund policies on individual consumers who use \nkerosene for home heating is unduly burdensome. Additionally, for the \nconsumers to pay a 24.4 cent tax per gallon at all strikes me as unjust \ntaxation. Many of those who use kerosene for home heating are poor and \ncan ill-afford to pay approximately 25% more per gallon of kerosene--\neven if it is to be refunded at a later time.\n  I sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on August 13, \n1998 asking Commissioner Rossotti to issue a regulation that would \nallow kerosene vendors to file refund claims on behalf of their \nconsumers. The Commissioner responded that such a regulation would \nrequire Congressional action to actually change the statute.\n  This bill would do just that. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure and I strongly urge passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2635. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor retirement savings for the 21st century; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  21st century retirement savings act\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleague Senator \nJohn Breaux, to introduce the 21st Century Retirement Savings Act.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senator Breaux as two of six co-sponsors \nof S.\n\n[[Page S12564]]\n\n2313, a bill to strengthen and preserve Social Security. This \nlegislation was developed through the expertise of the National \nCommission on Retirement Policy, convened by the Center of Strategic \nand International Studies.\n  The Commission was unique among such efforts in that it looked at the \nentire picture surrounding retirement saving, and did not seek to \nincrease income through one venue at the expense of another. It was our \nfinding that income through all of the components of the national \nretirement structures--Social Security, employer-provided pensions, and \nindividual savings--needed to be increased if we are to meet the needs \nof the 21st century.\n  This legislation to shore up private retirement savings is a \ncompanion piece to S. 2313, which dealt with Social Security. I am \npleased that it will also be introduced by Congressmen Kolbe and \nStenholm in the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a \n     parent in violation of law, court order, or legally binding \n     agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;\n       (2) until the mid-1970's, parental abduction generally was \n     not considered a criminal offense in the United States;\n       (3) since the mid-1970's, United States criminal law has \n     evolved such that parental abduction is now a criminal \n     offense in each of the 50 States and the District of \n     Columbia;\n       (4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime \n     Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-173; 107 Stat. 1998; 18 U.S.C. \n     1204), Congress recognized the need to combat parental \n     abduction by making the act of international parental \n     kidnapping a Federal criminal offense;\n       (5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United \n     States is a party specifically list the offenses that are \n     extraditable\n\n[[Page S12568]]\n\n     and use the word ``kidnapping'', but it has been the practice \n     of the United States not to consider the term to include \n     parental abduction because these treaties were negotiated by \n     the United States prior to the development in United States \n     criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and (4);\n       (6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the \n     United States is a party contain dual criminality provisions, \n     which provide for extradition where both parties make the \n     offense a felony, and therefore it is the practice of the \n     United States to consider such treaties to include parental \n     abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the \n     act of parental abduction to be a criminal offense; and\n       (7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United \n     States extradition law which should be rectified to better \n     protect the interests of children and their parents.\n\n     SEC. 203. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES.\n\n       For purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United \n     States is a party, Congress authorizes the interpretation of \n     the terms ``kidnaping'' and ``kidnapping'' to include \n     parental kidnapping.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12566-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12568-S12570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     THE RUMSFELD COMMISSION REPORT\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as you know, over the past year there \nhas been a great deal of discussion in Washington about the growing \nballistic missile threat to the United States and our forces and \nfriends abroad. Although Members of Congress and the Administration \nhave not always agreed on how to best respond to this growing threat, I \nthink we can all agree that the Commission to Assess the Ballistic \nMissile Threat to the United States, chaired by former Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld, has made an indispensable contribution to the \ndebate. The bipartisan, nine-member commission included many of our \nnation's most prominent experts on national security affairs. Due to \nDon Rumsfeld's leadership, this diverse group with divergent views on \nmany policy issues, came together and produced an outstanding report \nthat unanimously concluded that the ballistic missile threat to the \nU.S. is greater than previously assessed, that rogue nations like Iran \ncould develop long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S. in as \nlittle as five years, and that we might have little or no warning that \nsuch a threat had developed.\n  At an event last week, the Center for Security Policy honored Don \nRumsfeld by presenting him with the ``Keeper of the Flame'' award for \nhis outstanding leadership as chairman of the Commission to Assess the \nBallistic Missile Threat to the United States. It was a well deserved \nhonor. For the benefit of those who were not able to attend the award \nceremony, I ask that Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks at the event be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n Remarks of the Honorable Donald Rumsfeld, Center for Security Policy, \n                            October 7, 1998\n\n       Chairman Ed Meese, distinguished Members of the House and \n     Senate, public officials--past and present--ladies and \n     gentlemen. Good evening.\n       I see so many here who have served our country with \n     distinction in so many important ways--Senators Cochran, Kyl \n     and Wallop, Secretaries Jim Schlesinger and Al Haig, and many \n     others. And there is Dr. Fritz Kraemer. There is a true \n     ``keeper of the flame.'' It is a privilege as well as a \n     pleasure to be with you all.\n       Frank--my congratulations to you for your ten years of \n     contributions to our country's security. You and your \n     associates at the Center deserve, and have, our appreciation. \n     We all know and respect the energy, persistence and \n     patriotism that you have brought to the national security \n     debate and are grateful for it.\n       Senator Thad Cochran, I thank you for your generous words. \n     As you know, your Committee's very useful ``Proliferation \n     Primer'' was given to each of our Commission members at our \n     first session. You have made important contributions on these \n     key subjects, and I congratulate you for them.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I find since I first arrived in Washington, D.C., to work \n     on Capitol Hill back in 1957, fresh out of the Navy, that \n     while we went back home at regular intervals, I seem to keep \n     finding myself back here on some project or another for over \n     several decades now. I must say that this most recent \n     assignment, the Ballistic Missile Threat Commission, has been \n     particularly interesting, because the subject is so \n     important.\n       This evening I want to talk a bit about our report, first \n     because it is a message that needs to be heard, and, second, \n     because there's no group who has done more and can do still \n     more to carry that message.\n       As you will recall, the U.S. Intelligence Community's 1995 \n     National Intelligence Estimate caused quite a stir in the \n     national security community for a number of reasons. As a \n     result, the Congress established our Commission to provide an \n     independent assessment of the ballistic missile threat to the \n     United States--including Alaska and Hawaii. Our charter was \n     not to look at other threats or possible responses.\n       As one of our Commissioners put it, our task was to find \n     out, Who has them? Who is trying to get them? When are they \n     likely to succeed? Why do we care? and, When will we know?\n       Thanks to Speaker Gingrich and Minority Leader Gephardt for \n     the House, and Senate Leaders Lott and Daschle, the members \n     of our bipartisan Commission were truly outstanding. They \n     included: Dr. Barry Blechman, the former Assistant Director \n     of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the Carter \n     Administration; Retired four-star general Lee Butler, former \n     Commander of the Strategic Air Command/ Dr. Richard Garwin of \n     IBM, a distinguished scientist; General Larry Welch, former \n     Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and CEO of the IDA; Paul \n     Wolfowitz, former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, \n     former Ambassador to Indonesia, and Dean of the Nitze School \n     at Johns Hopkins University; and James Woolsey, former \n     Director of the CIA in the Clinton Administration. Also with \n     us this evening is Dr. Steve Cambone, currently the Director \n     of Research at the National Defense University. Steve did a \n     superb job as Staff Director for the Commission.\n       Two of our Commissioners are here this evening, and I'd \n     like them to stand and be recognized for their important \n     work.\n       Dr. William Graham, former Science Advisor to President \n     Reagan. Bill Graham has done a superb job. Thank goodness we \n     had the benefit of his technical experienced and knowledge.\n       Dr. William Schneider, former Undersecretary of State for \n     Security Assistance in the Reagan Administration. Bill kept \n     us sane with his unfailing good humor, penetrating as it is, \n     and challenged by his keen insights.\n       The members of the Commission spent an enormous number of \n     hours, over six months and received over 200 briefings. Not \n     surprisingly, given our different backgrounds and \n     experiences--military, technical, policy oriented, but all \n     with decades of experience dealing with the Intelligence \n     Community and its products--we started out with a variety of \n     viewpoints. As we proceeded, each time we seemed to be \n     diverging in our views, we called for more briefings and \n     focused back on the facts.\n       After extensive discussion and analysis, we arrived at our \n     unanimous conclusions and a unanimous recommendation. As \n     General Welch said, the facts overcame our biases and \n     opinions and drove us to our unanimous conclusions. And in \n     this city, unanimity is remarkable, especially on a subject \n     as heated as this.\n       Given that so few people will be able to read our \n     classified final report of some 307 pages, with several \n     hundred additional classified pages of working papers and \n     technical analysis, and that the unclassified executive \n     summary was only 36 pages, that our conclusions were \n     unanimous makes them considerably more persuasive.\n       During the course of our deliberations, almost every week \n     there was an event somewhere in the world related to \n     ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction--whether \n     the Ghauri missile launch by Pakistan, the Indian and \n     Pakistani nuclear explosions, continued stiff-arming of the \n     U.S. and the U.N. inspectors by Iraq, the Shahab 3 missile \n     firing in Iran, and more recently North Korea's Taepo Dong 1 \n     three-stage launch. The pace of these significant events, \n     while disturbing to be sure, provided a vivid backdrop for \n     our work.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It is clear the Gulf War taught regional powers that they \n     are ill-advised to try to combat U.S. or Western armies and \n     air forces. They can neither deter nor prevail against those \n     vastly greater conventional capabilities. That being the \n     case, it's not surprising that they week asymmetrical \n     advantages and leverage to enable them to change the \n     calculations of Western nations and ways to threaten and \n     deter them as well as their neighbors.\n       They have several cost effective options. Terrorism is one. \n     Cruise missiles are also an increasingly attractive option in \n     that they are both versatile and relatively inexpensive. At \n     some point they may well become a weapon of choice.\n       And, third, there are ballistic missiles. It is not \n     happenstance that some 25-30 countries either have or are \n     seeking to acquire ballistic missiles. They are very \n     attractive, and relatively inexpensive when compared to \n     armies, navies, and air forces; second, like cruise missiles, \n     they can be launched from land, sea or air and have the \n     flexibility of carrying chemical, biological or nuclear \n     warheads; and third, they have the compelling advantage of \n     being certain to arrive at their destinations--since there \n     are no defenses against them.\n       Those of us from Chicago recall Al Capone's remark that \n     ``You get more with a kind word and a gun than you do with a \n     kind word alone.'' We can substitute ``ballistic missile'' \n     for ``gun'' and the names of some modern day Al Capones.\n\n[[Page S12569]]\n\n       The term ``rogue countries'' is an unfortunate phrase, \n     since it suggests that their behavior might be erratic. While \n     unusual to us, their actions are rational for them and not \n     unpredictable. To say that such countries would be deterred \n     or dissuaded from using terrorist attacks, cruise missiles or \n     ballistic missiles with weapons of mass destruction, because \n     of the vastly greater power of the U.S. and the West, is to \n     misunderstand. As Lenin said, ``the purpose of terrorism is \n     to terrorize.'' these are terror weapons, and they work.\n       Having these capabilities in the hands of such countries \n     forces a different calculation on the part of the U.S. and \n     any nation that has interests in their regions.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Commission's unanimous conclusions were these:\n       China and Russia continue to pose threats to the U.S., \n     although different in nature. Each is on an uncertain, albeit \n     different, path. With respect to North Korea and Iran, we \n     concluded each could pose a threat to the U.S. within five \n     years of a decision to do so, and that the U.S. might not \n     know for several years whether or not such a decision had \n     been made. Given that UNSCOM sanctions and inspections are \n     unlikely to be in place it is increasingly clear that Iraq \n     has to be included with North Korea and Iran.\n       We concluded unanimously that these emerging capabilities \n     are broader, more mature, and evolving more rapidly than had \n     been reported, and that the intelligence community's ability \n     to provide timely warning has been and is being eroded and \n     that the warning time of deployment of a ballistic missile \n     threat to the United States is reduced. Finally, we concluded \n     that under some plausible scenarios, including re-basing or \n     transfer of operational missiles, sea- and air-launch \n     options, shortened development programs that might include \n     testing in a third country, or some combination of these, the \n     U.S. might well have little or no warning before operational \n     deployment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       One important reason is that the emerging powers are \n     secretive about their programs and increasingly sophisticated \n     in deception and denial. They know considerably more than we \n     would like them to know about the sources and methods of our \n     collection, in no small part through espionage. And they use \n     that knowledge to good effect in hiding their programs.\n       We concluded that there will be surprises. It is a big \n     world, it is a complicated world, and deception and denial \n     are extensive. The surprise to me is not that there have been \n     and will continue to be surprises, but that we are surprised \n     that there are surprises. We don't, won't, and can't know \n     everything. We must recognize that some surprises will occur \n     and take the necessary steps to see that we invest so that \n     our country is arranged to deal with the risks that the \n     inevitable surprises will pose. As von Clausewitz wrote, \n     ``The unexpected is the prince of the battlefield.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The second key factor relative to reduced warning is the \n     extensive and growing foreign assistance, technology transfer \n     and foreign trade in ballistic missile and weapons of mass \n     destruction capabilities. Foreign trade and foreign \n     assistance are, in our view, not a ``wild card.'' They are a \n     fact. The contention that we will have ample warning of \n     developments in nations with ``indigenous'' ballistic missile \n     development programs misses the point. I don't know of a \n     single nation on earth with an ``indigenous'' ballistic \n     missile program. There may not have been a truly indigenous \n     ballistic missile development program since Robert \n     Goddard. The countries of interest are helping each other. \n     They are doing it for a variety of reasons--some \n     strategic, some financial. But, be clear--technology \n     transfer is not rare or unusual, it is pervasive.\n       The intelligence task is difficult. There are more actors, \n     more programs and more facilities to monitor than was the \n     case during the Cold War. Their assets are spread somewhat \n     thinly across many priorities. Methodological adjustments \n     relative to collecting and analyzing evidence is, in our \n     view, not keeping up with the pace of events. We need to \n     remember Baldy's Law: ``Some of it (what we see), plus the \n     rest of it (what we don't see) equals all of it.'' Or, as Dr. \n     Bill Graham frequently reminded us, ``The absence of evidence \n     is not evidence of absence.''\n       Specifically, Russia and China have emerged as major \n     suppliers of technology to a number of countries. There is \n     the advent and acceleration of trade among second-tier powers \n     to the point that the development of these capabilities may \n     well have become self-sustaining. Today they each have \n     various capabilities the others do not. As they trade--\n     whether it's knowledge, systems, materials, components, or \n     technicians--they benefit from each other and are able to \n     move forward on separate development paths, all of which are \n     notably different from ours or that of the Soviet Union. And, \n     they are able to move at a more rapid pace.\n       To characterize the programs of target nations as ``high-\n     risk'' is a misunderstanding of the situation. These \n     countries do not need the accuracies the U.S. required. They \n     do not have the same concerns about safety that the U.S. has. \n     Nor do they need the high volumes the U.S. acquired. As a \n     result, they are capable of using technologies, techniques \n     and even equipment that the U.S. would have rejected as too \n     primitive as much as three decades ago. But let there be no \n     doubt--they are successfully and rapidly developing the \n     capabilities necessary to threaten the United States.\n       As I mentioned, we considered a series of ways nations can \n     shorten the missile development process and, therefore, \n     warning time. They include launching shorter-range missiles \n     by air or sea, by placing them in another country, by missile \n     testing in another country, by the turn-key sale of entire \n     ballistic missile systems to other countries, or some \n     combination.\n       These approaches have been characterized as ``unlikely.'' \n     But each has been done. They are not new, novel, high-risk or \n     unlikely.\n       As Jim Woolsey pointed out, making ICBMs was like the old \n     4-minute mile barrier. It seemed impossible until Roger \n     Bannister broke it. Today it's relatively easy.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       On the subject of sanctions, you will recall that President \n     Clinton recently said that sanctions legislation causes them \n     to ``fudge.'' It was an honest statement. However, \n     ``fudging'' can have a dangerous effect.\n       There are several ways to ``fudge'': First, simply don't \n     study or analyze a matter if the answer might put your \n     superiors in an uncomfortable position; delay studying or \n     reporting up information that would be ``bad news''; narrowly \n     construe an issue, so that the answer will not be adverse to \n     your boss's views or positions; and last, select assumptions \n     that assume that the answer will lead to your desired \n     conclusions. For example, you could study carefully whether \n     or not the U.S. will have adequate warning of ``indigenous'' \n     ballistic missile development programs, even though \n     ``indigenous'' ballistic missile development programs don't \n     exist.\n       In short, the effect of ``fudging'' is to warp and corrupt \n     the intelligence process. It is corrosive. Leaders have to \n     create an environment that is hospitable to the truth--\n     whether it is bad news or good news--not an environment that \n     forces subordinates to trim, hedge, duck and, as the \n     President said, ``fudge.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The recent TD-1 space launch vehicle test is an object \n     lesson and also a warning. Many were skeptical for technical \n     reasons that the TD-1 could fly at all. It had been the \n     conventional wisdom that ``staging'' and systems integration \n     were too complex and difficult for countries such as North \n     Korea to accomplish in any near time frame. Yet North Korea \n     demonstrated staging twice.\n       The likelihood that a TD-2 will be successfully tested has \n     gone up considerably since the August 31st flight. The \n     likelihood that a TD-2 flight could exceed 5,000 to 6,000 \n     kilometers in range with a nuclear payload has gone up as \n     well. And, the likelihood that we will not know very much in \n     advance of a launch what a TD-2 will be capable of continues \n     to be high.\n       Now, the TD-1 launch was interesting with respect to North \n     Korea, but given the reality of technology transfer, what \n     happens in North Korea also is important with respect to \n     other countries, for example, Iran. We can be certain that \n     North Korea will offer that capability to other countries, \n     including Iran. That has been their public posture. It has \n     been their private behavior. They are very, very active \n     marketing ballistic missile technologies. In addition, Iran \n     not only has assistance from North Korea, but it also has \n     assistance from Russia and China, which creates additional \n     options and development paths for them.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       What does this all mean by way of warning? Well, it \n     powerfully reinforces our Commission's conclusions that \n     technology transfer is pervasive and that deception and \n     denial work. I've mentioned ``surprises,'' which of course go \n     to the issue of warning. When do we know something? Put \n     another way--when is what we do know sufficiently clear that \n     it becomes actionable?\n       Roberta Wohlstetter's brilliant book Pearl Harbor, and the \n     foreword to it, compellingly argue that: ``. . . we were not \n     caught napping at the time of Pearl Harbor. We just expected \n     wrong. And it was not our warning that was most at fault, but \n     our strategic analysis. We were so busy thinking through some \n     ``obvious'' Japanese moves that we neglected to hedge against \n     the choice they actually made.''\n       It may have been a somewhat ``improbable'' choice, but it \n     was not all that improbable. We provided the undefended \n     target, and if we know anything from history, it is that \n     weakness is provocative. Weakness entices others into \n     adventures they otherwise would avoid. ``The risk is that \n     what is strange is thought to be ``improbable,'' and what \n     seems improbable is not taken seriously.''\n       The book goes on to point out that: ``Surprise, when it \n     happens to a government, is likely to be a complicated, \n     diffuse bureaucratic thing. It includes neglect of \n     responsibility, but also responsibility so poorly defined or \n     so ambiguously delegated that action gets lost. It includes \n     gaps in intelligence, but also intelligence that, like a \n     string of pearls too precious to wear, is too sensitive to \n     give to those who need it (and this is happening today). It \n     includes the alarm that fails to work, but also the alarm \n     that has gone off so often it has been disconnected. It \n     includes the unalert watchman, but also the one who knows \n     he'll be chewed out by his superior if he gets higher \n     authority out of bed. It includes the contingencies that \n     occur to no one, but also those that everyone assumes \n     somebody else is taking care\n\n[[Page S12570]]\n\n     of. It includes straightforward procrastination, but also \n     decisions protracted by internal disagreement. It includes, \n     in addition, the inability of individual human beings to rise \n     to the occasion until they are sure it is the occasion, which \n     is usually too late.\n       ``The results, at Pearl Harbor, were sudden, concentrated, \n     and dramatic. The failure, however, was cumulative, \n     widespread, and rather drearily familiar. This is why \n     surprise, when it happens, is everything involved in a \n     government's failure to anticipate effectively.''\n       Does that sound familiar?\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Our Commission's unanimous recommendation was that U.S. \n     analyses, practices and policies that depend on expectations \n     of extended warning of deployment of ballistic missile \n     threats be reviewed and, as appropriate, revised to reflect \n     the reality of an environment in which there may be little or \n     no warning. Specifically, we believe the Department of State \n     should review its policies and priorities, including \n     sanctions and non-proliferation activities, as well as our \n     alliance activities; the intelligence community should review \n     U.S. collection capabilities, given their changing and \n     increasingly complex task; and, last, that the defense \n     establishment should review both U.S. offensive and defensive \n     capabilities as well as strategies, plans, and procedures \n     that are based on an assumption of extended warning.\n       In short, we are in a new circumstance and the policies and \n     approaches that were appropriate when we could rely on \n     extended warning no longer apply.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Recently I have been asked about the reception our report \n     has received. I would say it has been surprisingly good.\n       First, the press. The reaction was superb from Bill Safire, \n     but across the country it has been modest. But then there has \n     been a lot of unusual news competition here in Washington, \n     D.C., to say nothing of the news of:\n       Russia's economic problems and protests and the last Soviet \n     intelligence chief, Mr. Primakov, being named Prime Minister.\n       The Asian financial crisis.\n       The Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa's brilliant chase for the home \n     run title, to say nothing of Mr. McGwire's accomplishment.\n       And, if you can believe it, Quaddafi, of all people, \n     holding a 5-nation summit.\n       As to the Department of State and the National Security \n     Council, I am not aware of any public reaction.\n       The only reaction from the Department of Defense I am aware \n     of was to reiterate their belief that the U.S. will have \n     ample warning of ``indigenous'' ballistic missile development \n     programs, with which we, of course, would readily agree, if, \n     in fact, any ``indigenous'' ballistic missile programs \n     actually existed--which they don't. As General Lee Butler \n     said at one of our Commission's Congressional hearings, ``If \n     you are determined to do it, there is no body of evidence \n     that cannot be ignored.''\n       In the Intelligence Community we see positive changes \n     already. I think it is reasonably certain that the next \n     National Intelligence Estimate will look quite different from \n     the last one. The initial press report on the release of the \n     Commission's findings quoted an ``anonymous CIA source'' as \n     contending that our report was a ``worst case.'' But that was \n     before the North Korean three-stage TD-1 launch in August. We \n     have not seen that phrase used again since. Indeed, our \n     report could prove to have been a ``best case,'' if and when \n     North Korea and/or Iran announce and demonstrate still \n     greater ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction \n     capabilities, as they most surely will in the months ahead.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We are in a relaxed post-Cold War environment, with \n     increased exchanges of scientists and students, relaxed \n     export controls, leaks of classified information appearing in \n     the press almost daily, espionage continuing apace, an \n     explosion of ``demarches,'' which provide vital information \n     that eventually is used to our disadvantage, and increased \n     international trade of sophisticated dual-use technology.\n       It is increasingly clear that anti-proliferation efforts, \n     coupled with the inevitable imposition of still more \n     sanctions--which already cover a large majority of the people \n     on earth--are not stopping other nations from acquiring \n     increasingly sophisticated weapons of mass destruction and \n     missile technologies.\n       There are two schools of thought as to how to deal with \n     this obvious failure:\n       One is to try still harder and impose still more sanctions.\n       The second approach is to seriously work to prevent the \n     availability of the most important technologies, try to delay \n     the availability of the next tier of information, but to \n     recognize that we live in a world where those who don't wish \n     us well will inevitably gain sophisticated weapons, and that, \n     therefore, the answer is to invest as necessary in the \n     offensive and defense capabilities and the intelligence \n     assets that will enable us to live with these increasingly \n     dangerous threats.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We hear a lot about the defense budget and the top line \n     pressure--that we can't afford more. Look, our country may \n     not be wealthy enough to do everything in the world that \n     everyone in the world may wish, but the first responsibility \n     of government is to provide for the national security. And, \n     let there be no doubt, our country is more than wealthy \n     enough to do everything important that we need to do. Defense \n     expenditures at 3% of GNP are the lowest in my adult \n     lifetime. We need to stop the mindless defense cuts, \n     rearrange our national defense to fit the post-Cold War \n     world, and invest as necessary to assure our nation's ability \n     to contribute to peace and stability in our still dangerous \n     and increasingly untidy world.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I am optimistic that we will find our way. We are not a \n     nation with but one leader. Our strength is that we have \n     multiple centers of leadership.\n       Our central purpose remains as compelling as ever. Quite \n     simply, it is to guard the ramparts of freedom and to expand \n     freedom at home and light its way in the world. This means \n     encouraging freedom abroad and enriching it here at home. It \n     requires purposeful diplomacy underpinned by strong, flexible \n     military power and persuasive moral leadership.\n       As Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``Aggressive fighting for \n     the right is the noblest sport that the world affords.'' To \n     those gathered here this evening, who do that each day, you \n     have my thanks and appreciation.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBernardino R. Stabile on his retirement from the Secret Service. A \nmilitary veteran and dedicated civil servant, Mr. Stabile has completed \n53 outstanding years in service to the government.\n  Mr. Stabile has served with great distinction for the past 25 years \nas an Operations Support Technician in the Boston Field Office of the \nSecret Service, working in support of the agency's protective and \ninvestigative missions.\n  Earlier, Mr. Stabile had served for 27 years in the United States \nMarine Corps. He served in the South Pacific in World War II, including \nthe Marshall Islands, Saipan, and Iwo Jima. He also served in the \nKorean War in the 1950's, was part of the Dominican Republic operation \nin 1965, and had two tours of duty in Vietnam in the 1960's.\n  In the course of this extraordinary career, he became a highly \ndecorated Sergeant Major and received numerous commendations, including \nthe Bronze Star, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Presidential Unit \nCitation, and the Navy Unit Citation. Some say, once a ``boot,'' always \na ``boot.'' But Sergeant Major Stabile took many ``boots'' over the \nyears and developed them into effective leaders.\n  Throughout his brilliant career, Bernardino Stabile has served his \ncountry with commitment, dedication, bravery, integrity, honor, and \npatriotism of the highest order. He deserves the gratitude of the \nSenate and the nation, and I am proud to take this opportunity to \npraise his outstanding service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12570-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

REDDING\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nDelaware's, indeed this nation's, legal legends.\n  Louis L. Redding was the first African-American admitted to the \nDelaware Bar in 1929. As one of the preeminent civil rights advocates \nin the country, Redding was sought after to\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\nparticipate in the argument before the U.S. Supreme Court in the \nlandmark Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which led to \nthe end of legal segregation in our nation's public schools. Brown \nincluded a Delaware case Redding had won in the State Chancery Court \nholding that nine black children had the right to attend white public \nschools.\n  Louis L. Redding died Monday, September 28, 1998, at the age of 96. \nHis death is obviously a time of sadness, but also a time to celebrate \nhis truly pioneering life and spirit.\n  Time and time again, Redding not only overcame adversity--he excelled \nin the face of it. He pursued justice persistently and passionately--\nstanding up for equal rights in education, public accommodations and \ncriminal law.\n  Redding, a 1928 Harvard University Law School graduate, broke the \ncolor barrier in the Delaware Bar after 253 years of this all-Caucasian \ngroup. When he took the Delaware Bar Examination with eight other white \nlaw school graduates, he was given a different, harder test. He passed \nwith the top grades. After he was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1929, \nhe remained the only minority attorney in Delaware for another twenty-\nseven years.\n  It even took twenty years for the Delaware State Bar Association to \nallow him to become a member--and again he excelled in the face of \nadversity--becoming Vice President of this once all-white Association.\n  Redding earned national respect with a series of sweeping civil \nrights victories in the Delaware courts. In 1950, he successfully \nargued Parker v. University of Delaware, Del. Ch., 75 A.2d 225 (1950), \nwhich held that the University of Delaware's refusal to admit blacks \nwas unconstitutional because the State's black institution, Delaware \nState College, was woefully inferior.\n  He next filed the public school racial segregation case, Belton v. \nGebhardt, Del. Ch., 87 A.2d 862 (1952), aff'd, Del. Supr., 91 A.2d 137 \n(1952). This was the only case ultimately affirmed by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Brown. Most Americans associate the name of Redding's \ndistinguished fellow NAACP attorney, Thurgood Marshall, with this \nschool desegregation case, since he achieved greatness as a U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice. And that's just how Redding preferred it. He \npreferred a lower profile, using his great skills to get the job done.\n  After the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, \nRedding dedicated his practice to implementing the desegregation order. \nIn 1956, he filed a class action suit in the federal District Court in \nDelaware seeking to compel a school district to establish a \ndesegregation plan. It took another twenty years for a court order \nforcing the implementation of this plan. Again, Redding persistently \nplodded along in the pursuit of justice.\n  Redding also set precedent in ending discrimination in public \naccommodations. In 1961, he won another U.S. Supreme Court case, \nrepresenting former Wilmington City Councilman William ``Dutch'' \nBurton, allowing blacks to eat at the same counter with whites at the \nEagle Coffee Shoppe owned by the Wilmington Parking Authority.\n  It is worth noting that Redding did not consider the U.S. Supreme \nCourt victories to be his greatest legal achievements. Instead, he said \nhis most significant accomplishment was desegregating Delaware's \ncourtrooms. In an interview in 1990, Redding said:\n\n       I suppose that really what I am most proud of . . . is my \n     undertaking years back to break up segregation in seating in \n     the courtrooms (of Delaware) . . . It was pretty horrible to \n     go into a courtroom and see blacks seated in one place and \n     whites in another. That's the way I found it when I came in.\n\n  Ironically, Redding was not particularly proud of his distinction as \nthe first African-American attorney in Delaware. In a \ncharacteristically, blunt, honest statement, Redding once said. ``How \ncan you boast about being the first when you realize it was the result \nof racism and antipathy?''\n  And Redding downplayed his role as a civil rights and civil liberties \npioneer. In a 1974 speech at Notre Dame University, he said: ``I am \njust a pedestrian, journeyman lawyer who happens to have been \npracticing in a state where the necessities of the situation made me \nparticipate in civil rights activities.''\n  The trails Redding blazed, however, set the course for those of us \nwho are humbled to follow in his footsteps.\n  On a very personal note, Louis Redding was one of my heroes. His \nleadership in the civil rights movement got me interested in politics. \nI first met him in 1969 when I was working as a young, public defender \nrepresenting many in the black community in civil and criminal cases.\n  And make no mistake about it--he commanded respect in the community \nand in the courtroom. In the black community, he respectfully was known \nas ``Lawyer Redding.'' Of course to me, it was never ``Lou,'' I always \nsaid ``Mr. Redding, Sir.'' Indeed, he was quite a presence in the \ncourtroom, with his tailored, conservative suits and button-down \nshirts. His standard was excellence, as he fought for the poorest and \nmost discriminated among us.\n  Fortunately for us, Louis Redding's legacy and spirit live on in our \ncommunity, and in his three daughters and five grandchildren. His name \nalso appropriately graces a middle school and the New Castle County/\nCity of Wilmington public building. His bronze statute stands erect \nsurrounded by young children in the pubic square as well.\n  Louis L. Redding, noted civil rights attorney, teacher, loyal son, \nfather, and grandfather--we will miss you greatly, and vow to keep your \nlegacy alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12570-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEREDITH BIXBY DONATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Meredith \nBixby of Saline, Michigan. Mr. Bixby is the father of the Meredith \nMarionettes Touring Company and is donating his collection of \nmarionette puppets to the Saline Culture and Commerce Center for \npermanent exhibit.\n  For more than forty years, Mr. Bixby toured with his Meredith \nMarionettes Touring Company across the Midwest and South staging shows \nin schools, theaters, and community centers. Each year nearly a quarter \nof a million children enjoyed the marionette magic Mr. Bixby brought to \nthem.\n  Mr. Bixby has been a leader in puppeteering for nearly five decades. \nHe is affectionately known as the ``Master of the Marionettes'' and \nbuilt his own marionettes and produced many original shows. He is also \none of the original founding members of The Puppeteers of America, \nwhich is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year.\n  This permanent exhibit is a cooperative effort of the Michigan \nCouncil for Arts and Cultural Affairs, the City of Saline, the Bixby \nProject Group, and Saline Area Chamber of Commerce. This exhibit will \npreserve the memory of Meredith Bixby's work and educate new \ngenerations of children of the art and entertainment of marionettes.\n  I once again congratulate Meredith Bixby for his years of providing \nquality entertainment and the gracious donation of his collection to \nthe community of Saline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12571-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12571-S12572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ROBERT F. DEASY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, communities are not defined by \nphysical borders. They are defined by people--people who are concerned \nfor the well-being of their neighbors, even if they do not know them. \nPeople who want to make their town a good place to raise children. \nPeople who recognize the importance of being a part of something larger \nthan themselves. Today, I want to speak about one such person who has \nworked tirelessly to make Rocky Hill, Connecticut a true community: \nRobert Deasy.\n  Bob Deasy worked for more than forty years as an accountant with \nTravelers and Phoenix Fire Insurance before retiring more than twenty \nyears ago. Throughout his life, Bob has been remarkably active in the \nRocky Hill community.\n  From 1973 to 1985, he served as Rocky Hill's registrar of voters, \nwhere he worked closely with the Secretary of State's office. He has \nalso been a member of American Legion Post 123 in Rocky Hill for more \nthan 30 years, and he served for eight years as the Post's commander. \nThrough the American Legion, he reached out to young people in the area \nby coordinating their Boys State and Girls State activities, which \nprovide young people with an opportunity to see how their government\n\n[[Page S12572]]\n\nworks. He also organized Rocky Hill's Memorial Day parade on many \noccasions, which earned him a citation from the city for exemplary \nservice.\n  In 1990, he was recognized for his outstanding service to the \ncommunity by the Wethersfield/Rocky Hill Elk's Club when they named him \ntheir ``Citizen of the Year.''\n  Bob also sat on the finance council at St. James Church for ten \nyears, where he helped to strengthen this important house of worship.\n  But even greater than his commitment to his church and his community \nis his devotion to his family. Bob has been a devoted husband to his \nwife Mildred and together they have raised three children, and they \nenjoy the company of five grandchildren.\n  Bob also possesses a passion for politics. He has been active in \nlocal Democratic politics for years, and I consider myself fortunate to \nhave had the opportunity to work with him and to become his friend. I \nam particularly thankful to Bob for encouraging his granddaughter Adria \nto become involved in public service. For the past four years she has \nworked in my Washington office. It has been a pleasure working with \nher, and she has only enhanced my already high opinion of the Deasy \nfamily.\n  This Friday, the Rocky Hill Democratic Town Committee will bestow \nupon Bob their Chairman's Award in gratitude for their work for the \nparty. This award is well deserved, and I congratulate Bob on this \nhonor.\n  But, as I stated earlier, Bob Deasy's devotion was not to a political \nparty, it was to a community. And thanks to Bob and people like him, \nRocky Hill, Connecticut remains a tightly knit community with its own \nidentity. It is a place with a strong sense of history that people are \nproud to call home. I thank Bob for all that he has done for the people \nof Connecticut, and I wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12571-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n A TRIBUTE TO DR. KENNETH JERNIGAN, PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF THE NATIONAL \n                        FEDERATION OF THE BLIND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a \nman who has dedicated his life to improving opportunities for others. \nHe is Dr. Kenneth Jernigan, who served as President of the National \nFederation of the Blind from 1968 to 1986 and as the Federation's \nPresident Emeritus until his death on October 12, 1998. In these \ncapacities, Dr. Jernigan has become widely recognized and highly \nrespected as the principal leader of the organized blind movement in \nthe United States.\n  On September 14, 1998, Mr. President, I was privileged to attend an \nespecially moving ceremony to recognize Dr. Jernigan for worldwide \nleadership in the development of technology to assist blind people. The \naward, consisting of $15,000 Canadian and a 2-ounce gold medallion, was \ngiven by the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and the event \nwas held at the Canadian Embassy here in Washington.\n  This recognition by our neighbors to the north was a tangible \nexpression, Mr. President, of the respect which Dr. Jernigan has earned \nthroughout his lifetime of service on behalf of blind people in the \nUnited States and around the world. Through his grit, determination, \nand skill, Dr. Jernigan achieved personal success. But more important \nthan that, as a lifetime teacher and mentor, he gave others the chance \nfor success as well.\n  Born blind in 1926, Kenneth Jernigan grew up on a small Tennessee \nfarm with little hope and little opportunity. But, Mr. President, in \nthe story of Kenneth Jernigan, from his humble beginning in the hills \nof Tennessee to his stature as a national--and even an international--\nleader, the story of what is right with American is told.\n  Dr. Jernigan may have been blind in the physical sense, Mr. \nPresident, but he was a man of vision nonetheless. In his leadership of \nthe National Federation of the Blind, he taught all of us to understand \nthat eyesight and insight are not related to each other in any way. \nAlthough he did not have eyesight, his insight on life, learning, and \nleading has no equal.\n  Mr. President, for those who knew him and loved him, for the blind of \nthis country and beyond, and for the National Federation of the Blind--\nthe organization that he loved and built--the world without Kenneth \nJernigan will be difficult. But the world he has left in death is a far \nbetter world because of his life.\n  The legacy which Dr. Jernigan has left is shown in the hundreds of \nthousands of lives that he touched and the lives that will still be \ntouched by his example and the continuing power of his teaching. This \nwill be the case for many generations to come. Mr. President, Kenneth \nJernigan will be missed most by his family and friends, but his loss \nwill be shared by all of us because he cared for all of us. He cared \nenough to give of himself. With the strength of his voice and the power \nof his intellect, he brought equality and freedom to the blind. As he \ndid so, Mr. President, Kenneth Jernigan taught us all to love one \nanother and live with dignity. That is the real and lasting legacy of \nKenneth Jernigan.\n  Mr. President, on September 24, 1998, an article entitled ``Friends \nPay Homage to Crusader for the Blind, Jernigan Still Working Despite \nLung Cancer'' appeared in the Baltimore Sun. Because it presents a \nfitting tribute to Dr. Jernigan's life and work, I ask to insert the \ntext of this article in the Record at this point.\n  The article follows.\n\n Friends Pay Homage to Crusader for the Blind, Jernigan Still Working \n                          Despite Lung Cancer\n\n                         (by Ernest F. Imhoff)\n\n       A steady stream of old friends--maybe 200 in the past \n     months--have been visiting Kenneth Jernigan at his home in \n     Irvington. Pals who followed the old fighter for the blind as \n     he tenaciously led fights for jobs, for access, for \n     independent living, for Braille, and for civil rights have \n     come to say thank you and goodbye to a dying blind man they \n     say expanded horizons for thousands of people. James Omvig, a \n     63-year-old blind lawyer, and his sighted wife Sharon flew \n     from Tucson, Ariz., to visit with the president emeritus of \n     the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), who is in the \n     latter stages of lung cancer. ``The wonderful life I've had \n     is all due to Dr. Jernigan,'' Omvig said. In the 1950s, he \n     ``was sitting around at home'' in Iowa, after learning chair-\n     making, until he met Jernigan and began studying Braille and \n     other subjects. Omvig then graduated from college, got a law \n     degree, became the first blind person hired by the National \n     Labor Relations Board and later developed programs for the \n     blind at Social Security in Baltimore, Alaska, and elsewhere.\n       One topic of conversation among the friends has been \n     Jernigan's latest project, a proposed $12 million National \n     Research and Training Institute for the Blind for NFB \n     headquarters in South Baltimore.\n       Last week, Larry McKeever, of Des Moines, who is sighted \n     and has recorded material for the 50,000-member federation, \n     came to chat and cook breakfast for the Jernigans. Donald \n     Capps, the blind leader of 58 South Carolina NFB chapters, \n     called to congratulate Jernigan on being honored recently at \n     the Canadian Embassy for his Newsline invention that enables \n     the blind to hear daily newspapers.\n       Floyd Matson, who is sighted and has worked with Jernigan \n     for 50 years, came from Honolulu to be with ``my old poetry \n     and drinking buddy.''\n       A dramatic example of the high regard in which blind people \n     hold Jernigan came during the annual convention of 2,500 NFB \n     members in Dallas in July. A donor contributed $5,000 to \n     start a Kenneth Jernigan Fund to help blind people.\n       Quickly, state delegations caucused and announced their own \n     donations. The result: pledges of $137,000 in his honor.\n       Jernigan, 71, who was born blind and grew up on a Tennessee \n     farm with no electricity, learned he had incurable lung \n     cancer in November. In the past 10 months, Jernigan has been \n     almost as busy as ever. He has continued projects such as \n     editing the latest in his large-type ``Kernel Book'' series \n     of inspirational books for the visually impaired. But his \n     focus has been the proposed four-story institute, for which \n     $1 million has been raised. It will house the nerve center of \n     an employment program; research and demonstration projects \n     leading to jobs and independent living; technology training \n     seminars; access technology, such as applications for voting \n     machines, airport kiosks and information systems; and Braille \n     literacy initiatives to reverse a 50 percent illiteracy rate \n     among visually impaired children.\n       In fighting for the blind, Jernigan has frequently been a \n     controversial figure. Before he moved to Baltimore in 1978, \n     the Iowa Commission for the Blind, which he headed, was the \n     subject of a conflict-of-interest investigation by a \n     gubernatorial committee. In the end, Gov. Robert Ray felt the \n     committee's report vindicated the commission. The governor \n     and the committee described the commission's program for the \n     blind as ``one of the best in the country.''\n       There are good things in everything, even this illness,'' \n     said his wife, Mary Ellen Jernigan. ``You expect to hear from \n     old friends. But in letters and calls, we hear from hundreds \n     of people we don't know.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12572-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12573]]\n                              PITNEY BOWES\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an \nimportant milestone by an important institution in my home state of \nConnecticut--Pitney Bowes. For the past 78 years, Pitney Bowes has been \nat the forefront of technological innovation. The postage metering \nmechanisms that the company patented more than seven decades ago have \nfaithfully performed their everyday task of metering postage.\n  Twenty years ago Pitney Bowes introduced a postage by phone system, \nwhich allowed businesses to refill their postage meters over the phone. \nThis technology has just passed a major milestone. Recently, Pitney \nBowes announced the signing of its one-millionth active postage by \nphone customer. Connecticut's Governor, John Rowland, was on hand to \ncommemorate this event and presented the company with a proclamation \nnoting that nearly three quarters of a billion dollars in time and \nlabor have been saved since the postage by phone system was \nimplemented.\n  Together with numerous mass mailing machines developed over the \nyears, Pitney Bowes has changed the face of commerce. They enabled mass \nmail marketing and created millions of jobs. Indeed, every member of \nthis body has had a campaign that depended on the mass mail systems \ndeveloped by Pitney Bowes.\n  However, Pitney Bowes is not just postage meters. It's not just \nfaxes, copiers, software, business services, financial services, or \ncryptographic security for cyberspace transactions and communications. \nIt is not just PC postage metering which makes it possible for \nbusinesses to print postage using only a PC and a standard printer. It \nis not just the $100 million in R it spends each year or the dozens \nof new patents that Pitney Bowes receives annually. It is not just \ncutting-edge technology.\n  The spirit of Pitney Bowes is found in its people. More than one \nmillion customers, mostly small businesses, use Pitney Bowes products \nto efficiently conduct their business. Tens of millions of our citizens \nbenefit from the company's mailing and messaging systems. More than \nthirty thousand employees--seven thousand of these in Connecticut--are \ndedicated to making all of our jobs easier. It is this spirit that has \nresulted in Pitney Bowes being repeatedly listed as one of the 100 best \ncompanies to work for in America, recognized as providing meaningful \nopportunities for women and minorities, and respected as a leader in \nthe Connecticut business community.\n  Congratulations to the Pitney Bowes workforce on this new \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12573-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DR.

Furchgott of the State University of New York Health Science \nCenter at Brooklyn on winning the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or \nMedicine.\n  Dr. Furchgott, along with Dr. Louis J. Ignarro of the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad of the University of \nTexas, were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discoveries of how \nnatural production of nitric oxide can mediate a wide variety of bodily \nactions. Those include the regulation of blood pressure, widening blood \nvessels, preventing the formation of blood clots, fighting infections, \nreducing sexual dysfunction, and functioning as a signal molecule in \nthe nervous system.\n  The bestowment of this prestigious honor to Dr. Furchgott brings long \noverdue recognition to the medical research conducted at ``SUNY \nDownstate''. I commend Dr. Furchgott and the entire staff of the State \nUniversity of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn for their many \ncontributions to the field of medicine.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article on Dr. Robert F. Furchgott from \nthe New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                Research Honor Goes to the Brooklyn Side\n\n                        (By Jennifer Steinhauer)\n\n       The State University of New York Health Science Center at \n     Brooklyn has always been a bit of an underdog among the \n     city's medically elite institutions. In spite of its \n     groundbreaking work in the study of AIDS, alcoholism and \n     other illnesses, kudos most often went to hospitals and \n     research centers on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, \n     like Mount Sinai and New York University.\n       But yesterday, SUNY Downstate, as the science center is \n     known, earned its boasting rights over Manhattan when Dr. \n     Robert F. Furchgott, a distinguished professor of \n     pharmacology there, received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or \n     Medicine, the highest recognition possible for a body of work \n     that most Americans would recognize only in the form of \n     Viagra.\n       Dr. Furchgott, 82, is in many ways a quintessential \n     representative of Downstate, which had never received that \n     Nobel Prize and is better known to most New Yorkers as the \n     college that provides doctors to Kings County Hospital \n     Center, one of the city's busiest and perhaps most embattled \n     hospitals.\n       Colleagues described Dr. Furchgott as modest, spending \n     nearly every day nibbling sandwiches and eating yogurt in his \n     office while poring over scientific journals, or toiling in \n     his laboratory, pondering the mysteries of nitric, pondering \n     the mysteries of nitric oxide.\n       ``His personal modesty stands in marked contrast to his \n     magnificent achievement,'' said Dr. Eugene B. Feigelson, the \n     college's dean of medicine. ``It is a source of pride for the \n     entire institution and to Brooklyn and is a further \n     distinction for us and for the State University of New \n     York.''\n       When asked to reflect on his honor, Dr. Furchgott seemed \n     almost dismissive. ``I was kind of surprised,'' he said in a \n     telephone interview from his home in Hewlett, N.Y. ``My work \n     is sort of old-fashioned pharmacology.\n       ``Is it the highlight of my career? I guess in a way, \n     though you don't do research to win prizes. You do it because \n     you're curious about what makes things tick.''\n       Sure, international attention, television cameras planted \n     on the front lawn, phone ringing off the hook with calls from \n     reporters struggling mightily to understand the subtleties of \n     his work--these things have tickled him.\n       But his favorite moment in his entire career, he said, \n     ``was when we discovered that endothelial cells were \n     necessary for relaxation of arteries.''\n       ``Then,'' he said, ``it was finding that the endothelium-\n     derived relaxing factor was nitric oxide. There have been \n     lots of fun things.''\n       He is, by admission of his admirers, a serious man of \n     research.\n       ``His lectures were dull, onerous and droning on,'' said \n     Eli A. Friedman, a distinguished teaching professor of \n     medicine at SUNY Downstate and a former student of Dr. \n     Furchgott. ``But the content of his work was profound and \n     inspiring. So if one could get past the fact that he was less \n     than electric competition for Jackie Gleason on television, \n     he was very exciting and moving.''\n       Dr. Furchgott, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry and is \n     a professor emeritus at Downstate, won his prize for \n     discoveries of new properties of nitric oxide. With \n     colleagues, he was able to demonstrate that the gas nitric \n     oxide can act as a messenger molecule that tells blood \n     vessels to relax and dilate, which lowers blood pressure. The \n     discovery was vital to developing the anti-impotence drug \n     Viagra.\n       In 1996, he won an Albert Lasker Award in basic medical \n     research, which is often a precursor award to the Nobel \n     Prize. ``Everyone here will walk a little straighter and hold \n     their head a little higher because he is here.'' Dr. Friedman \n     said.\n       Dr. Furchgott was born in Charleston, S.C., and received a \n     B.S. in chemistry from the University of North Carolina in \n     1937 and a doctorate in biochemistry from Northwestern \n     University in 1940.\n       When asked what else he would like known about his career, \n     Dr. Furchgott said: ``Nothing really. I would like to get \n     myself some lunch now.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12573-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12573-S12574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GRACE M. AMODEO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, communities are not defined by \nphysical borders. They are defined by people. People who are concerned \nfor the well-being of their neighbors, even if they do not know them. \nPeople who want to make their town a good place to raise children. \nPeople who recognize the importance of being a part something larger \nthan themselves. Today, I want to speak about one such person who has \nworked tirelessly to make Rocky Hill, Connecticut a true community: \nGrace M. Amodeo.\n  Born in Italy, Grace Amodeo has lived in Rocky Hill for 44 years. \nGrace is a political pioneer in this town. In 1971, she ran for Mayor \nof Rocky Hill and earned the nomination of the Democratic party, the \nfirst woman to ever do so. Although she didn't win, she did not let \nthat set-back deter her from actively serving her community throughout \nher life.\n  Grace Amodeo was a member of the Board of Education for eight years, \nand she served as the secretary for four years. A woman of strong \nfaith, she was a Eucharistic Minister at St.\n\n[[Page S12574]]\n\nJames Church. And Rocky Hill has known no stronger advocate on behalf \nof seniors. Grace was a long-time member of Rocky Hill Seniors and \nserved as their President from 1978 to 1980. She also served on the \nfundraising committee for the Senior Center. In fact, she was named \nRocky Hill's ``Senior of the Year'' in 1983.\n  Grace's contributions to the community are all the more remarkable \nwhen you consider that she and her late husband Tony also raised eight \nchildren.\n  In addition to possessing a commitment to her community, she had a \npassion for politics, as evidenced by her run for mayor. Grace has been \nactive in local Democratic politics for years, and I consider myself \nfortunate to have had the opportunity to work with her. This Friday, \nthe Rocky Hill Democratic Town Committee will bestow upon Grace their \nChairman's Award in gratitude for her work for the party. This award is \nwell deserved, and I congratulate Grace on this honor.\n  But, as I stated earlier, Grace Amodeo's devotion was not to a \npolitical party, it was to a community. And thanks to Grace and people \nlike her, Rocky Hill, Connecticut remains a tightly knit community with \nits own identity. It is a place with a strong sense of history that \npeople are proud to call home. I thank Grace for all that she has done \nfor the people of Connecticut, and I wish her all the best in her \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12573-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW SHEPARD AND HIS FAMILY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a young \nman who was wrongly, viciously struck down in the prime of his life. \nMatthew Shepard was an innocent, kind, young man pursuing his education \nand enjoying the life of a college student. Tragically, he is now a \nreminder of what happens when we do not stand up to hate and bigotry.\n  On Monday night in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, hundreds of \npeople from all walks of life came together to remember Matthew and to \ncall for action to end hate crimes. Many people in Washington were \noutraged and shared in our nation's sorrow. I was touched by this \nresponse and join with so many others in expressing my own deep sense \nof hopelessness. I know that this was not just an isolated incident. \nHate crimes are a real threat. We cannot be silent any longer.\n  A week ago today, I joined many of my Colleagues down at the White \nHouse in celebration of the signing of the Higher Education \nReauthorization Act. I was proud to be there to call attention to the \nimportance of this Act. I was proud that the legislation increased \nopportunities for young students and improved access to quality \neducation for all students. I thought about how important it was for us \nto be focused on the needs of young Americans and their families \nstriving to achieve a higher education.\n  I thought of the many college students and high school students I \nhave met who would benefit from these opportunities. I thought about my \nown college age children and the opportunities they would have. I knew \nthis was a big accomplishment.\n  Today, my thoughts are with another young college student who will \nnever experience the opportunities and improvements we worked so hard \nto achieve. My thoughts have gone from improving opportunities to how \nto prevent the terrible heartache that Matthew Shepard's family and \nfriends are now experiencing.\n  When I first heard of this horrible crime I immediately felt deep \nsympathy for Matthew's parents. How frightening it must have been for \nthem to fly half way around the world to be with their child who was \nalmost unrecognizable because of the violent attack he suffered. I \ncan't imagine the pain they must be experiencing. There are simply no \nwords that I could offer in comfort.\n  I then felt deep sorrow for the community and the University. To know \nthat those who committed this violent and hateful crime are part of \ntheir community must be unbearable. This community will never be the \nsame.\n  I now feel sorry for our nation. What we have lost? A young man with \nso much potential. What might Matthew Shepard have become? We know that \nhe was interested in political science and very interested in this \nfield of study. Could Matthew have become a U.S. Senator?\n  I think now that maybe Matthew can teach us all. We need to use this \ntragic and despicable crime to attack hate as we attack any other \ndisease that kills. We must treat hate crimes as the deadly threat that \nthey are and do more to prevent them. Hate is nothing more than a \ncancer that needs to be stopped.\n  S. 1529, Hate Crimes Prevent Act, offers us that opportunity. I am \npleased to have joined with many of my Colleagues in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation. The bill would expand the definition of a hate \ncrime and improve prosecution of those who act out their hate with \nviolence. No one beats a person to death and leaves them to die without \nbeing motivated by a deep sense of hate. This was no robbery. The \nmotive was hate.\n  The immediate response of local law enforcement officials illustrates \nwhy we need to strengthen federal Hate Crimes laws and why the Federal \nGovernment must take a greater role in ending this violence.\n  I urge all of my Colleagues to think about the many Matthew Shepard, \nwe have all met. Kind and hard working young adults. Let us act now to \nprevent any more senseless violence and deaths.\n  It is often said that from tragedy we can learn. Let us learn from \nthis tragic event and make a commitment that we will act on Hate Crimes \nPrevention legislation. Let our actions serve as a comfort to Matthew's \nparents and the hundreds of other parents who fear for their children.\n  There are so many tragedies that we cannot prevent. Another \nsenseless, brutal attack like the one experienced by Matthew is a \ntragedy that we cannot prevent. We spend millions of dollars a year \nseeking cures for deadly diseases that strike the young and old. We \nsimply cannot accept a disease that strikes without warning and takes \nthe life of a percious vulnerable child. We need to treat hate the \nsame. It cannot and will not be tolerated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12574-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12574-S12575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DESECRATION OF THE AMERICAN FLAG\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that we will not have the opportunity to vote before the \nend of this session on passage of S.J. Res. 40, the Constitutional \namendment to protect the flag of the United States.\n  Recently, the Majority Leader made a reasonable request for time for \ndebate and then a vote on this amendment. However, the minority \nunfortunately would not agree. There is not time for extended debate on \nthis issue in the last days of this session, but extended debate should \nnot be necessary.\n  We have considered this issue in the Judiciary Committee and on the \nSenate Floor many times in the past. In fact, we have been debating \nthis matter for almost a decade. I have fought to achieve \nConstitutional protection for the flag ever since the Supreme Court \nfirst legitimized flag burning in the case of Texas v. Johnson in 1989. \nWe have held numerous hearings on this in the Judiciary Committee, most \nrecently this past July.\n  In our history, the Congress has been very reluctant to amend the \nConstitution, and I agree with this approach. However, the Constitution \nprovides for a method of amendment, and there are a few situations \nwhere an amendment is warranted. This is one of them.\n  The only real argument against this amendment is that it interferes \nwith an absolute interpretation of the free speech clause of the First \nAmendment. However, restrictions on speech already exist through \nConstitutional interpretation. In fact, before the Supreme Court ruled \non this issue in 1989, the Federal government and the states believed \nthat flag burning was not Constitutionally-protected speech. The \nFederal government and almost every state had laws prohibiting flag \ndesecration in 1989.\n  Mr. President, flag burning is intolerable. We have no obligation to \npermit this nonsense. Have we focused so much on the rights of the \nindividual that we have forgotten the rights of the people?\n  During moments of despair and crisis in our history, our people have \nturned to the flag as a symbol of national unity. It represents our \nnation, our national ideals, and our proud heritage. It is much more \nthan a piece of cloth.\n\n[[Page S12575]]\n\n  One of the most vivid reminders of the importance of the flag is the \nBattle of Iwo Jima during World War II some 53 years ago. On the fourth \nday of the battle, after our troops fought their way onto the beaches \nand over dangerous terrain, six men raised a United States flag on the \nhighest ridge on Mount Suribachi. That was February 23, 1945, but the \nbattle raged on until March 15, 1945. During those weeks of fighting, \nthe flag served as an inspiration for our troops to keep pressing \nforward to victory.\n  Many times, American soldiers have put their lives on the line to \ndefend what the flag represents. We have a duty to honor their \nsacrifices by giving the flag the Constitutional protection it \ndeserves.\n  Since we will not be able to turn to this amendment in the closing \ndays of this session, this issue will have to wait for the next \nCongress. We must not be deterred. I am firmly committed to fighting \nfor this amendment until we are successful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12574-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that, after years \nof waiting, families facing the tragedy of alcohol-related birth \ndefects can finally expect a coordinated federal response to their \nneeds. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention \nand Services Act, which has been included as part of S. 1754, the \nHealth Professions Education Partnerships Act, will establish a \nnational task force to address FAS and FAE, and a competitive grant \nprogram to fund prevention and intervention for affected children and \ntheir families.\n  The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and \nServices Act was introduced as S. 1875 earlier this year and, with \ntoday's Senate passage, will be cleared for the President's signature. \nIt is a modest measure, but its implications--in terms of children \nsaved, families saved, and dollars saved--are dramatic.\n  Alcohol-related birth defects, commonly known as Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE), wreak havoc on the lives \nof affected children and their families. The neurological damage done \nby fetal exposure to alcohol is irreversible and extensive, \nundercutting normal intellectual capacity and emotional development. A \nchild with FAS or FAE may be unable to think clearly, to discern right \nfrom wrong, to form relationships, to act responsibly, to live \nindependently.\n  The complicated and debilitating array of mental, physical, and \nbehavioral problems associated with FAS and FAE can lead to continual \nuse of medical, mental health, and social services--as well as \ndifficulty learning basic skills and remaining in school, alarming \nrates of anti-social behavior and incarceration, and a heightened risk \nof alcohol and drug abuse. FAS is the leading cause of mental \nretardation in the United States.\n  And it is 100 percent preventable.\n  FAS is completely preventable, yet, each year in the United States, \nsome 12,000 children are born with FAS. The rate of FAE may be 3 times \nthat. Researchers believe these conditions are often missed--or \nmisdiagnosed--so the actual number of victims is almost certainly \nhigher.\n  The incidence of FAS is nearly double that of Down's syndrome and \nalmost 5 times that of spina bifida. In some Native American \ncommunities, one of every 100 children is diagnosed with FAS.\n  It has been more than 30 years since researchers identified a direct \nlink between maternal consumption of alcohol and serious birth defects. \nYet, the rate of alcohol use among pregnant women has not declined, nor \nhas the rate of alcohol-related birth defects. In fact, both are \nincreasing over time.\n  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported a sixfold increase in \nthe percentage of babies with FAS born between 1980 and 1995. This \nincrease is consistent with the CDC's finding that rates of alcohol use \nduring pregnancy, especially the rates of ``frequent drinking,'' \nincreased significantly between 1991 and 1995. These findings defy the \nSurgeon General's warning against drinking while pregnant as well as a \nstrongly worded advisory issued in 1991 by the American Medical \nAssociation urging women to abstain from all alcohol during pregnancy. \nClearly, we need to do more to discourage women from jeopardizing their \nchildren's future by drinking while pregnant.\n  In addition to the tragic consequences for thousands of children and \ntheir families, these disturbing trends have a staggering fiscal \nimpact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the \nlifetime private and public cost of treating an individual with FAS at \nalmost $1.4 million. The total cost in terms of health care and social \nservices to treat all Americans with FAS was estimated at $2.7 billion \nin 1995. This is an extraordinary and unnecessary expense.\n  We know FAS and FAE are not ``minor'' problems. They are prevalent; \nthey are irreversible; they are devastating to the victim and his or \nher family; and they are a drain on societal resources. We know the \nword is not getting out--or maybe it's not getting through--that \ndrinking alcohol during pregnancy is a tremendous and senseless risk. \nWe know children with FAS and FAE and their families are not receiving \nappropriate services, and we are all paying the consequences.\n  Given what we know about FAS and FAE, our governmental and societal \nresponse to date are clearly inadequate. With this legislation, we are \nfinally strengthening that response.\n  To the extent we can prevent FAS and FAE and help parents respond \nappropriately to the special needs of their children, we can reduce \ninstitutionalizations, incarcerations and the repeated use of medical, \nmental health and social services that otherwise may be inevitable. It \nmakes fiscal sense, but, far more importantly, it is what we need to do \nfor the children and families who suffer its impact.\n  The legislation we are sending to the President will establish a \nnational task force of parents, educators, researchers and \nrepresentatives from relevant federal, state and local agencies. That \ntask force will tell us how to raise awareness about FAS and FAE--how \nto prevent it and how to deliver the kinds of services that will enable \nchildren and adults with FAS and FAE, and their families, to cope with \nits devastating effects.\n  A national task force with membership from outside of, as well as \nwithin, the federal government is our best bet if we want to take a \nrealistic look at this problem and address it. The true experts on \nthese conditions are the parents and professionals who deal with the \ncause and effects of these conditions day in and day out. If we want to \nrespond appropriately, parents, teachers, social workers, and \nresearchers should have a place at the table. A national task force \nwill also provide the opportunity for communities to share best \npractices, preventing states that are newer to this problem from having \nto ``reinvent the wheel.''\n  In conjunction with the task force efforts, the Secretary will \nestablish a competitive grants program. This $25 million program will \nprovide the resources necessary to operationalize the task force \nrecommendations by supporting education and public awareness, \ncoordination between agencies that interact with affected individuals \nand their families, and applied research to identify effective \nprevention strategies and FAS/FAE services.\n  Mr. President, responding to the tragedy of alcohol-related birth \ndefects is an urgent cause. I'd like to thank the many concerned \nparents, researchers, educators, advocacy organizations and federal \nagencies for their invaluable input on this legislation. I am confident \nthis initiative will deliver profound benefits to the Nation, and I am \nthrilled to see us moving toward its enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12575-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12575-S12577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TUG AND BARGE SAFETY\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the managers of the \n1998 Coast Guard Authorization Act for their help in addressing an \nissue of great importance in Rhode Island: the safety of the tug and \nbarge industry. The managers' amendment to the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act that passed the Senate on Monday included a provision \nthat will strengthen the regulation of transportation of petroleum by \nbarges in the waters of the Northeast.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of Commerce Committee Chairman McCain,\n\n[[Page S12576]]\n\nRanking Member Hollings, Subcommittee Chairwoman Snowe, and Ranking \nMember Kerry for incorporating my provision into the bill.\n  I especially want to thank the cosponsor of the provision, Senator \nJoseph Lieberman of Connecticut, for his support. We have worked \nclosely on this issue for several years. Senator Dodd of Connecticut \nalso lent his support to the effort.\n  In order to understand why the Chaffee-Lieberman provisions are \nnecessary, you must go back to the 1996 disaster when the tug Scandia \nand barge North Cape grounded on the coast of Rhode Island. After the \naccident, the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, \nreported a bill to improve towing vessel safety, and important elements \nof the bill were included in the 1996 Coast Guard Authorization Act. My \nintent in enacting 1996 provisions was to improve safety in the towing \nindustry so as to prevent a repetition of a disaster like the 1996 \nScandia/North Cape spill in Block Island Sound.\n  In October, 1997 the Coast Guard issued rules to implement the 1996 \ntowing vessel legislation. I and others concluded that the proposed \nrules might not prevent a repetition of the Scandia/North Cape disaster \nand asked the Coast Guard to reconsider. The Coast Guard is now \nreworking the rules and expect to issue an interim final national rule \non anchoring and barge retrieval systems in November 1998. They will \nrepropose fire suppression regulations in January 1999.\n  Senator Lieberman and I also were concerned that the proposed rules \ndid not implement the recommendations of the Regional Risk Assessment \nTeam or ``RRAT,'' which forged a remarkable consensus among Coast Guard \nDistrict One, the States, the environmental community, and the \nregulated industry on rules, to improve safety and reduce risks in the \nwaters of the Northeast States.\n  The team was assembled by the Marine Safety Office in the First Coast \nGuard District shortly after the North Cape spill. The RRAT met for six \nmonths and, in February 1997, delivered a report with extensive \nregulatory recommendations. Regulations were proposed in the following \nareas: vessel manning, anchors and barge retrieval systems, voyage \nplanning, navigation safety equipment aboard towing vessels, enhanced \ncommunications, vessel traffic schemes and exclusion zones, lightering \nactivities, tug escorts, and crew fatigue.\n  The report was signed by the RRAT Steering Committee members: the \nChief of the Marine Safety Division of the First Coast Guard District, \nthe American Waterway Operators (on behalf of the regulated industry), \nSave the Bay (on behalf of environmental organizations), and the Rhode \nIsland Department of Environmental Management (on behalf of states \nparticipating in the RRAT).\n  The Coast Guard was deeply involved in the RRAT process. The First \nCoast Guard District facilitated RRAT meetings, prepared the agendas \nand minutes, and lent other administrative support to the effort. In \nJune 1997, the First Coast Guard District also forwarded its plan to \nimplement the RRAT recommendations to Coast Guard Headquarters.\n  It was the expectation of the state, environmental, and industry RRAT \nparticipants that the RRAT recommendations for regional regulations \nwould be included as a part of the rulemaking to implement the towing \nvessel safety provisions in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996. \nThis was a reasonable expectation based upon the level of Coast Guard \ninvolvement in the development of the consensus RRAT recommendations, \nwhich were then endorsed by the Coast Guard Officer charged with marine \nsafety in the RRAT study area.\n  Unfortunately, the regulations proposed by the Coast Guard in October \n1997, did not incorporate the RRAT's recommendations for regional \nregulations. It also rejected specific RRAT recommendations on anchor \nand emergency retrieval provisions. Subsequent inquiry by Senator \nLieberman and myself revealed that the Coast Guard did not have any \nfuture plan to issue the RRAT's recommended regulations.\n  This decision by the Coast Guard was simply not acceptable. In April \n1998, Senator Lieberman and I asked that the Coast Guard immediately \nissue the regional regulations. This same request was made by many \nothers in New England, including States environmental departments, \nregional and local environmental organizations, and private citizens in \nwritten comments, and at an April 9, 1998, hearing in Newport, Rhode \nIsland.\n  To its great credit, the Coast Guard has reevaluated its initial \nrejection of regional regulations. The Coast Guard has embraced the \nRRAT recommendations, and has been making admirable progress of \nimplementing the RRAT report. I am pleased to report that the Coast \nGuard will publish a proposed regional regulation in the Federal \nRegister today. Because of its proactive reponse to the concerns that \nSenator Lieberman and I raised, the Coast Guard is in position to meet \nthe aggressive deadlines in the Chafee-Lieberman provision in this \nyear's Coast Guard bill.\n\n  The Chafee-Lieberman provision, section 311 of the managers' \namendment to H.R. 2204, directs the Coast Guard to issue regulations \nfor towing and barge safety for the waters of the Northeast, including \nLong Island Sound. Section 311 directs the Coast Guard to give full \nconsideration to each of the regulatory recommendations made by the \nRRAT and explain in detail if any recommendation is not adopted.\n  Section 311 directly addresses anchoring and barge retrieval systems \non a regional basis only. It is my understanding the Coast Guard is \nplanning to issue a nationwide national interim final regulation on the \nanchor requirement by the end of November 1998. The amendment gives the \nCoast Guard the discretion to forego a regional requirement if the \nnational requirement for anchoring and barge retrieval are no less \nstringent than those required for the waters of the Northeast.\n  Though not a part of the Chafee-Lieberman provision adopted in H.R. \n2204, I wish to address the issue of fire suppression systems on \ntugboats. The fire on board the Scandia was the critical link in the \nchain of events that led to the grounding of the barge North Cape and \nthe resultant oil spill. It is my view that the October 1997 proposed \nrules badly missed the mark on this issue. The Coast Guard proposal did \nnot require a fire suppression system that would flood the engine room \nwith a gas to extinguish a serious fire. This is a fatal defect in the \nproposed rule, and is inconsistent with the 1996 Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act.\n  The Coast Guard's October 1997 proposal inferred a mandate ``to \nprevent casualties involving barges which are the result of a loss of \npropulsion of the towing vessel.'' The 1996 Coast Guard Authorization \nAct's actual mandate is quite explicit: ``The Secretary shall require * \n* * the use of a fire suppression system or other measures to provide \nadequate assurance that fires on board towing vessels can be suppressed \nunder reasonably foreseeable circumstances.'' This is a clear mandate \nthat onboard equipment be able to suppress reasonably foreseeable fires \nsuch as occurred on the Scandia.\n  The 1996 statute reflects Congress' judgment that the preferred \nalternative is to suppress a fire quickly enough so that damage is \nlimited and propulsive power can be restored if interrupted due to fire \nfighting efforts. A fixed fire suppression system is an option that any \nvessel master would desire if faced with an engine room fire that could \nnot be controlled by other means.\n  The proposed regulations used vessel size as a principal criterion, \nwhile failing to consider adequately any differential requirements \nbased on the ``characteristics, methods of operation, and nature of \nservice'' as required by the law, which intentionally omitted size from \nthe list of factors to consider.\n  Not all towing vessels are the same when considering the imposition \nof a requirement for a fixed flooding fire suppression system. \nSpecifically, tugboats like the Scandia which tow barges on the East \nCoast of the United States, are essentially seagoing vessels with \nsealable watertight doors and port holes. Tow boats operating on rivers \nand inland waterways are not designed for the same type of service. On \nthese inland vessels, engine rooms may be located on the main deck, and \nthey may have conventional doors and windows.\n  The proposed Coast Guard rule correctly noted that, looking at towing \nvessels as a whole, certain types of vessels are ``constructed with \nengine rooms that would not be sufficiently\n\n[[Page S12577]]\n\nair tight'' to be able to use a system that floods the space with a gas \nto extinguish an out-of-control blaze. This is certainly true in the \ncase of inland tow boats.\n  Tug boats designed for ocean service such as the Scandia, if they are \noperated in a prudent and seamanlike manner, do have the requisite \nwater and air tightness to use a fixed flooding fire suppression system \nto good advantage. Congress specifically required that the proposed \nregulations account for the variations within the commercial towing \nfleet.\n  My preference was to simply mandate a fire suppression system for \nocean-going tugboats in this year's Coast Guard bill. After hearing the \nconcerns raised by the Coast Guard and colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee, I will not pursue fire suppression changes this year. I look \nforward to the Coast Guard's new proposal on fire suppression, which is \ndue for publication in January 1999. I expect it will be a marked \nimprovement over the flawed October 1997 proposal.\n  In closing, I again thank my colleagues on the Commerce Committee for \naccommodating my concerns on this issue. I also want to thank the Coast \nGuard. They could have waited until section 311 became law before \nstarting on the regional regulations. Instead, the Coast Guard, by \nproposing the regional regulations this very day, has accelerated the \ndate when the Northeast will have the protection it deserves. Finally, \nI thank my long-time collaborator on oil spill issues, Senator Joseph \nLieberman of Connecticut, for his steadfast support in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12575-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DARE NOT SPURN RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the news from Russia remains grim. The \nTimes reported on Saturday:\n\n       Rocked by its worst harvest in 45 years and a plummeting \n     ruble, Russia appealed today for relief aid from the European \n     Union. It has also approached the United States and Canada \n     for help.\n\n  Clearly Russia is in a perilous--one could say dangerous--state. The \ngrain harvest is down almost 40 percent primarily because of a summer \ndrought in the Volga River and Ural regions. And the financial crisis \nin Russia has only added to the problems. For example the Times also \nreports that because payment has not been made ``15 ships full of \nAmerican frozen poultry have delayed unloading their cargo.''\n  What to do? For starters let's not repeat the mistakes of the past. \nFollowing the defeat of Germany in World War I, we failed to provide \naid to the Weimar Republic as it attempted to sustain a democratic \ngovernment. The resulting Nazi reign of terror was both devastating and \nunspeakable.\n  By contrast, following the defeat of the Nazis in World War II, we \nadopted the Marshall Plan to rebuild a democratic Germany. From 1948 to \n1952, the United States gave almost $3 billion a year to fund the \nMarshall Plan. A comparable contribution in round numbers, given the \ncurrent size of the United States economy, would be about $100 billion \na year for five years.\n  Recognize that Russia, no less than Nazi Germany, is a defeated \nnation--the latter on the military battlefield, the former on the \neconomic battlefield. To keep Russia on the road to democracy and \neconomic reform will require economic aid perhaps on the scale of the \nMarshall Plan. When you consider what we have been through, a post cold \nwar Marshall Plan does not seem excessive. Particularly since we were \nable to fund the Marshall Plan at the same time we were threatened by \nan empire that subscribed to the view that eventually the entire world \nwould succumb to communism.\n  The singular truth is that we were utterly unprepared for the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. During the 1980s we began a defense build \nup which resulted in the largest debt the United States has ever known. \nWhen the Soviet Union did collapse, we felt broke and unable to launch \nthe kind of economic assistance that we were able to do after World War \nII.\n  While we have provided some assistance, it falls far short of \nRussia's needs and lacks a coherent plan. Such a plan would include \ntechnical assistance on tax collections, operations of banks and stock \nexchanges, protection of property and individual rights to name just a \nfew areas that a country with little or no experience with democracy \nand free markets might find helpful. Let me emphasize: without real \nshort- and long-term financial assistance none of this technical \nassistance will be effective or, indeed, welcome.\n  But the United States cannot do it alone. What would make the \ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe more secure than any military \nalliance would be membership in the European Union. Unfortunately, our \nWestern European allies have not embraced their eastern neighbors in \nthis way.\n  Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has explained that to a certain extent, \nexpanding NATO served as a surrogate for EU enlargement. Roger Cohen \nreports Ambassador Holbrooke's remark in the International Herald \nTribune:\n\n       Almost a decade has gone by since the Berlin Wall fell and, \n     instead of reaching out to Central Europe, the European Union \n     turned toward a bizarre search for a common currency. So NATO \n     enlargement had to fill the void.\n\n  We seem to have stumbled into a reflexive anti-Russian mode. The \nUnited States continues to act as though the Cold War is still the \ncentral reality of foreign policy, withal there has been a turnover and \nwe now have the ball and it is time to move downfield. For instance, in \na Times story on Sunday about the selection of a trans-Caucus oil \npipeline, it was reported:\n\n       The Administration favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it \n     would pass through only relatively friendly countries--\n     Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey--and would bind them closer to \n     the West; because it would pull Azerbaijan and Georgia out of \n     the Russian shadow; and because it would not pass through \n     either Russia or Iran, both of which have offered routes of \n     their own.\n\n  Is ``binding'' Azerbaijan and Georgia closer to the West part of a \nflawed strategy of isolating Russia? We seem clearly headed in that \ndirection with the expansion of NATO. And ignoring George F. Kennan, \nwho lamented the Senate vote on NATO expansion in an interview with \nThomas L. Friedman. Commenting on the Senate debate, Ambassador Kennan \nstated:\n\n       I was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as \n     a country dying to attack Western Europe. Don't people \n     understand? Our differences in the cold war were with the \n     Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on \n     the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution \n     in history to remove the Soviet Regime.\n\n  We would do well to remember these words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12577-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12577-S12578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, about a year ago, the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, Senator Graham, and I introduced legislation (S. \n1252) to increase the amount of low-income housing tax credits \nallocated to each state to reflect inflation since 1986, and to index \nthis amount to reflect future inflation. Today, we have 64 additional \ncosponsors. In this time when the conventional wisdom is that \neverything is supposed to be so partisan in Washington, it is a very \ngood testament about the importance of the low-income housing tax \ncredit that S. 1252 has garnered the bipartisan support of two-thirds \nof the Senate.\n  I guess we should not be surprised about this support. The housing \ncredit has become an extraordinarily effective mechanism to encourage \nconstruction of affordable housing. Since its creation in 1986, the \nlow-income housing tax credit has successfully expanded the supply of \naffordable housing and helped revitalize economically distressed areas \nthroughout the United States. The credit has been responsible for \nalmost 900,000 units of housing in the past decade. Nearly all new \naffordable housing today (98%) is constructed with the help of the \ncredit. Without the credit, these units simply would not be available.\n  Credits are allocated to each of the states on a formula based on \npopulation: $1.25 multiplied by the number of people in the state. Each \nstate must adopt an allocation plan based on housing needs in that \nparticular state. Then private developers compete for allocation of the \nlimited amount of tax credit. This creates an environment where each \nstate can encourage the type and location of affordable housing it \nneeds. And the competition for limited amounts of credit means that the \nFederal Government gets more and better\n\n[[Page S12578]]\n\nhousing for each credit dollar. Effectively, the low income housing tax \ncredit is a block grant to each state, and each state uses market \ncompetition to maximize the amount and quality of the housing.\n  In March, 1997, after an 18 month study of the program, the General \nAccounting Office reported on the many achievements of the program \nwithout finding any problems in need of legislative correction. In \nfact, the GAO study concluded that families living in housing built \nwith the help of the credit had incomes that were lower than that \nrequired by statute.\n  Unfortunately, the amount of credit that can be allocated each year \nhas not been adjusted since the program was created in 1986. If the \ncredit had been indexed for inflation since it was first enacted, the \nper capita credit amount would be $1.85 this year.\n  Although building costs rise each year, as does the affordable \nhousing needs of the nation, the federal government's most important \nand successful housing program is in effect being cut annually as a \nresult of inflation. When the cap was first established, the credit \nwould fund 115,000 units. Now it will fund between 75,000 and 80,000 \nunits. Despite economic prosperity in recent years, the shortage in \naffordable housing has become more, not less, severe. According to HUD, \nthe number of households with crisis-level rental housing needs exceeds \n5 million.\n  I had hoped that we would have been able to see the enactment of S. \n1252 this year. Twelve years of erosion in value of the credit should \nbe enough. Unfortunately, it appears that this meritorious legislation \nwill have to wait until next year. It is not often that we can find a \nproposal that is supported by a bipartisan two-thirds of the Senate, a \nmajority of Republican governors, and a Democratic President. Given the \nneed for additional affordable housing, the effectiveness of the \ncredit, and its broad bipartisan support among elected officials at all \nlevels of government, I am very hopeful that we will be able to make \nthis legislation a priority tax item early next year when the new \nCongress convenes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12577-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12578-S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS BEING HELD HOSTAGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are currently 21 qualified nominees \non the Senate calendar who have been reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee. Ten of those nominations would fill judicial \nemergency vacancies, which have been without a judge for over 18 \nmonths. We have been trying for days, weeks, months and in some cases \nyears to get votes on these nominees.\n  The Majority Leader has yet to call up the nomination of Judge \nRichard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. That nomination was first received \nby the Senate back in January 1996, almost three years ago. His \nnomination was delayed at every stage and this is now the judicial \nnomination that has been pending the longest on the Senate Executive \nCalendar this year, seven months. Over the last few days the Majority \nLeader has repeatedly indicated that he would be calling up this \nnomination, but he has not done so.\n  I have heard rumors that some on the Republican side planned to \nfilibuster this nomination. I cannot recall a judicial nomination being \nsuccessfully filibustered. I do recall earlier this year when the \nRepublican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I noted how improper \nit would be to filibuster a judicial nomination. During this year's \nlong-delayed debate on the confirmation of Margaret Morrow, Senator \nHatch said: ``I think it is a travesty if we ever start getting into a \ngame of filibustering judges.'' Well, it appears that travesty was \nsuccessfully threatened by some on the Republican side of the aisle and \nkept the Majority Leader from fulfilling his commitment to call up the \nnomination for a confirmation vote.\n  Like the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights \nDivision, it appears that some on the Republican side have decided to \ntake the Paez nomination as a partisan trophy and to kill it--and to do \nso through obstruction and delay rather than allowing the Senate to \nvote up or down on the nomination.\n  Judge Paez and all 21 judicial nominations recommended to the Senate \nby the Judiciary Committee deserve better. They should be cleared for \nconfirmation without further delay. I note that of the 21 judicial \nnominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, 19 were reported \nunanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee over the last five \nmonths. Those judicial nominations which cannot be cleared by unanimous \nconsent ought to be scheduled for debate and a confirmation vote \nwithout further delay.\n  Let me put this in perspective: Most Congresses end without any \njudicial nominations left on the Senate Executive Calendar. The Senate \ncalendar is usually cleared of such nominations by a confirmations \nvote. Indeed the 99th, 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses all ended \nwithout a single judicial nomination left on the Senate calendar. The \nDemocratic Senate majority in the two Congresses of the Bush \nAdministration ended both those Congresses, the 101st and 102nd, \nwithout a single judicial nomination on the calendar.\n  By contrast, the Republican Senate majority in the last Congress, the \n104th, left an unprecedented seven judicial nominations on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar at adjournment without Senate action. And today, \nthis Senate still has 21 judicial nominations on its calendar. The goal \nshould be to vote on all judicial nominations on the calendar. To leave \nas many as seven judicial nominations without action at the end of this \nCongress is shameful; to be toying with the prospect of 21 is \nirresponsible.\n  In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused again on \nthe problem of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the \nvacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency \nvacancies and observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a \nconsiderable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final \nfloor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, \nwell under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: \n``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular \nnominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up \nor vote him down.''\n  That is good advice. That is what this Senate should do, take up \nthese nominations and vote them up or vote them down. I believe that if \nthe Senate were given an opportunity to have a fair vote on the merits \nof the nomination of Judge Richard Paez or Timothy Dyk or any of the 21 \njudicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar, they \nwould be confirmed. Perhaps that is why we are not being allowed to \nvote.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the \nnumber of judicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in \nthe federal judiciary.'' I have urged those who have been stalling the \nconsideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and \nwork to fulfil our constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or \nprevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are \nharming the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, \nincarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  We began this year with the criticism of the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court ringing in our ears: ``Vacancies cannot \nremain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of \njustice that traditionally has been associated with the federal \njudiciary.'' Nonetheless, instead of sustained effort by the Senate to \nclose the judicial vacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays \ncontinued and unjustified and anonymous ``holds'' become regular order.\n  To date, the Senate has actually been losing ground to normal \nattrition over the last two years. When Congress adjourned in 1996 \nthere were 64 vacancies on the federal bench. In the last 24 months, \nanother 87 vacancies have opened. And so, after the confirmation of 36 \njudges in 1997 and 48 so far this year, there has still been a net \nincrease in judicial vacancies. The Senate has not even kept up with \nattrition. There are more vacancies in the federal judiciary today than \nwhen the Senate adjourned in 1996.\n  This is without regard to the Senate's refusal to consider the \nauthorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary \nto deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, \nCongress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by\n\n[[Page S12579]]\n\nthe Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the \nCongress created judgeships during a Republican presidential \nadministration. Last year the Judicial Conference of the United States \nrequested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the \ncountry. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. \n678, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 120 vacancies \ntoday. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal \njudiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past two \nyears. In that light, the judicial vacancies crisis continues unabated.\n  In order to understand why a judicial vacancies crisis is plaguing so \nmany federal courts, we need only recall how unproductive the \nRepublican Senate has been over the last three years. More and more of \nthe vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for \nlonger periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified \nnominees for 23 of those judicial emergency vacancies, nominations that \nare still pending as the Senate prepares to adjourn.\n  When the American people consider how the Senate is meeting its \nresponsibilities with respect to judicial vacancies, it must recall \nthat as recently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority \nwas Democratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the \nRepublican Senate three years to reach the century mark for judicial \nconfirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session.\n  Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed \nto newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies \ncrisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to \nconsider nominees to longstanding vacancies.\n  No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved \nso far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements \nof the last two years that 48 judicial confirmations could be seen as \nan improvement. I recall that in 1992, during a presidential election \nyear and President Bush's last year in office, a Democratic Senate \nconfirmed 66 of his nominations.\n  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace. \nInstead, the Senate has confirmed only 48 judicial nominees instead of \nthe 84 judges the Senate would have confirmed had it maintained the \npace it achieved at the end of last year. The Senate has acted to \nconfirm only 48 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies \nthe federal judiciary experienced this year.\n  I know that some are still playing a political game of payback for \nthe defeat of the nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court and \nother Republican judicial nomination over the last decade. I remind the \nSenate that the Senate voted on the Bork nomination and voted on the \nnomination of Clarence Thomas and did so in each case in less than 15 \nweeks. To delay judicial nominations for months and years and to deny \nthem a vote is wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12578-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE IRISH PEACE PROCESS CULTURAL AND TRAINING PROGRAM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the passage of the Irish Peace Process \nCultural and Training Program Act is an important step to facilitate \nthe ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland and advance the goals of \nthe Good Friday Agreement of April 10, 1998. The legislation \ncontributes to this effort by providing the people of that strife-torn \nregion with new opportunities to achieve permanent peace and \nreconciliation.\n  This bill which authorizes a total of 12,000 residents of Northern \nIreland and the six border counties of the Republic of Ireland to come \nto the United States for up to three years for job training and \neducation.\n  Northern Ireland has an overall unemployment rate of 9.6 percent, and \nit is 13 percent in Belfast. The economy grew only three percent in the \nlast year. Economic stagnation and high unemployment disproportionately \naffect unskilled workers. The legislation reaches out to these \ndisadvantaged workers by giving many of them an opportunity to learn \nskills in the United States, which they will in turn take home to their \ncommunities in Northern Ireland and the border counties and use them \nproductively for their future.\n  One of America's greatest strengths is its diversity, and the \ndiversity of Northern Ireland can be a strength as well. A major goal \nof this legislation is to promote cross-community and cross-border \nunderstanding and build grassroots support for long-term reconciliation \nand peaceful coexistence of the two communities. Building on the \nsuccess of similar programs, this legislation will enable persons who \nhave lived amidst the conflict and bigotry of Northern Ireland to spend \ntime in communities in the United States where reconciliation works to \nachieve a strong and more just society. It is our hope that the \nexperience generated by this legislation produce long-lasting social \nand economic benefits for all the people of the borders and Northern \nIreland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12579-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADVANCEMENT IN PEDIATRIC AUTISM RESEARCH ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2263, the \nAdvancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act, introduced by Senator \nSlade Gorton. Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are \nbiologically-based, neuro-developmental diseases that cause severe \nimpairments in language and communication. This disease is generally \nmanifested in young children, sometimes during the first years of life.\n  Estimates show that 1 in 500 children born today will be diagnosed \nwith an autism spectrum disorder and that 400,000 Americans have autism \nor an autism spectrum disorder. The cost of caring for individuals with \nthis disease is estimated at $13.3 billion per year. Rapid advancements \nand effective treatments are attainable through biomedical research.\n  S. 2263 improves research on pediatric autism in the following areas: \nnetworks five Centers of Excellence combining basic research and \nclinical services; appropriates funds for an awareness campaign aimed \nlargely at physicians and professionals and designed to aid in earlier \nand more accurate diagnosis; appropriates monies for gene and tissue \nbanking, and funds current proposals at NIH in autism. Michigan \nfamilies who have been affected by autism or an autism spectrum \ndisorder have contacted my office in support of this legislation. They \nhave impressed upon me the need for better research into this disorder.\n  With three young children of my own, I too am concerned for millions \nof children afflicted with childhood diseases and birth defects. I have \nlong been committed to supporting policies that encourage research into \nthis and other afflictions, particularly those conditions that directly \nimpact children. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12579-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12579-S12580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RETENTION OF RECKLESSNESS STANDARD OF LIABILITY\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in the wake of final passage of S. 1260, \nthe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, I wish to emphasize my \ninterest in the retention and reinforcement of the recklessness \nstandard of liability and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals pleading \nstandard in federal securities fraud cases. Securities law experts, \nincluding officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission, have \nrecognized that the continued vitality of the federal securities laws \nand the health of the financial markets depend on the reaffirmation of \nthis standard.\n  It is essential that we be clear that reckless wrongdoing satisfies \nthe scienter standard under the federal securities laws. The current \nstandard that provides liability for reckless behavior should be \nexplicitly reaffirmed; any suggestion that a victimized investor must \nestablish actual knowledge by a defendant is not only legally incorrect \nbut would undermine the integrity of our financial markets. The SEC has \nrepeatedly stated in legal filings and Congressional testimony that the \nrecklessness standard is critical to investor protection. Every federal \nappellate court that has considered this issue has held that \nrecklessness suffices. The text of the 1995 Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act did not change the scienter standard; Members of \nCongress\n\n[[Page S12580]]\n\nunderstood that raising the standard would have not only a chilling \neffect on private actions by defrauded individuals, but on regulatory \nactions by the SEC.\n  Since the 1995 Reform Act, there has been some disagreement in the \ncourts about whether Congress intended to elevate the pleading standard \nin securities fraud class actions above the previously existing Second \nCircuit pleading standard. It is clear to me that the answer to the \nquestion must be ``no''. I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee \nReport on S. 1260, as well as the recorded colloquy on the Senate floor \nabout the Second Circuit pleading standard, reaffirm this point.\n  As I mentioned in my floor statement during debate on this \nlegislation, I am not convinced that the federal preemption of state \nanti-fraud protections is a necessary step. I support the right of \ninvestors to seek legal remedies against those persons selling \nfraudulent securities. While I worked to streamline the regulatory \nprocess in Georgia, I opposed amendments to federal regulations that \nwould have impaired the ability of a state to protect its investors. \nHere in the Senate, my focus remains the same. For this reason, I \nopposed S. 1260 during its initial Senate consideration. Nevertheless, \nif passage of this legislation is inevitable, let us at least make it \nabsolutely clear that an investor's right to seek redress through civil \nlitigation is not eliminated due to a failure to reaffirm the existing \nstandard of recklessness in federal securities fraud cases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12579-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12580-S12581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very important \nissue of education.\n  I am very disappointed that some Democrats in Congress and those in \nthe White House have chosen to demagogue and politicize education as we \nattempt to wind down our legislative year. These Democrats would like \nfor the American people to believe that Republicans just don't care \nabout education and that we are refusing to spend more money to improve \nour educational system.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Since I took office in 1995, I have seen a 27 percent increase in the \namount of money this Congress has appropriated for education. In 1994, \nwe spent $24.6 billion for education. For fiscal year 1999, we have \nproposed to spend $31.4 billion--exactly, I might add, that the \nPresident requested for discretionary spending. Historically, the \nfederal commitment to education has risen from $23.9 billion in 1959 to \nover $564 billion in 1996. As a percentage of GDP. educational \nexpenditures have risen from 4.7 to 7.4 percent over the same \ntimeframe.\n  For many Democrats, more money and more federal education programs \nare the answer to our Nation's education woes. Over the last few days, \nwe have heard Democrats lament how Republicans have held up all of the \nDemocratic efforts to provide funding for school construction and to \nreduce class size.\n  For these Democrats, more money is a surrogate for the structural \nreform that American education needs. Structural reform, change--this \nis what these Democrats fear. Instead, their response to crisis is more \nmoney and another federal program.\n  The last thing that we need is another federal program. Through my \nwork as the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Education Task \nForce, I discovered that there are approximately 552 federal education \nprograms. The Department of Education administers 244 of these \nprograms, and EVEN IF you count only those ``providing direct and \nindirect instructional assistance to students in kindergarten through \ngrade 12,'' the GAO found that there are still 69 programs.\n  Among these programs, overlap is pervasive. In my office, we call \nthis chart the ``spider web chart.'' This chart, prepared by the GAO, \nshows that 23 federal departments and agencies administer multiple \nfederal programs to three targeted groups: teachers, at-risk and \ndelinquent youth, and young children. For early childhood, for example, \nthere are 90 programs in 11 agencies and offices. In fact, one \ndisadvantaged child could be eligible for as many as 13 programs.\n  In addition, the effectiveness of many of these programs is doubtful \nor unknown. The GAO has expressed concern that the Department of \nEducation does not know how well new or newly modified programs are \nbeing implemented, or to what extent established programs are working. \nThe efficacy of Title I also remains uncertain.\n  Lastly, it should come as no surprise that so many programs and so \nmuch confusion comes at great cost. Critics of the education \nestablishment note that although federal funds make up only 7% of their \nbudgets, they impose 50% of their administrative costs. As one concrete \nexample, Frank Brogan, Florida's Commissioner of Education, has \nreported that it takes 297 state employees to oversee and administer $1 \nbillion in federal funds. In contrast, only 374 employees oversee \napproximately $7 billion in state funds. Thus, it takes six times as \nmany people to administer a federal dollar as a sate dollar.\n  Brogan went on to say:\n\n       We at the State and local level feel the crushing burden \n     cased by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and \n     mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to \n     administer inflexible, categorical Federal programs that \n     divert precious dollars away from raisin student achievement. \n     Many of these Federal program typify the misguided, one-size-\n     fits-all command and control approach. Most have the \n     requisite focus on inputs like more regulations, increasing \n     budgets, and fixed options and processes. The operative \n     question in evaluating the effectiveness of these programs is \n     usually: How much money have we put into the system?\n\n  Cozette Buckney, Chief Education Officer, of the Chicago \nschool system echoed the sentiments of many state and local officials:\n\n       Excessive paperwork is a concern. Too many reports, the \n     time lines for some of the reports, the cost factor involved, \n     the administrative staff just do not warrant that kind of \n     time on task. That is taking from what we need to do to make \n     certain our students are achieving and our teachers are \n     prepared.\n\n  Senator Wyden and I introduced legislation to help with this \nregulatory tangle and untie the hands of states and localities. Our Ed-\nFlex expansion bill would expand to 50 states the enormously popular \n``Ed-Flex'' demonstration program that has already been ``field-\ntested'' and proven successful in 12 states.\n  Ed-Flex frees responsible states from the burden of unnecessary, \ntime-consuming Washington regulations, so long as states are complying \nwith certain core federal principles, such as civil rights, and so long \nas the states are making progress toward improving their students' \nresults. Under the Ed-Flex program, the Department of Education \ndelegates to the states its power to grant individual school districts \ntemporary waivers from certain federal requirements that interfere with \nstate and local efforts to improve education. To be eligible, a state \nmust waive its own regulations on schools. It must also hold schools \naccountable for results. The 12 states that currently participate in \nEd-Flex have used this flexibility to allow school districts to \ninnovate and better use federal resources to improve student outcomes.\n  I would also like to add that educational flexibility should extend \nbeyond teaching techniques, curricula, and the rest of what happens in \npublic school classrooms. It should reach to the management of those \nschools. One of the most important lessons about the prospective \nchanges in education operations is the realization that decentralized, \non-the-spot leadership by principals and other administrators is \ncrucial to the success of a school.\n  Unfortunately, many of America's school systems are frozen into \nmanagerial patterns that reward conformity and discourage independent \nleadership. American business has had to make structural adaptations to \nmeet the challenge of the world market and international competition. \nTop-heavy managerial structures have given way to more flexible--and \ntherefore more responsive--ways of engaging the work force in team \nefforts. The result has been greater productivity and enhanced quality.\n  That is a good example of the kind of adaptation our schools can \nmake, to free up the enormous resources of talent and commitment both \namong teachers and in the ranks of administrators at all levels.\n  Republicans would like to stick with this strategy of untying the \nhands of\n\n[[Page S12581]]\n\nstates and localities and giving states and local school districts more \nflexibility. Rather than create another 2 or 3 entitlement programs \nthat are prescriptive and inflexible, we believe that we should allow \nstates to use additional federal monies in whatever manner the state \ndetermines the additional money can best be used.\n  For some states, this may very well be for school construction. For \nothers, it may be for hiring more teachers. But for others, it may be \nfor wiring every school, or for putting more computers in the \nclassroom. Some states may decide that they need the money for teacher \ntraining, to improve the teachers that they already have in the \nclassrooms.\n  The point is--how do we in the federal government know better than \nthose in the states and local communities--and parents--what their \nstudents need the most? The answer is that we don't.\n  Some in Washington argue that by allowing states the flexibility to \nuse federal money in the best way state officials see fit removes \naccountability from the equation. But to whom are state and local \nofficials more responsive--the sprawling federal bureaucracy or local \nteachers, parents and residents?\n  This Congress has actively addressed federal education. We had \nlengthy and thoughtful debate on a variety of education initiatives \nduring consideration of the Coverdell Education Savings Accounts bill. \nWe passed the Coverdell bill to allow parents to save more of their own \nmoney for use in paying educational expenses including, but not limited \nto, computers, school uniforms, tutors, textbooks or tuition.\n  The President vetoed the Coverdell bill.\n  This Congress has passed the Higher Education Amendments and made \ngreat strides in improving teacher quality.\n  Just a few days ago, we passed the Charter School bill to support \ncharter schools which are given more flexibility and freedom from \nburdensome state and federal regulations. I am encouraged by the \nsuccess of charter schools in the states that have them, and remain \nhopeful that when all 50 states have increased flexibility with Ed-\nFlex, that similar gains may be seen in the regular public schools. If \ncharter schools are successful, we must give our regular public schools \nthe same freedoms and opportunities to improve student achievement that \nwe have given charters.\n\n  In closing, my colleagues have heard me many times discuss the poor \nstate of our American education system. In recent international \ncomparisons, we have performed abysmally--scoring in the middle of the \npack or at the very bottom depending on the age category and subject \ntested.\n  Washington should not, however, rush to address this crisis by \ncreating new programs with new mandates on parents and teachers, \nschools and localities. The last thing that our schools need is more \nbureaucracy and federal intrusion. Instead, what Washington should and \ncan do is to free the hands of states and localities and to support \nlocal and state education reform efforts. When localities find ideas \nthat work, the federal government should either get out of the way or \nlend a helping hand.\n  I applaud the efforts of those on both sides of the aisle who are \nfighting for education. This is not a partisan issue. Witness my \nefforts with Senator Wyden on Ed-Flex--a bill that is also supported by \nSenators Kerrey, Ford, Glenn, and Levin on the Democratic side and more \nthan a dozen senators on the Republican side. Most of us here in the \nSenate are parents and we all want what is best for our children--and \nall children.\n  But let's not let extremist Democrats, who are hostage to the old \norder, paint the Republicans as the Grinches who stole Christmas for \nAmerica's school children. It is extremist Democrats, with their well-\nintentioned but completely misguided approach of throwing more money \ninto the federal education abyss and adding more and more programs to \nthe already complex maze of federal education programs, who are short-\nchanging the future of America's students.\n  The temptation for too many of us is to measure our commitment to \neducation by the size of the federal wallet. But let's not just throw \nmoney at our problems. Let's not just create more of the same old tired \neducation programs.\n  Let's focus on results. Let's give parents and local school boards \ncontrol of schools, and empower them to chart a course that improves \nstudent outcomes. Let's allow States to decide how they can best \nutilize increased federal resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12580-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12581-S12582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHIAPAS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof S. Con. Res. 128, introduced last week by the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Leahy]. I believe that this resolution is both timely and \nimportant.\n  This resolution calls on the Secretary of State to take a number of \nsteps to foster improvement in the human rights situation in Mexico and \nto end the violence in the state of Chiapas. These steps include \nensuring that any assistance and exports of equipment to Mexican \nsecurity forces are used primarily for counter-narcotics and do not \ncontribute to human rights violations, encouraging the Mexican \ngovernment to disarm paramilitary groups and decrease the military \npresence in Chiapas, and encouraging the Mexican government and the \nZapatista National Liberation Army to establish concrete conditions for \nnegotiations for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Chiapas.\n  Mr. President, allow me to just review briefly what is going on in \nChiapas today. Just over four years ago, in January 1994, the Zapatista \nNational Liberation Army, an organization of peasant and indigenous \npeoples seeking political and social changes, launched an uprising by \nseizing four towns in the Chiapas region of southern Mexico; fighting \nin the region resulted in nearly 100 deaths. Although the Mexican \ngovernment initially countered the rebellion by sending troops to the \nregion, issuing arrest warrants for all Zapatista leaders, and creating \na new military zone near the site of the Chiapas rebellion, Mexican \nPresident Ernesto Zedillo subsequently canceled the arrest warrants, \nordered the cessation of all offensive actions against the Zapatista \nArmy, and called for dialogue between Zapatista leaders and the Mexican \ngovernment. Since August of 1995, the Zapatistas have participated \nintermittently in peace negotiations with the Mexican government.\n  Last December, 45 indigenous peasants in the village of Acteal, \nChiapas, were killed by armed men reportedly affiliated with President \nZedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Following this \nincident, President Zedillo appointed a new Minister of Government and \na new peace negotiator for Chiapas, the Governor of Chiapas resigned, \nand Mexican authorities arrested more than 40 people in connection with \nthis incident, including the mayor of a nearby town.\n  These incidents renewed calls for peace in Chiapas. The Zapatistas \nrejected legislation submitted to the Mexican Congress by President \nZedillo in March 1998 to promote indigenous rights in Chiapas. \nPresident Zedillo visited the region several times in mid-1998 to \npromote dialogue, but the talks fell apart after the June 1998 \nresignation of Bishop Ruiz from the mediation commission, and the \ncommission subsequently dissolved. In July 1998, the Zapatistas \nadvanced a proposal for mediation and for a Mexican plebiscite on \nPresident Zedillo's indigenous rights legislation.\n  But, Mr. President, efforts for dialogue between the Mexican \ngovernment and the Zapatistas have been largely fruitless, and the \nviolence continues. I am deeply troubled by this situation.\n  I am also deeply troubled by the cool reception that the Mexican \ngovernment has given to some international human rights observers, \nincluding people from my home state of Wisconsin. Many of these \nindividuals have worked tirelessly from the beginning of the Chiapas \nconflict to help organize humanitarian assistance for the indigenous \npeoples of the troubled region. Some of these individuals feel that \nthere has been a concerted effort by the Government of Mexico to keep \nforeigners out of the region in order to limit this kind of \nhumanitarian assistance and to limit the ability of outsiders to \nmonitor and report on the human rights situation there. Many\n\n[[Page S12582]]\n\nhumanitarian workers have been detained for long periods of time and \nsummarily deported from Mexico.\n  The deficient reception of humanitarian workers in Chiapas casts \ndoubt on the sincerity of the Mexican Government when it says it wants \nto work with the United States and others to control drug trafficking \nor to enter into end-use monitoring agreements on the transfer of \nmilitary equipment.\n  Mr. President, I believe the United States has an obligation to be an \nadvocate for human rights protections around the world. I am not \nconvinced that the Mexican National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH), \nwhich was established in 1990, has done enough to prevent continuing \nviolations by Mexican law enforcement officials and the Mexican \nmilitary. I believe the United States must make human rights a top \npriority in our relations with Mexico, and I do not believe Mexico can \nreach stability without permitting its citizens to exercise their basic \nrights. In light of the proximity of Mexico to the United States and \nthe myriad ties between our two countries, we have a clear interest in \nworking to ensure that human rights are respected in Mexico.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S.Con.Res. \n128, which, in my view, will further call attention to the on-going \nhuman rights abuses in Chiapas. I hope that the Administration will \nactively work to put human rights at the very top of our priority list \nwith respect to Mexico, and that the Mexican government will take \nconcrete steps to end the violence in Chiapas and to respect the rights \nof all Mexican citizens and international visitors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12581-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BRIBERY IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention an excellent editorial published by the Washington Post on \nWednesday, October 7, 1998 concerning the OECD Convention on Combating \nBribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business \nTransactions.\n  This convention seeks to establish worldwide standards for the \ncriminalization of the bribery of foreign officials to influence or \nretain business. Just over 20 years ago the Congress passed the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. This landmark legislation, which I am \nproud to say was sponsored by one of Wisconsin's most respected elected \nofficials, Senator William Proxmire, was enacted after it was \ndiscovered that some American companies were keeping slush funds for \nmaking questionable and/or illegal payments to foreign officials to \nhelp land business deals.\n  For these 20 years, the FCPA has succeeded at curbing U.S. corporate \nbribery of foreign officials by establishing extensive bookkeeping \nrequirements to ensure transparency and by criminalizing the bribery of \nforeign officials.\n  The OECD treaty, which passed the Senate unanimously earlier this \nyear, would bring most of our major trading partners up to the same \nstandards that U.S. companies have been exercising since the FCPA \nbecame law.\n  Mr. President, I consider this treaty, and the implementing \nlegislation, S. 2375, that accompanies it, to be important work of the \nCongress. However, as the Washington Post noted in its editorial, the \nHouse of Representatives has yet to pass this legislation.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which had \nthe responsibility to recommend the Senate provide its advice and \nconsent on this treaty, I hope the House will move quickly to pass the \nimplementing legislation prior to adjournment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the October \n7, 1998, Washington Post editorial be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 7, 1998]\n\n                         A Vote Against Bribes\n\n       Its not every day that Congress has an opportunity to pass \n     legislation that has no down side whatsoever, that can only \n     help the United States and U.S. businesses; that fulfills a \n     demand Congress itself made 10 years ago; and that--perhaps \n     rarest of all--has the ardent support of both President \n     Clinton and Sen. Jesse Helms. The House has such an \n     opportunity now, with a bill to implement an international \n     treaty combating bribery overseas. Yet, perhaps not \n     surprisingly, even this universally acclaimed legislation is \n     no longer a sure thing.\n       More than 20 years ago, Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt \n     Practices Act, which outlawed the paying of bribes by U.S. \n     business executives to win foreign contracts. It was and \n     remains a good law, and by most accounts it has had a \n     beneficial effect on how Americans do business. But it's also \n     put them at a competitive disadvantage to European and other \n     companies that not only aren't prohibited from paying bribes \n     but in many cases can deduct the payoffs from their taxes. \n     The administration estimates that U.S. industry may lost $30 \n     billion worth of contracts each year for its honesty.\n       The Clinton administration last year negotiated a treaty \n     with other major industrial countries that would essentially \n     extend the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to all of them. \n     Instead of the United States lowering its standards, long \n     years of diplomacy finally persuaded Europeans to raise \n     theirs. The Senate unanimously ratified the treaty, citing \n     what Sen. Helms called an ``urgent need to push--and I use \n     that word advisedly--to push our European allies'' to \n     criminalize bribery overseas. Now the House must make U.S. \n     law consistent with the treaty. No one is against this. But \n     the press of business may put the bill in danger.\n       This may seem less urgent than other matters awaiting \n     congressional action. But corruption is at the root of the \n     financial crisis sweeping the world. Rich countries are good \n     at telling their poor counterparts to behave; here is a \n     change to show that the rich are willing to police \n     themselves, too. For the United States, which has been doing \n     such policing for two decades, this is a no-lose proposition. \n     But if Congress doesn't approve the treaty, Europe and Japan \n     won't either. The House should pocket this win before it's \n     too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12582-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER YEAR 200 RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, about two weeks ago, a list of medical \ndevice companies was printed in the Congressional Record which \nindicated they were non-responsive to The Food and Drug \nAdministration's request for Year 200 compliance status.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Medical Technology Caucus, I believe it is \nimportant my colleagues have the latest on manufacturers which have \nbeen responsive to the FDA's request for information on the Year 2000 \ncompliance status of their products Companies were asked by the FDA to \nindicate in their response the following:\n  The medical devices marketed and have sold are not Year 2000 \nvulnerable; medical devices marketed and sold are all year 2000 \ncompliant; the manufacturer is providing specific information regarding \nthose products which are not compliant or their assessment is currently \nincomplete; or the manufacturer is working on an assessment and will \npost the results.\n  Mr. President, there are many sectors of our economy which still need \nto address the potential for problems in the year 2000, but I am \npleased that a vast majority of medical device companies in the United \nStates have responded to the FDA on year 2000 compliance status and \ndeserve to be recognized for having done so.\n  I would like to mention specifically thirteen companies mistakenly \nlisted in the Congressional Record as being unresponsive to the FDA's \nrequest. These manufacturers have responded to the FDA's request for \nYear 2000 compliance status: Apothecary Incorporated, Augustine Medical \nIncorporated, Braemar Corporation, Dantec Medical Incorporated, \nDiametrics Medical Incorporated, Keomed Incorporated, Medtronic PS \nMedical Medtronic Bio-medicus, Medtronic Neurological, Prime Ideas \nIncorporated, Puritan Bennett Corporation, Timm Research Company, and \nWilliams Sound Corporation.\n  Mr. President, while this list only represents companies based in \nMinnesota, the FDA has compiled a much larger listing of companies \nwhich are or have addressed year 2000 issues on their website located \nat www.fda.gov.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12582-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12582-S12583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 105th Congress is nearing its \nconclusion. As we look over the past two years of this Congress, one \nissue that consumed hours of effort and debate, exposed problems that \nstrike at the heart of our government, and whose ramifications are \nnothing less than a cancer eating at the body politic, remains \nunresolved. I'm talking about campaign finance reform.\n  In January 1997, this Congress launched multiple investigations into \nevents associated with the 1996 federal elections. Dozens of hearings \nwere held,\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\nand the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee issued a 9,575 page \nreport. Bipartisan legislation addressing the major issues was \nintroduced and debated on the floor of the Senate and the House. \nMajorities on both sides of the Capitol voted in support of reform, to \nstrengthen federal election laws. In the Senate, a majority supported \nthe McCain-Feingold bill. In the House, a majority voted for the Shays-\nMeehan bill. Both bills sought to ban soft money, treat phony issue ads \nas campaign ads they are, strengthen disclosure, and streamline \nenforcement. Despite majority support in both Houses, we are ending \nthis Congress without major campaign finance reform.\n  It is a tragedy. Given the controversy and criticisms following the \n1996 elections, the failure to enact meaningful campaign finance reform \nis unjustifiable, it is inexplicable, and it is wrong.\n  As many of us have said repeatedly, the problem with the 1996 \nelections is that the vast majority of the conduct most loudly \ncondemned was not illegal--it was legal. Most involved soft money--the \nsolicitation and spending of undisclosed and unlimited election-related \ncontributions, despite laws now on the books requiring federal campaign \ncontributions to comply with strict limits and be disclosed. Virtually \nall the foreign contributions so loudly condemned involved soft money. \nVirtually every offer of access to the White House or the Capitol \nBuilding or to the President or the leadership of the Senate or the \nHouse involved contributions of soft money.\n  Opponents of campaign finance reform contend that soft money is not a \nproblem and that the laws on the books do not need reform, but the \ntruth is that legal limits which once had meaning have been virtually \nswallowed up by the loopholes. The limits on individual, corporate and \nindividual contributions have become a sham. Campaign contribution \nlimits, for all intents and purposes, do not exist.\n  The law now states, for example, that no one may contribute more than \n$1,000 per election to a candidate; no one may contribute more than \n$20,000 per year to a political party; and corporations and unions may \nnot make federal campaign contributions at all except through a PAC. \nBut the soft money loophole makes these limits meaningless. For \nexample, under the current system, a corporation, union or individual \ncan give $1 million to a candidate's party and have that party televise \nso-called issue ads in that candidate's district during the election, \nusing an ad that is indistinguishable from candidate ads which have to \nbe paid for with regulated funds. That's exactly what is happening. In \nthe 1998 elections, for example, the Republican National Congressional \nCommittee is conducting a $37 million advertising effort dubbed \n``Operation Breakout'' in which the party runs television ads in areas \nwhere there are close Congressional races, claiming that the ads \ndiscuss issues and are not efforts to elect or defeat the candidates \nthey mention by name. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \nis spending $7 million on similar issue ads. These multi-million dollar \nadvertising efforts by both parties demonstrate how the loopholes have \neffectively erased the campaign limits.\n  Other, more fundamental problems with current law are illustrated by \na recent court decision, issued October 9th in the Charlie Trie \nprosecution, holding that the law as currently worded does not prohibit \nsoft money contributions by foreign nationals.\n  The plain truth is that the federal election laws now on the books \nare too often unenforceable. While the Republican leadership rails at \nthe Attorney General for not doing more and threatens her with \nimpeachment for not appointing an independent counsel to investigate \nthe 1996 federal elections, they simultaneously block efforts to \nclarify and strengthen the very laws that they say they want her to \nenforce.\n  The soft money loophole exists, because we in Congress allow it to \nexist. Foreign involvement in American election campaigns exists, \nbecause we in Congress allow it to exist. Phony issue ads exist, \nbecause we in Congress allow them to exist. Weak enforcement of \ncampaign laws continues, because we in Congress allow the current \nloophole-ridden statutes to continue on the books unchanged.\n  It is long past time to stop pointing fingers at others and take \nresponsibility for our share of the blame for this system. We alone \nwrite the laws. Congress alone can close the loopholes and reinvigorate \nthe Federal election laws.\n  We could have made significant progress during this Congress. The \nHouse passed meaningful campaign finance reform. The majority of the \nSenate voted to do the same, but the Republican leadership brought \nsufficient pressure to bear so that the chief sponsor of the \nlegislation in the Senate, Senator McCain, withdrew his reform \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill. We had 52 votes in favor \nof his amendment to include the McCain-Feingold legislation in that \nbill. But rather than allow the majority to prevail, the Republican \nleadership sank the campaign finance reform effort. And when Senator \nFeingold announced his intention to offer the same amendment again to \nforce another vote, the leadership chose to pull the Interior bill from \nthe Senate floor. And since the Interior appropriations bill was pulled \nfrom the Senate floor in September, there has been no must-pass bill on \nthe Senate floor that supporters could seek to amend to forward the \ncampaign finance reform effort.\n  Instead the Interior bill, along with a number of other \nappropriations bills, have been folded into a so-called omnibus \nappropriations bill. That means that anyone who wants to enact campaign \nfinance reform by amending the omnibus spending bill would be forced to \nhold up almost all government appropriations--essentially to shut down \nthe government--in order to debate the issue.\n  The question is whether these strong-arm tactics will prevail. \nWhether, given the obstacles thrown in the path of campaign finance \nreform, we give up this fight or whether we continue to press on. \nSenators McCain and Feingold have said publicly that they will be back \nin the next Congress to fight for reform. I plan to stand with them. I \nbelieve the stakes are nothing less than the integrity of our electoral \nsystem.\n  The time is over for empty rhetoric about the 1996 campaign and the \nneed for stronger enforcement of the campaign laws already on the \nbooks. The laws now on the books are too often unenforceable, and \neveryone knows it. It is time to wipe away the crocodile tears and see \nclearly what the American people see. Campaign finance reform is long \noverdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12582-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12583-S12586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are now in the closing days of this \ncongressional session. A lot is happening in these final hours. With \nthe clock ticking we almost always knuckle down and get things done. \nBut it has become clear that one thing that this Congress will not do \nbefore it adjourns is pass meaningful campaign finance reform.\n  Today I want to serve notice that this fight is not over. If the \npeople of Wisconsin in their wisdom send me back to this chamber next \nyear, the Senate will hear about campaign finance reform again and vote \non campaign finance reform again because our democracy has been made \nsick by the corrupting influence of big money, and the future of our \ncountry is at stake.\n  And Mr. President, this fight will continue regardless of what I say. \nBecause the fight for campaign finance reform is bigger than any one \nSenator or any one political party. It is as big as the idea of \nrepresentative democracy itself, and just as resilient. This is a fight \nfor the soul and the survival of our American democracy. This democracy \ncannot survive without the confidence of the people in the legislative \nand the electoral process. The prevalence--no--the dominance--of money \nin our system of elections and our legislature will in the end cause \nthem to crumble. If we don't take steps to clean up this system it \nultimately will consume us along with our finest American ideals.\n  Mr. President, there has been alot of discussion on this floor in \nrecent weeks about morality. Indeed, we are now engaged in a process, \nboth constitutional and political, that may ultimately lead to an \nimpeachment trial in this historic chamber. Questions of morality are \nat the center of that process, which has consumed much of the public's \nand the press's attention over the past several months.\n\n[[Page S12584]]\n\n  I submit that questions of morality should be central in this body's \ntreatment of the campaign finance issue. Along with millions of other \nAmericans, religious leaders from across a wide spectrum of \ndenominations have urged us to enact reform. They see how this corrupt \nsystem is undermining the moral authority of our government. How can we \npretend to be following the dictates of conscience, and not politics, \nas we prepare to judge the President, while simultaneously ignoring \nthis moral crisis in the process by which the people elect their \nrepresentatives?\n  There has also been a lot of discussion about high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  I haven't decided yet whether the President's misbehavior meets that \nhigh standard. Many of the American people seem skeptical.\n  But they do think it's a crime that the tobacco companies can use \nmoney to block a bill to curtail teen smoking. They do think it's a \ncrime that insurance companies can use money to block desperately \nneeded health care reform. They do think it's a crime that \ntelecommunication companies use money and can force a bill through \nCongress that's supposed to increase competition and decrease prices, \nbut leads to cable rates that keep on rising and rising. And they do \nthink it's a crime that corporations and unions are able to give \nunlimited soft money contributions to the political parties to advance \ntheir narrow special interests.\n  They think it's a crime. And you know what, it should be a crime. But \nhere in Washington it is business as usual--until we manage to pass \nmeaningful campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, it was very disappointing to me that 48 of our \ncolleagues voted against the McCain-Feingold bill a few weeks ago, \nkilling reform for this year. It was especially disappointing that we \nwere unable to break through the filibuster here, after the enormous \naccomplishment of our colleagues in the other body who passed reform by \na lopsided 252-179 margin.\n  It was especially disappointing that all the votes to kill our bill \nin the Senate came from one party. Facing the determined opposition of \nthe leadership, reformers in the House succeeded not only in bringing \ncampaign finance reform to the floor but in passing it with a strong \nbipartisan majority. When we failed to invoke cloture on the McCain-\nFeingold bill last month, we missed a golden opportunity to together do \nsomething positive for the American people on a bipartisan basis.\n  I emphasized the strong bipartisan vote in the House, Mr. President, \nbecause this effort has been a bipartisan effort all along. The senior \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and the Senior Senator from \nTennessee and Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nThompson, have been in the forefront of this effort from the beginning. \nFive other distinguished Republican Senators voted for the McCain-\nFeingold bill. In the House, fully \\1/4\\ of the Republican Members \nvoted for the bill. Senator McCain and I recognized a long time ago \nthat a partisan campaign finance bill will never become law. A serious \neffort to actually do something about this problem, Mr. President, has \nto be bipartisan.\n  It is significant, Mr. President, that many of the leaders in this \nbody on campaign finance reform were part of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's year long investigation of campaign finance abuses in the \n1996 campaign. Not only the Chairman, Senator Thompson, but two other \nhighly respected Republican members of the committee, Senator Collins \nand Senator Specter, supported the McCain-Feingold bill. And Democratic \nmembers such as the Senator Glenn, Senator Levin, and Senator Durbin, \nhave also been very active and outspoken in pushing for reform. These \nSenators saw--up close and personal--how the excesses of the 1996 \ncampaign stem from problems with the law, particularly the enormous \nloophole known as soft money.\n  I want to thank all of them for their hard work on the investigation \nand on this legislation, and promise them that their work shall not \nhave been in vain. It is unfortunate that the investigation did not \nlead to legislative correction in this Congress, but the factual record \nthey amassed remains the most powerful and detailed argument for \nreform, and it will undoubtedly shape our efforts in the future.\n  There are plenty of scandals in this scandal-obsessed town--but when \nit comes to campaign finance, the greatest scandal of all is not about \nlaws that were broken. The greatest campaign finance scandal is about \nthe outrageous practices and compromising contributions that are \nperfectly legal. Yes, those who broke the current campaign finance laws \nshould be punished, but that will hardly begin to solve the problems in \nthis corrupt campaign finance system.\n  We've heard the horror stories again and again. The parties have \nspecial clubs for big givers and offer exclusive meetings and weekend \nretreats with officeholders to the donors. And it's totally legal.\n  The tobacco companies have funneled nearly $17 million in soft money \nto the national political parties in the last decade, $4.4 million in \n1997 alone when the whole issue of congressional action on the tobacco \nsettlement was very much alive--and it's totally legal.\n  In 1996, the gambling industry gave nearly $4 million in soft money \nto the two major political parties at the same time that Congress was \ncreating a new national commission on gambling, but with limited \nsubpoena powers--and it's totally legal.\n  The National Republican Congressional Committee is engaged in a $37 \nmillion dollar effort called Operation Breakout, funded largely by soft \nmoney, to attack Democratic candidates with advertisements that aren't \nconsidered election ads and don't even have to be reported to the FEC \nbecause they don't use certain ``magic words'' like Vote For or Vote \nAgainst--and it's totally legal.\n  And we're even starting to extort money from our own colleagues. It \nwas recently reported that Republican leaders actually threatened to \ndeprive their own Members of appropriations subcommittee chairmanships \nif they didn't cough up up to $100,000 for the Operation Breakout plan. \nAnd it's totally legal.\n  There are some in this body, of course, despite what the Thompson \ninvestigation uncovered and what news stories show on almost a daily \nbasis, who don't see or won't acknowledge the corrupting influence of \nthese unlimited soft money contributions, which are now totally legal. \nIn our most recent debate, the junior Senator from Utah gave us a \nhistory lesson intended to convince us that we should not fear enormous \ncampaign contributions. He recounted the frequently told story of how \nSen. Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968 was jump-started \nby some very large contributions by some very wealthy individuals.\n  He also noted that Steve Forbes was apparently prepared to make \nsimilarly enormous contributions to support Jack Kemp in a run for the \nPresidency in 1996, but was prohibited from doing so by the federal \nelection laws and so decided to run his own campaign, a decision from \nwhich we might infer that the money is more important than the \ncandidate. And he recounted as well the story of Mr. Arthur Hyatt, a \nwealthy businessman who gave large soft money contributions to the \nDemocratic Party in 1996, but decided after that election not to give \nsoft money to the parties anymore, and instead to fund an advocacy \ngroup that is promoting public financing of elections.\n  The point of these examples was supposed to be that wealthy donors \nare motivated by ideology and the desire to benefit the public as they \nsee it rather than by the desire to gain access and influence with \npolicy makers through their contributions. And I suppose that is \nsometimes the case. Of course, there is also the well known story of \nRoger Tamraz, who testified under oath to our Governmental Affairs \nCommittee that he never even votes, and the only reason that he gave \nsoft money to the DNC was to gain access to officials he thought could \nhelp him with his business. I mean no disrespect to the Senator from \nUtah and the civic-minded millionaires he cites, but Mr. Tamraz, I \nsuspect, is more typical in his motives, if not his methods, of big \ncontributors.\n  I'm not cynical, Mr. President. There is a reason that I hold that \nsuspicion. And the reason is that the vast majority of soft money \ncontributions to our political parties are coming from corporate \ninterests. And it simply cannot\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\nbe argued that these interests are acting out of public spiritedness or \nideological conviction. Corporations do not have an ideology, they have \nbusiness interests. They have a bottom line to defend, and they have \nlearned over the years that making contributions to the major political \nparties in this country is a very good investment in their bottom line. \nCampaign money buys access, and access pays off at the bottom line.\n  Corporate interests are special interests. Special interests have \nself-interested motives. They are concerned with profits, not what is \nbest for other citizens or consumers or the country as a whole. They \nlike to cast their arguments in terms of the public interest, and they \ncertainly will argue that if the Congress follows their advice on \nlegislation the public will be better off, but in the end it is their \nown businesses that they care about, not the public good. Indeed, the \nboards of directors and management of corporations have a legal duty to \nact in the best interests of their shareholders, not the public at \nlarge.\n  And I have no problem with that, and no illusions about it either. \nIt's OK with me that the corporate special interests are looking out \nfor number one in the public debate, but I object when their deep \npockets give them deep influence that ordinary Americans don't have.\n  Take the tobacco companies. They oppose increasing the taxes paid by \nconsumers of their products, they promote putting caps on the damages \nthat smokers and their families can be awarded in personal injury or \nwrongful death actions, but they oppose ending government subsidies for \ntobacco farmers. In each case, they say they are supporting the public \ninterest, but in the end they are protecting their own bottom line. And \nthey have invested heavily in this Congress, and in our political \nparties, millions upon millions of dollars to protect their bottom \nline.\n  These are the folks who raised their right hands and swore that \ntobacco was not addictive. These are the companies that concealed \ncrucial studies on the dangers of their product for years. These are \nthe people who spent millions on a misleading advertising campaign to \nkill the most important public health initiative that the Congress \nconsidered this year because it threatened their economic health. I'm \nnot willing to rely on them to look out for the public interest, \nparticularly when the voices of opposing views can hardly be heard \nbecause they don't have a lot of money.\n  Most soft money donors are using their contributions like Roger \nTamraz and the tobacco companies do. That is borne out by a recent \nstudy by Common Cause of the major soft money donors so far in this \nelection cycle. The political parties have already raised over $116 \nmillion in soft money in this cycle, the most ever in a non-\npresidential cycle and more than twice the amount given in a similar 18 \nmonth period in the 1993-94 cycle.\n  As is always the case, corporations with business before the \nCongress, not disinterested, public-spirited millionaires, and \ncertainly not ordinary citizens, are leading the way in soft money \ngiving in this cycle. Securities and investment companies and their \nexecutives have given $8.5 million, the insurance industry has given \n$7.3 million, the telecommunications industry $6.1 million, the real \nestate industry $5.9 million, the pharmaceutical industry $4 million, \nand the tobacco industry $3.9 million. All of these amounts are at \nleast double and in some cases triple the amount given in 1993-94.\n  And one very interesting set of contributors shows that access, not \nideology, is the main reason for soft money donations. Fifty-seven \ndonors in the first 18 months of this cycle gave more than $75,000 to \nboth parties. 15 companies, including Philip Morris, AT, Walt Disney \nCo., MCI, Bell South Corporation, Atlantic Richfield and Archer Daniels \nMidland gave more than $150,000 to both parties.\n  Now I suppose there might be some in those companies, or even in this \nbody, who will argue that all of these ``double-givers'' just really \nwant to help the political process. That they are motivated not by \ntheir bottom line but by a deep desire to assist the parties in serving \nthe public. But if that is the case, why is that in every Congress \nsince I have been here the industries most seriously affected by our \nwork pony up to give huge contributions to us and to the political \nparties?\n  In 1993-94 it was the health care debate. Hospitals, insurance \ncompanies, drug companies, and doctors all opened their wallets in an \nunprecedented way. Then in 1995 and 1996, the Telecommunications Act \nwas under consideration and lo and behold the local and long distance \ncompanies and the cable companies stepped up their giving. Now in this \nCongress, we've been working on bankruptcy reform and financial \nservices modernization, and the biggest givers of all in this cycle \naccording to Common Cause's research report are securities and \ninvestment companies, insurance companies, and banks and lenders, eager \nto have their business interests protected or expanded. What's going on \nhere? I submit that it's not a spontaneous burst of civic virtue. And \nif we don't finish work on these bills this year, you can bet that the \nmoney will be there for us in the Congress as well--it has been \nsuggested that sometimes the very members of Congress who most want a \nbig bill to pass will slow its progress to keep the checks coming in \nand the money flowing that much longer.\n  Mr. President, not surprisingly, there's also a powerful new player \nin the soft money game in this Congress--the computer and electronics \nindustry. According to Common Cause, these companies have given the \nparties nearly $2.7 million so far, more than twice as much as they \ngave four years ago. And why is that, Mr. President? Could it have \nanything to do with the ongoing antitrust investigations and the \npossibility of congressional action in connection with those \ninvestigations? Or is it that the industry suddenly became more public \nspirited than it was in the past?\n  Mr. President, the American people are not gullible or naive. They \nknow that these companies contribute these enormous sums to the parties \nbecause their bottom line is affected by what the Congress does and \nthey want to make sure the Congress will listen to them when they want \nto make their case. And they know that the big contributors get \nresults.\n  And frankly, Mr. President, it's a two way street. The parties are \nhitting up these donors because they know that most companies, unlike \nMonsanto and General Motors who announced early in 1997 that they would \nno longer make soft money donations--most companies don't have the \ncourage to say no. Most companies are worried that if they don't ante \nup, their lobbyists won't get in the door. Our current campaign finance \nlaws encourage old fashioned shakedowns, as long as they are done \ndiscreetly.\n  Faced with this kind of evidence, it is beyond me how any Senator \ncould support this soft money system. We simply must pass comprehensive \nreform, including a ban on soft money at the beginning of the next \nCongress, and we must make that ban effective immediately to prevent \nthe presidential election in the Year 2000 from being contaminated with \nthis corrosive and corruptive force. The consequences of failing to \nmake these reforms will be devastating to the confidence of average \ncitizens in the fairness and impartiality of the legislative process \nand the actions of a future Chief Executive.\n  Let me be clear Mr. President, I'm not suggesting that any individual \nMember of Congress is corrupt. I don't know that any Member of this \nbody has ever traded a vote for a contribution. But while Members are \nnot corrupt, the system is riddled with corruption. It is only human to \nhelp those who have helped you get elected or reelected, to agree to \nthe meeting, to take the phone call, to allow the opportunity to be \npersuaded by those who have given money. It is true of the parties, and \nit is true of the Members, even those who seek always to cast their \nvotes on the merits. The result is that people who don't have money \ndon't get heard.\n  So we don't need to point fingers at one another, we just have to \nrise above politics and do the right thing by the American people. We \nmust clean up our own house, Mr. President. We cannot continue to \nignore the corruption in our midst, the cancer that is eating the heart \nout of the great American compact of trust and faith between the people \nand their elected representatives.\n  We know that unlimited soft money contributions make a mockery of our \nelection laws and threatens the fairness of the legislative process. We\n\n[[Page S12586]]\n\nknow that phony issue ads paid for with unlimited corporate and union \nfunds undermine the ability of citizens to understand who is \nbankrolling the candidates and why. We can find bipartisan solutions to \nthese problems that protect legitimate First Amendment rights if we are \nwilling to put partisan political advantage aside and sit down and work \nit out.\n  Senator McCain and I are ready--we have been ready ever since we \nintroduced our bill--to make changes to our bill that will bring new \nsupporters on board and get us past the 60 vote threshold that the \nSenate rules have placed in our way, so long as we stay true to the \ngoal of a cleaner, fairer, system in which money will no longer \ndominate.\n  I look forward to continuing this work next year Mr. President. And I \nam confident that we will succeed. Again, I want to thank Senator \nMcCain and all the Republicans who joined our bill this year. And of \ncourse, Senator Daschle and all the Democratic Senators who have so \nsteadfastly supported bipartisan reform in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, most important legislative accomplishments take more \nthan one Congress to enact. Rome was not built in a day, and campaign \nfinance reform obviously could not be enacted in a year. But I believe \nthat early in the next Congress there will be a real chance to deal \nwith the campaign finance issue in a bipartisan fashion to make the \nelection in the Year 2000 cleaner and fairer than the one we just had \nor the one we are about to have. The American people deserve that as we \nenter a new century, and here is a promise: I will never, ever, give up \nthis fight until we give it to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12583-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12586-S12589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NOMINATION OF JAMES C. HORMEL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress draws to a \nclose, I rise to express my disappointment over something we did not \ndo. The Senate, despite strong support from both sides of the aisle, \nhas not brought the nomination of James C. Hormel to serve as U.S. \nAmbassador to Luxembourg to the floor, has not had a debate on the \nnomination, and has not had a vote on it.\n  This failure is really quite incomprehensible.\n  The President nominated James Hormel for this post on October 6, \n1997. After a thorough review by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the committee approved the nomination by a vote of 16-2 and \nreported it to the full Senate with the recommendation that it be \nconfirmed. And yet here it is, October 14, 1998, in the final hours of \nthis Congress, and the nomination has not budged from the Executive \nCalendar.\n  Mr. Hormel is eminently qualified for the job of U.S. Ambassador to \nLuxembourg. He has had a diverse and distinguished career as a lawyer, \nbusinessman, educator, and philanthropist, and he gained diplomatic \nexperience as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human \nRights Commission in Geneva in 1995 and as a member of the U.S. \ndelegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly in 1997. He was even \nconfirmed unanimously by this very Senate for the latter post on May \n23, 1997.\n  He has been an upstanding civic leader in San Francisco, and he has \nbeen honored for his work by organizations too numerous to mention. He \nis a man who is kind to all he meets, generous beyond measure, and \ndeeply committed to making the world and his community a better place \nto live for all people. He is a devoted father of five grown children, \nand grandfather of 13. Anyone who knows him, as I have been privileged \nto do for over two decades, knows that he is a man of decency and \nhonor, and the type of person who should be encouraged to be in public \nservice.\n  So this is the situation we face: we have a nominee with outstanding \ntalents and credentials; he was previously confirmed by this Senate for \nanother post; he was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee by a \n16-2 vote nearly a year ago; and over 60 Senators support bringing his \nnomination to a vote. And yet, we have never had the opportunity to \nvote on it.\n  Why? Because several Senators on the other side of the aisle have \nplaced holds on the nomination, preventing a debate and a vote they \nknew they would lose. And the Majority Leader has refused to call up \nthe nomination, effectively allowing the passage of time to kill it.\n  Why has Mr. Hormel been denied the Constitutionally delineated due \nprocess of a Senate debate and vote? The answer is simple: Mr. Hormel \nis gay. With no other reasonable grounds to block this nomination, one \ncan come to no other conclusion than that some Senators are simply \nopposed to a gay man serving our country as a U.S. Ambassador. I \nbelieve the Senate does not want to allow this type of discrimination \nto prevail, and I think the vast majority of my colleagues agree. But \nso far, it appears that discrimination has prevailed.\n  I believe the majority of Americans agree with this position as well. \nTo cite just one measure, newspaper editorials have appeared in support \nof Mr. Hormel's nomination across the country, including in the: Albany \nTimes Union, Albuquerque Journal, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Atlanta \nJournal & Constitution, Boston Globe, Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, \nChicago Tribune, Cincinnati Post, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Detroit Free \nPress, Evansville Courier, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hartford Courant, \nHouston Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal, \nMinneapolis-St. Paul Star-Tribune, Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger, New \nOrleans Times Picayune, New York Daily News, New York Times, Peoria \nJournal-Star, Philadelphia Inquirer, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Portland \nPress Herald, Providence Journal, Riverside (Ca.) Press-Enterprise, \nRocky Mountain News, San Diego Union-Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, \nSan Francisco Examiner, Santa Rosa (Ca.) Press Democrat, Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer, Springfield (Ill.) Journal-Register, St. Louis Post-\nDispatch, St. Petersburg Times, Syracuse Post-Standard, Tulsa World, \nWashington Post, and York (Pa.) Daily Record.\n  Many of these newspapers have also run op-ed columns which call for a \nvote on the nomination, as have the: Arizona Republic, Buffalo News, \nColumbus Dispatch, Dallas Morning News, Denver Post, Des Moines \nRegister, Detroit News, Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, Greensboro News & \nRecord, Madison Capital Times, Memphis Commercial Appeal, Northern New \nJersey Record, Raleigh News & Observer, Salt Lake City Tribune, and USA \nToday.\n  I deeply regret that the Senate has not been permitted to have its \nsay on this eminently qualified nominee solely because he is gay. But \nthe Senate's failure to act need not prevent Mr. Hormel from assuming \nhis post. In a case such as this, where the Senate has so clearly \nfailed to fulfill its Constitutional obligation with respect to a \nnomination, even though a clear majority of the Senate supports that \nnomination, I believe it is entirely appropriate for the President to \nuse his Constitutional authority to make a recess appointment.\n  Luxembourg is a NATO ally, and we need an ambassador there. Mr. \nHormel has every qualification necessary to be an outstanding \nambassador, and he would have been overwhelmingly confirmed if the \nSenate had been allowed to vote. But we were not. I, therefore, urge \nPresident Clinton, after Congress adjourns, to make a recess \nappointment of James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. It is \nthe right thing to do, and it will give the country the benefit of the \nservice of James Hormel, which the Senate has failed to do.\n  Mr. President, because the Senate has not had the opportunity to \ndebate this nomination, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record \nsome of the materials I would have used in the course of that debate, \nincluding some of the notable editorials, op-ed pieces, and letters of \nsupport that have come to my attention.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 22, 1998]\n\n                       Game's Not Over for Hormel\n\n       Even though this hasn't been a notably busy or productive \n     year for the U.S. Senate, Majority Leader Trent Lott has \n     decided that there simply is no time available to vote on the \n     nomination of James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. Never \n     mind that Hormel's confirmation has been pending since last \n     fall, that hearings on his fitness have long since been \n     completed or that Lott early on declared his unshakable \n     belief that Hormel should not represent his country abroad \n     because he is a homosexual. The excuse du jour is that the \n     Senate calendar is\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\n     too crowded to permit a confirmation vote. So Lott and a \n     handful of others of like mind will have denied the Senate \n     its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to \n     this nomination.\n       That's not the end of the story, however. The Constitution \n     also empowers the president to fill vacancies when Congress \n     is in recess. Congress is rushing toward recess now, its \n     members eager to campaign for the November elections. Once it \n     has adjourned, President Clinton can name Hormel to the \n     Luxembourg post. He is qualified, he is acceptable to the \n     host government and his sexual orientation is utterly \n     irrelevant.\n       That's the way most senators feel, as Lott well knows. Had \n     the Senate leader allowed a floor vote, Hormel would easily \n     have been confirmed. Instead Lott used his powers to prevent \n     a vote, meanwhile taking to the airwaves to give his opinion \n     that homosexuality is a treatable condition, as he put it, \n     like alcoholism or kleptomania. In other words, anyone who \n     makes the effort can surmount it. That notion may play well \n     in some circles. It hardly elevates the reputation of the \n     Senate.\n       In a few weeks the Senate will recess. There's no reason \n     why Hormel shouldn't be presenting his credentials in \n     Luxembourg not long after.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Atlanta Constitution, July 2, 1998]\n\n                   Senate Discriminates Against Gays\n\n       When gay Americans have sought protection against being \n     fired from jobs or being denied employment solely because of \n     their sexual orientation, they have been slapped with the \n     charge that they are seeking ``special rights.''\n       The implication of the term, ``special rights,'' has been \n     that gay Americans don't really need job protection, that \n     they seek some sort of exalted legal status above and beyond \n     that enjoyed by other Americans. That doesn't make much sense \n     to gay Americans, for whom job discrimination is very real, \n     but it has nonetheless become the standard line for \n     politicians in rejecting gay-rights legislation.\n       The example of businessman James Hormel has exposed the \n     hypocrisy of that argument. President Clinton has nominated \n     Hormel to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, a largely \n     honorary role that requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate. \n     But a vote on Hormel's nomination has been blocked by a small \n     minority of U.S. senators for one very obvious and silly \n     reason: He is gay, and they don't like gay people.\n       It's a situation rich in irony. Most of those opposing \n     Hormel have no doubt cited the ``special rights'' argument in \n     the past, denying that gay Americans need protection. Now \n     here they are, in a very public setting, committing a form of \n     discrimination that supposedly does not exist.\n       For that reason, the Hormel nomination already has served a \n     great public benefit. It has stripped away the code phrases \n     and the weasel words that certain politicians have used to \n     communicate their message of hate to one crowd while \n     maintaining the pretense of tolerance for others. It has \n     ripped away the mask exposing the hate that has always hidden \n     behind that term ``special rights.''\n       Here is a good man, a person of great accomplishment and \n     civic contributions, denied the chance to represent his \n     country simply because he is gay. And the wellspring of that \n     bias and hate, the agency denying him a job because of his \n     sexual orientation, is the U.S. Senate.\n       That is shameful.\n       No American should be denied the opportunity to contribute \n     to his country, or more fundamentally, to simply earn a \n     living, because of his sexual nature. If the right to earn a \n     living and contribute to one's country is a ``special \n     right,'' it is a special right that must be available to all \n     Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, June 23, 1998]\n\n                          Hold That Homophobia\n\n       Maybe Don Nickles, the second-ranking Republican in the \n     Senate, thinks he's Don Rickles, the insult-comedian?

If homophobes want to oppose Mr. Hormel, even \n     though Luxembourg has expressed its approval, let 'em.

It is not Mr. \n     Hormel's credentials that are in question. An heir to the \n     Hormel Meat-packing fortune, a former dean of the University \n     of Chicago Law School, he has given leadership and money to \n     causes that range from the San Francisco Symphony to \n     Swarthmore College and the Human Rights Campaign, the main \n     political lobby for homosexual rights.\n       Mr. Hormel is gay, but that is not an issue in Luxembourg. \n     As Alphonse Berns, Luxembourg's Ambassador to the United \n     States, said on Friday, ``We would welcome Mr. Hormel.'' But \n     for months, Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Tim Hutchinson \n     of Arkansas and Robert Smith of New Hampshire have been \n     blocking a vote on the nomination, making dark suggestions \n     about Mr. Hormel's gay-rights ``agenda,'' as if he might \n     somehow seek to lead the moral standards of Luxembourg array.\n       Discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual \n     orientation is outlawed in Luxembourg and in all the other \n     countries in the European Union. It is illegal in San \n     Francisco, where Mr. Hormel lives, and in Washington--except \n     in such place as Congress, where the Republican leadership \n     has made a fetish of it lately.\n       Last week, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who has \n     refused to bring the Hormel nomination up for a vote, said in \n     a television interview that he thought homosexuality was a \n     sin. He likened it to alcoholism, kleptornania and ``sex \n     addiction.'' The next day, Dick Armey, the House majority \n     leader, said he thought it was a sin too, and cited some \n     Bible scripture to the effect that neither fornicators, nor \n     adulterers, ``nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with \n     mankind'' shall inherit the kingdom of God.\n       Finally, in a letter to Mr. Lott made public on Thursday, \n     Senator Alfonse D'Amato of new York broke the silence of his \n     fellow Republicans to say that it was wrong to block Hormel's \n     nomination simply because he is gay. ``I am embarrassed,'' he \n     said. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has said she \n     believes more than 60 senators support Mr. Hormel. Mr. Lott \n     should let the nomination go to the floor, so Mr. Hormel. can \n     be judged on his merit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1998]\n\n                           Qualified To Serve\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, refuses to let the \n     Senate vote on President Clinton's nominee to be ambassador \n     to Luxembourg. Four of Mr. Lott's fellow Republicans have \n     objected to would-be ambassador James Hormel because, they \n     say, of his support for gay rights. But many other Clinton \n     appointees have shared Mr. Hormel's views on that matter. The \n     real problem seems to be that Mr. Hormel is himself openly \n     gay.\n       Mr. Hormel, 65, is a longtime supporter of the Democratic \n     Party, and you could certainly make a case that more career \n     diplomats and fewer political contributors should get \n     ambassadorial posts. But as political nominations go, Mr. \n     Hormel is, according to wide bipartisan consensus, unusually \n     well qualified. A lawyer and businessman from San Francisco, \n     Mr. Hormel has been a longtime and effective supporter of \n     many charitable causes. George Shultz, former secretary of \n     state, says Mr. Hormel ``would be a wonderful representative \n     for our country.''\n       The senators who object--Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, James \n     Inhofe of Oklahoma, Robert Smith of New Hampshire and a \n     fourth who remains anonymous--say they fear he would use his \n     ambassadorship to advance a gay rights agenda. How that might \n     come about in Luxembourg is hard to see; in any case, Mr. \n     Hormel has made clear that he would use his post to promote \n     U.S. policy, and U.S. policy only.\n       Mr. Hormel's nomination sailed through the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee last fall. Now he deserves a vote in the \n     full Senate. Those senators who don't believe a gay person \n     should represent the United States overseas would be able to \n     vote no. Those who believe the United States should welcome \n     to public service its most qualified citizens regardless of \n     race, religion, gender, ethnic background or sexual \n     orientation, would be able to vote yes. We believe a majority \n     of the Senate inclines toward the latter view. As Republican \n     Sen. Orrin Hatch said in support of Mr. Hormel's nomination, \n     ``I just don't believe in prejudice against any individual, \n     regardless.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]\n\n         Strange Diplomacy--Senator Hutchinson, Meet Mr. Hormel\n\n       Any day now Tim Hutchinson is to meet with James Hormel. \n     Mr. Hutchinson, you may have noticed, is the junior senator \n     from Arkansas, and Mr. Hormel is the ambassador-designate to \n     Luxembourg whose appointment Senator Hutchinson has been \n     holding up.\n       We thought better of Tim Hutchinson. It's one thing to \n     block an ambassadorial nomination when policy is the issue. \n     That's what Jesse Helms did when William Weld, then governor \n     of Massachusetts, was nominated\n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\n     as ambassador to Mexico.

The senator says he's concerned \n     about the ``activism'' of Mr. Hormel in pushing rights for \n     homosexuals.\n       Funny, we don't remember homosexuality being a major issue \n     between the United States and Luxembourg. Nor does Luxembourg \n     seem to offer much of a platform for espousing any political \n     agenda. Luxembourg is by all accounts a lovely country about \n     the size of Rhode Island, and one not likely to be confused \n     with a great power.\n       Tim Hutchinson says he plans to find out more for himself \n     about the nominee's background.

Mr. \n     Hormel's ``activism'' wasn't an issue for Senator Hutchinson \n     when that vote came up.\n       When it comes down to it and ambassadorship to a small \n     friendly country requires little more than an ability to \n     throw good parties. What's our junior senator worried about--\n     that James Hormel will serve Spam at diplomatic receptions? \n     That he'll re-decorate the ambassador's residence in \n     lavender? Come On, senator. Wake up and grow up.\n       Senators have more realistic problems to worry about.

Glassman)\n\n       Luxembourg is a nation of 400,000 souls in the middle of \n     Europe. It's smaller than Jacksonville, Fla., but it's the \n     focus of a big controversy in Washington. Back in October, \n     President Clinton picked James C. Hormel of San Francisco, an \n     investor and philanthropist, to be U.S. ambassador to \n     Luxembourg. The next month, he was approved by the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, 16-2. But it is unlikely that \n     the ``Spam heir,'' as the local newspapers call him, will \n     ever become our envoy to the Grand Duchy.\n       Trent Lott, the Senate Majority Leader, refuses to put the \n     matter to a vote. Hormel is gay, and Lott considers \n     homosexuality a sin. In an interview on ``The Armstrong \n     Williams Show,'' Lott elaborated: ``You should still love \n     that person. You should not try to mistreat them or treat \n     them as outcasts. You should try to show them a way to deal \n     with that problem, just like alcohol . . . or sex addiction . \n     . . or kleptomaniacs.''\n       Kleptomaniacs! The Hormel nomination has brought anti-gay \n     sentiment among GOP leaders out of the closet--and it is an \n     ugly sight. Recent comments by Lott, Foreign Relations \n     Chairman Jesse Helms (``it's sickening'') and Senate Whip Don \n     Nickles (``immoral behavior'') may appear unenlightened and \n     ignorant, but politicians, like the rest of us, are entitled \n     to their bigotries.\n       Through their actions as lawmakers, however, politicians \n     should not be entitled to impose such bigotries--or religious \n     or moral convictions, if you prefer--about matters of \n     personal behavior on the rest of us.\n       In general, while Americans don't approve of homosexuality, \n     they are very tolerant of it--and getting more so. For \n     example, 52 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll last year \n     said homosexuality was ``not an acceptable alternative \n     lifestyle''--a figure essentially unchanged from 1982. But 84 \n     percent (up from 59 percent 16 years ago) said homosexuals \n     ``should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.'' \n     Gallup says that ``solid majorities'' favor gays as \n     elementary school teachers (up from 27 percent in 1977) and \n     clergy (up from 36 percent).\n       What's truly disturbing about the Hormel affair is that it \n     shows how conservatives, who claim to favor a smaller, less \n     intrusive government, can't resist using it to impose their \n     own moral views on the public.\n       Frederich von Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and \n     a patron saint to many conservatives, identified this \n     propensity in a famous essay in 1960. ``In general,'' he \n     wrote, ``it can probably be said that the conservative does \n     not object to coercion or arbitrary power so long as it is \n     used for what he regards as right purposes. . . . Like the \n     socialist, he regards himself as entitled to force the values \n     he holds on other people.''\n       At a conference on homosexuality at Georgetown University, \n     Bill Kristol, a conservative intellectual leader and editor \n     of the Weekly Standard, complained about ``a denial of the \n     public's right to uphold moral standards.'' But he, too, \n     misses the key distinction: No one is denying the right of \n     individuals and groups to campaign against immorality as they \n     see it. But public officials, in the discharge of their \n     duties are something else. Judgments about truly personal \n     behavior are not their province.\n       Some of Hormel's foes claim they are against him not \n     because he's gay but because he's a vigorous proselytizer for \n     gay causes. ``He has promoted that lifestyle and promoted it \n     in a big way, in a way that is very offensive,'' said \n     Nickles.\n       But this is a meaningless distinction. Gays are denied jobs \n     because of their sexual orientation. Why shouldn't Hormel \n     campaign to change that situation? Lott and Nickles sound \n     like a couple of 1950s southern segregationists: ``It's not \n     that we're against nigras. It's that we're against them \n     marching for their so-called rights.''\n       One reason the American system works so well is that, in \n     Hayek's words, ``we agree to tolerate much that we dislike.'' \n     It's that agreement ``that makes it possible to build a \n     peaceful society with a minimum of force.''\n       When we abandon tolerance, the trouble begins. It's bad \n     enough on college campuses, where rules against ``offensive \n     speech'' are used to stifle ideas unpopular to the left and, \n     of course, to hypersensitive gays. But when it comes to \n     government, which wields the power to tax and imprison, \n     tolerance is an absolute necessity.\n       As far as our international relations are concerned, it \n     makes no difference at all whether Hormel becomes an \n     ambassador. As far as the preservation of our freedoms and \n     proper role of our government are concerned, it makes a big \n     difference indeed.\n                                  ____\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, February 6, 1998.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: We are writing on behalf of James Hormel, a \n     candidate for the post of Ambassador to Luxembourg.

D'Amato (R-NY) today \n     called on Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) to permit \n     an up or down vote on the nomination of James Hormel to serve \n     as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Text of Senator D'Amato's \n     letter follows:\n\n       Dear Majority Leader: I urge you to permit an up or down \n     vote on the nomination of Mr. James Hormel to serve as United \n     States Ambassador to Luxembourg. I support proceeding to a \n     vote for three basic reasons.\n       First, Mr. Hormel is a highly qualified nominee. His \n     academic, business, and community service credentials are \n     outstanding and are easily equal to or greater than those of \n     most ambassadorial nominees. I know of no statements or \n     actions by Mr. Hormel that make him unfit to represent our \n     country in this diplomatic post. Furthermore, he clearly \n     understands that his own personal philosophies, whatever they \n     may be, are not to influence his ambassadorial duties. He is \n     completely committed to representing the policies of the \n     United States government.\n       Second, simple fairness demands that the Senate be allowed \n     to vote on Mr. Hormel's nomination. The Foreign Relations \n     Committee overwhelmingly approved the nomination, and a \n     majority of Senators are on record supporting the nomination. \n     Opponents of the nominee should certainly have their voices \n     heard, but so too should supporters. And Mr. Hormel should \n     also be given the chance to defend himself. This can only \n     happen if the Senate is permitted to vote.\n       Third, and most fundamentally, I fear that Mr. Hormel's \n     nomination is being obstructed for one reason, and one reason \n     only, the fact that he is gay. In this day and age, when \n     people ably serve our country in so many capacities without \n     regard to sexual orientation, for the United States Senate to \n     deny an appointment on that basis is simply wrong. What's \n     more, on a personal level, I am embarrassed that our \n     Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln, is seen to be the \n     force behind this injustice.\n       I know that you join me in standing for the proposition \n     that all people should be judged on their ability to do the \n     job. By that sole standard, Mr. Hormel is well qualified to \n     be Ambassador to Luxembourg. I urge you to permit a Senate \n     vote on the nomination, and to join me in opposing those who \n     would deny Mr. Hormel this position because of his sexual \n     orientation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alfonse M.

S. 967 \ncontained the majority of the provisions in H.R. 2000.\n  One of the most important provisions in H.R. 2000 is section 6 which \nimplements a land exchange with the Calista Corporation, an Alaska \nNative regional corporation organized under the authority of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act. This exchange, originally authorized in \n1991, by P.L. 102-172, would provide for the United States to acquire \nmore than 200,000 acres of Calista and village corporation lands and \ninterests in lands within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in \nsouthwestern Alaska.\n  The Refuge serves as an important habitat and as a breeding and \nnesting ground for a variety of fish and wildlife, including numerous \nspecies of migratory birds and waterfowl. As a result, the Calista \nexchange will enhance the conservation and protection of these vital \nhabitats and thereby further the purpose of ANCSA and the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n  In addition to conservation benefits, this exchange will also render \nmuch needed economic benefit to the Yupik Eskimo people of southwestern \nAlaska. The Calista region is burdened by some of the harshest economic \nand social conditions in the Nation. As a result of this exchange, the \nCalista Corporation will be better able to make the kind of investments \nthat will improve the region's economy and the lives of the Yupik \npeople. In this regard, this provision furthers and carries out the \nunderlying purposes of ANCSA.\n  This provision is, in part, the result of discussions by the various \ninterested parties. As a result of those discussions, a number of \nmodifications were made to the original package of lands offered for \nexchange.\n  Mr. President, it is past time to move forward with this exchange.\n  Another section of this bill I wanted to comment on is a provision \nthat was not included in the technical amendments I introduced but that \nwas added in the House.\n  Section 12 of this bill expressly authorizes and confirms the \noriginal intent of ANCSA in 1971: that ANCSA corporations could provide \nhealth, education and welfare benefits for Alaska Natives, including \nthose persons who were their shareholders.\n  This provision is necessary because one recent Alaska Supreme Court \ncase has concluded that an ANCSA corporation had liability to its \nshareholders under Alaska state law for a cash payment benefits \nprogram. The program at issue in that case was limited to the persons \nreached a certain age. Given the narrowness of this program, it was not \nconsistent with the intent of ANCSA. Section 12 of this bill is not \nintended to alter the result in that case, or otherwise, with regard to \nthat specific benefit program.\n  However, in reaching its decision under Alaska state law, the court \nused language which suggests that any ANCSA corporate benefits program \nwhich does not provide equal pro rata benefits to all shareholders \nsimultaneously is invalid. Such a conclusion goes too far and is \ninconsistent with the intent behind ANCSA.\n  Thus, section 12 of this bill is intended to make clear that in \nevaluating the legality of health, education and welfare programs \nmaintained by ANCSA corporations, federal law (ANCSA) is to preempt \nAlaska state law. Such programs have been established in good faith to \nprovide health, education and/or welfare benefits for the ANCSA \ncorporations' shareholders or their family members.\n  To be valid under ANCSA, it is not necessary that benefits be \nprovided on an equal pro rata basis simultaneously to all shareholders, \nor even that the program recipients be shareholders as long as they are \nfamily members of shareholders.\n  Examples of the type of programs authorized include: scholarships, \ncultural activities, shareholder employment opportunities and related \nfinancial assistance, funeral benefits, meals for the elderly and other \nelders benefits including cash payments, and medical programs.\n  I believe these programs represent an important part of the ANCSA \ncorporations, and I hope they will continue long into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12589-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REVISION OF RECORD CONCERNING AMENDMENT NO. 3812\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, prior to the passage of H.R. 3494 by the \nSenate and House, Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 2252 and \n2252A permitted prosecution for possession of child pornography only \nwhen it could be alleged that an individual possessed three or more \npictures or images of child pornography. When the original Senate \nsubstitute to H.R. 3494 was reported out of the Judiciary Committee, no \nagreement had been reached on amending the federal child pornography \nlaws to prohibit the possession of even one picture or image of child \npornography.\n  Thanks to the diligent efforts of Senators Leahy, DeWine, and \nSessions, we were able to reach agreement on that issue. The final bill \nmakes it clear that the United States has ``Zero Tolerance'' for the \npossession of any child pornography. Unfortunately, Senators Leahy, \nDeWine, and Sessions were inadvertently omitted from the list of \ncosponsors of Senate amendment 3812 to H.R. 3494, which incorporated \nthat agreement. The Record should be corrected to reflect their work \non, and cosponsorship of, this important amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12589-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12589-S12590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MISPRINT OF THE STATEMENT OF MANAGERS OF S. 1260\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to address a question to the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato: it is my \nunderstanding that the joint explanatory statement of the committee of \nconference on S. 1260, as printed by the Government Printing Office in \nReport 105-803, and as it appeared in the Congressional Record for \nFriday, October 9, 1998, contained an error and was incomplete. Is that \nthe Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, my colleague from Maryland, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Banking Committee is correct. Due to a clerical error, the joint \nexplanatory statement of the committee of conference on S. 1260, was \nprinted without the final page. This page contained some essential \nexplanatory information regarding the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform \nAct regarding scienter standards. Unfortunately, this same clerical \nerror occurred in the version of the report language that appeared in \nthe House Record at H10270. The official version of the joint \nexplanatory statement was filed in the Senate on October 9th and did \ncontain the page that was omitted by the GPO and the Congressional \nRecord for October 9th.\n  In order to clarify this situation, I ask for unanimous consent that \nthe text of the explanatory statement be reprinted in its entirety.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it the further understanding of the Chairman of the \nBanking Committee that page H10775 of the Congressional Record for \nOctober 13, 1998 contains a printing error?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator from Maryland is correct. The Joint \nExplanatory Statement of the committee of conference begins on page \nH10774 of the\n\n[[Page S12590]]\n\nCongressional Record for October 13, 1998 and concludes on page H10775 \nwhere the names of the House and Senate Managers appear. The material \non page H10775 that follows the names of the Managers, although printed \nin the same typeface, is not part of the Joint Explanatory Statement. \nIt does not represent the views of the Managers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the correct version of the Joint Explanatory \nStatement is that which will appear in today's Senate Record?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator is correct.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998\n\n\n                           Uniform Standards\n\n       Title I of S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform \n     Standards Act of 1998, makes Federal court the exclusive \n     venue for most securities class action lawsuits. The purpose \n     of this title is to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade \n     the protections that Federal law provides against abusive \n     litigation by filing suit in State, rather than in Federal, \n     court. The legislation is designed to protect the interests \n     of shareholders and employees of public companies that are \n     the target of meritless ``strike'' suits. The purpose of \n     these strike suits is to extract a sizeable settlement from \n     companies that are forced to settle, regardless of the lack \n     of merits of the suit, simply to avoid the potentially \n     bankrupting expense of litigating.\n       Additionally, consistent with the determination that \n     Congress made in the National Securities Markets Improvement \n     Act \\1\\ (NSMIA), this legislation establishes uniform \n     national rules for securities class action litigation \n     involving our national capital markets. Under the \n     legislation, class actions relating to a ``covered security'' \n     (as defined by section 18(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, \n     which was added to that Act by NSMIA) alleging fraud or \n     manipulation must be maintained pursuant to the provisions of \n     Federal securities law, in Federal court (subject to certain \n     exceptions).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Public Law 104-290 (October 11, 1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       ``Class actions'' that the legislation bars from State \n     court include actions brought on behalf of more than 50 \n     persons, actions brought on behalf of one or more unnamed \n     parties, and so-called ``mass actions,'' in which a group of \n     lawsuits filed in the same court are joined or otherwise \n     proceed as a single action.\n       The legislation provides for certain exceptions for \n     specific types of actions. The legislation preserves State \n     jurisdiction over: (1) certain actions that are based upon \n     the law of the State in which the issuer of the security in \n     question is incorporated \\2\\; (2) actions brought by States \n     and political subdivisions, and State pension plans, so long \n     as the plaintiffs are named and have authorized participation \n     in the action; and (3) actions by a party to a contractual \n     agreement (such as an indenture trustee) seeking to enforce \n     provisions of the indenture.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ It is the intention of the managers that the suits under \n     this exception be limited to the state in which issuer of the \n     security is incorporated, in the case of a corporation, or \n     state of organization, in the case of any other entity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Additionally, the legislation provides for an exception \n     from the definition of ``class action'' for certain \n     shareholder derivative actions.\n       Title II of the legislation reauthorizes the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) for Fiscal Year 1999. \n     This title also includes authority for the SEC to pay \n     economists above the general services scale.\n       Title III of the legislation provides for corrections to \n     certain clerical and technical errors in the Federal \n     securities laws arising from changes made by the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \\3\\ (the ``Reform \n     Act'') and NSMIA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Public Law 104-67 (December 22, 1995).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The managers note that a report and statistical analysis of \n     securities class actions lawsuits authored by Joseph A. \n     Grundfest and Michael A. Perino reached the following \n     conclusion:\n       The evidence presented in this report suggests that the \n     level of class action securities fraud litigation has \n     declined by about a third in federal courts, but that there \n     has been an almost equal increase in the level of state court \n     activity, largely as a result of a ``substition effect'' \n     whereby plaintiffs resort to state court to avoid the new, \n     more stringent requirements of federal cases. There has also \n     been an increase in parallel litigation between state and \n     federal courts in an apparent effort to avoid the federal \n     discovery stay or other provisions of the Act. This increase \n     in state activity has the potential not only to undermine the \n     intent of the Act, but to increase the overall cost of \n     litigation to the extent that the Act encourages the filing \n     of parallel claims.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ Grundfest, Joseph A. & Perino, Michael A., Securities \n     Litigation Reform: The First Year's Experience: A Statistical \n     and Legal Analysis of Class Action Securities Fraud \n     Litigation under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \n     of 1995, Stanford Law School (February 27, 1997).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Prior to the passage of the Reform Act, there was \n     essentially no significant securities class action litigation \n     brought in State court.\\5\\ In its Report to the President and \n     the Congress on the First Year of Practice Under the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the SEC called the \n     shift of securities fraud cases from Federal to State court \n     ``potentially the most significant development in securities \n     litigation'' since passage of the Reform Act.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ Id. n. 18.\n     \\6\\ Report to the President and the Congress on the First \n     Year of Practice Under the Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act of 1995, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \n     Office of the General Counsel, April 1997 at 61.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The managers also determined that, since passage of the \n     Reform Act, plaintiffs' lawyers have sought to circumvent the \n     Act's provisions by exploiting differences between Federal \n     and State laws by filing frivolous and speculative lawsuits \n     in State court, where essentially none of the Reform Act's \n     procedural or substantive protections against abusive suits \n     are available.\\7\\ In California, State securities class \n     action filings in the first six months of 1996 went up \n     roughly five-fold compared to the first six months of 1995, \n     prior to passage of the Reform Act.\\8\\ Furthermore, as a \n     state securities commissioner has observed:\n\n     \\7\\ Testimony of Mr. Jack G.

Keith Paul Bishop, \n     Commissioner, California Department of Corporations, \n     submitted to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs' Subcommittee on Securities'' ``Oversight \n     Hearing on the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n     1995,'' Serial No. 105-182, at 3 (July 27, 1998).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The solution to this problem is to make Federal court the \n     exclusive venue for most securities fraud class action \n     litigation involving nationally traded securities.\n\n\n                                Scienter\n\n       It is the clear understanding of the managers that Congress \n     did not, in adopting the Reform Act, intend to alter the \n     standards of liability under the Exchange Act.\n       The managers understand, however, that certain Federal \n     district courts have interpreted the Reform Act as having \n     altered the scienter requirement. In that regard, the \n     managers again emphasize that the clear intent in 1995 and \n     our continuing intent in this legislation is that neither the \n     Reform Act nor S. 1260 in any way alters the scienter \n     standard in Federal securities fraud suits.\n       Additionally, it was the intent of Congress, as was \n     expressly stated during the legislative debate on the Reform \n     Act, and particularly during the debate on overriding the \n     President's veto, that the Reform Act establish a heightened \n     uniform Federal standard on pleading requirements based upon \n     the pleading standard applied by the Second Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Indeed, the express language of the Reform Act \n     itself carefully provides that plaintiffs must ``state with \n     particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that \n     the defendant acted with the required state of mind.'' The \n     Managers emphasize that neither the Reform Act nor S. 1260 \n     makes any attempt to define that state of mind.\n       The managers note that in Ernst and Ernst v. Hochfelder, \n     \\10\\ the Supreme Court left open the question of whether \n     conduct that was not intentional was sufficient for liability \n     under the Federal securities laws. The Supreme Court has \n     never answered that question. The Court expressly reserved \n     the question of whether reckless behavior is sufficient for \n     civil liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in a \n     subsequent case, Herman & Maclean v. Huddleston, \\11\\ where \n     it stated, ``We have explicitly left open the question of \n     whether recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\10\\ 425 U.S. 185 (1976).\n     \\11\\ 459 U.S. 375 (1983).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The managers note that since the passage of the Reform Act, \n     a data base containing many of the complaints, responses and \n     judicial decisions on securities class actions since \n     enactment of the Reform Act has been established on the \n     Internet. This data base, the Securities Class Action \n     Clearinghouse, is an extremely useful source of information \n     on securities class actions. It can be accessed on the world \n     wide web at http://securities.stanford.edu. The managers urge \n     other Federal courts to adopt rules, similar to those in \n     effect in the Northern District of California, to facilitate \n     maintenance of this and similar data bases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12589-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12590-S12591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DANA TASCHNER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \noutstanding achievements of a Nevadan who has dedicated himself to \nhelping individuals who often lack the means to help themselves. Dana \nTaschner has achieved national recognition as a champion for victims of \ndomestic violence and civil rights abuses. He is a 38 year-old lawyer \nfrom Reno who chooses cases that are relatively small-scale,\n\n[[Page S12591]]\n\nbut representative of many of the problems facing Americans. Time and \nagain, Mr. Taschner has had the courage and initiative to take on cases \nthat more prominent firms are hesitant to handle for political or \nmonetary reasons. Dana Taschner truly brings honor to his profession.\n  Mr. Taschner's devotion to fighting oppression recently earned him \nthe American Bar Association's Lawyer of the Year award. He was chosen \nfrom a pool of approximately 245,000 other lawyers in North America, \ncompeting with litigators with much higher profiles and greater wealth. \nIn 1993, Mr. Taschner took on the Los Angeles Police Department and \nsucceeded in forcing them to change their policy regarding police \nofficers who commit domestic violence. In this case, he represented 3 \norphans whose father, an L.A. police officer, murdered their mother and \nthen took his own life. Taschner was able to overcome his own painful \nchildhood memories of domestic abuse and secure the orphans a \nsettlement. He argued that the department should not have returned the \nofficer's gun after he had beaten his wife and threatened to kill her. \nHe also forced the department to treat these matters as criminal cases, \nrather than internal affairs.\n  In this era of cynicism and self-promotion, I believe we must take \nsteps to encourage and reward sincerity. Dana Taschner's unwavering \ndedication to his clients can be seen in his personal relationships \nwith them, relationships that often outlive the outcome of the case. As \nan attorney myself, I have seen firsthand how much our country needs \npeople in my field who care enough about their clients to commit \nthemselves personally, as well as professionally. Many litigators find \nit much easier to take the cases that bring financial gain, rather than \nattempting to help the true victims of injustice.\n  I am proud that his colleagues have lavished accolades upon Mr. \nTaschner, but I believe it is a much greater sign of his success that \nhis clients put their faith in him. Dana Taschner, whose integrity and \nselfless devotion to fairness truly embody our American justice system, \nis a role model for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12590-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE HEALTHCARE QUALITY ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nsupport for S. 2208, the Healthcare Quality Enhancement Act, which \nseeks to reform and improve the Agency for Healthcare Policy and \nResearch (AHCPR).\n  Studies show that health care quality is dictated more by where you \nlive than by scientific evidence or what is the best practice in \nmedicine. Today, we have more biomedical research results than ever \nbefore, yet we are falling short in our success to disseminate our \nfindings and to influence practice behavior. In 1843, Dr. Holmes \npublished his famous article on hand washing for the prevention of \npuerperal fever in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and \nSurgery. While it is an accepted and expected practice today, it took \nseveral decades before his recommendation became a universally accepted \npractice.\n  The landmark Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study was published \nin 1985. Then, three years later, the American Diabetes Association \npublished its eye care guidelines for patients with diabetes. \nUnfortunately, however, today the national rates for annual diabetic \neye exam is still only 38.4 percent. Clearly, the practical application \nof scientifically sound diabetic eye care recommendations has not fared \nmuch better than the highly beneficial and very important hand washing \ntheory. While there are more scientific discoveries than ever before, \nthe practical introduction of these new scientific discoveries does not \nappear to be much faster today than it was more than 100 years ago.\n  Through S. 2208, I am seeking to close the gap between what we know \nand what we do in health care. The expired statute of AHCPR represented \nan outdated approach to health care quality improvement. S. 2208 would \nestablish the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research (AHQR), whose \nmission is the overall improvement in health care quality.\n  Built upon the current AHCPR, the Agency for Healthcare Quality \nResearch is refocused and enhanced to become both the hub and driving \nforce of federal efforts to improve quality of health care in all \npractice environments. The Agency will assist, not burden physicians in \nfour specific ways. First, it will aggressively support state-of-the-\nart information systems for health care quality. Improved computer \nsystems will advance quality scoring and facilitate quality-based \ndecision making in patient care. Next, it will support research in \nareas of primary care delivery, priority populations and access in \nunder served areas. The Agency's authority is expanded to support \nhealth care improvement in all types of office practice--both solo \npractitioners and managed care. In addition, it will promote data \ncollection that makes sense. Physicians want information on quality to \nenable them to compare their outcomes with their peers. Statistically \naccurate, sample-based national surveys based on existing structures \nwill efficiently provide reliable and affordable data. And finally, the \nAgency will promote quality by sharing information with doctors, not \nthe federal government. While proven medical advances are made daily, \npatients wait too long to benefit from these discoveries. We must get \nthe science to the people who use it--physicians.\n  I would like to point out that S. 2208 does not create a new \nbureaucracy, nor does it expand the federal government. Rather, it \nrefocuses an existing agency, the AHCPR, on a research mission that can \nbetter serve the health and health care of all Americans. The \nreauthorization of the AHCPR and the creation of the Agency for \nHealthcare Quality Research enjoys broad-based support. By taking \nleadership in supporting research on health care quality improvement, \neight Senators, including myself, are co-sponsoring this bill. They are \nSenators Collins, Faircloth, Jeffords, Inouye, Mack, Breaux, and \nLieberman. In addition, S. 2208 was later incorporated in another bill \nwhich received co-sponsorship from 49 Senators. Also, I am pleased to \nreport that 44 leading organizations, consisting of health care \nprofessionals, patient advocates, major health care organizations and \nhealth services researchers, have also lent their support for this \nmeasure.\n  Americans want and deserve better health care. For this compelling \nreason, I will reintroduce S. 2208 in the 106th Congress. I urge my \ncolleagues to support health care quality improvement and to refocus \nthe federal government's role in this vitally important area of \nresearch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12591-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12591-S12592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JEFFREY S. MERRIFIELD\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nMr. Jeff Merrifield to the position of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommissioner.\n  Mr. Merrifield was born in Westerly, Rhode Island and spent most of \nhis childhood in Antrim, New Hampshire. In 1985, Jeff graduated Magna \nCum Laude with his B.A. from Tufts University. In 1986, he joined \nSenator Gordon Humphrey's staff and handled energy and environmental \nissues. I first came to the Senate in 1990 and I was fortunate that \nJeff was one of several staffers who carried over from Senator \nHumphrey's staff to mine.\n  While working for Senator Humphrey and me, Jeff put himself through \nGeorgetown Law School. He graduated in 1992 after which he began work \nfor the Washington D.C. based law firm of McKenna and Cuneo. There, he \npracticed environmental and government contracts law until 1995. I was \nvery pleased to have Jeff returned to my staff in 1995 to be my counsel \nfor the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk \nAssessment. He was the lead staffer in developing my Superfund \nreauthorization legislation.\n  During his time with the Senate, Jeff has been involved with all \naspects of solid and hazardous waste disposal and cleanup regulation. \nHe took part in a number of bills including the Price Anderson \nreauthorization, the Oil Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act \nreauthorization, efforts to reauthorize both Superfund and RCRA, and \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Act (ISTEA I).\n  In addition to his duties on the Committee, Jeff has also been \nextensively\n\n[[Page S12592]]\n\ninvolved in assisting me on the Armed Services Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces, which I chair. He has provided me with valuable \noversight of hazardous and radiological waste programs at DOD and DOE \nfacilities.\n  Jeff's philosophy as Commissioner will be that the NRC cannot take a \nsolitary role in maintaining full public confidence in the safety of \nnuclear power. He has said that the nuclear industry must also assume \nequal responsibility for taking the steps necessary to maintain the \ntrust of the American public.\n  Mr. President, Jeff has done a great job for me over the years. \nAlthough I'm sorry to lose him from my staff, I'm confident that he \nwill provide the NRC with the talents necessary to ensure adequate \nprotection of the public health and safety, the common defense and \nsecurity, and the environment in the use of nuclear materials in the \nUnited States. Jeff is a bright, dedicated and articulate individual \nwho will serve the nation with distinction. I strongly recommend him \nfor the position of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12591-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate today on the \npassage of the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998. \nThis bill reauthorizes the programs funded through Titles VII and VIII \nof the Public Health Service Act. These programs are intended to \nincrease access to primary care and to improve the distribution of \nmembers of the health professions--physicians, dentists, pharmacists, \nnurses, and others--to underserved areas. For many years, this \nlegislation has helped our nation's schools of health serve the needs \nof their communities better and prepare the health care practitioners \nof the future. This bill provides a comprehensive and flexible \nauthority to support training programs for health professions and \nrelated community-based educational partnerships. It will improve the \nquality, diversity, and distribution of the work force.\n  The Senate has worked diligently on this effort for the past four \nyears. Reauthorization has been a priority since the authority expired \nfor Title VII programs in 1995 and for Title VIII programs in 1994. In \n1995, Senators Kassebaum, Kennedy, and I introduced S. 555 to take the \n44 programs involved and consolidate them into six groups or clusters. \nPerformance outcomes and improved data collection were added. This \napproach was used to streamline the granting process, and to allow the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services greater flexibility to leverage \nareas of development; and to align with community workforce needs. It \nalso provided flexibility for strategic planning of the workforce \nsupply, and insured that a greater percentage of program dollars would \ngo directly to grantees versus federal administration.\n  After this bill, S. 555, passed in the Senate but failed to pass in \nthe House during the 104th Congress, I identified areas of disagreement \nand developed ways to address these obstacles. At a hearing in April \n1997, I had the opportunity to listen to concerned groups and outline \npossibilities for compromise. My staff has worked very hard to maintain \na high level of input from constituency groups. We worked with the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus to address their concerns. We worked to \nensure that this bill lived up to the goal of increasing the number of \nunderrepresented minorities in the health professions. We are very \npleased that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus supports S. 1754.\n  This bill enjoys broad support in the medical and public health \ncommunity. The bill is supported by a broad range of professional \nsocieties for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, dentists, \nand others.\n  S. 1754 establishes a program with the flexibility to respond to \nchanges in the workforce. Flexibility is built into the bill over time. \nAs funding lines change, the Secretary's authority to move funds across \nprogram lines increases. This revision will allow programs to address \nthe constantly changing health care needs of communities and respond to \nthe changes in the health care delivery system.\n  Since so much of the Act's flexibility is based on the discretion of \nthe Secretary, we have added advisory councils to ensure that the view \npoints of those providing medical services are considered. This will \ngenerate confidence among the grantees and encourage collaboration \nbetween agency officers and the programs they manage. In addition, \nthese councils will report back to Congress to ensure oversight of \nthese programs.\n  However, flexibility alone will not result in successful targeting of \nresources. As noted by the Government Accounting Office in testimony to \nthe Senate Labor Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety in April \n1997, federal efforts should be based on performance measures and \nachievement of goals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will \nensure that there is an annual evaluation of programs and projects \nfunded through this legislation.\n  It was very important to maintain the distinct and separate funding \nfor nurse education--Title VIII, the ``Nursing Education and Practice \nImprovement Act of 1998.'' We wanted to increase the flexibility of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to target funding and to \nrespond to the nursing workforce needs of a rapidly changing health \ncare system. S. 1754 strengthens the role of the National Advisory \nCouncil on Nursing Education and Practice. We rewrote the duties of the \nCouncil so that it not only provides advice and recommendations to the \nSecretary and the Congress but also to report its findings and \nrecommendations annually. In addition, S. 1754 specifies that the \nCouncil include representatives of advanced practice nursing groups, \nincluding nurse practitioners.\n  The bill specifically states that authorized nurse practitioner \nprograms have as their objective the education of nurses who will \nprovide primary health care. For advanced practice nurse traineeships, \nthe Secretary shall give special consideration to those programs that \nagree to train advanced practice nurses who will practice in health \nprofessional shortage areas. The amendment proposed and passed by the \nHouse further clarifies how funding for training for nurse midwives, \nnurse practitioners, and nurse midwives will be allocated. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, in consultation with \nindividuals in the field of nursing, will develop a methodology, based \non data, to allocate training funds. The data for this methodology will \ninclude the need for and distribution of services among underserved \npopulations and health professional shortage areas, and the percentage \nof the population that are minorities, elderly, or below the poverty \nlevel. The methodology will be in place by fiscal year 2003. Until the \nmethodology is developed, the funding for nurse practitioners, nurse \nmidwives, and nurse anesthetists will be ``held harmless''. The House \namendment also clarifies the use of the definition of an advanced \npractice nurse in S. 1754.\n  Mr. President, this bill creates new partnerships and supports \nexisting ones. It represents the best example of team work among \ninterest groups, agencies and legislators. Through the goals of \nimproving the distribution and quality of health professions in \nunderserved areas and of simplifying the administration of existing \nprograms, this bill fosters change. The Health Professions Education \nPartnerships Act of 1998 will help underserved areas meet their future \nhealth care needs.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of our work. I would like to take this \nopportunity to specifically thank, Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, and \nBingaman, and all their staffs for their efforts to work with us on \nthis bill. I would also like to thank the interest groups which gave so \ngenerously of their time and support to help us address the issues \ninvolved. Mr. President, I especially thank Dr. Mary Moseley, Dr. Carol \nPertowski, Dr. Debra Nichols, and Sue Ramthun of my staff for their \ndedication and hard work toward the reauthorization of these programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12592-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12592-S12593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS NETWORK\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I take this opportunity to call my \ncolleagues' attention to the role of women owned businesses in our \neconomy, and\n\n[[Page S12593]]\n\nparticularly in Colorado. The Business Women's Network (BWN), which is \na network of 1200 women's associations working in concert to expand all \nwomen's inclusion in business development, is helping towards that end. \nTonight, the BWN will be hosting an event to honor its members and the \nmany structures which serve the development of women's business.\n  Colorado enterprises which embody well-developed and successful \nbusiness ventures include: the Colorado Women's Business Office, which \nrepresents more than 75,000 women and 50,000 girls; the Denver Women's \nBusiness Network; the Casa Career Development and Business Center for \nWomen; the Southern Colorado Women's Chamber of Commerce; the \nUniversity of Colorado Women's Resource Center; the Women Owner, \nManagers and Executive Network of Colorado Springs; the Women's \nFoundation of Colorado; the Women's Library Association in Denver, and \nmany others. Colorado's success in identifying and nurturing a strong \nbase of women owned businesses provides a model for other states \nseeking to conquer the spectrum of needs and obstacles that confront \nwomen entrepreneurs.\n  National recognition is in order. Last year, the women-owned \nbusinesses in the Denver metro area had the highest regional growth \nrate in the country, at 57%. Both employment and sales increased four-\nfold. The translation for Coloradans is easy. As a state, we enjoy more \nthan 77,600 women-owned businesses that provide jobs for almost 208,000 \npeople, to the tune of $23 billion in annual sales.\n  The Business Women's Network is important because it profiles all \nwomen's groups, both nationally and globally, in salute of their \nachievements. Today, I wish to single out for special honor the solid \nfoothold women's business has in Colorado's unparalleled economy. I \nalso want to encourage the continued efforts of BWN--the strong \npresence of women in our world economy cannot be emphasized enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12592-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WHITE RIVER JUNCTION VA CENTER--60 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital and Regional Office Center \nof White River Junction, Vermont. October 16 marks this facility's \nsixtieth anniversary. For six decades it has provided compassionate, \nhigh-quality service to Vermont and New Hampshire Veterans.\n  On October 16, 1938, an elaborate dedication ceremony was held in \nWhite River Junction at the newly completed VA hospital. The next day, \nthe first patient was admitted. In an unusual move, the regional VA \noffice relocated its offices from Burlington to the White River \nJunction location to better serve veterans in processing their claims \nfor benefits. The facility gradually grew over the years. By the end of \nWorld War II, 26 ``Quonset'' huts had to be erected to provide space \nfor the rapidly expanding veterans programs, increasing the hospital's \ncapacity to 250 beds.\n  In 1946, the VA hospital entered into an agreement with Dartmouth \nMedical School to become a teaching hospital, an arrangement that \ncontinues and thrives today. Recognizing the importance of research \nprograms, in 1954, the VA, in partnership with Dartmouth Medical \nSchool, launched a medical research initiative. The research function \nwas significantly expanded in 1992 with the completion of a research \nand education facility that enabled the hospital to perform medical and \nhealth services research, rehabilitation and cooperative studies. In \naddition to these critical fields of study, this facility is helping \nveterans make more informed choices about their medical treatment \nthrough cutting edge outcomes research.\n  From 1971 through 1981, several construction projects were undertaken \nto modernize and expand the hospital. In 1989, the VA began its venture \nof providing community-based outreach centers (CBOCs) to meet veterans' \nprimary care needs in locations closer to their homes. A outreach \nclinic was opened in Burlington, and based on the success of this \nproject, a community clinic was opened in Bennington earlier this year.\n  The White River Junction VA center has also done an exemplary job of \nmeeting more than just the veterans' health care needs. Vermont \nveterans are also very fortunate to have, under the same roof, a very \ncapable group of people to assist them with their benefit needs. The \nstaff is small but mighty when its comes to their advocacy for veterans \nand I greatly appreciate the assistance they have provided Vermont \nveterans, for more than half a century, as well as to my office for the \npast 20 years.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to publicly thank all of the unsung \nheroes associated with this tremendous facility. They know who they \nare--the director of this facility, Gary DeGasta; the dedicated staff \nat the hospital and regional office; the Veterans Service Organizations \nwho donate so much time and money to help provide for veterans; and, of \ncourse, the veterans, who for 60 years have supported the mission of \nthis fine facility with their continuous patronage.\n  To my friends at the VA in White River Junction--Happy Anniversary. \nMay you have many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12593-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12593-S12594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN SUPPORT OF SUBSTITUTE TO H.R. 3433\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nin the form of a substitute to H.R. 3433.\n  Many people with disabilities who have been out of the workforce are \neager to return to work. However, because of the risks of losing cash \nbenefits and health insurance provided through the Social Security \nDisability Insurance program and the Supplemental Security Income \nprogram many beneficiaries are discouraged from entering or re-entering \nthe workforce. The intent of these programs was never to demoralize or \ndishearten Americans who are ready, willing and able to work. We must \nlook at ways to overcome this attitude.\n  Thanks to the disability reform proposal developed by Senator \nJeffords and Senator Kennedy many of the barriers facing people with \ndisabilities will be addressed. Several provisions in the Jeffords-\nKennedy substitute to H.R. 3433 tackle the problems of loss of cash \nbenefits and health insurance which can prevent beneficiaries from \nbeing able to support themselves once they begin working. The \nsubstitute legislation would provide working individuals with \ndisabilities access to additional services under the Medicaid program, \nsuch as personal assistance and prescription drugs. These services are \nvital to many people on SSDI and SSI. Furthermore, this proposal would \nprovide improved access to rehabilitation opportunities for \nbeneficiaries of both the SSI and SSDI programs.\n  The most encouraging parts of this proposal are those that eliminate \nwork disincentives and facilitate self-sufficiency among those with \ndisabilities. This legislation prohibits using work activity as the \nonly basis for triggering a continuing disability review. Moreover, the \nproposal put forth by my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator \nKennedy, would expedite the process of eligibility determinations of \nindividuals who have been on disability insurance but who lost it \nbecause they were working. Also, the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute \ncreates incentives for both disabled beneficiaries and providers of \nvocational rehabilitation to secure jobs for those who want to work. It \nis my hope that this will eliminate shuffling these people from \nvocational rehabilitation programs to state programs without them being \nable to make any real progress.\n  Finally, I want to say how glad I am to see that a component of the \nJeffords-Kennedy substitute includes a proposal to ensure that local \nprisoners will not receive Social Security Disability Insurance \nbenefits. I sponsored legislation in the beginning of the 105th \nCongress to prevent this needless waste of taxpayer dollars by closing \na loophole in the law. Criminals should not be allowed to ``double \ndip'' and receive Federal money earmarked for the purchase of food and \nclothing while they are part of a prison system which provides these \nnecessities already. This proposal would protect the financial \nsoundness of the Social Security Disability Insurance program for the \npeople it is meant to assist.\n  The work Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have put forth on this \nbill characterizes the bipartisanship necessary to pass the proposal \ninto law. I am glad to lend my support to\n\n[[Page S12594]]\n\nthe Senate substitute legislation to H.R. 3433. I look forward to \npassage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12593-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ADDRESSING READINESS ISSUES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to proposed \nincreases in military spending contained in the supplemental \nappropriations provisions for FY 1999, and to comment on even larger \nanticipated proposals for increases in the military budget for fiscal \nyear 2000 and beyond that will be the subject of ongoing debate in \nWashington in the coming months.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of our men and women in \nuniform, and I believe we must provide the best possible training, \nequipment, and preparation for our military forces, so they can \neffectively carry out whatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, war-\nfighting, or other missions they are given. But certain Republican \nproponents of increased defense spending here in Washington are trying \nto use an alleged ``readiness crisis'' to get $1 billion or more \nadditional funding included in the omnibus appropriations bill to be \nconsidered before adjournment. And this is just the first step. Some \nPentagon officials, and Republican defense hawks here in Congress, are \nreportedly already pressing the Administration to increase next year's \nbudget request by up to $15 billion, and by an estimated $50-75 billion \nover the next five years. These numbers are in addition to the grossly \nwasteful and unnecessary military spending of recent years, much of \nwhich was over and above what the Pentagon itself had requested from \nCongress to complete its mission.\n  These large increases are unjustified. Yes, I recognize that to a \ncertain extent there are problems with readiness. There are shortages \nof spare parts in some areas, for example. It is reportedly difficult \nto retain pilots and other key personnel; certain of our armed forces, \nespecially enlisted personnel, are suffering a declining quality of \nlife. But if we look carefully at the military budget we can see that \nthese readiness problems are not caused by inadequate military budgets, \nbut rather by a wasteful and irresponsible, often politically-motivated \nmisallocation of existing defense dollars to military programs and \nprojects in states of key members of Congress. This is the crux of the \nmatter. There is more than sufficient funding in the current budget to \nfix these problems if priorities are reassessed and money is redirected \nfrom wasteful and obsolete weapons programs to crucial readiness \nmeasures.\n  We continue to pour billions into Cold War era weapons programs that \nare essentially massive pork projects for the states and districts of \nvarious members of Congress. Congress has also contributed to the \nreadiness problems by refusing to close military bases which the \nPentagon acknowledges are unneeded and obsolete, and has pressed to \nhave closed. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and his colleagues on \nthe Joint Staff, testified to this recently before the Armed Services \nCommittee--they effectively said if you want us to fix these problems, \nthen stop ramming down our throats weapons systems, ships and planes \nthat we don't need, don't want, and haven't requested--and start \nclosing down antiquated or outdated military bases that we can no \nlonger afford to maintain, for which there is no reasonable purpose.\n  Mr. President, as I've said, I believe in maintaining a strong \nnational defense. We face a number of credible threats in the world \ntoday, including terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. But let's make sure we carefully identify the threats we \nface and tailor our defense spending to meet them. Let's not continue \nto maintain military spending based on the needs of the Cold War.\n  Mr. President, we do not need to spend more on the military. We only \nneed to spend what we have already allocated more intelligently and \nmore honestly. We do not need to give more money to an already bloated \nPentagon for wasteful pork projects when we have so many urgent \nproblems in this country that need attention. We need to focus on \nadequate funding for the hundreds of domestic programs that protect the \nvulnerable; protect our lakes and streams; provide health care for the \nvulnerable elderly; and create expanded opportunities for the broad \nmiddle class, such as student loans and job retraining.\n  The real ``readiness'' crisis, Mr. President, is not in the military \nbudget but in the readiness of the Congress to give up its attachment \nto wasteful pork projects, and in the readiness of Pentagon officials \nto make the hard choices about what programs are really necessary for \nthe restructured military force we need to face the challenges of the \n21st century. I expect that an omnibus bill will pass, and that some \nadditional defense spending will be included in it for Bosnia and other \nneeds. But I hope my colleagues will keep these concerns in mind as the \ndefense spending debate moves forward next year.\n  I intend to press forward my efforts here in the Senate to make sure \nwe more responsibly balance our defense and domestic priorities, by \nscaling back wasteful defense spending, and reallocating existing \nmilitary funds to address our readiness problems, so that we can invest \nmore in the skills and intellect and character of our children; in \nbasic health care for all; in decent education, affordable housing and \njobs that can sustain families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12594-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12594-S12596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in these last few days of the 105th \nCongress, when I come to the floor, I often look wistfully to the aisle \njust to my left here, where Dale Bumpers has trod up and down yanking \nthe microphone cord and dispensing wisdom for just about twenty-four \nyears now. The other day he gave his last speech here, and it was \nbrilliant--an eloquent and moving reminder of the best purposes of \npolitics. But now I want to look back and pay tribute to my friend Dale \nBumpers for what he has done and what he has been for me, for the \nSenate, for his beloved Arkansas and for our country.\n  Dale Bumpers was born in Charleston, Arkansas in 1925, and it's from \nthat little town he first drew the values he has eloquently proclaimed \non this floor for two and a half decades. In a small town in western \nArkansas during the Depression, young Dale Bumpers learned about human \nsuffering and deprivation, learned to believe that it could be defeated \nand came to understand, on his father's knee, that the government could \nbe a force for good in that struggle. He saw typhoid in his hometown \nand saw a New Deal program put an end to it. He saw rural \nelectrification light the countryside, projects that made the water \ncleaner, the roads safer, he saw the WPA and he saw the tenacity, and \nthe ingenuity and the sense of community of the American people. One \nday as a boy he went to the nearby town of Booneville and saw Franklin \nRoosevelt himself, and he heard his father tell him that politics is an \nhonorable profession--he took all that to heart and we are all the \nricher for it. He sometimes says, as his father did, ``When we die, \nwe're going to Franklin Roosevelt.''\n  In 1943, Dale Bumpers joined the Marines. He shipped out to the \nPacific and he expected to be a part of the invasion force that would \nhit the beaches of Japan. He did not expect to survive it. The invasion \nnever came, but that experience made a profound impression on him. When \nI hear him speak about the Constitution, our Founding Fathers and the \nflag on this floor it is plain how that wartime experience helped him \ncomprehend the true stakes of the constitutional debate, how it \ninformed his notions of patriotism and his sense of what America means. \nWhen he returned from the service he got a first-rate education at the \nUniversity of Arkansas and Northwestern University Law School, all paid \nfor, he is quick to point out, by Uncle Sam under the GI bill. He has \nbeen returning the favor to the American people ever since.\n  Dale Bumpers started his career as a country lawyer in Charleston, a \nvery successful one by all reports, and he got a reputation around \nArkansas, even if he was, as he says, ``the entire membership of the \nSouth Franklin County Bar Association.'' As time went by, his practice \ngrew, he took over his father's hardware store, he taught Sunday School \nand sang in the church choir and he and his wonderful wife Betty \nstarted a family. But he wasn't feeling complacent.\n\n[[Page S12595]]\n\n  There are a lot of great Dale Bumpers stories many people don't know. \nIn the days following the Brown v. Board of Education decision, tension \nwas building in the South as school integration looked more and more \ninevitable. By 1957, we had the Little Rock Crisis, but there was one \ntown in Arkansas that had already integrated by then, without any great \ntrouble. It was the first in Arkansas, maybe the first in the entire \nsouth. It was Charleston, Arkansas, where Dale Bumpers was a young \nlawyer, representing the school board. He saw what was coming and he \nknew what was right. He did a little research and he found out how much \nthe district was spending to bus its black students to Fort Smith. He \nmade his case to the school board about the right course, working those \nnumbers into the argument. The board then voted to do what he had \nadvised them to do--integrate the schools. It was not long after that \nhe helped to integrate his church--the pastor of the local black \nMethodist church approached the all white congregation of his Methodist \nchurch, seeking help to repair a leaky roof. Why spend all that money \nand have two churches, why not just join our two churches together, \nsaid Dale Bumpers, and it was done. Those are two quiet little pieces \nof history that tell us plenty about the principles and the persuasive \npowers of Dale Bumpers.\n  Well, after a while, school board politics were getting to him, so \nDale decided he would like to be the Governor of Arkansas. So off he \nwent, eighth out of eight in the early primary polls, to do battle with \nOrval Faubus and other established politicians. His critics said he had \n``nothing but a smile and a shoeshine.'' But then the people of \nArkansas heard what he had to say. He beat everybody but Faubus in the \nprimary, beat Faubus in the runoff and then he beat Winthrop \nRockefeller. Arkansas had never seen a governor like Dale Bumpers. He \nreformed everything from education to heath care and gained the lasting \naffection of the people while doing it.\n  After four years as Governor, he decided he wanted to go to the \nSenate. All that stood in his way was J. William Fulbright, an \ninstitution in his own right. But Bumpers won, and he came to the \nSenate. As we have seen, this chamber is the place where he always \nbelonged.\n  When I came to the Senate, I had heard of Senator Bumpers' \nintelligence, his quick wit, his impatience with wasteful spending, his \nvigorous defense of the environment and his role as a relentless \nguardian of our Constitution. When it comes to amending the \nConstitution. Dale Bumpers always says, ``I'm a founding member of the \n`Wait Just a Minute' club.'' That is a great line, but it tells of a \nSenator who has risked defeat, has felt real contempt from those who \ndisagree, all because he would not stand for the political use of the \nConstitution. He gave a great speech once called ``The Trivialization \nof the Constitution'' in which he made the case that we must never \ncasually fiddle with our Constitution for political gain or to deal \nwith transitory policy issues. His work to defend the Constitution and \ninject sobriety into the constitutional debate, all by itself, \nqualifies him as a great patriot and senator. Let the record reflect \nthat I too am a member of the ``Wait Just a Minute'' club.\n  Dale Bumpers' leadership in cutting wasteful spending and his fiscal \nforesight are unsurpassed. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan was calling the \nshots in the budget debate, Dale Bumpers was one of only three Senators \nto oppose Reagan's tax cuts and support the spending cuts. If their \nposition had prevailed, the budget would have been balanced in 1984. \nThat was fourteen years ago. Now there's a fiscal role model.\n  Senator Bumpers went after what we now call ``corporate welfare'' \nyears before the term was coined, and years before others were willing \nto focus on the problem of government waste. From the international \nspace station to the 1872 Mining Law, Senator Bumpers has been resolute \nin his pursuit of excesses in the federal budget. He has gone after \nsacred cows and hidden pork, and faced strong opposition from both \nsides of the aisle. But he has continued his work, tirelessly and often \nthanklessly, because he knows he is doing what is right for the \nAmerican people. I have often felt great pride standing with Dale \nBumpers on an amendment, even when we knew we would lose, because when \nhe made a stand, his allies knew they were doing the right thing.\n  His campaign against government waste is matched only by his efforts \nto protect the environment as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. Senator Bumpers has been an \noutstanding leader on the committee, and has exhibited a conservation \nethic unparalleled in the U.S. Senate. Dale Bumpers was the first \nSenator to sound the alarm about the ozone layer and the danger of \nozone-depleting gases, long before most of us had ever heard of them. \nAnd he always remembered his father's hardware store--there never was a \nmore relentless defender of small business in the Senate.\n  I have been honored to work with him on a number of conservation \nefforts, including public land reform and nuclear energy issues, and I \nknow the Senate will miss his leadership in that area. His work to \nreform the 1872 mining law is the issue where his environmental \nstewardship and his determination to cut wasteful spending have gone \nhand-in-hand. I have been proud to join him in this fight, because it's \na crucially important one, an ``outrage,'' as he calls it, that \nwouldn't be under scrutiny today if it weren't for the work of Senator \nBumpers. And I am confident, Senator Bumpers, that your view will \nprevail on the mining law soon enough, because you are right and \neverybody knows you're right.\n  Everybody thinks of Dale Bumpers first and foremost as an orator, a \nstory teller, a raconteur and a dispenser of folk wisdom. He is common \nsense with a silver tongue and a sense of history. So let me finish my \nremarks with a tribute to his oratorical style. Dale Bumpers often \ndecried the idea that we could eliminate the deficit by cutting taxes \nand raising spending, he said ``That reminds me of the combination \ntaxidermist/veterinarian in my hometown. His slogan was `Either way you \nget your dog back.' '' When he saw a flaw in his opponent's argument he \njumped on it like a duck on a junebug. He might declare. ``His argument \nis as thin as spit on a rock!'' Why is he such a masterful debater? \nBecause he can explain the complex in a simple way, and expose the \ntruth in uncomplicated language, without demagoguery or distortion. As \nhe would say, ``You gotta throw the corn where the hogs can get at \nit.'' He hated deficit spending, and when he saw a budget full of red \nink, he said, ``Well, you pass that and you'll create deficits big \nenough to choke a mule. That's just eating the seed corn!''\n  Being in this body, and having the honor of serving with Dale \nBumpers, has given me an invaluable chance to get to know a remarkable \nman, and to understand what his legacy in this body will mean for \ngenerations to come. The greatest thing he has taught me is not to fear \nthe tough votes. Time and again, from the Panama Canal to the flag \namendment, he has cast the hard votes. Time and again, he has gone home \nto Arkansas and made his case, explaining his votes to the people. He \ndidn't always persuade them all, but he convinced them that his were \nvotes of principle--and the poeple's confidence in his integrity has \nsustained him in the affection of even those Arkansans who disagreed.\n  Dale Bumpers has plenty to be proud of, but he has always remembered \nwho he is and where he came from. He mixed it up with the best of them \nduring debate, but never with rancor. He is quick to point out the work \nof other Senators and his staff when things are accomplished. The other \nday he stood on this floor and thanked his grade school teacher, Miss \nDoll, for encouraging him more than sixty years ago! He never fails to \ncredit all his success to his remarkable wife Betty, who has achieved \nso much in promoting peace and the health of children. He speaks always \nof his family as the wellspring of his values and the source of his \npriorities.\n  So now he leaves the Senate having enriched this country and this \ninstitution in a thousand ways. His wisdom and courage and his \npersistent voice will echo long into the future. To every member of the \nSenate, on both sides of the aisle, Dale Bumpers is an admired friend \nand colleague. To those of us who share his principles and have learned \nfrom his leadership, he is nothing less than a hero. He is one of the\n\n[[Page S12596]]\n\ngreat ones--and you don't need to be all broke out in brilliance to \nknow that. Thank you Dale Bumpers and good luck! I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12594-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DIRK KEMPTHORNE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, six years seems too short a time for a \nman of Dirk Kempthorne's character to serve in the United States \nSenate. In the two years that I have been privileged to work with the \nSenator from Idaho, I have been impressed by both his considerable \nintegrity and also his unwavering dedication to the citizens of Idaho \nand to his fellow countrymen. When I reflect upon Senator Kempthorne's \ntenure in the Senate, I will remember the traits that made him such a \nsuccessful legislator. I will especially remember the thoughtful \napproach the the Senator used when addressing the pressing issues of \nthe day. When Senator Kempthorne chose a course of action, every \nSenator could be certain that his decisions were guided by careful \ndeliberation, broad consultation, and sincere prayer. Now, Senator \nKempthorne has decided to return to his people of Idaho, offering to \nsere their interests closer to home. Selfishly, I and others will miss \nhis quiet strength, his leadership in a pinch, his good judgment, and \nhis deep faith. It has enriched all who have had the privilege of \nserving with him and, I must say, it has been a special source of \nstrength to me. Dirk not only talks the talk, he walks the walk. His \nconcern is for the least among us and his insights are superior. \nWhether he is in a small group meeting, a committee hearing, a \nleadership conference, a Bible study, or on the floor of the United \nStates Senate, Dirk Kempthorne always reveals himself to be a man of \nintegrity. This is so because he is one solid whole. He does not \ncompartmentalize. What you see is what you get, from the surface to the \ncenter.\n  Dirk has called us to higher things than mere public policy. He wants \nour government to make us better, not just richer and more powerful. \nHis service in the Senate has been to that goal. He is both a humble \nservant of a higher calling, and an effective leader. We will miss that \nleadership and strength on issue after issue. We will miss even more \nhis good example, his living proof that one can serve in public life \nand posses the richest qualities of a Christian gentleman. Dirk, we \nwill miss you. You have made us better by your word, your manner, and \nyour life. Our best wishes go with you. Godspeed Dirk Kempthorne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12596-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, since taking my oath of office in January \nof 1963, I have had the high privilege of serving with 323 senators. \nAmong them were some of the giants we read about in history books, \nRichard Russell of Georgia, Everett Dirksen of Illinois, Mike Mansfield \nof Montana, and John Stennis of Mississippi.\n  I have served with men and women of great moral strength and high \nintellect, but, of the 323 senators, I shall always look upon one \nperson as my ``best friend''--Senator Wendell Ford.\n  How does one become a best friend of a stranger? I had some knowledge \nof Wendell before he was elected, because I was then a member of the \nSenate Campaign Committee and serving as the Secretary of the \nDemocratic Caucus. I knew that he was a former State Senator, \nLieutenant Governor, and the 49th Governor of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky before he was elected to the Senate. I also knew that he was \none of the most popular Presidents of the U.S. Junior Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  When I first met Wendell in early 1974, I immediately liked what I \nsaw.\n  I could see that he was ``truth in packaging'' personified. There \nwere no fancy frills, or bells, or ribbons around him. He was down to \nearth. He obviously loved his constituents and without question, \nunderstood them. Immediately, I concluded that he was a ``man of the \npeople.'' Soon, I found myself serving with him on two important \nCommittees--the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation and the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Whenever he stood and raised his voice to defend, advocate, oppose, \nor support a measure, you knew that it related to people.\n  Therefore, I was not surprised when he became the prime mover of the \nNational Voter Registration Act which would ensure that every American \nwho was of age, qualified and wanted to vote was given the opportunity \nto do so. He took away all of the obstacles that stood in their path.\n  He also made certain that when a worker's spouse was ill at home, he \nor she was given the right to be with their loved ones in their time of \ngreat need. He knew what it was to be a husband and a father. And he \nknew what it meant to comfort wives and children in time of need. When \nWendell became the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, first and \nforemost on his agenda was passenger safety.\n  He was always ready to carry the banner for the working man and \nwoman. And during the recent tobacco legislation debates, Wendell's \nvoice was one of the very few that spoke out for the tobacco farmer. \nHis concern was not for the wealthy Chief Executive Officers. His \nconcern was for the poor farmer who had to struggle, day in and day \nout, to eke out a livelihood.\n  Wendell also spoke out for the miners who worked in the deep coal \nmines, and for those who had been discriminated against in employment \nbecause of their age. He was a ``work horse,'' never a ``show horse.'' \nWhen others would give eloquent speeches on cutting the cost of \ngovernment, he did something about it. He led the movement to adopt a \ntwo-year budget, thereby saving millions of dollars by streamlining our \nbudgetary process.\n  He introduced the measure that is responsible now for using recycled \nprinting paper by the federal government, thus saving millions of \ndollars. After all, the paperwork of the federal government today, with \nall the technological advances, still uses more than 480,000 tons of \npaper annually. However, before Wendell Ford got into the act, it was \nnearly double that amount.\n  As a politician, he wanted to make certian that campains were carried \nout without corruption and without impediments. He streamlined voter \nregistration procedures, and did everything to increase voter \nparticipation in federal elections.\n  Wendell Ford's departure from the Senate will leave a huge void in \nthe committee rooms and in the Senate Chamber. It is difficult for me \nto imagine that next year we will not hear his voice rising to defend \nthe working man and woman.\n  We will not hear his voice to insist upon safety for our traveling \npublic. And we will not hear his voice for good and clean government. I \nhope that the people of Kentucky will someday come to the realization \nthat they and the people of this nation were blessed with the service \nof Wendell Ford.\n  Winston Churchill just prior to his retirement from active government \nservice said, ``Service to the community is the rent we pay for living \non this earth.'' Wendell Ford has been paying his rent throughout his \nlife.\n  It will be difficult for me to say goodbye to my good friend. It will \nbe difficult no matter how good a person his successor may be, to fill \nhis ``huge boots.''\n  But most importantly, I agree with my wife, Maggie, that what makes \nWendell a good husband, a good father, and decent human being is the \nfact that he had the good sense to marry his beloved Jean. Without \nJean, Kentucky and our nation would have been denied the great service \nof Wendell H. Ford.\n  Wendell and Jean, you have my best wishes for continued happiness and \nfulfillment in the bright years ahead. We shall miss you immensely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12596-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12596-S12597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RETIREMENT OF SENATORS\n\n\n                              wendell ford\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor Senator \nWendell Ford for his long and distinguished record of service in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  A vigorous defender of his home state, Wendell Ford's raspy voice has \nspoken out for the people of Kentucky and the entire nation with \nintelligence, tenacity and humor, winning him the respect and affection \nof his colleagues.\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\n  Of Senator Ford's many accomplishments during his years of public \nservice, his positions in the Senate's Democratic leadership and as \nChairman of the Senate Rules Committee stand out as invaluable \ncontributions to his party and his country. I have greatly appreciated, \nas have all my Democratic colleagues, the outstanding job Senator Ford \nhas done as the Democratic whip, and the dedication he has shown to the \ncaucus. Here on the floor, Wendell Ford has exhibited an uncommon \ncommitment to fairness.\n  Kentuckians can also be proud of Senator Ford's sponsorship of the \nMotor Voter bill and longstanding support of government reforms, which \nare a testament to his commitment to the democratic principle of \ngovernment.\n  I want to wish Senator Ford all the best for his well-earned \nretirement, and thank him for his many contributions to American \npolitical life.\n\n\n                            dirk kempthorne\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to wish all the best to Senator \nKempthorne as he leaves the Senate. Senator Kempthorne and I both \njoined the Senate in 1992, and both, as very junior senators, initially \nfound ourselves with offices in the basement of the Dirksen building.\n  Senator Kempthorne has always demonstrated a strong grasp of policy \nissues, including his work on unfunded mandates, and has always \nconducted himself with the highest degree of professionalism in the \nSenate. I thank him for his service, and wish him well in his new \nendeavors.\n  Now he returns to Idaho to seek the office of governor. Whatever \nhappens in that race, the people of Idaho will know that he is a \nthoughtful man of grace and civility.\n\n\n                               john glenn\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to take this opportunity to \nthank Senator John Glenn for his long and distinguished service in the \nUnited States Senate. He has served this body with great dignity, and \nwith an unparalleled commitment to our country.\n  Of course, Senator Glenn is known for a great deal more than his \nSenate service, as the first man to orbit the earth and a hero in both \nWorld War II and the Korean War. But his contributions here in the \nSenate, all by themselves, have made for Senator Glenn the legacy of an \nAmerican hero.\n  I worked with Senator Glenn in 1993 on an amendment to the Clean \nWater Act, which was just one of his many efforts to focus \nenvironmental protection efforts on the Great Lakes region. The Great \nLakes states owe a great debt to Senator Glenn for his work in this \narea, which has included chairing the Senate's Great Lakes Task Force \nand helping to get Great Lakes regional offices for the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  As the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Glenn has been fairminded and provided outstanding \nleadership on the committee, in particular during the recent hearings \ninto campaign finance violations. During those hearings, Senator Glenn \nshowed his keen understanding of the flaws in the current system and \nhis commitment to its reform. As someone who cares deeply about \ncampaign finance issues, I was grateful for his leadership.\n  Senator Glenn has also worked tirelessly on nuclear proliferation \nissues, and been a valued member of the Armed Services Committee, the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, and the Special Committee on Aging.\n  Now Senator Glenn is moving on to his newest challenge, and, as \nusual, making history. At the age of 77, he will again launch into \nspace, this time for a nine-day ride on the Shuttle Discovery. Most of \nus would be content being the first man to orbit the earth, flying 149 \ncombat missions, and breaking a transcontinental flight speed record in \na Navy jet. But then John Glenn has more determination, more talent and \nmore courage than most of us can imagine. He must know that he is not \njust respected and famous, he must know that he holds a special place \nin the hearts of his fellow Americans and in American culture, yet \nthere is no humbler man in the Senate. We admire him for that, we thank \nhim for his dedicated service to the U.S. Senate, to the people of Ohio \nand to America. We wish him every success on his next mission, and wish \nhim all the best in his retirement.\n\n\n                               dan coats\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer my best wishes to \nSenator Coats as he retires from the Senate this year. I have enjoyed \nworking with him in areas where we agree, and I have always respected \nhis viewpoint when we have differed. He is a gentleman in the best \ntradition of the Senate.\n  I have appreciated Senator Coats leadership in several areas, \nincluding his commitment to the line-item veto, which I agree can be a \npowerful tool against wasteful spending. Senator Coats has also taken \non the issue of solid waste disposal, calling for more state discretion \nover what types of waste are disposed of within individual states. In \nWisconsin, where we have a strong recycling program and create less \nsolid waste than many states, we share Senator Coats' belief that \nstates deserve to be heard on this issue, and not be forced to accept \nunwelcome garbage.\n  Senator Coats has also been a leader among the ``donor states'' in \nISTEA funding for a more equitable distribution of highway funds, \nanother issue of great importance to Wisconsin, where we again \nappreciate his commitment to fairness.\n  Senator Coats now voluntarily walks away from the Senate, still a \nyoung man, with humility and dignity, sure to find success in private \nlife. As he leaves the Senate, I thank him for his years of service in \nthis body and in the House of Representatives, and I wish him all the \nbest in his new endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12596-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12597-S12598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DAN COATS\n\n  Mr. SESSION. Mr. President, many have spoken more eloquently than I \nof the contributions made to this body and to this nation by Dan Coats. \nI will not try to describe his distinguished career or to list his \nlegislative achievements, but I will, once again, attempt to review the \nqualities that have made Dan Coats special to me and to so many others.\n  First, he is a man of faith who lives that faith and allows it, \nshockingly to some, to actually affect how he votes and how he does his \njob. He is fully apprized of all the technical data and the Senate \nprocedures required for effective service in the Senate on the Armed \nServices Committee and the Labor and Human Resources Committee. But, \nthe strength of his service goes beyond technical skills--Dan brings \nhonesty, strong principle and faith to every issue he faces. He does \nnot approach these issues in a shallow or parochial fashion, but \ninstead brings perspective to these matters that only comes from faith. \nFaith shapes what he does. It inspires others. It has inspired me, an \nevent for which I am most grateful. Dan Coats is generous, kind, loving \nand courteous. He is also courageous. He cares about our nation and he \nwants it to achieve its highest and best goals. He knows that \ncoarseness, selfishness, dishonesty, and meanness must not be our norm. \nSo, while Dan tended to the daily duties of the Senate, he always kept \nhis eye on the permanent things. Whether he was working quietly behind \nthe scenes, or passionately on the floor, Dan has sought to ensure that \nour nation's policies result not only in making us stronger and richer, \nbut also better. Dan knows, to the depth of his being, that God desires \ngoodness, humility, honesty and justice more than power, fame and \nwealth. Indeed, Dan has steadfastly and in a winsome manner, worked, \nperhaps more than any other Senator, to cause the members of this body \nto think on these things. He has encouraged us, as the prophet Habakkuk \nsays, ``to walk on my high places''. He has shown that one person can \nimprove the lives of others by articulating and living a message of \nfaith. That Dan is national president of the Big Brothers organization \nis not surprising. He knows that profound change comes one life at a \ntime, not through the expenditure of a few more governmental dollars. \nAnd, though he has served in the most exemplary fashion as a United \nStates Senator, still, to paraphrase, nothing has so become him as his \nmanner of leaving. He, with grace and diginity, has just walked away. \nDan knows, he really knows, that this great Senate, this earthy pit, \ntoo often leads us to believe, by our own pride and self deception, \nthat we control our own destinies,\n\n[[Page S12598]]\n\nthe destinies of others, and the destiny of the world. And, most \nimportantly, he knows that such price is false. Dan knows that another \npower controls this world, a power far beyond our imaginings. While we \nhave governmental duties to fulfill, we must also listen to that still, \nsmall voice. It is not only important to listen, but to obey. Dan does \nboth. He has just walked away from this Senate and the wise think this \ndecision is foolish. But, as he leaves this body, and begins a new \nperiod in his life of obedience, none can know precisely what the \nfuture will hold anymore than Abraham did when he was called. But, when \nhe was called, he went. As Dan Coats leaves this Senate, we are all \nsaddened because we love him, admire him, and because we will miss his \nguidance. Certainly, he has loved us first and uplifted this senator \nand others with his example. With grace and strength he has dropped the \ntrappings of power to serve in another way. His example, Mr. President, \nis bright and pure. We watch with love and awe. Godspeed Dan Coats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12597-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join others to comment \non the service provided to America and to Kentucky by Wendell Ford. \nWhile we were members of different political parties, I often had the \nopportunity to hear him speak on this floor and to observe him \nrepresent his party as a Democratic leader. He is strong, experienced, \nfilled with good humor and a tough advocate for his state and for his \nbeliefs. I was honored to be the presiding officer for the Senate on \nthe day in which Wendell Ford eclipsed the service record of a host of \noutstanding Kentucky senators and became the longest serving Senator \nfrom that great state.\n  While he loves government, politics and the debate that goes with \nthis office, he is a family man at heart. He has the sense of a \nsoutherner. He remembers his friends and he loves his state.\n  He is also independent. I recall one late night that we were debating \nwhether to limit the high attorneys' fees in the tobacco cases. Senator \nFord came on the floor and I noticed him looking my way during the \ndebate. As we concluded, he asked if I would yield for a question. I \nanswered his inquiry as best I could and he firmly nodded. Even though \nhis party was strongly against my amendment, and no one could doubt \nthat Wendell Ford is a good Democrat, he voted for the amendment and it \npassed by one vote.\n  Those are the things that you remember and are a good example for all \nof us. While we want to be loyal, we are also independent.\n  Mr. President, we are losing one of our more notable members. We will \nmiss the richness of his experience, the sharp debate, and the good \nhumor. While our association has been a short one, I have enjoyed and \nbenefitted from it, and expect that it will continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12598-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nALLOWING HASKELL INDIAN NATIONS UNIVERSITY AND THE SOUTHWESTERN INDIAN \n     POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE EACH TO CONDUCT A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4151, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4151) to amend chapter 47 of title 18, United \n     States Code, relating to identity fraud, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \npassing H.R. 4151, the ``Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence \nAct.'' This is virtually identical to the Kyl-Leahy substitute to \nS.512, which passed the Senate unanimously on July 30, 1998. This bill \npenalizes the theft of personal identification information that results \nin harm to the person whose identification is stolen and then used for \nfalse credit cards, fraudulent loans or for other illegal purposes. It \nalso sets up a ``clearinghouse'' at the Federal Trade Commission to \nkeep track of consumer complaints of identity theft and provide \ninformation to victims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath.\n  Protecting the privacy of our personal information is a challenge, \nespecially in this information age. Every time we obtain or use a \ncredit card, place a toll-free phone call, surf the Internet, get a \ndriver's license or are featured in ``Who's Who,''in the form of \npersonal information, which can be used without our consent or even our \nknowledge. Too frequently, criminals are getting hold of this \ninformation and using the personal information of\n\n[[Page S12605]]\n\ninnocent individuals to carry out other crimes. Indeed, U.S. News & \nWorld Report has called identity theft ``a crime of the 90's''.\n  The consequences for the victims of identity theft can be severe. \nThey can have their credit ratings ruined and be unable to get credit \ncards, student loans, or mortgages. They can be hounded by creditors or \ncollection agencies to repay debts they never incurred, but were \nobtained in their name, at their address, with their social security \nnumber or driver's license number. It can take months or even years, \nand agonizing effort, to clear their good names and correct their \ncredit histories. I understand that, in some instances, victims of \nidentity theft have even been arrested for crimes they never committed \nwhen the actual perpetrators provided law enforcement officials with \nassumed names.\n  The new legislation provides important remedies for victims of \nidentity theft. Specifically, it makes clear that these victims are \nentitled to restitution, including payment for any costs and attorney's \nfees in clearing up their credit histories and having to engage in any \ncivil or administrative proceedings to satisfy debts, liens or other \nobligations resulting from a defendant's theft of their identity. In \naddition, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to keep track \nof consumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to \nvictims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath.\n  This is an important bill on an issue that has caused harm to many \nAmericans. It has come a long way from its original Senate formulation, \nwhich would have made it an offense, subject to 15 years' imprisonment, \nto possess ``with intent to deceive\" identity information issued to \nanother person. I was concerned that the scope of the proposed offense \nin the original Senate version of the bill would have resulted in the \nfederalization of innumerable state and local offenses, such as the \nstatus offenses of underage teenagers using fake ID cards to gain \nentrance to bars or to buy cigarettes, or even the use of a borrowed ID \ncard without any illegal purpose. This problem, and others, were \naddressed in the Kyl-Leahy substitute that was passed by the Senate.\n  This bill appropriately limits the scope of the new offense governing \nthe illegal transfer or use of another person's ``means of \nidentification'' to exclude ``possession.'' This change ensures that \nthe bill does not inadvertently subject innocuous conduct to the risk \nof serious federal criminal liability. For example, with this change, \nthe bill would no longer raise the possibility of criminalizing the \nmere possession of another person's name in an address book or Rolodex, \nwhen coupled with some sort of bad intent.\n  At the same time, the Kyl-Leahy substitute as reflected in H.R. 4151, \nrestores the nuanced penalty structure of section 1028 of the Federal \ncriminal code. Specifically, the bill provides that the use or transfer \nof 1 or more means of identification that results in the perpetrator \nreceiving anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more over a 1-year \nperiod, would carry a penalty of a fine or up to 15 years' \nimprisonment, or both. The use or transfer of another person's means of \nidentification that does not satisfy those monetary and time period \nrequirements, would carry a penalty of a fine and up to three years' \nimprisonment, or both.\n  Finally, again with the support of the Department of Justice, we \ncreated a limited and appropriate forfeiture penalty for these offenses \nand specified the forfeiture procedure to be used in connection with \nthem.\n  I am glad that Senator Kyl and I were able to join forces to craft \nlegislation that both punishes the perpetrators of identity theft and \nhelps the victims of this crime.\n  Finally, an amendment added in the House, at the joint request of \nSenator Hatch and myself, gives the United States Judicial Conference \nlimited authority to withhold personal and sensitive information about \njudicial officers and employees whose lives have been threatened. \nApparently, sophisticated criminals are able to use information set \nforth in publicly available financial disclosure forms to collect more \ndetailed personal information then used in carrying out threats against \nour judicial officers. This amendment is an important step to protect \nthe lives of judges, and I am glad that we were able to accomplish \nthis.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4151) was considered read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/14/senate-section/article/S12604-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.
