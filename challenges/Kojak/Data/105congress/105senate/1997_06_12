DENNIS E. ELLISEN\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Reverend \nDennis E. Ellisen for his wonderful invocation this morning. Reverend \nEllisen is the Pastor of Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Appleton, WI. \nReverend Ellisen has led the congregation there, which has now swelled \nto more than 1,600 people, for the past 21 years.\n  The people of Appleton have been fortunate to have such a \ncompassionate and a strong spiritual leader. During his time there, \nReverend Ellisen has made a profound impact on his community and upon \nhis congregation. As a member of the Goodwill Board of Directors, he \nhelps direct efforts to help the neediest in our State.\n  Perhaps his most significant impact has been in starting the first \nhospice program in the area. As president of the Visiting Nurses \nAssociation, Reverend Ellisen created the first hospice program for \nAppleton. This courageous and humanitarian effort brings care and \ncompanionship to the terminally ill. Without Reverend Ellisen's \nguidance and leadership, that corner of my State would be less special \nand a lot of people's lives in Appleton would be less bright.\n  I thank the Reverend Ellisen for his prayers and words of \nencouragement today and congratulate him on his years of achievement \nfor the people of Wisconsin.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5551-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5551-S5552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDERS FOR TODAY\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes of \nthe Senate's time to discuss an issue of great importance to the self-\nemployed throughout the country, that of making health insurance more \naffordable.\n  Nearly 1.4 million children who live in families headed by a mother \nor father who is self-employed do not have health insurance. If you \nwork for yourself, typically health insurance is very expensive for \nboth you and your family.\n  Congress has an opportunity to make it more affordable for families \nwho work for themselves by treating them fairly under the Tax Code.\n  Currently, large corporations can deduct 100 percent of their share \nof the employee's health care costs, while the self-employed farmer, \nchild care provider, or truck driver can only deduct 40 percent. That \nis totally unfair.\n  It is time that Congress changed the law to allow the self-employed \nto deduct the full cost of health care premiums. Last year, we worked \nwith Senator Kassebaum to move the deductibility up gradually to 80 \npercent of the premiums by the year 2006.\n  That is a great start. Most families cannot afford to wait until the \nyear 2006 to get sick. We want that health care deductibility. That is \npart of the Home Based Business Fairness Act that is also very \nimportant in small business.\n  On Tuesday, Senator Durbin and I sent a letter to the Senate Finance \nCommittee that was signed by 53 Senators, a majority of the Senate, \nurging them to set aside the money to provide 100-percent health care \ndeductibility. And we truly hope that they will.\n  We are confident that with this broad support we can make health \ninsurance more affordable for the families who depend upon the earnings \nof a self-employed father or mother.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5552-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, almost 60 years ago, President \nRoosevelt, in his State of the Union Address, challenged the American \npeople to not simply be content with our own freedom or our own \neconomic progress but to fight for what he called, a world founded upon \nfour essential human freedoms. He described them as the freedom of \nspeech and expression, the freedom of every person to worship God as he \nsees him in his own heart, freedom from want, and freedom from fear of \nattack and aggression anywhere in the world.\n  There was a sense of immediacy to President Roosevelt's remarks. He \nreminds us that these were not simply distant hopes for another time, \nbut in his words, ``It is a definite basis for a kind of world \nattainable in our own time and generation.''\n  The world we live in, Mr. President, is largely the fulfillment of \nhis vision on that day. After two world wars and a long-enduring cold \nwar, we live in a time where democratic values have become common, \nmarkets are open, the rule of law governs the many nations of the \nglobe. From South Africa to the former Soviet Union, across Latin \nAmerica, freedom--free markets and free expression--have become the \ncommon coin of the realm in our time.\n  But because these values are succeeding does not mean that they have \nmet any final triumph. We have been reminded that in the fight for \nhuman freedom, there is no final victory. That is why, Mr. President, I \ntake the floor today to remind our country and my colleagues that it is \ntime to face the terrible truth about China. I raise this question not \nbecause China is not important but because it is central to the issue \nof prosperity and security in the 21st century. There will be no \nseparate future. The free peoples of the world and those who live in \nChina, because of its massive size, rising military power, enormous \neconomic growth and even greater potential, the question about our own \nfreedom and prosperity and most certainly the security of the United \nStates and the allies and other free peoples of the world are \ninexplicably, inevitably tied to the fate of the Chinese people.\n  We have learned in the 20th century the painful lesson that nations \nthat may obtain great economic power inevitably translate that economic \npower into military means, and that military power invites its own use. \nWe have also tragically learned that those nations that rule without \nthe consent of their own people are inherently unstable and inevitably \naggressive.\n  These are truths we do not want to have to recognize. They are facts \nthat I wish could be otherwise, but there is nothing in the history of \nour time that would lead us to any other conclusion and nothing that \ncan lead us to believe that China in any way will be any different.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the record of the Beijing Government, for \nthose who would promote most-favored-nation status and those who do \nnot, for those who seek constructive engagement and those who argue \nagainst it, the record is not only remarkably clear but largely \nindisputable.\n  In recent years, the Peoples Republic of China has shown little to no \nregard for commitments that have been made under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the Missile Control Technology Regime, or the \nChemical Weapons Convention. China has had a largely open policy \nregardless of international commitments or responsible policies of \nnonsignatories by selling technology of a nuclear and missile basis to \nPakistan, Iran, and other governments.\n  In a 1992 memorandum of understanding, China vowed to prohibit the \nexport of any product manufactured by prison labor, but it has almost \ncertainly systematically and knowingly ignored this pledge. Indeed, the \nactivist Harry Wu has documented labor camps where millions of Chinese \nprisoners, against their own will, manufactured goods for export to the \nUnited States and other countries.\n  In March 1996, the Beijing Government responded to the first ever \nfree election held by a Chinese people on the island nation of Taiwan \nby firing missiles off the coast of Taiwan, seeking to intimidate its \npeople and its government.\n  Similarly, the human rights situation within China has continued to \ndeteriorate since the horrible results of its policies in Tiananmen \nSquare. These 8 years later, there not only is no progress on free \nspeech or expression, there is no free speech or expression. Even \ntoday, 300 demonstrators who survived Tiananmen Square with their lives \nremain in jail. Indeed, Mr. President, not a single demonstrator or \norganizer or individual who spoke in sympathy of the events of \nTiananmen Square and was jailed in the days that followed has been \nreleased.\n  There is no freedom of religion. The Dalai Lama remains in exile, a \nprominent Catholic bishop was recently brutalized, and China has \npersecuted more Christians than any other nation on Earth for the \nsingle crime of worshiping their God.\n  There is no freedom from want. The benefits of liberalized trade and \nhigh import tariffs flow to a small, corrupt, ruling elite while 300 \nmillion Chinese live on a single dollar a day.\n  Finally, its neighbors live in increasing fear of attack. A China \nthat cannot provide for its own people finds the means to build \nincreasing military capability with new technology that it both exports \nat will and builds to potentially intimidate its neighbors, including \nthe free government of Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, the facts that I mention today are remarkably not in \ndispute. Those who even now decide their\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nown position on free and liberalized trade with China and those who \nargue for or against constructive engagement will, in a matter of \nweeks, come to this floor to dispute not the facts, only the policy \nconclusion, because there are those who argue in good faith and will do \nso in this Chamber that regardless of these conclusions and all the \nevidence at hand, that if we will only put these facts aside and \ncontinue with a policy of liberalized trade, almost certainly as the \nday follows the night, the Chinese leadership will recognize the error \nof their ways, share their new prosperity with their people, allow free \nexpression within their institutions and among the Chinese people, and \nin due course a new government more respectful of international \ncommitments and of human rights will almost certainly evolve.\n  Mr. President, the simple truth is 8 years have passed since \nTiananmen Square. Free expression is not better; it is worse. Respect \nfor the many faiths has not been enhanced; it has deteriorated. \nCommitment to arms control and a more responsible policy of restricting \ndangerous technologies for nuclear weapons and missile technologies has \nnot been enhanced; it is also worse.\n  Mr. President, we do the cause of freedom and the security of our \ncountry no benefit by postponing reaching the horrible truth. The 21st \ncentury, Mr. President, will be guided by whether or not there is \nprogress in China in respecting her own people and being a responsible \nmember of the international community. This relationship, more than any \nother in the world, will answer the critical question of whether the \n21st century will be more peaceful, more respectful of humankind, and \nrespect human life more than any other single relationship the United \nStates will have with any other nation in the world. The facts would \nargue that this policy of constructive engagement is not leading us to \nthat different future.\n\n  Last year, the United States had a $40 billion trade deficit with \nChina. This year, it will pass $50 billion. Patience and understanding \nis not leading China to recognize their obligations as a trading \npartner. From piracy of copyrighted CD's, to laser discs, to \npharmaceutical products, the United States is losing billions of \ndollars' worth of intellectual property of our own people. In trying to \ncontinue to riddle our barriers with exports, with high tariffs, \nquotas, licensing agreements and discriminatory practices, patience is \nnot leading China to become a responsible trading partner any more than \nit is leading to respect of rights, or religion, or arms control.\n  Mr. President, last week in Detroit, the House minority leader, Mr. \nGephardt, asked that we ground our policy toward China on principle and \nthat it be consistent with other aspects of American foreign policy in \nour own history. He asked us to remember the words of William Allen \nWhite, who said, ``Whoever is fighting for liberty is defending \nAmerica.''\n  The questions that we face with regard to policy on China may be \nlarger because of the enormous power and size of the Chinese nation, \nbut they are not novel. We have faced these issues before in Rhodesia, \nSouth Africa, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. We have \nfound that trade sanctions--and in its most modest form, the denial of \npreferred trade status--is not only a legitimate but an effective means \nof promoting human rights and changing national policies. Jackson-Vanik \nwas a remarkable success in leading the Soviet Union to change its \nimmigration policy toward Jews and dissidents by withholding trade \npreference. Apartheid in South Africa was met by a denial of a policy \nof constructive engagement by simply refusing to allow our markets to \nbe open until South Africa abandoned apartheid, and it succeeded. Those \npolicies worked in the past.\n  Today, we impose much stricter policies toward Cuba, Libya, Iraq, \nIran, and North Korea--in many instances, for the same violations of \narms control agreements, irresponsible sharing of dangerous \ntechnologies, violations of human rights, of religion and speech, for \nthe very same instances that I take this floor today to cite in the \ncase of China and which, ironically, will be ceded by proponents of \nmost-favored-nation status for China, we have a policy of denying trade \npreference. For China, we seek to see a different conclusion, while we \ncede the same facts.\n  Mr. President, I argue, however, for more than consistency. I argue \nthat because China has violated these critical rights of her own \npeople, because her Government continues without the consent of the \ngoverned and therefore is inherently unstable and potentially \ndangerous, because these rights have been violated, trade agreements \nwith the United States have been ignored, because dangerous \ntechnologies are being shared with the world despite commitments to the \ncontrary, China should not be the exception, she should be the rule. \nWithholding these trade preferences are not less important because of \nChina's size and power. They are more important.\n  Mr. President, regardless of our party, our philosophy, or our \nideology, I know no Member of the Senate wants anything but friendship \nwith the Chinese people. They have a rich culture, a great history, and \nin their hands, perhaps more than those of any other people on Earth, \nlies the question of peace, freedom, and prosperity for the many \npeoples of the globe.\n  Mr. President, as President Roosevelt concluded in his State of the \nUnion Address 60 years ago, he reminded us that we needed to be \ngoverned by reality and not hope. He concluded, Mr. President, by \nsaying:\n\n       No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace \n     international generosity, or return of true independence, or \n     world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of \n     religion--or even good business. Such a peace would bring no \n     security for us or our neighbors.\n\n  Mr. President, so be it. The world turns, generations succeed \ngenerations, but some truth remains eternal. The wisdom that Roosevelt \nbrought to that dark day facing the authoritarianism of the Third Reich \nand of fascism, facing the prospect of a cold war he may not have been \nable to predict, but whose dimensions were beginning to become clear, \nthe wisdom of that day can govern us as well. It is time to face the \ntruth about China.\n  I know every Member of this Senate wishes they had a chance to \nrevisit in history the gulag, the concentration camps, all the \nblindness that we brought, the terrible problems of fascism and \ncommunism. We all wish that we could have seen the world as clearly as \nRoosevelt saw it on that day. We didn't all have his wisdom. We could \nnot have all seen the future as clearly.\n  Mr. President, there is no changing history, but there is still time \nfor the 21st century. I rise today, Mr. President, to ask my colleagues \nto see China as it is, not as we would have it be. Someday, we will be \naccountable to the Chinese people themselves, and they will ask: Did \nyou stand with us while we sought to worship our God? Did you defend us \nwhen we wanted to speak to our own future? Did you stand with us when \nwe sought to choose our own government? Or, as you did in Iran, as you \ndid often in the cases of communism, as you did in the early years of \nfascism, did you pretend to see the world as you would have it rather \nthan the facts as they were presented to you? Were you part of change? \nDid you challenge our leaders? Did you put a price on their oppression? \nOr did you conspire with them in silence?\n\n  Mr. President, that is the choice before us. It is not new. It has \nfaced every generation that has ever stood on the floor of this Senate, \nevery generation that ever succeeded the governance of this country. In \na few weeks, when most-favored-nation status becomes an issue on the \nfloor of this Senate, it will come again. I urge my colleagues to \nconfront it with wisdom and reality, recognizing the extraordinary \nconsequences for a new time and a new century, which we so desperately \nwant to be different than the past.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5552-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5553-S5554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \ncongratulating Israel on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of \nJerusalem and in welcoming Senate passage of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 21, which reaffirmed the Senate's views on this issue. This \nimportant event came about as a result of the 1967 Six-Day war, before \nwhich the city of Jerusalem was divided, with Jews denied access to the \nOld City and its holy sites.\n  We should not underestimate the significance of this event. Jerusalem \nhas been undivided now for 30 years. As a result, people of all \nreligious traditions have access to Jerusalem and all its religious \nsites. On this anniversary, and with Senate passage of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 21, we commit ourselves again to seeing that \nJerusalem remains an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic \nand religious group are protected.\n  This anniversary presents a good opportunity for us to assess \nprogress toward peace in the Middle East. While the peace process is \nmoving at a slower pace than many of us would like to see, it is \nimportant to acknowledge the difficulty of the task and the progress \nthat has been made thus far under the Oslo accords. It is also \nimportant to point out the importance of security as the process \nunfolds. Previous terrorist attacks have provided graphic justification \nof Israel's security concerns. I urge the Palestinian Authority to see \nthat its security forces cooperate fully with Israeli security to \nthwart the work of the terrorists.\n  Again, I congratulate the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary of \nthe reunification of Jerusalem, and I commend them for ensuring that \nthis holy and historic city is undivided.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Since there is no other Senator here, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I further ask that, upon the completion of \nmy remarks, the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, be \nrecognized for the 15 minutes that has been allotted to him as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5554-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5554-S5555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEVILS LAKE FLOOD\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have taken to the floor numerous times \nsince the disasters that struck North Dakota and attempted to describe \nto my colleagues the really remarkable series of events that we have \nexperienced: First of all, the greatest snowfall in our State's \nhistory; followed by a winter storm in early April that was the most \npowerful winter storm in 50 years, knocking out the electrical grid to \n80,000 people for more than a week, leaving people with 15-foot \nsnowdrifts, leaving people with the most powerful ice storm that we \nhave ever seen that killed literally hundreds of thousands of cattle in \nNorth and South Dakota and also tied up the transportation system for \nmost of our State, as well as much of South Dakota and parts of \nMinnesota. That was then followed by the 500-year flood, which was \ncataclysmic in Grand Forks. All of the dikes failed, a city of 50,000 \nwas evacuated. Many of those people are still not back in their homes. \nIn fact, 80 percent of the city of Grand Forks was in some way damaged \nby the floods. And, in the midst of all that, a fire broke out that \ndestroyed much of downtown Grand Forks.\n  This is a series of events, unparalleled in our State's history, and \nit has left much of our economy in ruins. It has left people sleeping \non cots, living in cars, wondering what will happen to them next. And, \nas I think everyone here knows now, the disaster bill has been delayed.\n  But the good news is, there are serious negotiations underway to \nresolve this issue and resolve it today, and for that we are extremely \ngrateful.\n  Mr. President, I thought today, because I have spent a great deal of \ntime describing the circumstances in Grand Forks, ND, and in the rest \nof the Red River Valley, that I would take a bit of time to describe \nthe developing disaster in Devils Lake, ND, because not only have we \nhad this remarkable series of events in the Red River Valley, but \nDevils Lake, a town of over 9,000 people, has had a slow-motion \ndisaster occurring. This is one of only two major lakes in North \nAmerica that has a closed basin--no inlet and no outlet. For the last 4 \nyears, the lake has been rising inexorably.\n  This chart shows the historic water level of Devils Lake. This chart \ngoes from 1867 to 1997, 130 years. You can see the recorded history is \nthe blue line. Recorded history starts back in about 1890, and the lake \nwas at about 1,423 feet. It then went into a period of steep decline \nwhere it went down to just over 1,400 feet. But look what has happened \nsince the 1930's. That lake has been rising, sometimes falling, but in \nrecent history, in the last 30 years, rising dramatically. And in the \nlast 4 years, this lake has just gone up and up and up.\n  Some people might say, ``Well, the lake is rising. You know, that's \nnot that big a deal.''\n  Mr. President, this lake is nearly 200 square miles. It is a huge \nlake. It is nearly three times the size of the entire area of the \nDistrict of Columbia. This is a lake that is rising inexorably and is \nacting like a cancer. It is eating everything around it. It is \nsubmerging roads, it is inundating homes and bridges. It is just eating \nup the countryside. In the last 4 years, it has tripled in volume and \ndoubled in size. It is very hard to understand or appreciate this \ncircumstance, because nowhere else in the country do we face anything \nquite like it.\n  Mr. President, if I can just show this next chart, it shows the \nsummary of damages in the Devils Lake area. As this lake level rises, \nyou can see what happens to the cost in terms of damages. Already we \nhave spent over $114 million, and that is just from the Federal \nGovernment, addressing this disaster. But you can see as the water \nlevel rises, the estimates from the Army Corps of Engineers is that we \nwould face over $400 million in Federal costs if the lake level \ncontinues to rise. As I indicated, the Federal Government has already \nspent over $114 million coping with this crisis.\n  This next picture shows the lake and how it has expanded. You can \nsee, this is the luckiest guy in America today. He just got through on \nthis road. He was driving along, and it looks like he escaped from the \nlake. You can see the lake coming over the road. This is actually a \nroad, the Minnewaukan Flats Road, completely covered by water now. You \ncan see the various tree lines.\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\n You can see how this lake has been expanding and expanding very, very \ndramatically.\n  This is one of my favorite pictures, Mr. President, because this \nshows the little town of Minnewaukan, ND, of 400 people, and they have \na sewage lagoon--you can see the outlines of it--surrounded completely \nnow by Devils Lake. When the Federal officials came to Devils Lake, \nthey said to the mayor of the little town of Minnewaukan, ``Gee, why \ndid you build this sewage lagoon so close to the lake?'' And the mayor \nand the local officials laughed and they said, ``Well, when we built \nthis sewage lagoon, it was 8 miles from the lake''--8 miles. That is \nhow this lake has expanded. Mr. President, this is truly an \nextraordinary circumstance.\n  This next picture shows a seed company and what has happened to their \noperation. It is completely surrounded by water now in this area of \nDevils Lake. And this water is deep, by the way. It is just amazing how \nthis lake keeps rising.\n  This picture shows one of the key roads, Highway 57, that connects \nthe city of Devils Lake to the Spirit Lake Nation and to the \ncommunities south of Devils Lake. You can see the wave action. These \nare 5-feet waves on this lake completely breaking over the highway. In \nfact, if we were to go and take this picture today, this entire road \nnow is under water. That is how rapidly this lake is rising. In fact, \nit has come up 4 feet already this year. And now remember, we are not \ntalking about some little tranquil lake, we are talking about a huge \nexpanse of water, a lake that is nearly 200 square miles in size now. \nThat is what we are dealing with here, and the water keeps rising.\n\n  Mr. President, those are the pictures I wanted to show our \ncolleagues. An important point I wanted to make is that in this \ndisaster supplemental bill, there are a number of measures to address \nthis crisis, in addition to the crisis we have in the Red River Valley, \nwhere we had the 500-year flood. We also have provisions to deal with \nthis crisis at Devils Lake.\n  First, is a provision for an emergency outlet. The Corps of Engineers \nhas determined that one of the things we need to do to fight this \ndisaster is to have an emergency outlet, because we are very close to \nthe point at which this lake will find its own outlet. And if it does, \nit will be out of the eastern end of the lake where the water quality \nis, by far, the worst, and it will go over into Stump Lake. At that \ntime, Stump Lake will immediately rise 40 feet. It is hard to get your \nmind around these numbers because this is so massive. But when this \nfinds its natural outlet at 1,446.6 feet--it is right now at 1,442 \nfeet--at 1,446.6 feet, it spills over into Stump Lake, raising that \nlake immediately 40 feet.\n  At 1,457 feet, it spills over into the Sheyenne River Valley, and, as \nI showed the cumulative impact, we are then talking about over $400 \nmillion of cost to the Federal Government. The emergency outlet \nrequires $5 million for the work that needs to be done this year, and \nthat is in this disaster supplemental bill.\n  Second, we need to raise the levy protecting the city of Devils Lake, \nand this legislation directs the Corps to expedite action to raise the \nlevy system protecting the city of Devils Lake. The city right now has \na dike that is protecting it to about 1,445 feet. This provision will \nmove the protection to 1,450 feet, with 5 feet of free board to deal \nwith the wave action on this very large lake.\n  Third, there are provisions for emergency funding for Federal Highway \nAdministration to raise roads, because, as I showed, the main linkage \npoint here is already under water. That road--Highway 57--has to be \nraised and needs to be raised as quickly as possible because it \nprovides the emergency access to all of the communities south of Devils \nLake and the Spirit Lake Nation to the regional hospital and the \nregional shopping center that is in the city of Devils Lake.\n  Fourth, this legislation provides for the Ramsey County rural sewer \nsystem some $600,000 to mitigate damages from the Devils Lake flood to \nthe Ramsey County rural sewer system. As you can imagine, Mr. \nPresident, this is a situation in which the rural sewer system is about \nto float. That is a very bad thing to have happen. All of those \nunderground pipes, as the water table rises, puts enormous hydrological \npressure on that rural sewer system, and they are desperately worried \nthat at any time, those pipes will burst through the ground and float. \nAt that point, the entire rural sewer system is destroyed. It is \ncritically important that that money be approved and be approved as \nquickly as possible.\n  Fifth, and finally, this legislation includes $15 million for the \nNatural Resources Conservation Service to purchase floodplain easements \nfor frequently flooded farmland. Landowners in the Devils Lake basin \nwould be eligible for this voluntary floodplain easement program.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take this time to describe this disaster \nso there is an understanding that not only are we dealing with the \ncrisis in the Red River basin, the cities of Grand Forks and other \ncities up and down the Red River, but that we have a second disaster as \nwell, a slow-motion disaster, and that is the disaster that is \noccurring at Devils Lake and that there are very important matters that \nare included in this disaster supplemental bill that deal with those \nproblems.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, who has spent an enormous amount of time and effort \ndealing with the flooding issues that have afflicted our region of the \ncountry. It seems to me that there is some good news on the horizon, \nand it appears that finally the logjam may be broken. It appears \nfinally, perhaps today, the Congress will pass a bill that contains \nmuch-needed disaster relief that the President will sign and that hope \nand help will be offered and restored to the people of Minnesota, North \nDakota, and South Dakota who are victims of this disaster. Even as it \nappears there are these signs this may happen today, I want to, once \nagain, describe a bit about why we have maintained that it is so urgent \nthat disaster relief be provided for disaster victims.\n  Senator Conrad and I represent the State of North Dakota in the U.S. \nSenate. We are a small State, in many ways. We are 10 times the size of \nthe State of Massachusetts in landmass. It is a pretty big State \ngeographically, but about 640,000 people live in our State. It is a \nwonderful place to live, and we have a lot of wonderful things to talk \nabout with respect to North Dakota.\n  Regrettably, the only thing people from the outside who don't come to \nNorth Dakota regularly see about our State is to tune in on the morning \nshows perhaps on a February morning or January morning, and they see \nthat someone says that there is a blizzard or it is cold in our part of \nthe country. It gets that way sometimes. Other times in January or \nFebruary, it is quite nice. I don't suppose that we could really, in \ngood faith, tell people that in January and February in North Dakota it \nis balmy and sunny and warm and an equivalent vacation spot to \nCalifornia or Florida. I don't suppose we could do that with great \ncredibility. It does get a little cold sometimes.\n  In fact, we had a fellow who was in jail in North Dakota, and from \nhis jail cell, he petitioned a judge to extend his jail sentence for 90 \ndays because he alleged that his rights would be violated if he were \nreleased from jail in December in North Dakota. He said it was too \ncold, didn't have clothing, so on and so forth. He asked the judge if \nthe judge would extend his jail sentence for 90 days. The judge \npromptly told him, no, that he won't extend his jail sentence.\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\n  I don't want the actions of one prisoner to allow people to think \nthat it is so cold, you can't exist in our State. It is a wonderful \nState. But it is true that sometimes in the winter we have some snow, \nsome cold weather, and some wind, and this winter particularly.\n  Those who have watched what has happened in our State know that we \nwere hit with a devastating winter. In North Dakota, we had the \nequivalent of 3 year's worth of snow dumped on our State in nearly 3 \nmonths. Nearly 10 feet of snow fell in the State of North Dakota. We \nsuffered, as a result of that, a real disaster--blizzards, roads \nclosed, lives lost because of white-out blizzards where no one could \nmove, ambulances couldn't get through. And then we had, in addition to \nthe blizzards, finally, a 50-year blizzard, the worst in 50 years, and \nthen the melting of all of that snow and the flooding.\n\n  While people in North Dakota are patient and tough and resilient and \nhave a wonderful spirit, this winter has been tough for them. Most of \nwhat they can do for each other they have done for each other. But \nsometimes you cannot do it all by yourself.\n  I have told my colleagues before of the kinds of individual acts of \nheroism that occurred every day this winter in North Dakota. I told of \nDon Halvorson, who is a hero of mine. I have not met him. I only talked \nto him by telephone. But he symbolizes the spirit of the people in \nNorth Dakota, saying to others who are in trouble, ``Let me help you. \nYou are a neighbor. Let me help.''\n  Don Halvorson was at home one night sleeping at around 3 in the \nmorning near Grafton, ND, out in the country in a farmhouse. Jan Novak \nwas working in town in Grafton, ND. At about 10:30 at night, driving \nout to her home in the country, it was blizzarding, and the blizzard \ngot worse, and it became a whiteout blizzard. You cannot see in a \nwhiteout blizzard; you cannot see the hand in front of your face with \nheavy snowfall and winds of 40 miles per hour, temperatures with 60 and \n80 degrees below zero windchills.\n  Well, Jan Novak, on the way home, could not see and ran off the road \nand became stuck. Her husband became worried, in the middle of this \nblizzard, and could not find her and called the sheriff up in Grafton, \nND. The sheriff sent out some people to look for her. They could not \nsee to drive on the roads.\n  Finally, they had to call off the search. So they began calling all \nof the homes along the roads where they thought Jan Novak might have \ndriven. One of the homes they called at 3 in the morning was Don \nHalvorson's. They said, ``A woman is missing. Have you seen a woman \ndriving on your country road past your place?'' Of course, he could not \nsee the road anyway because of the whiteout blizzard, but Don said, \n``No,'' and then he went back to bed.\n  But then he said he could not sleep. So at 3:30 in the morning he got \nback up, got out of bed, in the middle of the blizzard, and put on his \nwinter clothes and trudged out to his tractor. He had a cab on his \ntractor. He got in that tractor cab, started up the tractor, and with \nhis tractor lights started driving.\n  About 3 hours later Jan Novak--when I called her she said she had \nbeen in the car all of that night, starting the engine to try to keep \nwarm, and finally it was not starting very well. And the temperature \nand the blizzard was such that she would freeze to death. She began to \nworry she might not survive through this.\n  She prayed all night long, she said. At about 6:30 in the morning she \nhad almost given up hope. Her head was bowed in her car, and she was \nsaying a prayer, thinking she would not survive, when a tractor drove \nup to her car. The tractor lights, in the middle of that blizzard, were \nabout 5 feet away when they became apparent to Jan Novak. It was Don \nHalvorson, 3 hours in the middle of a blizzard, not being able to see \nbeyond the front fender of his tractor. He drove all around his part of \nthe country looking for this woman who was lost and whose life was in \ndanger.\n  When I read about what Don had done, I called Don and said, ``Tell me \nhow you happened to do this.'' He said, ``When they called my home at 3 \nin the morning and said that this woman was missing--I didn't know her \nand obviously had not seen her--I went back to bed, but I couldn't go \nto sleep.'' He said, ``I just couldn't go to sleep knowing there was a \nwoman out there missing, and I went to search for her.'' Three hours \nlater he found her.\n  You talk about a hero. Don Halvorson likely saved Jan Novak's life. \nThat is one story of hundreds and hundreds of stories across our State \nthis winter--the ambulance drivers in Mandan and Flasher, ND, who \npunched through a huge blizzard-related snowbank that had blocked a \nroad and made all traffic impassable. They, along with the road crews \nfrom both sides of this snowbank, punched through in whiteout \nconditions and no visibility to go out and save a young boy and get him \nto a hospital. They risked their lives, all of them, and that young boy \nsurvived because of them.\n\n  All across our State those stories abound--individuals helping others \nbecause it is the spirit and the culture of what we do. We say, ``Let's \nhelp each other.''\n  Our country does that in a larger way. Sometimes one person cannot do \nenough to help another. Sometimes even a city or a State cannot do \nenough. Sometimes a flood or earthquake or fire or tornado it \noverwhelms the ability of one person to make the difference, so our \ncountry then makes the difference.\n  What happened when all of this snow melted in North Dakota, was the \nRed River Valley suffered a 500-year flood. When the dikes broke in \nGrand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, and that water became a \ngusher running down the streets to inundate two entire cities and they \nevacuated two complete communities, it was not a case where one person \ncould solve the problem for another person. It then became a case of us \nhaving to say, as people now tried to recover from this calamitous \nflood, ``We want to help you. The rest of the people of the country \nwant to help you.''\n  That is what this fight has been about on this disaster bill. I know \nI have worn out my welcome for a number of Members of the Senate in \nrecent weeks. They are flat out tired of seeing me on the floor. They \nthink I put too much pressure on them. Some are angry at my \npresentations on the floor.\n  But I have no choice. Thousands of people this morning in Grand Forks \nand East Grand Forks, thousands and thousands of them this morning woke \nup not in their own homes, because their homes are destroyed. Their \nlives are on hold until we pass a disaster relief bill.\n  That bill has been delayed. And now it appears that that bill may \ntoday finally be on the road to the President in a manner that will \nresult in a signature, and in the bill becoming law, and in the \ndisaster aid being available to those who so desperately need it.\n  I want again to just read some of the messages of North Dakotans who \ndescribe why I am here on the floor and why I have been here for some \nweeks.\n  First, simply a drawing by a grade schooler that came in a large \npacket of drawings. It is pretty simple. Someone in a canoe says, \n``Save our town.'' Pretty simple expression that does not need much \nelaboration. ``Save our town.'' We have the capability to help do that.\n  Mr. President, here is a Grand Forks resident who says:\n\n       I'm calling on behalf of my grandmother. She's 99 years \n     old. She lost her home and everything in it. She's in \n     Bemidji, MN, now staying in a house with four children. She \n     doesn't know if she's going to get home again. She's in good \n     shape, but I'm really concerned about the trauma at her age, \n     and I don't know what I'd be like in that circumstance. She's \n     pretty strong and she talked about how she was married in \n     World War I, and she went through the Depression and the Dust \n     Bowl and World War II. She lost two out of her three kids. \n     She lost her husband. She's been through it, and all of these \n     milestones in her life, and now she is going through \n     uncertainty of not knowing whether she's going to have a \n     home. Her husband left her well set with a home she could \n     live in for the rest of her life and she's done well until \n     now. And now at age 99 she's homeless.\n\n  Kari and Paul Kolstoe, who are from Grand Forks, ND, said:\n\n       Our daughter's 12th birthday was April 18. That was the day \n     the Red River destroyed our home. We lost most of our \n     possessions, but more importantly, we lost the place and our \n     ability to live together as a family. The last 5 weeks we've \n     lived in four different places. Our home has too much damage \n     to be restored. And we now live in limbo waiting for a \n     decision and the money to go on with our lives. * * *\n       We can deal somehow with the disaster that's happened to us \n     in our town and we're trying to put our lives back together. \n     * * *\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\n       But we lost everything. And don't prolong this disaster \n     bill. Allow us to go on with our lives.\n  That is Kari and Paul Kolstoe from Grand Forks, ND.\n  There are so many letters.\n  Rodney and Judy Krause. I talked to Rodney and Judy a couple days \nago, as a matter of fact. They are also from Grand Forks, ND.\n\n       April 19 [Rod writes] we were evacuated from our home, and \n     it sat under water for a period of 10 to 12 days, with 56 \n     inches of sewage and floodwater on the main floor. Currently, \n     the house is sitting empty and we're waiting for a bill to be \n     passed in Congress dealing with flood relief.\n\n  Rod Krause says:\n\n       I'm a staff sergeant in the Air Force, and my wife and \n     myself also happen to be from Grand Forks. We're proud of \n     this community, and we hate to see it as wasted as it is from \n     this flood. Right now, as a member of the Air Force, even \n     through all this mess, I have my bags packed and ready to go \n     at a moment's notice to fight, possibly die, for this \n     country, basically at your calling. But what Congress is \n     doing now really hurts. I still need to make a house payment \n     for a home that sits empty. And it keeps getting worse as the \n     days pass. I can't do anything but wait. All we want is an \n     answer. Why is this taking so long?\n\n  Arthur Bakken, who is a councilman in Grand Forks, says:\n\n       People here have no homes, no jobs, no other homes to go \n     to. They have no toys, no bikes, no clothes, or anything else \n     for their children.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I mentioned yesterday a call from a man named Mark whose \nfamily has been separated, children living with the grandparents, his \nhome damaged by the flood. His wife is in the hospital with a terminal \nillness, telling us that his wife has only a couple months to live \nperhaps, asking us to make the decisions that allow them to get on with \ntheir lives.\n  Here is another little drawing from a schoolchild who sent it to me. \nIt probably says it is as well as any can. It is two different scenes. \nOne is a scene of flooding and devastation and trees down; and it says, \n``If you do nothing.'' And the other side is a page with a scene with a \npark bench and grass and trees and sun and flowers; and underneath it \nsays, ``If you do something.''\n  These are people who have voiced to say to us today, through my \nreading their letters, that they really need help. That is what this \ndisaster legislation is about, reaching out and helping those who, \nthrough no fault of their own, have had to bear the burden of a natural \ndisaster of enormous proportions.\n  I came to Congress some many years ago, and I have on behalf of the \nconstituents in North Dakota on every occasion--on every single \noccasion--said, when there was an earthquake in California, ``Count me \nin, and count my constituents in, because on behalf of North Dakotans I \nwant so vote yes to provide disaster aid for you.''\n  For flood victims on the Mississippi, I have said, yes, because I \nthink it is important to provide disaster aid for you.\n  In every circumstance, every day and every way that we have been \nrequested to provide disaster assistance, I have indicated that I felt \nNorth Dakotans would want to do that.\n  North Dakotans now feel that people in the rest of this country will \nwant to do that for us as well--North Dakotans, Minnesotans and South \nDakotans--who have suffered through the disaster.\n  Isn't every disaster unique and isn't every disaster difficult and \ntraumatic? Yes, it is. There is no question about that. We have seen \nnow through the new technology of television in the modern age the \ngripping scenes of devastation from disasters--death, and destruction. \nIt breaks your heart to see that anywhere in our country.\n  This disaster was unusual in a couple of respects. First, we were \nenormously fortunate that we did not suffer a major or massive loss of \nlife. Some lost their lives, but we did not suffer the loss of life of \nhundreds of citizens.\n  This combination of blizzards and floods and then fires in the middle \nof the flood that ripped the guts from a significant city in our State, \nthis combination is a very unusual circumstance because a large city \nwas completely abandoned and evacuated and completely inundated with \nwater. The water came and stayed for a very long period of time.\n  Now we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of homes that will \nnever again be lived in. We have families from every single one of \nthose homes whose possessions are now out on the berm, somewhere out on \nthe boulevard, on the driveway being hauled away in dump trucks--the \ndolls, the baby carriages, the pictures, all of the belongings of those \nfamilies. They do not know what will come next for them, what their \nlives will be like, where they will live, how they will make a house \npayment on a house that is destroyed. That is why this legislation is \nso critically important.\n\n  Now, I have been very upset that we have not gotten this done. We are \nabout 3 weeks late. I have said repeatedly that I appreciate enormously \nthe cooperation on a bipartisan basis to put a disaster package in this \nbill that is very substantial and will be enormously helpful to these \nvictims of this disaster. Most every Member of this institution \ndeserves credit for what is in this bill, and I thank them for it.\n  I am upset that it was delayed. But if today this gets dislodged, and \nif today this bill gets passed by the House and the Senate and goes to \nthe President for his signature, then we will finally be able to \nprovide the answers that are necessary for these people to understand \nwhat the rest of their lives will be like, what will happen to their \nhome, will their job be restored, will their community be rebuilt, will \ntheir region recover? Those are the questions that will be answered by \nthe hundreds of millions of dollars in the many categories in this \npiece of legislation. In fact, the disaster portion is something over \n$5 billion in this legislation dealing with many, many States.\n  If and when this happens, and I hope it does today, it will be an \nenormous benefit to our region, and I will be forever grateful to the \nMembers of the Senate who made it happen.\n  Mr. President, as I finish, I say to my colleagues, while I have worn \nout my welcome in recent weeks on this subject, I do not apologize for \nit. I speak on behalf of people who need a voice in this debate. Let us \nhope, at the end of this day, we will have some wonderful news for \npeople who have been victims of this disaster.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5555-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am prepared to ask for some unanimous-\nconsent agreements here momentarily. I believe that the Democratic \nleader will be here. In the meantime, I thought I might just give the \nSenators some idea of what the time could be for the balance of the \nafternoon and then some thought about next week.\n  If we get the agreement we have here before us entered into and \nagreed to, we would begin debate, I believe, then at about quarter \nuntil 4 on the supplemental appropriations, with a vote occurring 1 \nhour from then. So that vote could occur around quarter of 5. We are \nlooking at the possibility of, of course, getting agreement for \ncommittees to keep working, because we have a number of committees that \nare in very crucial markups--the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and the Finance Committee is meeting in a walk-\nthrough, although it is not a markup.\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n  We are also looking at the prospect of calling up again the birth \ndefects bill, which has broad bipartisan support, and we believe we \ncould get a limited time agreement on that. We are contacting the \nprincipal sponsors, Senator Bond and perhaps others who are interested \nin that, and we could take that up somewhere around 5 o'clock and \nhopefully complete that early in the evening or late this afternoon, \nbecause we think we are only going to talk about 30 minutes to an hour, \nperhaps with the possibility of a recorded vote that could come, I \npresume, about 6 o'clock.\n  With regard to the consent agreement that we are about to ask for \nhere, we would begin as soon as we get the agreement on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Basically, it is the bill that the \nHouse is now considering, or is about to consider. It may be before the \nRules Committee and will be going to the floor of the House shortly \nafter that.\n  We would ask unanimous consent that our agreement only apply if the \ntext has been received from the House and is identical to the bill that \nwe are sending to the desk for the Record.\n  We also have worked out a process to consider the very important \nissue that we feel very strongly about, and that is the Government \nShutdown Prevention Act. And we are going to ask for consent that would \nallow for a process for it to be brought up, full debate with one \nrelevant amendment for each leader. I think it is a fair way to \nconsider this issue, and the Democratic leader has indicated he thinks \nthat would be the way to proceed.\n  With regard to the census issue, I understand that they have worked \nout some language on census with the administration, which is in the \ndocument that they are going to be taking up. I do not know the details \nof the agreement, but I understand that language is in there, for the \ninformation of all Senators.\n  Would the Senator like to comment before I enter the UC request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader. I think we have made great progress today. I have had the \nopportunity to look at all of the details of both the supplemental and \nthe amendments, and I advise my colleagues that I am enthusiastic about \nthe arrangement and would want to agree with the unanimous-consent \nrequest. I appreciate very much the great willingness on the part of \nthe majority leader to work with us to accommodate our concerns, and we \nare ready to move ahead with the agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5557-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5558-S5574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives from \nthe House legislation which provides for the continuing of Government \nfunding at a level of 100 percent of the fiscal year 1997 for those \nfiscal year 1998 appropriations that have not been signed by October 1, \n1997, the majority leader may proceed with that legislation after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader.\n  I did not read that smoothly. This is the continuing resolution, \nGovernment shutdown prevention language. We assume we will receive it \nin this 100 percent form of 1997 levels for those 1998 appropriations \nthat have not been signed. There will then be one relevant amendment in \norder for each leader, limited to 1 hour each, to be counted against \nthe overall 8 hours, and no other amendments or motions be in order to \nthe bill, there be 8 hours for debate on the bill equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, and finally, following the \nexpiration or yielding back of the time, the bill be read a third time \nand the Senate proceed to a vote on passage, all without intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the \ncooperation of the Senator from South Dakota. He has been willing to \nwork on a number of different approaches to resolve this matter. This \nis clearly not the way I thought we should proceed. Apparently, the \nHouse-passed bill will be at the full funding level of about $8.6 \nbillion. I think that is inappropriate, uncalled for. I think it is \nimportant that we get the disaster funds through and the funding for \nthe Department of Defense Bosnia activities, but this bill has grown \nlike Topsy. There is no need for it to be $8.6 billion. There has been \na lot of add-ons on both sides of the Capitol, both parties, and the \nadministration even made an additional request apparently in writing \nthe other day with regard to forward funding.\n  It seems to be everybody has found a way to add more money here and \nthere, and while enumerated on the floor and put in on the floor, some \nof the things that have been added--and, again, this is not partisan or \nit is not aimed at just the Senate or just the House; it is a \nbicameral, bipartisan exercise--but as the effort has gone forward to \ntry to reduce this funding, basically what this Senator has found is \neverybody said: No, not mine. Don't take this out. Don't take that out. \nThere is a good reason for that, good reason for this, good reason for \neverything--always wanting to spend more of the people's tax money. So \nI am very unhappy with the amount of money involved here.\n  But I think, as majority leader, it is incumbent upon me to work with \nall the various parties involved here to find a procedure to get this \nwork done. We have done that, and so now I think we are ready to go \nforward with the debate. I believe the chairman, Senator Stevens, is \nhere to give some more details about what is included in this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would ask if the majority leader would \njust clarify one, I hope, minor point. In the last unanimous-consent \nrequest there was a reference to legislation which provides for the \ncontinuing of Government funding at a level of 100 percent of fiscal \n1997 for fiscal 1998 appropriations. I assume that the reference to \nthat particular legislation only refers to that particular matter and \nno other extraneous issues that could be attached. Is that the \nunderstanding of the majority leader, there would not be anything else \nin the bill other than continuing appropriations?\n  Mr. LOTT. Oh, yes, absolutely. Only that substance. Not other \nunrelated matters. I can think of lots of things they might try to \nattach to that.\n  No, not at all. We want this to be considered upfront in the daylight \nand a sincere effort to work out a way to avoid the fun and games at \nthe end of the fiscal year. I think this will give us that shot. And if \nthe House adds extraneous to it, it will never come up in this form. I \nwould work with the Senator to make sure that does not happen.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate that clarification. That is \nexactly the assurance I assumed the majority leader would give, and I \nappreciate very much appreciate his assertion in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, has it been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that the unanimous-\nconsent request has been agreed to.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wanted to make certain, Mr. President, there was an \nagreement that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to make sure there is an agreement that the \nconference report that accompanied the bill, the managers' report \naccompanying the conference report is agreed to without any reservation \nas being the legislative history for the bill that will be covered by \nthis unanimous-consent agreement. Is that understood?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Alaska making that in the \nform of a unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do seek to add that to the unanimous consent, that the \nmanagers' report--there will be no report accompanying this bill. The \nstatement of managers on the report on H.R. 1469 I wish to be included \nin this unanimous-consent request as being the legislative history for \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would certainly not object. On this \nside of the aisle, there are no reservations or objections to that at \nall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object--I will not object--my only \nhesitancy was I was wanting to make sure I understood the ramifications \nof the Senator's request. I think I do, and based on that I do not have \nany objections.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, several days ago a former staff member of \nmine in Hattiesburg, MS, brought to my attention a speech that was made \nat the University of Southern Mississippi to the honors college by Dick \nThornburgh, former Attorney General of the United States. It was on the \nsubject of ``business crime goes international.'' In the remarks, \nformer Attorney General Dick Thornburgh talks about the international \nproblems that are created for U.S. businesses by criminal conduct in \nother countries--extortion, bribery in connection with Government \ncontracts, and the like--and options for dealing with this in a more \neffective way to help enhance U.S. competitiveness throughout the \nworld. It was such an excellent speech that I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the speech of Dick Thornburgh printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\n  There being no objection, the document was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Business Crime Goes International\n\n                          (By Dick Thornburgh)\n\n       Contemporary observations on the world economy are \n     invariably premised on the vast expansion of international \n     trade. This increased internationalization of business \n     provides major opportunities for American interests as we \n     begin to accommodate to the global landscape fashioned by \n     NAFTA, the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the \n     coming into being of the new World Trade Organization.\n       But, as I will discuss this evening, this prospect for \n     expansion is threatened by an accompanying growth in \n     international business crime. Sophisticated illegal \n     operations and enterprises have burgeoned during the 1990s as \n     the world's economic and financial configuration has adjusted \n     to unprecedented change.\n       Part of this change derives from the rapid advances in \n     technology, communication and transportation which have made \n     the world a smaller place and produced a network of 24-hour \n     trading marts around the globe. Jet travel, faxes, on-line \n     communications and real-time conferencing capabilities have \n     gone a long way toward the realization of what was once only \n     a hypothetical ``global community.''\n       The end of the Cold War and the rise of market economies in \n     many areas where they were previously unknown have \n     contributed to this process of internationaization as well. \n     New opportunities for investors and new markets for \n     manufacturers and service providers now exist in countries \n     that were previously in the thrall of totalitarian \n     governments and centrally-directed economies. In Eastern and \n     Central Europe and in the former Soviet Union, for example, \n     while varying degrees of success have been achieved in the \n     actual transition from state-run economies of private \n     enterprise, in most of these countries the commitment from \n     the top of privatization remains a reality.\n       Meanwhile, in the third world, developing countries are no \n     longer merely pawns in the struggle between democratic and \n     communist ideologies. The socialist economic models adopted \n     by many of these nations during this lengthy competition have \n     been largely discredited and abandoned. It is widely \n     recognized that private investment in market economies will \n     be the key to figure true growth in these underdeveloped \n     areas.\n       Let me share with you an experience I had at the United \n     Nations which vividly brought this change of attitude home to \n     me. It involved the Center for Transnational Corporations \n     (CTC), a UN affiliate formed during the 1970s at the behest \n     of the Group of 77, the voice of the third world countries. \n     The CTC was created out of a desire to prevent giant Western \n     corporations from visiting suspected predatory practices on \n     these developing countries. Codes of conduct were proposed to \n     regulate the actions of multi-national investors so as to \n     protect fragile developing economies. Now, as we fast forward \n     to the 1990s, we find these same third world countries doing \n     a 180 degree turn. They now urge the United Nations shift its \n     emphasis to induce these same multi-national firms to invest \n     in their nations so as to help create the economic growth, \n     jobs and better quality of life that only an expanding \n     economy can produce.\n       This shift in attitudes about private investment is \n     emphasized in a recent report of the Bretton Woods \n     Commission. This group was established under the chairmanship \n     of Paul Volcker to observe the 50th anniversary of the \n     conference which established the World Bank and the \n     International Monetary Fund. Their report noted: ``Of the \n     challenges facing the World Bank Group, none is greater than \n     adapting to a world that has turned from public sector \n     dominance towards private enterprise and free markets. A \n     private sector orientation is a new one for development \n     assistance and the World Bank Group should lead the way.''\n       Clearly, American companies are responding to these \n     messages. Private American investments abroad now exceed $700 \n     billion dollars and American businesses now employ some 5.4 \n     million persons in foreign countries. While manufacturing \n     operations have traditionally dominated our overseas \n     activities, more and more growth is now taking place in the \n     service sector. A spokesman for the prime U.S. retailer, Wal-\n     Mart, put it this way: ``It is our belief that, with trade \n     barriers coming down, the world is going to be one big market \n     place, and he who gets there first, does the best.''\n       Unfortunately, there is a dark underside to this increase \n     in international activity. With greater private sector \n     activity has come an increase in business crime. And with a \n     greater global reach of legitimate business has come a \n     corresponding increase in the internationalization of illegal \n     business activities. It is this phenomenon that I wish to \n     address this evening.\n       Business crime, of course, is not an alien concept in the \n     United States. During the nearly three decades since I first \n     joined our Department of Justice, federal investigators and \n     prosecutors have concentrated increasingly upon the more \n     sophisticated types of business crimes--what Ralph Nader \n     calls ``crime in the suites.''\n       We have seen an unprecedented emphasis in the 1990s, for \n     example, on cases involving failed savings and loans, illegal \n     trading in securities and commodities, defense procurement \n     fraud, money laundering and corrupt public officials, with \n     high rates of conviction and substantial sentences in each \n     area.\n       Since the 1920s, the American phenomenon of organized \n     crime--the business of crime itself--and its illicit \n     monopolies in narcotics, illegal gambling and loan sharking \n     has beleaguered legitimate enterprise and been a particular \n     focus for intense law enforcement activities as well.\n       Efforts against these types of crime have been largely \n     carried out at the federal level since these cases often \n     cross state or international boundaries and, more often than \n     not, require sophisticated law enforcement techniques to \n     unravel purposely complicated transactions designed to escape \n     detection.\n       Now it appears that, just as business growth has been \n     extended into new regions and nations of the world, so has \n     the reach of these same types of criminal activities become \n     more evident. As new market economies have grown abroad, \n     criminal elements have grasped the opportunity to prosper \n     through illegal activities as well. Particularly in countries \n     without a well-developed rule of law and an embedded legal \n     culture (not to mention professional police establishments \n     and an independent judiciary) criminal enterprises can easily \n     gain a foothold and retard the full potential of increased \n     legitimate business activity.\n       Consider Russia, where the world's biggest economic \n     transition is taking place, and where more than 100 American \n     joint ventures and partnerships are already underway. As the \n     lumbering state-run economy evolves into a new market-\n     oriented system, reform efforts are beset by racketeering and \n     corruption. There we find that:\n       Last year, Russian organized crime controlled as much as 40 \n     percent of the nation's turnover in goods and services.\n       An estimated 80 percent of Russian businesses are said to \n     pay ``protection'' money to gangsters.\n       Practices such as the infiltration of legitimate \n     businesses, illegal smuggling, black market activities and \n     public corruption are rife.\n       The largest Russian investment firm, MMM, almost completely \n     unregulated by our standards, virtually collapsed, leaving an \n     estimated 10 million investors disillusioned, not only with \n     the scam artists responsible, but with the whole notion of \n     capitalism.\n       When I visited Russia as an observer of their historic \n     parliamentary and presidential elections, rumors abounded \n     that particular candidates were funded by the so-called \n     ``Mafiya.'' In Russia today, this term is used all too \n     loosely and, in some quarters, may merely designate anyone \n     who has turned a profit in the new economy. As one observer \n     has noted, ``[p]olice and politicians still fall into the \n     Soviet habit of ascribing mafia connections to anyone who \n     possess what seems to be an unreasonable amount of money.'' \n     This is not surprising in a culture where generations have \n     been taught the Marxist-Leninist catechism that ``all \n     property is theft!''\n       There is, to be sure, real organized crime in the Russian \n     Federation. Its face is an ugly one indeed, as described by \n     one observer:\n       ``When it comes to control of individual companies, the \n     crime bosses' methods are simple but effective. They approach \n     the director of a large business and suggest a more \n     manageable and productive system that will provide everyone \n     with certain guaranteed economic returns. For the director, \n     noncooperation may mean unbearable operating conditions, \n     refusals of credit, delays in supply, work-place accidents, \n     missing payrolls--even death.''\n       Serious business crime problems are not, of course, \n     confined to the former Soviet sphere. Italy, where the \n     ``real'' Mafia originated, is in the throes of a major \n     continuing political crisis resulting from the impact of \n     organized crime and official corruption upon its business and \n     governmental structure. An Italian Small Business Association \n     study estimates that the mob controls up to a fifth of all \n     business activity in that country and as many as half of its \n     financial holding companies. Public corruption has already \n     toppled long-standing political institutions and \n     personalities in Italy and the final returns are yet to be \n     tallied.\n       Activities of other high profile criminal groups as the \n     Japanese Yakuza, the Chinese Triads and, of course, the \n     Colombian drug cartels have impacted the ability of free \n     markets to operate in those countries and visited the heavy \n     toll of corruption upon their economies.\n       Some even posit the coming into existence of a world-wide \n     criminal cartel which would draw these various groups \n     together to execute their illegal enterprises.\n       Political change is deeply implicated in the threats posed \n     by business crime. One of the most frequently voiced fears I \n     heard expressed on a recent trip to Hong Kong, for example, \n     is what effect the July 1 take-over by the Peoples Republic \n     of China and the uncertain future of effective law \n     enforcement against business crime and corruption there will \n     have on that community's thriving economy.\n       And while Hong Kong has highly sophisticated securities \n     regulators and corruption fighters, what of those countries \n     where such mechanisms do not exist? How can market economies \n     be created or sustained without the ``checks and balances'' \n     inherent in the authority to regulate securities markets, to \n     insure competition through vigorous anti-trust enforcement \n     and to stifle attempts to launder dirty money through \n     legitimate financial institutions?\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\n       Money laundering, in particular, has become a $100 billion \n     worldwide problem. As recently pointed out in a Foreign \n     Affairs treatment of the subject: ``[I]nnovative techniques \n     of moving and concealing vast sums of cash * * * often seem \n     to be outstripping the capacity of the international criminal \n     justice system and its diplomatic and legal underpinnings.'' \n     In one recent case, the concealing of the illegal movement of \n     funds utilized bank and non-bank institutions in 40 different \n     countries. The speed with which electronic transfers can be \n     effected often leaves law enforcement ``a day late and \n     [several million] dollars short'' in the pursuit of ill-\n     gotten gains.\n       Finally, American firms also find themselves at a \n     competitive disadvantage in foreign markets due to the \n     failure of other major trading nations to emulate the \n     strictures of our Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which makes \n     bribery abroad a federal criminal offense. The former chief \n     spokesman of the World Bank has pointed out that:\n       ``International corruption hobbles American corporations, \n     which lose deals when foreign rivals bribe foreign officials. \n     It cheats American taxpayers whose aid dollars end up in the \n     private bank accounts of foreign leaders. And it hurts the \n     world's poor, when aid is siphoned off for political \n     kickbacks by contractors intent upon selling unneeded weapons \n     or presidential palaces.''\n       A recent Commerce Department study estimated that U.S. \n     companies had been edged out by foreign competitors on some \n     $36 billion of international business deals on account of \n     bribes and other government-assisted activities. And--the \n     unkindest cut of all--in many cases, these payments are tax-\n     deductible business expenses for foreign competitors back \n     home.\n\n\n                                  ii.\n\n       How has law enforcement reacted to this increasing \n     internationalization of business crime? In fact, as we passed \n     the mid-point of this decade, a great deal of effort was \n     being expended to cope with these challenges. While the late \n     author Claire Sterling described ours as an era where \n     ``borders have gone down for crooks, but not for cops,'' \n     significant steps are being taken to increase cooperative \n     international law enforcement efforts and help meet the \n     problem of the internationalization of business crime. As you \n     might expect, however, much more remains to be done.\n       Successful action will be required on three separate \n     fronts: (1) stepped-up domestic law enforcement capabilities \n     in each country; (2) bilateral initiatives to increase \n     cooperation between nations; (3) multi-lateral efforts to \n     insure a maximum international reach of effective law \n     enforcement. Let me set forth a brief progress report in each \n     of these areas.\n\n\n                                   a.\n\n       Needless to say, an effective response to international \n     criminal activity begins at home. Here the United States has \n     much to share with its global partners in this effort. \n     Statutes defining racketeering activities and various types \n     of conspiracies, together with investigative techniques such \n     as witness immunity, court-authorized wiretaps and expert \n     accounting skills, are lacking in many of the countries now \n     called upon to deal with business crimes.\n       Many of those with the worst problems are lacking in even \n     the rudiments of legal and law enforcement systems to deal \n     with sophisticated criminal activity.\n       The central problem for the Russian Federation, for \n     example, is identified by one observer as ``the legal vacuum \n     at the heart of the Russian economy.'' That is to say, he \n     continues, ``Russian policymakers . . . tried to develop a \n     free market before constructing a civil society in which such \n     a market could safely operate.''\n       During my service as attorney general we visited the then \n     Soviet Union in 1989 to discuss the need for the rule of law \n     and its vigorous implementation, not only in the interest of \n     preserving human rights and civil liberties, but to create a \n     climate within which free markets could exist and economic \n     growth could take place. Many of these principles were, \n     happily, to be reflected in the new Russian constitution \n     approved in the December, 1993 referendum.\n       Our Moscow meetings were following up by further exchanges \n     here and abroad with representatives of the Russian \n     Federation and those from other Eastern and Central European \n     countries such as Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland and the \n     former Czechoslovakia, all focused on creating systems within \n     which arbitrary rule would give way to concepts of due \n     process enforced by an independent judiciary.\n       Once these benchmark principles began to be implanted, our \n     focus switched to the nuts-and-bolts of how to make the \n     system work in areas such as securities regulation, creditors \n     rights, promoting competition and fighting racketeering. That \n     work has been ably reinforced by the American Bar \n     Association's Central and Eastern European Law Initiative \n     (CEELI) project, seeking to establish law enforcement and \n     regulatory mechanisms under which the free enterprise system \n     can take root and those seeking to corrupt the system can be \n     brought to justice.\n       Recently, I met in Moscow with judges of the newly-expanded \n     commercial court system about the handling of business \n     disputes and with Russia's new chief prosecutor concerning \n     the need to crack down on illegal business practices.\n       Others have also capitalized on American know-how in \n     dealing with law enforcement challenges. The Italian-American \n     Working Group, established by Attorney General William French \n     Smith, provides a forum for U.S. officials to share the \n     latest in techniques for the investigation of organized \n     criminal activities in both countries. And the Justice \n     Department's International Criminal Assistance Training \n     Program (ICITAP) has made available valuable expertise to \n     Central and South American countries interested in racheting \n     up their capabilities to deal with sophisticated criminal \n     activity.\n       But the basic need continues to be the strengthening of the \n     rule of law and legal cultures within these nations. One \n     Chinese expert, for example, has recently emphasized that \n     ``China lacks a legal framework and effective enforcement of \n     a legal system for a market economy.'' She argued further \n     that the solution to the problem of corruption in China \n     ``rests on the development of a . . . modern legal system \n     with binding contracts, property rights and courts to \n     adjudicate disputes.''\n\n\n                                   b.\n\n       It is clear, however, that, no matter how proficient the \n     domestic capabilities of any one country, including the \n     United States, become, the challenge of international \n     criminal activity cannot be met on a go-it-alone basis. Thus, \n     increasing attention is being paid to cooperative efforts to \n     ensure that neither evidence nor suspects can find ``safe \n     havens'' from prosecution simply by crossing international \n     borders.\n       Probably the most effective bi-lateral tool established for \n     this type of nation-to-nation cooperation is the Mutual Legal \n     Assistance Treaty, or MLAT, as it is popularly designated. \n     During the 1970s, when I headed the Justice Department's \n     Criminal Division, a number of executive agreements regarding \n     the exchange of evidence were established with foreign \n     governments in the aftermath of allegations of illegal \n     payments by Lockheed to foreign officials. The first MLAT \n     treaty, however, was not ratified until 1976 when, not \n     surprisingly, it was the Swiss government which agreed to \n     exchange evidence with U.S. prosecutors on a somewhat \n     limited, but since expanded, basis.\n       MLATS are now in effect with a total of 15 countries and \n     they provide a useful means by which law enforcement agencies \n     can communicate directly, avoiding sometimes cumbersome \n     diplomatic channels and outmoded formal procedures for the \n     acquisition of evidence. A typical MLAT covers the taking of \n     testimony and providing of documents and other articles of \n     evidence, the service of judicial documents, the execution of \n     searches and seizures, the transfer of persons in custody and \n     assistance in proceedings relating to forfeiture, restitution \n     and the collecting of fines. Counterpart Memoranda of \n     Understanding (MOUs) have been entered into between the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission and regulators in other \n     countries to facilitate investigations in this field, \n     deriving from the 1982 MOU with the Swiss government.\n       Incidentally, in what has been described as ``the first \n     break in the concept of universal bank secrecy,'' Switzerland \n     in 1989 also adopted a tough anti-money laundering statute. \n     This action followed our meeting with leading Swiss bankers \n     to point out to them the threat to their reputation for \n     probity and integrity in the world's financial circles, \n     should they continue to be indifferent to the sources of \n     funds deposited in their famous ``Swiss bank accounts.'' This \n     ``know your customer'' law was recently buttressed by \n     additional criminal sanctions and the Swiss example has been \n     followed by others as well, including the United Kingdom, \n     Spain, Hong Kong and Canada. Money laundering also received \n     increased emphasis at the G-7 Summit in 1989 out of which \n     came recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force \n     which have been activated by all leading members of the world \n     financial community.\n\n\n                                   c.\n\n       These multi-lateral efforts have been duplicated by other \n     groups of countries intent upon making the whole of their \n     collective law-enforcement efforts greater than simply the \n     sum of their individual parts.\n       Within the European Community, for example, the Trevi Group \n     meets twice a year to exchange views on law-enforcement \n     policy and the United States (with Canada) enjoys observer \n     status at such gatherings, giving American law officials a \n     chance to interact with their continental counterparts on a \n     most productive informal basis. Similar mechanisms exist \n     within the Organization of American States and, in 1990, a \n     meeting in Seoul, South Korea brought together attorneys \n     general from 24 Asian and Pacific nations to exchange views \n     on international challenges to law enforcement in that \n     area of the world.\n       The most significant break-through with regard to multi-\n     lateral law enforcement activity came, however, with the \n     adoption in Vienna in December, 1988 of the United Nations \n     Drug Enforcement Convention, now ratified by 115 nations. \n     This Convention charted an entirely new course for global law \n     enforcement requiring, as it did, the enactment of laws to \n     criminalize specific acts involved in producing and \n     trafficking in illegal drugs (including money-laundering), to \n     provide for the seizure and forfeiture of assets and profits \n     of the drug trade, to simplify the exchange of witnesses and \n     evidence and to expedite extradition procedures.\n       Although confined for now to drug offenses--a politically \n     popular and highly visible target--the UN Treaty establishes \n     a\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\n     model for international cooperation against all types of \n     crime that extend beyond the boundaries and the capabilities \n     of individual countries. It will not be long, I would venture \n     to predict, before its counterpart in the area of \n     international business crime begins to attract substantial \n     support in the world community.\n       Such a suggestion was indeed made at the World Ministerial \n     Conference on Organized Transnational Crime held in Naples, \n     Italy in November, 1994 and repeated at a conference on \n     International Corruption which I attended last month in \n     Buenos Aires, Argentina under the sponsorship of the United \n     Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.\n       Why are these extraordinary mechanisms necessary? One \n     observer has identified the ``Basic challenge [to be] how to \n     control growing domains of transnational activities that \n     either ignore or take advantage of national borders when the \n     powers of the state remain powerfully circumscribed by the \n     political, geographical and legal limitations that attend \n     notions of national sovereignty.''\n       The international community has already responded to the \n     threat of drug trafficking by relinquishing portions of state \n     sovereignty through the adoption of the UN Drug Enforcement \n     Convention. If the world is to take full advantage of the \n     prospects for economic growth we have examined today, a \n     similar effort against international business crime and \n     official corruption must be mounted with the same vigor.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       As the nation in the forefront of the commitment to the \n     rule of law and the containment of crime, it is to be hoped \n     that the United States will continue to play a lead role in \n     the endeavor to send a consistent message to international \n     criminals, however sophisticated, that ``You can run, but you \n     cannot hide'' from effective law enforcement.\n       To do otherwise might well forfeit the unprecedented \n     opportunity we have to help bring the full benefits of free \n     markets and an improved quality of life to portions of the \n     world desperately in need of both.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerkl will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5574-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5577-S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   1997 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR RECOVERY FROM \n  NATURAL DISASTERS, AND FOR OVERSEAS PEACEKEEPING EFFORTS, INCLUDING \n                            THOSE IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Stevens, in urging the Senate to \nadopt the disaster assistance supplemental appropriation bill upon its \nreceipt from the House. The funding levels contained in that bill are \nthe same as those adopted by the Senate in the conference report on \nH.R. 1469 on June 5 by a vote of 67 to 31. That conference agreement, \nhowever, also contained a number of extraneous provisions to which the \nPresident objected and which he advised would cause a veto. Upon \nreceipt of the conference agreement to H.R. 1469, the President did, in \nfact, veto the measure. Subsequently, continuous efforts have been \nongoing to resolve the differences on those extraneous provisions in a \nway that will allow the disaster assistance funding contained in this \nsupplemental to reach the hundreds of thousands of victims of the \nrecent disasters that have beset the Nation over past months.\n  In all, 33 States will be eligible for the disaster assistance funds \nprovided in the bill. As explained in more detail by the chairman, \ntitle I of the bill contains appropriations totaling $1.8 billion in \nsupport of our men and women in uniform engaged in peacekeeping \noperations around the world, particularly in Bosnia. Title II of the \nbill contains disaster assistance appropriations for a number of \ndepartments and agencies throughout the Federal Government with \njurisdiction over the emergency relief efforts. Those appropriations \ntotal some $5.5 billion. The bill also contains an appropriation of \nover $937 million for veterans compensation and pensions.\n  In all, the bill totals some $8.6 billion, the budget authority of \nwhich is fully offset by the rescissions of appropriations which are \nalso contained in the bill.\n  Regarding the extraneous matters which caused the Presidential veto, \nit is my understanding that they have all been resolved to the \nsatisfaction of the administration and in a way which will allow the \nPresident to sign this bill. While I regret that the enactment of this \ndisaster assistance appropriation bill has required many weeks and a \nPresidential veto in order to achieve its ultimate enactment, I \nrecognize that the proponents of the extraneous provisions that caused \nthe delay feel very strongly about the merits of their provisions, and \nI appreciate their willingness to allow the removal or modification of \nthem in a way that will allow this bill to go forward so that its \nbenefits can then be forthcoming to the American people for whom they \nare intended.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge all Members to support the bill, \nand I congratulate the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, \nMr. Livingston, and my House counterpart, Mr. Obey, for their efforts \nin reaching this agreement, as well as the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens. In addition, I also \nthank our distinguished minority leader, Mr. Daschle, who has worked \ntirelessly day and night in resolving these issues. The majority \nleader, Mr. Lott, is also to be commended for his efforts on this bill.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 29 minutes \nand 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. President, this legislation comes as an enormous relief. As the \noccupant of the Chair knows well, I have come to the floor many times \nto plead with my colleagues to deliver this assistance and deliver it \nas quickly as possible. We have been hung up here, now, in the 54th day \nsince the dikes broke at Grand Forks. A town of 50,000 was completely \nevacuated; tens of thousands of people still, today, are not back. We \nhave people still who are sleeping on cots, living in cars; thousands \nof people who are wondering when is help going to come.\n  We heard over the weeks that there was money in the pipeline. I can \ntell you, from a local perspective, the money has not been getting \nthrough that is necessary for rebuilding and recovery. So this \nlegislation that has now come from the House represents an incredible \nvictory for the people in the disaster areas because the offending \nprovisions, those that caused the President to veto the bill, are now \nremoved. What we have is a clean disaster relief bill, which is what \nthe people of the disaster areas have asked for sincerely, and in many \nways with, I think, real patience, because 54 days have elapsed before \nwe are finally going to see this legislation pass and be signed by the \nPresident of the United States. Mr. President, a clean disaster relief \nbill, thank goodness; many of us wondered if this day was going to come \nand here it is. This bill represents real help that is going to make \nthe difference, a real difference in the lives of people.\n  I just remind my colleagues, this is what we look at in Grand Forks \ntoday. This is the rubble that is left by the devastation of downtown \nGrand Forks. Remember, we experienced a multiplicity of disasters. We \nhad, first of all, 10 feet of snow this winter, the most snow we have \never had, followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years that \neliminated electricity for 80,000 people for more than a week, followed \nby a 500-year flood, by far the worst flood ever in our history. It was \nabsolutely devastating. Then, in the midst of that, a fire that burned \nmuch of downtown Grand Forks.\n  I tell you, we began to think this was apocalyptical. But still, \ntoday, we are living with the results. This is the picture of just one \nboulevard. On every street in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, this is \nwhat you see: The rubble piled, 5, 6 feet high. You can go down the \nstreets and you can see what kind of washer and dryer everybody had in \nGrand Forks, because they are all out in the boulevards. Every item of \npersonal furniture and clothing is out on these boulevards. People left \nat 1 o'clock in the morning with only the\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nclothes on their backs, because the dikes failed at that hour.\n  Again, this is another typical street. You can see the junk piled all \nup and down the streets of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, ND. These \npeople are living through a slow-motion disaster because the disaster \noccurred, the natural disaster, but now we are still living with the \nresults. That is why this money is so desperately needed.\n  I can tell you, there are many people we want to thank. Senator Byrd, \nthe ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, has been a staunch \nally throughout this fight. We deeply appreciate, Senator Byrd, your \nassistance, and the assistance of your able staff--Jim English I want \nto name specifically, because he has been a rock. We will never forget \nthe assistance that you, Senator Byrd, have provided and that Jim \nEnglish has provided as well.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, because he, too, listened and heard our plea. And we \nappreciate it very much.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first of all I thank the distinguished \nsenior Senator from North Dakota for his kind words concerning me, and \nespecially with reference to my very capable staff.\n\n  How much time does the Senator from Minnesota require?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have had a chance to speak on this \noften. Five minutes, I think, will do it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't have any rehearsed remarks. I \nam trying to think exactly what to say. I want to thank my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, both Senators from North Dakota, and the Senators \nfrom South Dakota. It has been a pleasure to work with you.\n  I certainly want to thank the minority leader, Senator Daschle, who \nhas done a great job.\n  Jim English, I am going to say the same thing about you. I want to \nthank Jim for just incredible work. Larry Stein has been phenomenal as \nwell.\n  I would like to thank Sarah Neimeyer who has worked with me in my \noffice.\n  We have had so much help. Senator Byrd, thank you so much for your \nsupport. And I would like to thank my Republican colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle for their support.\n  Finally, we have come together. Finally we are going to pass a \ndisaster relief bill. Mr. President, all I can say right now is that \nthis has been a long and sometimes bitter fight. I wish it had not been \nsuch a long, protracted fight. I wish it had not been a bitter fight. I \ndo not think I am in the mood at all to point fingers today. I think it \nis better just to say to everybody here, we finally have come together.\n  Senator Stevens, thank you for your help. And I think that what \nmatters is not who wins or who loses here in the Senate or in the \nHouse. I don't really care. I don't think it's very important. But I do \nthink the people back in Minnesota and the Dakotas win, and that does \nmatter a great deal to me. People are trying to get on with their \nlives. They are trying to rebuild their lives. And they need the \ncertainty. They need the certainty of knowing whether or not this \nassistance is going to be available. I think, finally, today, as a \nSenator from Minnesota, I can look people in the eyes, go back home and \nmeet with people and say, ``This is passed, the help is going to be \nforthcoming. I hope and pray that this will help you and this will help \nyour children and this will help your families.''\n  I am proud of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. I thank \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for their support now. \nFinally, we are together. I am proud of my Democratic colleagues \nbecause I think we did the right thing. I think we used the rules of \nthe Senate. The expert--I have to get his attention--the expert who \nknows more than the other 99 Senators combined is Senator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd, I want to get your attention. You do not have to \nrespond. I would say I am proud of my colleagues, I am proud of the \nDemocrats. I said one of the things I am most proud of is I think we \ndid the right thing to be out here fighting for people, and I think it \nwas important to use the rules of the Senate to fight for people. I was \nsaying that you are, of course, the master teacher to all of us. Again, \nI thank you for what you have taught us.\n  It feels good to be able to know the process and use the rules, if \nyou can use your leverage to fight for people. I think we did that. But \nI think most important of all, it is the people who will benefit. We \nhave come together, finally, finally. I think the U.S. Senate, and I \nhope the House of Representatives and therefore the Congress, will look \ngood to people after what has been a terrible period of time. I do not \nbelieve the last several weeks have been a good several weeks for the \nCongress. They have not built up a lot of respect for our institution. \nPeople have not been able to understand the delay. I think, in a way, \nthis is an important victory for people in our States and it is also, I \nthink, a very good thing that finally, finally the U.S. Senate has come \nthrough for people.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken many, many, many, many hours, have given \nenough speeches to probably deafen all of my colleagues and I do not \nneed to say any more. I am so pleased, I feel so good that we finally \nare able to pass this bill and we are finally going to be able to help \npeople--really good people who really need the help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska yields 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that Congress and the \nPresident have finally agreed to the compromise proposal I offered \nearlier this week to smooth the way for passage of emergency flood \nrelief for the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas.\n  My compromise calls for separate votes on the emergency disaster \nrelief bill and on legislation to protect the American people from a \nGovernment shutdown. Today's vote confirms that was the best way to \nbuild the necessary consensus in Washington to deliver flood relief as \nquickly as possible.\n  The people of my home state of Minnesota have been waiting with \nincreasing impatience for Washington to stop talking about delivering \nrecovery aid and finally do something about it.\n  They have been waiting for Congress and the President to work \ntogether to finally bridge the gap that led to the veto that now holds \nup flood relief. I am pleased to say that today, the waiting ends and \nthe rebuilding process can move ahead.\n  This flood recovery aid means more to us in Minnesota than simply \ndollars. It sends the message that the people of Minnesota and the \nDakotas, who have endured so much during this critical time, have not \nbeen forgotten by Washington, and that the promises made by Congress \nand the President to our States will be promises kept.\n  But our work does not end with this vote. Once we pass this bill and \nthe President signs it into law, we must keep a watchful eye to ensure \nthat the recovery and rebuilding process in Minnesota and the Dakotas \ncan go forward without any further delays caused by gridlock in \nWashington.\n  That is why I believe that Congress must pass the Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act, which will protect Minnesotans from a Government \nshutdown as we rebuild our State from the damages caused by the flood.\n  Under my proposal, which we will adopt today, we can have that vote, \nfree from any procedural delays, and give the people of Minnesota and \nthe Dakotas that important assurance.\n  Mr. President, this has been a stressful time for individuals, \nfamilies, farmers, and businesses in the Midwest devastated by the \nflooding. The delays from Washington did not help anybody.\n  But with this agreement today, we have reduced the chance that a \nmanmade disaster this fall, in the form of a Government shutdown, will \nfollow the natural diaster that victimized so many people this past \nspring.\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\n  Again, I am pleased that we could work out this agreement and act on \nmy proposal to pass emergency flood aid to Minnesota and the Dakotas. \nWith this compromise, the blame game can end and the rebuilding can \ncontinue. It is time to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nif he has any problem with my yielding time at this point?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to have him yield time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan], and I am going to be off the floor temporarily \nbecause I have someone waiting in my office down below. In the \nmeantime, I ask Mr. Dorgan to yield time on my behalf.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an occasion of some happiness for \nthose of us who have spent a substantial amount of time in the Senate \npushing very hard to try to get a disaster relief bill finished.\n  I today compliment the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, the \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and other members of the \nAppropriations Committee. I have said repeatedly that when this \nlegislation passes, it will contain a substantial amount of assistance \nfor those who have been hit by natural disasters, especially for those \nin our region who were devastated by the circumstances of blizzards, \nfloods, and then fires.\n  There have been a substantial amount of impatience on my part and the \npart of many others in Congress in the recent 3 or so weeks. We have \nbeen impatient because we have constituents who have been impatient. We \nknow that their lives have been on hold, decisions have not been able \nto be made on a timely basis.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, my colleagues, Senator Wellstone, \nSenator Grams and others, Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson from \nSouth Dakota, we know from going home, our citizens who are victims of \nthese disasters have, in many instances, been living in other \ncommunities with relatives, in tents, in camper trailers, in shelters, \non cots, and they have been very concerned about the inability to put \ntheir lives back together. We have repeatedly pushed for a timely \nresolution for this matter.\n  Today, it appears that we will see a piece of legislation through the \nCongress, and it is my hope to be invited to participate tomorrow \nmorning in a bill-signing ceremony. I hope that President Clinton will \nhave a brief ceremony to sign this legislation, after which a \nsubstantial amount of help will be available to people of our region.\n  What kind of help is it? Well, it is a substantial amount of money to \nhelp people who lost their homes. In Grand Forks, ND, alone, 600 homes \nhave been totally destroyed, another 600 to 800 homes have been \nseverely damaged. Those families are not back in their homes and will \nnot be back in their homes. Many of those homes will never again be \ninhabited, and those families need some help. This legislation reaches \nout to them to say we want to help you.\n  The legislation includes some resources for people who have lost \nlivestock in the blizzards this winter. A substantial number of \nblizzards paralyzed our State. The last blizzard was the worst blizzard \nin 50 years. We had cattle on their feet suffocating from snow, and \nwhite-out conditions where they could breathe nothing but snow. I \nmentioned the other day that a fellow was in a community and someone \nsaid, ``Well, what are you going to be doing next?'' He was a rancher. \nHe said, ``Well, I'm going home to shoot some calves.'' He had to shoot \ncalves because these are calves whose feet were frozen in the blizzard, \ncows whose udders were frozen in the blizzard, cows froze to death \nstanding up, cows froze to death in stock ponds when ice gave way and \nthe cattle died in the ice cold water.\n  I don't need to describe in any greater detail the ravages of \nblizzard after blizzard after blizzard, the last being the worst \nblizzard in 50 years, and then the flood that resulted from 10 feet of \nsnow, 3 years' worth of snow dumped on our State in 3 months. The \nresult: a disaster of significant proportions that has upset the lives \nof so many thousands of families.\n  The creation of this bill then was a response to that, and although \nwe have gone through enormous angst as a result of delay, today, when \nthis aid begins to flow, we say thanks to a lot of folks who joined \nhands in this Chamber, on the Appropriations Committee and off, in the \nleadership, who said we want to be part of a solution.\n  I know, as I said earlier today, I have worn out my welcome on the \nfloor of the Senate. I know there are some here who are tired of seeing \nme on the floor, tired of hearing my message and hope that they will \nnot have to suffer much more--the constant drumbeat and the constant \nurgency that I express on behalf of my citizens, but I make no apology \nfor that. I came here to represent a group of people who need help, and \nI am pleased that help will be in this legislation when it passes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls time on \nhis side.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  The point I was making was while we feel very strongly about these \nissues, because our constituents are involved--and they are not just \nconstituents, they are people, families trying to put their lives back \ntogether--at the end of the day, when the day is done and the job is \ndone, and this will at least complete this portion of the job for a \nCongress responding to this disaster, we must stop and say thank you \nfor the help that others have given us.\n  As we proceed to begin to rebuild and to recover and to have families \nput their lives together and to have communities rebuild, we will \nundoubtedly see things that need to be done in next year's \nappropriations bills, as well.\n  Mr. President, today when this passes, on final passage, and \ntomorrow, when the President signs this legislation, I will be \nenormously pleased that finally disaster relief will be available to \nmany Americans who desperately need it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to give a little history of what \nwe are dealing with in this 1997 supplemental appropriations bill.\n  In February of this year, we received a request for $2.1 billion from \nthe President to deal with the funding that had been advanced in the \nBosnia peacekeeping efforts overseas in a way that would repay the \nfunds to the various accounts in the Department of Defense from which \nthose moneys were taken. That was $2.1 billion, as I said.\n  That February budget request also contained mandatory veterans \ncompensation and pensions of $800 million and other requests, mainly a \nWIC request, women, infants, and children request of $.1 billion. It \nwas $100 million. The total of the budget request in February was $3 \nbillion. There was no disaster attached to that request.\n  We received a formal request on March 19 for $2 billion related to \nthe disasters. Again, on April 23, we received a request of $300 \nmillion. And on June 9, we received a major request of $2.4 billion. \nAgain, Mr. President, that was June 9. Our total formal budget request \nthat is covered by this bill is $7.7 billion. Some of those amounts we \nhad anticipated in the bill that was presented to the Senate \npreviously, but the formal budget request was received June 9 for more \nthan 25 percent of this bill.\n  I have seen and heard people on the television telling us how we \nshould be getting on with our work. As a matter of fact, I think in \nterms of supplementals, for us to handle supplemental requests from \nMarch 19, April 23, and June 9 by today, which is June 12, I think is \nnot tardy. We have had informal OMB reestimates of $400 million since \nthose others were received. We had an informal increase for mandatory \nveterans compensation and pensions reported to us on June 3, another \n$200 million. The total Presidential request before the Senate is $8.2 \nbillion. This bill is $8.9 billion.\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\n  The $700 million comes about by the community development block \ngrant, the CDBG moneys, for the disaster of $300 million. We have an \nSSI provision in this bill, supplemental amount for legal aliens of \n$200 million. There is an additional $700 million for the Federal \nHighway Administration, and other minor adjustments made by \ncongressional amendments amount to $200 million. In other words, the \ntotal congressional impact on this bill is $700 million.\n\n  The bill, for the first time in history, is totally offset. This \nreport offsets in the Defense Department $1.9 billion. It offsets, in \ndomestic offsets, $6.1 billion. There is an additional amount of \nmandatory spending, mainly veterans compensation and pensions, that is \ncovered by the bill and amounts to $900 million. It does not score \nunder the Budget Act. Those are moneys that were already covered under \nentitlement provisions.\n  Mr. President, I made the statement before and I asked unanimous \nconsent that the agreement that applies to this bill is that the \nstatement of the managers that accompanied the conference report for \nH.R. 1469 would be the legislative history for this bill that is going \nto be presented to the Senate.\n  The reason for that is that I did not want it to be just a statement \nof one person, myself, to make that legislative history. It is the \nstatement of the Senate now on a unanimous-consent basis that the \nprovisions of the managers' report that accompanied the former \nconference report, to the extent those provisions are in the bill, are \nthe legislative history for this bill.\n  There are three items that have been deleted from the bill: the \ncontinuing resolution language, the census language and the language \nthat pertained to Revised Statute 2477, the right-of-way provision. I \nregret deeply being put in the position where that has to be withdrawn. \nWe do, however, have a commitment from the President of the United \nStates that within 180 days, there will be presented to the Congress a \nbill proposing a legislative solution to the problems that have beset \nthe West since the announcement of the policy by the Secretary of \nInterior in January of the change in the historic concept that these \nrights-of-way were to be determined by State law and the statement of \npolicy from the Department of Interior that says they have to be \nrights-of-way developed by vehicular traffic. Both of the changes are \nvery oppressive, as far as my State is concerned, and we look forward \nto receiving the legislation that the President has committed his \nadministration to submit to us on that subject, and I hope the Congress \nwill act on that during this session of Congress.\n  But, Mr. President, it is important that everybody understand that \nother than the three provisions that have been deleted from the bill, \nthe managers' report that accompanied the conference report is the \nlegislative history for this bill. There were conditions and terms set \nforth in that managers' report that we expect the administration to \ncomply with. They are now listed as being the formal statement of this \nSenate as a whole on how the conference report is to be interpreted. I \nthink that is only fair. That is what we intended in the event the \nconference report had been signed by the President. This is the same \nbill except for those three provisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe fiscal year 1997 supplemental appropriations requests and \ncongressional action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n  FY 1997 Supplemental Appropriation Requests and Congressional Action\n\n     [In billions of dollars, by fiscal year 1997 budget authority]\n\nFebruary budget: \n  Bosnia/peacekeeping..............................................2.1 \n  Mandatory Veterans compensation and pensions.....................0.8 \n  Other requests (mainly WIC)......................................0.1 \n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Total February budget..........................................3.0 \nFormal budget requests: \n  March 19, 1997...................................................2.0 \n  April 23, 1997...................................................0.3 \n  June 9, 1997.....................................................2.4 \n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Total, including formal budget requests........................7.7 \nInformal OMB reestimates (April 14, 1997)..........................0.4 \nInformal increase to mandatory Veterans compensation and pensions (June \n  3, 1997).........................................................0.2 \n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Total, President's request.....................................8.2 \nCongressional adjustments (House and Senate floor amendments included \n    in conference agreement; plus conference adjustments): \n    Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).......................0.3 \n    SSI--Legal aliens..............................................0.2 \n    Federal Highway Admin.

Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. We \nhave finally reached a point this afternoon that has been awaited for \nsome time by the people of South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota, \nand 30 other States that have been seriously and negatively impacted by \nthe blizzards and floods of this past winter and spring. It had been my \nhope the passage of this legislation could have been accelerated and \nwithout the contention we had to deal with over this past month.\n  But I do at this point today want to extend thanks to Senator Stevens \nfor his assistance on this legislation, certainly to Senator Daschle, \nthe Democratic leader; Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee; Senators Dorgan and Conrad of North Dakota, \nmy colleagues from the north; and Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, in \nparticular who have played a critical role on this floor helping \neducate the Members and the American public about the urgency and the \nseverity of the crisis that our region faced here and continues to \nface.\n  And certainly a thank you as well to President Clinton and his \nadministration, who has responded in a timely fashion to the disaster \nrequests from our Governor, from our State, affirmatively responding \nboth to the blizzard and to the flood disaster requests on the very day \nthat he received the requests, having visited our States, both in the \nsouth personally and with the Vice President and his Cabinet officials, \nand has become very acquainted in a direct way with the immense damage \nthat was done in my State of South Dakota and throughout the region.\n  So there are a lot of thank yous to be extended for the work on this \nlegislation. But I think that we cannot underestimate the scope of the \nharm done and the reality that even this legislation, as significant as \nit is, will not make people whole.\n  We are looking now, with the most recent estimates in the State of \nSouth Dakota, of livestock losses in excess of 300,000. We have an \nincredible level of damage to fences, to roads, and local governments \nbankrupt from the snow removal now finding themselves without even \nmatching money to come up with the repair of the roads. That is one of \nthe reasons why the CDBG, the community development block grant, aspect \nof this will be so critically important.\n  We have families looking to relocate. We have levees to be rebuilt. \nWe have mayors asking about the repair of their waste water treatment \nfacilities and water treatment facilities. We have rural water projects \nand systems throughout the State that have been damaged in significant \nways.\n  So in so many ways this legislation is going to be critical in \nhelping people get their lives back together, to making decisions about \nthe future of their homes, of their families, of their farms and \nranches and of our public infrastructure.\n  This legislation will come as badly needed assistance, a hand up, and \nconsistent with a tradition that has marked the American approach to \ndisasters in any part of the country. Whether it has been earthquakes, \nfloods, tornadoes, hurricanes, we have a long tradition in this country \nof setting aside our partisan differences and working together with a \nhand up so\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\nthat people can get back on their feet, at least have the resources to \nbegin that long trek back.\n  But I think that the winners of this final resolution of the \nconflicts that we have had are more than just the people of the Dakotas \nand the Great Plains and all the States that have been affected by \nthese disasters. The American public in general has won this debate \nover the last several weeks. There was a sense on the part of the \nAmerican public that we need to handle one issue at a time, that when \nit comes to disasters, that ought to be a clean bill sent to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  That ultimately is what has transpired, I think in large part because \nof the great concern and attention given to this legislation by \nAmericans from one coast to the other, many of them living in States \nthat have not had significant disaster problems this past year, but \nrecognize that that hand up is part of the American tradition and also \nrecognize that in the past when we have had emergency legislation it \nhas been devoid of controversial extraneous matters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from South \nDakota has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If the Senator would yield an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. So we have maintained that precedent and not moved away \nfrom the tradition in this country that we have had in this body of \ndealing directly with legislation so that it may in a timely fashion \nget to the people who need it.\n  It would have been, I think, a tremendous loss and would have been a \nbad precedent for the future if we had not in fact voted down \nlegislation with controversial issues and used disaster legislation as \na political vehicle. So I think that we have won the short-term battle \nto get help to people who need it but also won the long-term battle for \npeople who need legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  There are a number of people I would like to additionally thank. I \nwould like to thank the President for his support. I would like to \nthank the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for really brilliant \nleadership in a very difficult fight. I would also like to thank very \nmuch his colleague, Senator Johnson from South Dakota, Senator \nWellstone of Minnesota, my own colleague, Senator Dorgan of North \nDakota, who serves on the Appropriations Committee and served on the \nconference committee that came up with this disaster relief package. He \nhas been extraordinary throughout this fight. I will never forget both \nhis friendship and his advocacy of the State of North Dakota.\n  If I could have an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the Senator an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to thank our colleague in the House, \nCongressman Pomeroy, who really stood up and was counted at a critical \ntime for our State.\n  I also would like to thank staff members, my own staff people that \nspent night after night here, Derik Fettig, Kirk Johnson, Bob Van \nHeuvelen, my own chief of staff Kent Hall, and one person I did not \nthank, somebody on Senator Stevens' staff, Steve Cortese, who was of \ngreat help in resolving this matter as well.\n  I want to thank them all. They have made a difference in the lives of \npeople who desperately need help.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield such time as the Senator from Texas desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I, too, want to thank a few people because I have been very involved \nin this supplemental emergency appropriations. I have seen the back \nroom negotiations hour after hour, night after night.\n  I want to thank first the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. There \nis not a person who has stood truer to principle than the majority \nleader on all of the issues in this emergency appropriations. He was \nprepared at all times to make sure that disaster victims were able to \nget the money that they needed in absolute due course. He was prepared \nto make sure that all of the money in the defense accounts would go in.\n  He also was standing on a principle to set the process in place so \nthat at the end of this fiscal year the people who work for the U.S. \nGovernment, the people who look to the U.S. Government for services \nsuch as passports and all of the other Government services, and the \npeople such as veterans who have earned pensions would know that there \nwould not be a disruption in Government.\n  I think there has been a lot of rhetoric that has blurred the facts \non these issues. In fact, there was never a question of the actual \namount that would go to the flood victims of North Dakota. They have \nbeen getting the millions of dollars that they need to start the \nprocess of rebuilding their State. And we want them to have that. They \ndeserve it. They have it. It is ongoing right now. And it never was in \nquestion.\n  But, Mr. President, I think it is very important as we get ready to \nvote on this issue to see exactly what is on the table. We have a \nsupplemental appropriations bill that is not only emergency disaster \nrelief, but it is supplemental appropriations. There are many people \nwho are concerned about how big this appropriations bill is. I am \nconcerned as well. I think that it grew too much. But since it is the \nfirst appropriations bill of this year--and this is June; we are \nhalfway through the year--a lot of people felt that we had to replenish \nthe coffers before we would get to the 1998 appropriations. So there is \nthat issue and that concern.\n  We have now a separate opportunity to deal with the anti-Government-\nshutdown provisions. I think we are going to have a day of reckoning on \nthis because there are those on the floor who have said, ``We don't \nwant to shut down Government, but this isn't the right bill.''\n  So now we have an agreement that we will take up, without a \nfilibuster, the issue of shutting down Government. We will send a bill \nto the President that gives him the opportunity to tell the people of \nAmerica once again that he does not want to shut down Government. The \nPresident has said this on many occasions, but he did not like this \nbill to have the anti-Government-shutdown provisions. So he is going to \nget this bill separately, and we are going to vote on an anti-\nGovernment-shutdown bill. It has been agreed to by both sides that that \nwill happen without any more political games.\n  I think the people of America should wake up and see who is trying to \nplay political games with the anti-Government-shutdown issue. We are \ntrying to prepare in an orderly way for the appropriations process in \nthis Congress. We are trying to assure the people who depend on \nGovernment, the people who work for Government, and the people who have \npensions that are supported by Government that there will not be a \ndisruption if Congress and the President have not agreed on some part \nof the appropriations bills.\n  So we have now set the process. We are going to vote on a \nsupplemental appropriations, and we are going to vote on an anti-\nGovernment-shutdown provision; and we are going to see if the President \nof the United States is sincere about wanting to work with Congress in \na negotiation with a level playing field that will set a process in \nplace so that we will not have a Government shutdown.\n\n  I think the test is yet to come. I hope that the people of America \nwill look to see how people vote when we have a straight up-or-down \nvote, which the President has asked for, which Congress has acceded to \ngiving the President what he has asked for, and see if the President is \nsincere about wanting to work with Congress.\n  I hope very much that the President and Congress will be able to work \ntogether. I think Congress has shown for its part that Congress is \nwilling to work with the President and to bow to his wishes. We have \ngiven him everything that he has asked from this Congress in a budget \nresolution, and now\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\nin a supplemental appropriations. I hope that this good will goes both \nways.\n  Last, Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Stevens from Alaska, who likes to describe himself as a bear \nbut who, in fact, is actually one of the most fair, even-handed people \nI have ever seen in a committee chairmanship in this Congress. He \ndeserves a lot of praise for his patience in working, not only with the \nPresident, but with the Democrats and with the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives to have a bill that would make sure that we cover the \ncosts of Bosnia, of the flood victims in North Dakota, of the tornado \nvictims in Texas, who will have some little bit of help from this bill, \nand the many others who have suffered disasters in our country.\n  I want to thank my cosponsor, Senator John McCain, for standing up on \nthe principle that we would not have a Government shutdown. I will tell \nyou that Senator McCain and I will not let this issue die. We are going \nto be back. We are going to have a clean vote. We are going to put the \nPresident to the test to see if he really wants to set a process that \ndoes not shut down the Government. Senator McCain and I are very \nsincere in wanting to make sure that never again will we have the \ndebacle of 1995.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens. I thank especially Senator Lott and Senator \nMcCain for standing on the principles that will make our appropriations \nprocess work in a responsible way.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for \nthe yeas and nays at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee yield?\n  I worked with the chairman and the chairman of the House Commerce \nJustice State Appropriations Committee during the supplemental \nappropriations conference to craft report language that requires the \nDepartment of Commerce to take into account a very important \nforthcoming GAO study which analyzes the cost of maintaining four \nNational Weather Service regional headquarters offices in the \ncontinental United States versus consolidation into three offices by \nclosure of the Southern Region Headquarters office. The language \nrequires the Department of Commerce to take this report into account. \nIt is my wish that it will cease its efforts to close the office now so \nthat it may take the report into consideration, as this language \nrequires them to do.\n  I want to ensure that this legislative history will be carried \nforward with the Senate's supplemental appropriations bill. Mr. \nChairman, can you give me this assurance?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is the case. And it is my hope that the \nDepartment of Commerce will assent to the Senator's wishes in this \nmatter to have this report fully considered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating \nthe people of the Dakotas and Minnesota for their hard work and \nperserverance through this ordeal. Their resolve speaks volumes about \nthe American spirit, and the American work ethic. I am also pleased \nwith the work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These civil \nservants have helped those Americans affected by natural disasters \nthrough one of the worst times of their lives. But Mr. President, I am \nconcerned with the way disaster relief has been handled by Congress and \nthe President.\n  What has come to be known as the disaster relief bill, is, in \nreality, nothing of the sort. Yes, there is disaster relief included in \nthis bill, but there are a number of other provisions as well. Two of \nthese provisions are well known to the American public, and they happen \nto be two provisions that I favor, and I believe a clear majority of \nColoradans favor as well. The most important is the Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act also known as a continuing resolution. The Government \nShutdown Prevention Act would allow the President and Congress to \ncontinue good faith budget negotiations without the specter of another \nGovernment shutdown. Without this, if the President and Congress cannot \nagree on funding levels by the end of the fiscal year, the Federal \nGovernment will shut down. If this happens, retirement checks, social \nsecurity payments, Government contracts could all be delayed, national \nparks would be closed, veterans services would be suspended, and \nFederal employees would be sent home with pay, a waste of valuable tax \ndollars. The President objects to the inclusion of the Government \nShutdown Prevention Act and vetoed disaster relief, holding those \nvictims of natural disasters hostage, because he did not want to live \nup to the commitment he made during his State of the Union Address.\n  Since the President has objected to riders unrelated to disaster aid, \nlet's look at what is included in his idea of a clean bill minus what \nhe considers to be unrelated riders. His version of a clean bill \nincludes: Assistance to Ukraine; Language concerning buy-American \nproducts; $140 million for the Health Education Assistance Loans \nProgram; $650,000 for the National Commission on the Cost of Higher \nEducation to pay salaries and expenses; $33.5 million for the Botanic \nGarden to pay salaries and expenses; $1.6 million for the Coast Guard \nto cover operating expenses relating to the TWA flight 800 crash; \n$650,000 to implement the Cost of Higher Education Review Act of 1997; \nand changes to the Welfare Reform Act;\n  And of most concern to me: $3.5 million for Housing and Urban \nDevelopment implementation in New York; and $500,000 for a parking \ngarage in Kentucky.\n  Many of my colleagues have discussed these issues time and time \nagain, and while many of these projects might be worthwhile, they have \nnothing to do with disaster relief. But the President overlooks each \none of these, and finds fault in preventing the Government from \nshutting down. I ask the President to stop playing games with the \nAmerican people by claiming that the Shutdown Prevention Act does not \nbelong in a disaster relief bill when there are multiple unrelated \nriders, to which he does not object, included in the same bill. I am \ntold that a clean disaster relief bill would be in the area of $3.3 \nbillion. With or without the Shutdown Prevention Act, this is not a \nclean bill, let us stop playing political games with America.\n  The President vetoed the bill because of extraneous provisions, \nmainly the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. Because this provision \nis not included, and because of the other provisions unrelated to \ndisaster relief included, I must vote no. A clean bill would not have \nthese additional provisions and I hope that my colleagues can agree \nthat extraneous means extra, no matter whose projects they are. I yield \nmy time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am voting in favor of the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997. I commend our \ncolleagues, the chairmen of the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittees, Senator Stevens and Congressman Livingston, for their \ndetermination, hard work, and leadership on this important bill.\n  And, as a member of the Senate-House Conference Committee, I \nappreciate the cooperative efforts of my counterpart, Congressman \nKolbe, the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTreasury, Postal Service and General Government. I also appreciate the \nvaluable work of my colleague, Senator Kohl, who serves as the ranking \nmember of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee.\n  This bill includes much needed assistance to our fellow Americans who \nhave been hard hit by natural disasters. I am also pleased that the \nconferees agreed to include two of my provisions which are vital to my \nhome State of Colorado.\n  The first provision includes $1.95 million to support law enforcement \nefforts during the Denver Summit of Eight which is occurring later this \nmonth.\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nThis historic economic summit, which includes Russia for the first time \nas an active participant, will draw the leaders of the world's leading \neconomies and thousands of other participants and guests. The funding \nwhich this supplemental includes will reimburse our police officers who \nare on the frontlines in providing the necessary security for the \nSummit of Eight.\n  The second provision delays the implementation by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration [HCFA] of a Medicare Competitive Pricing \nDemonstration project in Denver. The project, originally set to begin \nin January 1998, was ill-conceived in its design and had the potential \nto disrupt and reduce benefits for over 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries. \nMy colleagues and I are all committed to successfully testing \ncompetitive pricing as an alternative reimbursement mechanism for \nMedicare risk contractors. It is for that very reason I sought a delay \nand appreciated the resounding support of my Senate and House \ncolleagues.\n  In light of the importance of this supplemental appropriations bill, \nI urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 10 minutes and 21 \nseconds, and the Senator from West Virginia through the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has 5 minutes and 6 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Florida, Senator \nGraham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have talked about the principles that \nare represented by our action in legislation. Let me talk about an \nimportant principle. That is the principle that when we are dealing \nwith lives and we are dealing with the destruction and the aftermath of \na catastrophe, it is not the time to inject political ideology on \nunrelated subjects. I suggest that has been the policy of this Senate, \nthat has been the policy of this Federal Government.\n  Let me just give two examples of that policy. On September 21, 1989, \nHurricane Hugo slammed into Charleston, SC, and 29 people were killed \nin South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Hugo. One week after \nHurricane Hugo hit South Carolina, this Senate passed, by a vote of \n100-0, disaster assistance legislation. On the same day, it passed in \nthe House of Representatives, and the following day, September 29, 8 \ndays after the disaster, President Bush signed that into law. A \nDemocratic Congress, a Republican President, and in 8 days we responded \nto a major disaster within our Nation.\n  In my own State of Florida, on August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew \ndevastated the southern part of our State, killing 40 people and \ndestroying 25,000 homes. On September 8, President Bush requested $7.7 \nbillion of relief. Ten days later, the House and Senate passed the \nPresident's recommendation. It was signed into law on September 23, \n1992, 30 days after the hurricane had done such devastation.\n  Mr. President, that is the kind of schedule, that is the kind of \ncooperation between a Congress of one party and a President of another \nthat we should expect, that all Americans should expect, in the event \nof a disaster that causes extensive damage and loss of life.\n  Contrast those two past experiences with what we are, hopefully, \nabout to conclude today as it relates to the flooding in the Midwest. \nIt was on March 19 of this year that the President made his official \nrequest for disaster funds. After that date, the disaster became even \nmore severe as flooding occurred as a result of the severe winter. \nToday, on June 12, we hopefully will pass the legislation which will go \nto the President for his signature.\n  The principle is that we should not allow a repetition of what we are \nexperiencing in this concluding chapter of the suffering of the people \nof the upper Midwest. They deserve to be treated with the same dignity, \nrespect, and sense of urgency that we accorded the people of South \nCarolina in 1989, that was accorded to the people of my State of \nFlorida in 1992.\n  Mr. President, I commend those who have worked so hard to bring this \nissue to a resolution. I wish we had been congratulating ourselves on \nthis, not on the 12th of June, but many, many weeks earlier. I hope we \nhave learned a lesson from this experience, and that lesson is, deal \nwith the plight of people, not politics, when it comes to humanitarian \nrelief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has a total of \n45 seconds left.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to thank several additional people. \nThere have been so many people involved in this effort. The mayor of \nGrand Forks, Mayor Pat Owens, who has been just remarkable through this \nseries of disasters, and Mayor Lynn Stauss of East Grand Forks, who has \ncome to Washington three times to plead for the assistance that the \npeople of our area need, and two other people on my staff, Geri \nGaginis, who is from that area of our State and has worked tirelessly \nto help the people of that area, and Scott Carlson of my staff, who was \nreally the author of the provisions to help the livestock owners across \nthe part of our country that have lost hundreds of thousands of head of \nlivestock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand we are waiting for the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. Other than that, I had hoped we could \nget the vote started sooner. There are people that wanted to make \nconnections and leave.\n  Pending that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask the Senator if he would grant me 15 \nseconds?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I, too, want to thank Mayor Stauss and \nMayor Owens from East Grand Forks and Grand Forks for their very \ncourageous voices. They never gave up and they continue to give people \nhope. They gave all of us here a lot of hope.\n  I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield to the Democratic leader such time \nas he desires to use.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me begin with the chairman. I want to thank the \nSenator for his kindness. We would not be here if not for the \nleadership and the extraordinary effort the Senator from Alaska has put \nforth to bring us to this point. I publicly acknowledge his work and \nhis leadership on behalf of the people in South Dakota and our \ncolleagues here in the Senate. I thank him for all of his effort.\n  I heard my colleague from South Dakota express what I hope to also \nexpress, and that is gratitude to so many people who are responsible \nfor the fact that we are here this afternoon. I begin with our \nGovernor, who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in ways that \nare recognized on both sides of the aisle, and Brenda Barger, the mayor \nof Watertown. Watertown is lucky to have a leader as talented and as \ngifted as she is. All across South Dakota organizations have come forth \nand put so much effort into ensuring that our communities and our \npeople could hold themselves together in the way that they did. South \nDakotans have endured much over the past months, but throughout these \nmost difficult and unfortunate times they have shown courage and \ncompassion. I also want to thank my colleagues for all of the effort \nthey put forth in making possible this tremendous assistance.\n  I appreciate very much the work of the administration--the President, \nthe Vice President, James Lee Witt. People in the administration at all \nlevels could not have been more responsive. They went out to the \nDakotas and Minnesota not once, not twice, but on numerous occasions in \nan effort to fully appreciate the magnitude of the problem and to \nrespond as quickly and as comprehensively as they could. The President, \non at least two occasions, declared natural disasters in record time, \ntrying as he could to respond in ways that exceeded virtually \neveryone's expectation.\n  It has all been said so eloquently by my colleagues but this help is \ndesperately needed. People have waited too long. In some cases, lives \nhave been lost. Throughout our region, hundreds of thousands of \nlivestock have been\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nkilled. The magnitude of this loss is only now being fully appreciated. \nWe need this help and it will now at long last be on the way and in the \nhands of people who have been waiting patiently, in some cases, for \nmore than 2 months.\n  The work is only beginning. The passage of this legislation starts \nthe process by which rebuilding can begin. There is so much work to be \ndone in such a short period of time. We have about 100 to 110-some days \nof construction time available to us. I call upon those in the \nadministration who have already demonstrated such willingness to work \nwith us to respond now in this second phase, making sure that we \nmaximize the use of our time, making sure that we eliminate whatever \nbureaucratic encumbrances there are in an effort to get this assistance \nto those who need it the most, as quickly and as efficiently as we \npossibly can.\n  So there is much more work to be done and we need to expedite our \nefforts to ensure that it gets done in the most meaningful way in what \ntime is left, this year, in order for it to be done right.\n  Again, Mr. President, I express gratitude to all of those who had so \nmuch to do with the fact that we are here now this afternoon. I \nappreciate very much the cooperation, the partnership, and the efforts \nmade by all of those responsible to at long last send the help so \ndesperately needed by so many.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I did explain the important role of \nSenator Stevens from Alaska and our gratitude toward him. However, I \nwould be remiss if I did not tell the Senate the admiration we have for \nthe Senator from South Dakota in his leadership on this issue. He has \nbeen faithful and determined on this issue and all of us know that his \nfamily has had some medical challenges in recent hours. We very much \nappreciate what you have done for the country and for our region of the \nState. Much of the reason we are here at this moment on the edge of \nvictory in having disaster relief approved is because of the efforts of \nthe Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my friend and colleague from North Dakota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the bill. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Birth \n     Defects Prevention Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant \n     mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five \n     infant deaths.\n       (2) Thousands of the 150,000 infants born with a serious \n     birth defect annually face a lifetime of chronic disability \n     and illness.\n       (3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all \n     racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose \n     excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared \n     to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American \n     infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina \n     bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American \n     infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.\n       (4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to \n     environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during \n     pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are \n     slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of \n     birth defects. Outbreaks of birth defects may go undetected \n     because surveillance and research efforts are underdeveloped \n     and poorly coordinated.\n       (5) Public awareness strategies, such as programs using \n     folic acid vitamin supplements to prevent spina bifida and \n     alcohol avoidance programs to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, \n     are essential to prevent the heartache and costs associated \n     with birth defects.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROGRAMS REGARDING BIRTH DEFECTS.\n\n       Section 317C of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     247b-4) is amended to read as follows:\n\n\n                   ``programs regarding birth defects\n\n       ``Sec. 317C.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has chosen \nfinally to address this often overlooked but very compelling health \ncare problem in the United States.\n  We have been working with the March of Dimes and with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle since 1992 to deal with one of the most serious \nand compelling health care problems in America today. Many people are \nnot aware that birth defects affect over 3 percent of all births in \nAmerica, and they are the leading cause of infant death.\n  This year alone, approximately 150,000 babies will be born with a \nserious birth defect, resulting in 1 out of every 5 infant deaths.\n  Among the babies who survive, birth defects are a leading cause of \nlifelong disability. Medical care, special education, and many other \nservices are often required into adulthood, costing families thousands \nof dollars each year.\n  Let me share with you an experience I had when I was Governor of \nMissouri. In the early 1970's, I appropriated dollars to fund the high-\ncost, but highly effective, neonatal care units at our hospitals.\n  These remarkable institutions and the dedicated men and women who \nserve there do a tremendous job of saving low-birth-weight babies and \nbabies with severe birth defects. But it is not enough. As I talked to \nthe people and congratulated them on the great work they were doing, \nthey said, ``Why don't we do something to reduce the incidence of birth \ndefects and the problems that bring these tiniest of infants to these \nvery high-tech specialized care units?''\n  And despite the large number of babies born with and dying from birth \ndefects, we do not even know what causes most defects or where they are \neven occurring.\n  An unfortunate situation in Texas a few years ago exemplifies how the \nlack of a birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy delayed \nthe response to an outbreak of birth defects and may have needlessly \ncost innocent lives. At least 30 infants in south Texas were born \nwithout or with little brain tissue over a short period of time.\n  Because Texas did not have a birth defects surveillance system, and \nbecause our country did not have a comprehensive birth defects \nprevention and surveillance strategy, the severity of the problem was \nnot recognized until the incidence of birth defects was so high that it \nwas difficult to miss.\n  To avoid tragedies such as this from reoccurring, there is something \nthat we can do here today.\n  Passage of the Birth Defects Prevention Act will prioritize our \nefforts and make Congressional intent clear--more resources should be \ndirected for the prevention of the leading killer of babies, birth \ndefects.\n  S. 419 is a two-pronged approach to tackling this devastating public \nhealth problem.\n  First, the bill calls for a nationwide birth defects surveillance \nstrategy. The legislation directs the Centers for Disease Control to \nserve as a national clearinghouse for the collection and storage of \ndata on birth defects and to establish regional centers for the conduct \nof applied epidemiological research on such defects.\n  The bill also provides funding to public entities such as State \ngovernments to start up or improve existing surveillance programs. \nToday only about half of the states have some kind of birth defects \nsurveillance system.\n  The second focus of the Birth Defects Prevention Act is to broaden \npublic and professional awareness of birth defects and prevention \nopportunities.\n  Grants will be available to public entities and nonprofit \norganizations to develop and implement birth defect prevention \nstrategies, such as programs using folic acid vitamin supplements to \nprevent neural tube defects and alcohol avoidance strategies to prevent \nfetal alcohol syndrome [FAS].\n  It is important to note that many birth defects are indeed \npreventable. For instance, we now know that if women of childbearing \nage took a simple 400 microgram dose of the B vitamin folic acid each \nday, 50 to 70 percent of all cases of spina bifida and anencephaly \ncould be prevented--saving about $245 million each year and more \nimportantly, saving some families the heart ache that many of us have \nwitnessed friends and families go through.\n  It was a deficiency of folic acid that caused the tragedy in south \nTexas based on the diet, and it was only when we had enough instances \nwere the researchers able to identify what might be the problem.\n  A survey released by the March of Dimes just this week highlights the \nneed for an aggressive public awareness program on this issue. The \nsurvey indicates that only 32 percent of women ages 18 to 45 take a \ndaily multivitamin\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\ncontaining folic acid. Dr. Jennifer Howse, president of the March of \nDimes Birth Defects Foundation, also stated that ``seven out of 10 \nwomen begin taking folic acid too late to reduce their risk of having a \nbaby with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida or anencephaly. In \norder to be effective in preventing these defects, folic acid must be \nconsumed before pregnancy and during the early months of pregnancy.''\n  Fetal alcohol syndrome, which increases the risk that babies will \nsuffer from mental retardation, learning disorders and other problems, \nis also preventable.\n  Although preventable, an April 25 Associated Press article noted that \nthe number of pregnant women who say they frequently drink alcohol has \nincreased. The survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, \nfound that 3.5 percent of the respondents admitted they had seven or \nmore drinks per week or binged on five or more drinks within the \nprevious month.\n  Clearly, we must convey these crucial messages regarding birth defect \nprevention opportunities to the American people. Passage of the Birth \nDefects Prevention Act is a first step in this process.\n  The time has come for the U.S. Senate to join with groups such as the \nMarch of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Easter Seals \nSociety, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, and many \nother organizations, in advocating the need for a national strategy to \nprevent these devastating defects.\n  The bill also has broad bipartisan support. As of today, the Birth \nDefects Prevention Act has 33 cosponsors.\n  Let me conclude by recognizing the hard work and dedication of the \nMarch of Dimes and their volunteers throughout America; and \nspecifically, I want to single out Dr. Jennifer Howse, Jo Merrill, and \nMarina Weiss, for their daily involvement in trying to prevent the No. \n1 cause of infant deaths, birth defects.\n  Our country is forever indebted to the March of Dimes and its 3 \nmillion dedicated volunteers for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk three articles to which I made \nreference, and I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMore Women Know Vitamin Can Prevent Serious Birth Defects, But Few Are \n                 Taking It, March of Dimes Survey Finds\n\n Health Knowledge and Behaviors During Childbearing Years Are Assessed \n                         in Major Opinion Poll\n\n       White Plains, N.Y., June 10.--A new nationwide survey shows \n     that while more American women of childbearing age have heard \n     of folic acid, a B vitamin that can greatly reduce their risk \n     of having a baby with serious birth defects of the brain and \n     spine, the proportion of women actually taking a multivitamin \n     on a daily basis remains low.\n       Only 32 percent of women ages 18 to 45 take a daily \n     multivitamin containing folic acid. Among women who were \n     pregnant in the two years preceding the survey, only 23 \n     percent reported taking a daily multivitamin before pregnancy \n     began.\n       ``Seven out of 10 women begin taking folic acid too late to \n     reduce their risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect \n     such as spina bifida or anencephaly,'' said Dr. Jennifer L. \n     Howse, president of the March of Dimes Birth Defects \n     Foundation, which commissioned the survey. ``In order to be \n     effective in preventing these birth defects, folic acid must \n     be consumed before pregnancy and during the early months of \n     pregnancy. Much remains to be done to ensure that more women \n     get folic acid at the critical time and in the right amount \n     to improve their chances of having a healthy baby.''\n       The survey follows up a benchmark poll conducted two years \n     ago by the March of Dimes to assess women's knowledge and \n     behavior on a variety of issues relating to healthy \n     pregnancy. In the 1997 survey conducted for the March of \n     Dimes by The Gallup Organization under a grant from the U.S. \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2,001 women \n     between the ages of 18 and 45 were asked questions designed \n     to measure changes in awareness and behavior from 1995.\n       Awareness of folic acid jumped 14 percent points over the \n     two-year period, from 52 percent of women in 1995 to 66 \n     percent in 1997. Awareness of the U.S. Public Health Service \n     recommendation that all women capable of having a baby \n     consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent neural \n     tube defects rose from 15 percent in 1995 to 22 percent in \n     1997. Specific knowledge of the health benefits of folic acid \n     nearly doubled: whereas only 9 percent of women knew in 1995 \n     that folic acid can prevent birth defects, this figure rose \n     to 16 percent in 1997.\n       Asked in 1995 and 1997 to name a food that is a good source \n     of folic acid, about half of all women who had heard of folic \n     acid were unable to do so. However, in 1997, 16 percent who \n     had heard of folic acid correctly named orange juice as a \n     good source, up from just 6 percent in 1995.\n       Although nearly all women agree that it is important for a \n     woman who is planning to have a child to see her doctor \n     before she is pregnant, only 27 percent of the women who have \n     had a pregnancy say they actually made a visit to the doctor \n     prior to conceiving.\n       Since 1995, the March of Dimes has conducted a public \n     health education campaign called ``Think Ahead'' to inform \n     women of childbearing age of some simple steps they can take \n     before pregnancy to improve their chances of having a healthy \n     baby, including consuming folic acid and getting a medical \n     checkup.\n       ``There were some significant improvements over the 1995 \n     findings, but they fall far short of the levels that the \n     March of Dimes would like to see,'' Dr. Howse said. ``The \n     survey shows that awareness of important health messages can \n     increase when these messages are repeated continuously over \n     time, but that behavior changes more slowly. Younger women \n     especially could benefit from further education efforts.''\n       She noted that women under age 25 are the least likely to \n     consume vitamins daily, with only 23 percent reporting that \n     they do so. However, this age group accounts for 39 percent \n     of all births in the United States.\n\n\n                      importance of the news media\n\n       Dr. Howse pointed out the importance of the news media in \n     informing women about folic acid. The survey found that 36 \n     percent of women who have heard of folic acid say they \n     learned about it from a magazine or newspaper article, and 22 \n     percent learned of it from radio or television. Fifteen \n     percent of women say they received this information from \n     their doctor.\n       Dr. Howse noted that although enriched flours for products \n     such as bread, pasta, and cereal will be required to contain \n     folic acid as of January 1, 1998, the amount of folic acid \n     will not be sufficient to remove the need for daily \n     multivitamin use.\n       She also said the March of Dimes urges passage of the Birth \n     Defects Prevention Act (S. 419 and H.R. 1114), a bill \n     currently before Congress that would establish a national \n     birth defects surveillance, research, and prevention system. \n     This system would include research and demonstration projects \n     for the prevention of neural tube defects.\n       U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. \n     Shalala said, ``It is very important that we take advantage \n     of the prevention opportunity offered by folic acid. We still \n     have a lot of work to do to ensure that preventable birth \n     defects do not continue to occur.''\n       The March of Dimes survey results are based on telephone \n     interviews with a national sample of 2,001 women ages 18 to \n     45 conducted between January 21 and March 3, 1997. For \n     results based on samples of this size, one can say with 95 \n     percent confidence that the error attributable to sampling \n     and other random effects could be plus or minus 2 percentage \n     points.\n       Copies of the March of Dimes survey, ``Preparing for \n     Pregnancy II,'' item #41-948-97, can be obtained for $4.50 \n     plus shipping and handling costs by calling toll-free 1-800-\n     367-6630.\n       The March of Dimes is a national health agency whose \n     mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing \n     birth defects and infant mortality. Through its Campaign for \n     Healthier Babies, the march of Dimes funds programs of \n     research, community service, education and advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            More U.S. Women Drink While Pregnant, Study Says\n\n             Increase Raises Risk of Fetal Alcohol syndrome\n\n       More pregnant women are drinking than in 1991, raising the \n     risk that more babies will suffer mental retardation, \n     learning disorders and other problems, the government \n     reported yesterday.\n       A telephone survey by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     prevention found that 3.5 percent of 1,313 moms-to-be in 1995 \n     admitted they had had seven or more drinks per week or binged \n     on five or more drinks at once within the previous month. \n     That's up from 0.8 percent of 1,053 pregnant women in 1991.\n       The sample suggests that 140,000 pregnant women nationwide \n     were frequent drinkers in 1995, compared with 32,000 women in \n     1991. The CDC also said 16.3 percent of pregnant women \n     surveyed in 1995 had at least one drink in the preceding \n     month, compared with 12.4 percent in 1991.\n       The reason for the increase is unclear, but CDC researchers \n     plan to reexamine the survey to try to find out. Drinking \n     while pregnant can cause infants to be born with fetal \n     alcohol syndrome, a lifelone condition that can include \n     retardation, facial abnormalities, stunted growth and \n     learning disorders.\n       The 1995 survey questioned 33,585 randomly selected women \n     pregnant or not--ages 18 to 44. Of the total, more than half \n     said they drank at least once within the past month, and 12.6 \n     percent were frequent drinkers, those who have at least seven \n     drinks a week or five or more at once. The percentages were \n     similar to the 1991 figures, the CDC said.\n       Claire Coles, an expert on fetal alcohol syndrome, \n     speculated that people may simply be more honest about their \n     drinking\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\n     than in the earlier survey. In any case, she said, \n     obstetricians and gynecologists need to talk to their \n     patients about the dangers of alcohol.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, June 10, 1997]\n\n           Few Women Take Folic Acid To Prepare for Pregnancy\n\n                          (By Steve Sternberg)\n\n       Although many women of childbearing age now know that folic \n     acid taken daily can avert birth defects, 78% still take a \n     risk rather than a multivitamin, a new survey shows.\n       The survey of 2,001 women ages 18 to 45, released today by \n     the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, indicates that \n     66% know the value of folic acid in fetal development, up 14 \n     percentage points from the March of Dimes' first such survey \n     two years ago. Yet just 23% reported taking a multivitamin \n     before their pregnancy began.\n       ``The brain and the spinal cord develop in the first four \n     weeks of pregnancy,'' says Richard Johnston, medical director \n     of the White Plains, N.Y., foundation. As a result, he says, \n     women must begin taking folic acid before the pregnancy for \n     it to lower the child's risk of birth defects.\n       Folic acid is found in green leafy vegetables and liver. In \n     1992, the U.S. Public Health Service advised all women who \n     could become pregnant to take 400 micrograms of folic acid a \n     day to boost their odds of having a normal infant. The \n     recommended daily allowance is 200 micrograms.\n       The nutrient is so critical for fetal development that the \n     U.S. government last year required that 140 micrograms be \n     added to cereals and bread, trying to boost women's dietary \n     intake without masking a rare but dangerous form of anemia.\n       The March of Dimes and other groups have spent the last two \n     years trying to get the message out.\n       If taken within a few weeks of conception, folic acid cuts \n     by two-thirds the risk of two devastating birth defects: \n     spina bifida, a paralyzing abnormality that leaves the nerves \n     of the spine exposed, and anencephaly, in which an infant is \n     born without a developed brain.\n       Each year, at least 2,500 children are born with one of \n     these defects.\n       Joseph Molinari, a birth defects epidemiologist at the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, says \n     of the survey, ``We think it's important, because it tells \n     that women are learning about folic acid but not changing \n     their behavior.''\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to join other Members of the Senate in \ncommending Senator Bond for his work in developing this legislation and \nfor his strong commitment to this program. He has been interested in \nand committed to children over a long period of time--both in the \nSenate and as a Governor. I think all of us are very much aware of his \nleadership in the family and medical leave program a number of years \nago, and in working closely with Senator Dodd and me. This legislation \nis another indication of his strong commitment in terms of the most \nvulnerable in our society--the children, and particularly those that \nhave some very special needs in the form of defects.\n  I join with him, too, in commending the March of Dimes and all of the \norganizations and all of the volunteers. The individuals who are part \nof these organizations spend hours and hours doing the hard and \ndifficult work--knocking on doors, spending many hours away from their \nfamilies in this volunteer commitment to make a difference to children. \nWe too often forget about all of their dedication, hard work and \ncommitment.\n  I think of the families in this country whose lives in one way or \nanother have been touched by the March of Dimes and the voluntary \norganizations who have been supportive of the birth defects \nlegislation. I join in thanking them. This is really their achievement, \nbut most importantly the achievement for children; those that are born \nnow and those that are yet to be born in the future whose lives will be \nenhanced and who will be enriched and will have healthier lives because \nof this legislation. Also, the parents of those children who will be \nrelieved of a great deal of the anxiety and the concern as they love \nthose children and see these children struggling to deal with some of \nthe really serious kinds of birth defects that affect too many in our \ncountry.\n  As the good Senator has pointed out, so many of these defects are \npreventable. It would be one thing if they were unavoidable, but they \nare avoidable. If we develop the kind of approach that I think this \nlegislation provides, we can really see an important difference made \nfor many, many of our children.\n  As Senator Bond has pointed out, more than 150,000 infants are born \nwith serious birth defects, making birth defects the leading cause of \ninfant mortality in the United States. Families from all racial, \nethnic, and economic groups share the risk of having a child born with \na serious defect. It makes no difference from what part of this country \nyou come. The danger is there of developing the kind of defects this \nlegislation is focused to try to prevent.\n  Birth defects are also a leading cause of childhood morbidity and \ndisability. Medical care and special education made necessary by these \ndefects cost families and the Government billions of dollars a year and \nconsume a disproportionate share of our health care resources.\n  Large numbers, as I mentioned, of these birth defects are \npreventable. For most, the cause is unknown. But each year thousands of \nchildren are born with defects such as spina bifida and fetal alcohol \nsyndrome that are largely preventable. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a \nleading cause of mental retardation, and it affects approximately 8,000 \ninfants per year, yet all of these case are preventable.\n  We can do much more to help States to develop surveillance programs \nwhich count the number of babies born with birth defects and identify \ncommunities and populations at higher risk. Currently, only about half \nthe States have some kind of birth defects surveillance system in \nplace.\n  We must also develop new and effective types of early intervention \nwhich can be integrated into our public health and medical care \nsystems. Preventing birth defects will dramatically reduce the costs of \nmedical care, for special education, and for social services for \naffected individuals and families.\n  The Birth Defect Prevention Act is a major step toward a national \npriority for surveillance, research, and prevention. The act will be \noverseen by the Centers for Disease Control and will provide grants to \nthe States to establish a State-based birth defect surveillance program \nand establish regional centers for birth defect prevention research.\n  It will provide the States with funding for demonstration projects \naimed at birth defect prevention as well as technical assistance to \nimplement programs of proven effectiveness. There will be shared \ninformation when we find out that some programs have been very \neffective. We will be able to get that information out to other \ncommunities. This will be powerful in terms of enhancing local \ncommunities with information that will show the advantages of some of \nthe programs that are proven effective.\n  It will broaden public and professional awareness of birth defects \nand prevention opportunities. There is enormous impact this can have in \nterms of sensitizing the whole medical profession about these needs and \nthat can have a powerful effect in developing opportunities and \nmodalities for prevention.\n  In this congressional session we have an unprecedented opportunity to \nprioritize children and children's health. Along with the Hatch and \nKennedy legislation that expands health insurance coverage to uninsured \nchildren and improves access to prenatal care, this act will serve to \nimprove health, prevent disease, and enhance the lives of children and \nfamilies.\n  Even as we are meeting this afternoon, the Finance Committee is \nworking through how to provide resources to the States to provide help \nand assistance to millions of American children that would qualify \nunder the Medicare programs to make sure their health care needs are \nattended to. Senator Hatch and I are hopeful that before long we will \nhave an opportunity again to address the Senate on our program which \nwould ensure that good, comprehensive coverage for children in all of \nour States is fully funded and financed by an increase in the cigarette \ntax.\n  We will have the additional advantage of discouraging young teenagers \nfrom smoking.\n  So I again thank the Senator for his leadership and commend him for \nhis efforts in this area. He has taken a concept and put it into \nlegislation and passed it in a very, very short time.\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nBut it is certainly consistent with his longstanding interest with \nchildren, and we look forward to work with him on other issues as well \nthat affect children in this country.\n  Mr DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support the Birth Defects \nPrevention Act. I commend Senator Bond for his work on this \nlegislation, and I am pleased to have been one of its cosponsors. I am \nconfident that this legislation will significantly enhance our \nunderstanding of birth defects and lower the frequency with which they \noccur.\n  Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in this \ncountry, and in many cases, children with birth defects face a lifetime \nof disability.\n  The efforts of these children to cope with and overcome their \ndisabilities are an inspiration to all of us. It is tragic, however, to \nthink that, for so many, their struggles could have been prevented. \nWith better education and health care for mothers, many birth defects \ncan be avoided entirely. Yet, our country still has no national \nstrategy for reducing the incidence of birth defects. That is why I am \nrising today in support of this legislation.\n  At the root of our prevention efforts is the need to increase the \nflow of information regarding birth defects. Without well-coordinated \nresearch efforts and surveillance, outbreaks of birth defects may go \nundetected.\n  This bill would provide Federal grants to State health authorities \nfor the purpose of collecting and researching birth defects statistics. \nThese grants are necessary since many States have no system in place \nfor the monitoring of birth defects.\n  This bill would also establish at least five regional research \nprograms that would collect and analyze information on the number, \nincidence, and causes of birth defects. In addition, it would institute \nthe Center for Disease Control as the coordinating agency for birth \ndefects prevention activities by establishing a clearinghouse within \nthe CDC to collect and store data on birth defects. The CDC would also \nbe responsible for facilitating the coordination of research and policy \ndevelopment to prevent birth defects.\n  But while efforts to prevent birth defects begin with education, the \ntask of changing the behavioral patterns is far more difficult. While \nprogress is being made in this struggle, there remains a great deal of \nwork to be done. The findings of a March of Dimes study that was \nreleased this week provides a great illustration of this point.\n  A simple 400 mg daily dose of the B vitamin folic acid could prevent \n50 to 70 percent of all cases of spina bifida and anencephaly. The \nrecent March of Dimes survey found that 66 percent of all women know \nthe value of folic acid in fetal development, marking a 14 percent \nincrease over the past 2 years. However, just 23 percent of all women \nreported taking a multivitamin before their pregnancy began. Women are \nlearning about folic acid but not changing their behavior.\n  As we all know, behavioral patterns do not change overnight, but if \nwe continue to educate the population changes will occur, as evidenced \nby the fact that the number of women who smoke during pregnancy has \ndropped 29 percent since 1989.\n  While there is nothing that can be done to prevent most birth \ndefects, it is unconscionable that every day in America children are \nbeing born with illnesses that we could prevent, and in the most severe \ncases, children are dying. I urge my colleagues to make a commitment to \nfighting the problem of birth defects, and I ask that they join me in \nsupporting the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997.\n\n\n                               cody groce\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell \nmy colleagues about a very special individual I met recently. Cody \nGroce is an active, healthy, intelligent 5-year-old from Elkin, NC, who \nplans on becoming a doctor when he grows up. His story seems like that \nof any young man, however, Cody is special because he was born with a \nserious birth defect.\n  During a prenatal care visit Brenda Groce, Cody's mother, was told \nthat the baby she was carrying had life-threatening urinary problems. \nAt birth, Cody was admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit and had \nsurgery to save his kidneys and his life.\n  Cody is now healthy and busy sharing his story with people across the \ncountry as the National Ambassador for the March of Dimes. I met Cody \nin March when he came to visit my office to tell me about his story and \nthis important legislation.\n  There are 150,000 children, like Cody, that are born every year with \na serious birth defect. And it is because of these children that we \nmust pass S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997.\n  This legislation establishes a national, State-based, birth defects \nsurveillance, research and prevention system to help us to find the \ncauses of birth defects like Cody's and prevent them. Birth defects \nsurveillance programs can count the number of babies born with birth \ndefects and identify communities and/or populations with higher risks. \nIn addition, this legislation develops education and prevention \nprograms for birth defects with known causes.\n  So, I ask my colleagues help my friend Cody and others like him by \nvoting for S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Birth \nDefects Prevention Act and want to urge all of my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this important measure. I am especially pleased that the \nlegislative logjam that prevented the Senate's consideration of the \nbill earlier this week has now been broken, permitting us to do the \nwork of the Senate.\n  In my roles as the president of the National Commission of Children \nand cochair of the Health Alliance, I have had occasion to learn \nfirsthand of the daily struggles of families of children with birth \ndefects. These parents must be tireless advocates for their children \neach and every day to ensure that their child's health and education \nneeds are met and to see that their child has the opportunity to reach \nhis or her full potential. The struggles that these families face in \ntheir fight to get adequate insurance coverage for their children's \nmedical needs are trials that no parent or child should have to endure. \nPerhaps the greatest tragedy is that in many cases, these birth defects \ncould have been prevented, if only the parents had access to \ninformation on adequate nutrition and to quality prenatal care, or if \nour researchers had adequate funding to pursue their questions. That's \nexactly why this bill is so important.\n  The Birth Defects Prevention Act would authorize $42 million for the \nestablishment of a comprehensive national system of birth defects \nprevention programs with oversight by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. This would provide for a national, State-based birth \ndefects surveillance system. It would authorize funding and CDC \nexpertise to establish regional prevention research centers, as well as \nlocal prevention and intervention programs. It would also establish a \nnational advisory committee on birth defects and a National Information \nClearinghouse on Birth Defects.\n  This legislation is important because at the present time, less that \nhalf our States have a birth defects surveillance system. This has \ngreatly limited our understanding of birth defects as well as our \nability to prevent them. Birth defects are the leading cause of infant \nmortality, responsible for one out of every five infant deaths. Each \nyear, 150,000 children are born with a serious birth defect. Birth \ndefects are also the leading cause of childhood disability. Yet despite \nthe high numbers of babies born each year with birth defects, we still \ndo not know the causes of most birth defects. The establishment of a \nnational tracking system would significantly advance our scientific \nunderstanding of birth defects.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have seen \nthe struggles of men and women who worry that exposures to chemical \nagents they may have encountered in military service in Vietnam or the \nPersian Gulf may have contributed to birth defects in their children. I \nhave heard testimony of men and women who bravely served in our \nmilitary and who now are afraid to start a family or have more children \nbecause of these fears. The Institute of Medicine reported an \nassociation among our Vietnam veterans between exposure to Agent Orange \nand a greater risk of having a child with spina bifida. Now we are \nfaced with the very difficult and emotional question of whether there \nis an increased rate of birth defects among gulf war veterans. The \nstudies are underway, but none has provided a\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\nclear answer that will adequately address our concerns. The studies \nwill continue, but some of our difficulty in answering questions about \nveteran populations has to do with our poor understanding of birth \ndefects. This legislation will help with these issues by increasing our \nscientific understanding of birth defects and increasing current \nprevention efforts in all populations. Therefore, I am proud to \ncosponsor this important bill.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, unless someone else wishes to speak, I think \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and I are prepared to \nyield back.\n  I express my sincere thanks to Senator Kennedy, who has long been a \nchampion in this area. His very excellent statement does indicate the \ntremendous and compelling nature of this problem. This is a problem, \nunfortunately, that affects 150,000 children a year, but it never seems \nto get up on the radar screen.\n  Now, the fact that we are going to pass this on a voice vote--we had \n33 sponsors. Actually, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hutchison \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. That brings it to 34. I hope that will make the point that \nwe are serious about it. That this is the fifth year, Mr. President, \nthis has got to be passed is an outrage; this is a bill that nobody \nobjects to. I think anybody would think it is common sense. But it just \ngets crowded off the agenda. I do not intend to let it get crowded off.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, the Senator from Vermont, and their staffs. We included \nas a substitute the measure as originally passed last year, and I know \nthat we can count on the committee to insist upon it. I cannot believe \nwe will fail this year once again to pass a measure which can do so \nmuch to reduce hardship and suffering and needless heartbreak \nthroughout America.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time.\n  Is there anyone else seeking time?\n  Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time and would not ask for \nthe yeas and nays per the previous agreement. I ask it be adopted by \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 371) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The bill (S. 419), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will take only 1 minute and say a sincere \nthanks to Joe Pierle of my staff, who has worked on this measure and \nhas had great cooperation with the Labor Committee. I also would thank \nprevious staffers, Mark Hayes and Leanne Jerome, who have worked on \nthis for 5 years now. And we hope this is the last time we have to do \nit.\n  Again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we very much appreciate and \nthank the leadership of the March of Dimes and the 3 million dedicated \nvolunteers across this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Since this is the time for commendation, I would just, \nif I could, note that Governor Bond, then, in 1981, was effective in \ndeveloping a long-range prevention, screening and health care \ninitiative in response to Missouri's infant death rate being among the \nhighest in the Nation, and in the 1989-90 period the Better Child Care \nAct that was developed here in legislation. Just looking through the \nSenator's achievements--and, as I mentioned earlier, his work on family \nand medical leave--it is a very clear indication of the Senator's very \nstrong commitment to children. It is something all of us know here, but \nI think it is well worthwhile having that referenced at the time that \nwe pass this very important piece of legislation.\n  Again, I commend him and will try to find, if we can, other ways of \nworking on children's issues as well.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. It is always a pleasure to work with him in the many, \nmany areas in which we agree. It is not all of them, but when we do \nagree it is a real pleasure to work with a champion of children's \nhealth and well-being.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5584-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a \nwonderful group of young men and women who have served as Senate pages \nover the last 5 months.\n  This particular group has served with great distinction and has done \na marvelous job maintaining a high standard of excellence in both the \nacademic arena and the contributions they make to the day-to-day \noperations of the Senate.\n  Page life is not easy. In fact, most people may not fully appreciate \nthe rigorous nature of the page's work. On a typical day, pages rise \nearly and are in school by 6:15 a.m. After spending several hours each \nmorning in school, the pages then report to the Capitol to prepare the \nSenate Chamber for the day's session. It is the responsibility of the \npages to ensure that each Senator's desk has a copy of: The Senate \nLegislative and Executive Calendars; the legislation under \nconsideration; and the Congressional Record, as well as any other \ndocument that a Senator might want to have available to colleagues.\n  Throughout the day, pages are called upon to perform a myriad of \ntasks. These tasks might include obtaining copies of documents for a \nSenator's use during debate; ensuring that copies of relevant documents \nare available for Senators and staff; running errands between the \nCapitol and the Senate Office Buildings, as well as providing \nassistance at the regularly scheduled conference luncheons.\n  Once the Senate has concluded business for the day, no matter what \ntime, the pages return to the dorm and prepare for the next day's \nclasses and Senate session and, we hope, get some much-needed sleep. \nEven with all of this, the Senate pages continually discharge their \ntasks efficiently and cheerfully.\n   Mr. President, it is my hope that we have given the pages some \ninsight into the need for individuals to become involved in community \nand civic activities. The future of our Nation strongly depends on the \ngenerations who will\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\nfollow us in this august body. I look forward to the likely possibility \nthat one or more of this fine group of young people will return here to \nserve as Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  In closing, I hope the experiences the pages have gained here will \ninspire them to return to their respective communities as better \ncitizens and with a greater appreciation for public service. Speaking \non behalf of all Democratic Members, we wish them well and thank them \nfor a job well done. Good luck and best wishes for a bright and \nsuccessful future.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the 1997 \nspring pages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        1997 Spring Senate Pages\n\n\n                               democratic\n\n       Mary Elizabeth Begin (RI).\n       Brian Burton (NY).\n       Matthew Canter (WI).\n       Amanda Croushore (WI).\n       Andrea Hoekman (SD).\n       Charlotte Houghteling (MA).\n       Christina Monico (IL).\n       Robert Mook (VT).\n       George Nelson (MT).\n       Karoline Pershell (MI).\n       David Robinson (AR).\n       Timothy Smith (TX).\n       Shatika Starks (MD).\n       Nathan Zukas (WI).\n\n\n                               republican\n\n       Carmen Anderson (SC).\n       LaKeisha Applegate (RI).\n       Kathryn Brotherton (WA).\n       Leslie Carter (SC).\n       Danielle DeArment (VA).\n       Hamilton Frey (MS).\n       Whitney Gilliam (SC).\n       Sarah Gregg (NH).\n       Jayne Merner (RI).\n       Catherine Mitchell (NC).\n       Jordan Raphael (VT).\n       Brian Reagan (UT).\n       Joanna Steckler (VA).\n       Matthew Wales (IN).\n       Mercedes Weyher (UT).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5589-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today, I would like to comment on this \nhistoric anniversary that we have reached. Today marks the 30th \nanniversary of the end of the Six-Day War, and the reunification of \nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. It is not only a landmark for the \npeople of Israel, and for Jews around the world, but for people of all \nfaiths and all nationalities.\n  The 19 years that East Jerusalem was under the control of Jordan saw \nJews and Israelis denied the chance to visit the holy sites in the \neastern side. The dividing walls and the barbed wire have now come \ndown. When Jerusalem was reunited, Israel opened the city up to all \nfaiths, and that practice continues. Jews, Christians, and Muslims now \nmingle freely in the entire city.\n  Reunification did come at a great cost--the price paid was the Six-\nDay War. Israel launched a preemptive strike against the Arab troops \nmassed against her, and was successful. It ended the dividing of \nJerusalem, but it did not end the gunfire. There is still turmoil in \nIsrael.\n  However, although the Mideast peace process is by no means over, we \nhave perhaps reached a point, as described by Churchill, at the end of \nthe beginning. The recognition and continuation of Jerusalem as the \nundivided capital of Israel is crucial to the ongoing peace process.\n  The United States Congress has recognized this fact, and through a \nseries of actions has sought to insure that an undivided Jerusalem is \nthe capital of the State of Israel. Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, \nin 1990, declared that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital and \ncalled for Israel and the Palestinians to undertake peace negotiations. \nThis war later cited by Prime Minister Rabin as having helped bring \nparticipants of the Declaration of Principals on Interim Self-\nGovernment Arrangements to the negotiating table. In 1995, the \nJerusalem Embassy Act stated as a matter of U.S. Policy that Jerusalem \nshould remain the undivided capital.\n  We now celebrate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of \nJerusalem, and affirm our desire for that ancient city to remain \nreunited eternally. I ask, too, that Jerusalem eternally remain a \nsymbol of freedom where all religions can share in visiting the holy \ncity and be a model for religious tolerance and freedom throughout the \nglobe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5590-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5590-S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATO ENLARGEMENT AFTER PARIS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, having recently returned from Paris and the \nsigning of the NATO-Russia charter, I rise today to discuss what is one \nof the most important foreign policy questions facing the United \nStates--and facing this body: The enlargement of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization to include several new democracies of Central \nEurope.\n  Mr. President, I know that what I have just said will at first seem \ncounterintuitive to many Americans. Why is NATO enlargement so \nimportant? After all, the Soviet Union is but a bad memory, communism \nin Europe lives on in stunted form only in Serbia and Belarus, and no \nmilitary threat in Europe is in sight.\n  Moreover, some will correctly point out, the Pacific Rim has become \nthe world's premier area for economic growth, and Latin America, while \nalso a prime opportunity for trade and investment, is vitally important \nto the United States because of problems like illegal immigration and \ndrug trafficking.\n  So why are we bothering with Europe, much less tinkering with a \nhugely successful alliance like NATO?\n  Mr. President, these are legitimate questions that must be answered. \nI would submit, first of all, without minimizing the importance of Asia \nand Latin America, that Europe remains a vital area of interest for the \nUnited States for political, strategic, economic, and cultural reasons. \nA sizable percentage of the world's democracies are in Europe, and the \ncontinent remains a major global economic player and partner of the \nUnited States.\n  The European union, composed of 15 vibrant free-market democracies, \nhas embarked upon an ambitious program to create an ever closer union \nwith greater political, economic, and social integration. Most of \nCentral and Eastern Europe has gone through several free elections, and \ndemocracy is putting down firm roots.\n  In economic terms, the European union, with a combined population a \nthird larger than ours, has a combined gross domestic product that \nexceeds ours. While the United States has a larger--and, I might add, \nless balanced--trading relationship with Asia than with Europe, we \ninvest far more in Europe.\n  Several new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe have highly \neducated work forces, already boast rapidly expanding economies, and \nalready attract considerable American investment.\n  Moreover, most Americans trace their cultural roots to Europe, and \nmillions retain personal ties to it. By any geopolitical standard, it \nwould be a catastrophe for U.S. interests if instability would alter \nthe current situation in Europe.\n  How might that instability occur? Well, no one believes that the \nRussian\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\narmy is poised to pour through the Fulda Gap in Germany--NATO's horror \nscenario for 45 years. The Russian army is in such pitiful shape that \nit could not even reconquer little Chechnya, a part of the Russian \nfederation.\n  No, the threats to stability in Europe have changed, but they are, if \nanything, even more real than those of the cold war. We all know what \nthey are. They are ethnic and religious hatred as horrifyingly shown in \nthe hundreds of thousands killed, raped, made homeless, or otherwise \nbrutalized in Bosnia.\n  They are the well-organized forces of international crime, whose \ntentacles extend from Moscow and Palermo to New York and Los Angeles.\n  True--but some might ask why the Europeans can't take care of their \nown problems? Mr. President, life is not fair. Unfortunately, the \nhistory of the 20th century has demonstrated that the United States \nmust play a leading role in organizing the security of Europe. In World \nWar I, in World War II, and lately in Bosnia and Herzegovina, without \nAmerican leadership the countries of Europe have been unable to resolve \ntheir differences peacefully.\n  While American idealism has certainly played a role in our various \ninterventions to rescue Europe, enlightened self-interest has been the \ndominant motive. Put simply: It is in the vital interest of the United \nStates that stability be preserved in Europe.\n  How does that translate into 1997 terms? It means that we must lead \nthe Europeans to create what is called in current policy jargon a new \nsecurity architecture to guarantee stability to the areas most \nvulnerable to disruption.\n  To no one's surprise, I am talking about Central and Eastern Europe, \nwhere Newly Independent States are striving to create and solidify \npolitical democracy and free markets. It is a difficult process, which \nif not put into a larger framework could spin out of control.\n  It is in this context that the enlargement of NATO must be seen. \nDuring the cold war, NATO provided the security umbrella under which \nformer enemies like France and Germany were able to cooperate and build \nhighly successful free societies.\n  It was the framework in which former pariahs like Germany, Italy, and \nSpain could be reintegrated into democratic Europe. And it was NATO \nthat kept the feud between Greece and Turkey from escalating to \nwarfare.\n  The enlargement of NATO can now serve to move the zone of stability \neastward to central Europe and thereby both prevent ethnic conflicts \nfrom escalating and forestall a scramble for new bilateral and \nmultilateral pacts along the lines of the 1930's from occurring.\n  For if NATO were not to enlarge, the countries between Germany and \nRussia would inevitably seek other means to protect themselves. The \nquestion for today is not ``enlarge NATO or remain the same.'' The \nstatus quo is simply not an option.\n  In fact, we already have clear evidence of how NATO can act as a \nstabilizing influence in the region. Two years ago, NATO listed \nfriendly relations with neighbors as one of the core criteria for \njoining the alliance. Merely the possibility of attaining membership \nrapidly induced centuries-old enemies like Hungary and Romania to bury \nthe hatchet, conclude a treaty of friendship, and even begin intensive \nmilitary cooperation. The same is true to a lesser extent between \nHungary and Slovakia.\n  Italy and Slovenia have settled a long-festering property dispute. \nThe Czech Republic and Germany have formally come to terms with the \nNazis' war-time atrocities and with Czechoslovakia's post-war expulsion \nof 3 million sudeten Germans. I submit that none of these highly \nencouraging developments would have occurred without the carrot of \nadmission to NATO having been offered.\n  Mr. President, there is one additional argument for NATO enlargement: \nThe moral one. For 40 years the United States loudly proclaimed its \nsolidarity with the captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe who \nwere under the heel of Communist oppressors. Now that most of them have \ncast off their shackles, it is our responsibility to live up to our \npledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European \nUnion when they are fully qualified.\n  Let me be precise in my policy formulation. I believe it would be in \nour national interest for NATO to extend invitations to final \nnegotiations for membership at its July summit in Madrid to Poland, the \nCzech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia.\n  All of these countries have fulfilled the basic criteria for NATO \nmembership--Political democracy, free-market economy, civilian control \nof the military, peaceful relations with neighbors, and a commitment to \nNATO principles and Trans-Atlantic security.\n  In each of these countries democracy and free-market capitalism are \non sound footings. All four are able to assume the political, military, \nand financial responsibilities of membership.\n  Mr. President, this morning the administration announced that it will \nonly support the candidacies at Madrid of Poland, the Czech Republic, \nand Hungary. I regret the omission of Slovenia from this list, but I \nrecognize the political realities--especially among the current \nEuropean members of NATO--that argued for this decision.\n  After my discussions last night with the President and his advisers, \nI am convinced that Slovenia will be the No. 1 candidate for membership \nin the second round of NATO enlargement--and in a short time.\n  For me, the logic of enlargement is inescapable. But because the \nissue is complex and remote from the daily lives of most Americans, I \nalso believe that it is critically important immediately to initiate a \nnational debate on NATO enlargement.\n  No foreign policy, no matter how well-formulated, can be sustained \nwithout the informed consent of the American people, which is why we \nneed to launch a national debate to explore the costs, obligations, and \nbenefits to the United States of NATO enlargement. I have asked \nChairman Helms to hold hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee; I believe they will be an essential part of this debate.\n  Meetings in non-governmental forums across the country are likewise \nessential if our people are to understand the profound importance of \nthe issue before us.\n  I believe that when they have examined the facts, the American people \nwill support us in our effort to enlarge the alliance and build the new \nEuropean security architecture.\n  For 40 years after World War II, NATO bound together the democracies \nof Western Europe and North America in a military alliance to counter \nthe threat of Soviet communism. The statesmen who crafted the \nWashington treaty of 1949 bequeathed their successors an alliance of \nunparalleled effectiveness, one that deterred aggression for four \ndecades until its adversary collapsed from internal weakness.\n  Ironically, within the fruits of NATO's success lie the seeds of its \npossible demise. Alliances are formed to fight wars or to deter them. \nOnce the adversary is gone, unless they adapt to meet changing threats, \nthey lose their reason for being. My good friend from Indiana, Senator \nLugar, recognized this fact when he said that NATO must ``go out of \narea or go out of business,'' and I wholeheartedly agree with him. For \nthis reason too, the status quo is simply not an option.\n  Enlargement must be accompanied by a redefinition of NATO's mission. \nThe Alliance's primary mission as outlined in article 5 of the \nWashington Treaty of April 4, 1949, remains the same: Treating an \nattack on one member as an attack on all and responding through the use \nof armed force if necessary. Now, in the current post-cold-war \nsituation, non-article 5 missions like peacekeeping, sometimes in \ncooperation with non-NATO powers have become possible.\n  The SFOR joint effort in Bosnia and Herzegovina with Russia and \nseveral other non-NATO countries is an excellent example.\n  But what about our erstwhile adversary, Russia? Many ask whether \nenlarging NATO will not rekindle the cold war and strengthen the hand \nof hostile nationalists and communists in Russia. Again, this is not \nonly a legitimate question to ask, but a necessary one.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that NATO enlargement need not \nadversely affect United States relations with Russia. I came to this \nconclusion on a\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\ntrip to Moscow and several central European capitals earlier this \nspring. My observations are contained in greater detail in a Foreign \nRelations Committee report that I wrote entitled: ``Meeting the \nchallenges of a Post-Cold War World: NATO Enlargement and U.S.-Russia \nRelations.''\n  Although few Russians are fond of NATO enlargement, policymakers in \nMoscow have accepted it. Moreover, no Russian politician whom I met--\nfrom communist leader Zyuganov, to liberal leader Yavlinsky, to the \nnationalist General Lebed--believed that NATO enlargement constitutes a \nsecurity threat to Russia.\n  In fact, nearly all politicians and experts whom I met understood the \nnon-aggressiveness implicit in NATO's ``three no's\" --the Alliance's \ndeclarations of having no reason, intention, or plan in the current and \nforeseeable security environment permanently to station nuclear weapons \nor substantial combat forces of current members on the territory of new \nmembers.\n  Rather, the Kremlin's public opposition to enlargement is largely a \npsychological question connected with the loss of empire, wounded \npride, and--most importantly--an uncertainty about Russia's place in \nthe world of the 21st century.\n  As part of this uncertainty, most Russian leaders are worried about \ntheir country's being marginalized, and as a result they are eager to \nmove forward with its bilateral relationship with the United States.\n  Mr. President, let us not kid ourselves. Never is a long time, and \nRussia's current weakened condition is sure to improve. We must \ncontinue to engage Russia politically, militarily, and economically.\n  The Clinton administration, together with our NATO allies, has \nalready begun to do so. As I mentioned earlier, 2 weeks ago in Paris, \nthe heads of government of the 16 NATO members and President Yeltsin \nsigned the so-called ``Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation \nand Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation.'' President \nClinton asked me to accompany him to represent the United States at the \nsigning ceremony.\n  Time does not permit me to go into detail about this lengthy \ndocument, except to say that it is a good start at binding Russia \ncloser to the West and soothing its bruised feelings, without giving \nMoscow a decision-making role in NATO's core structures.\n  It creates a new body called the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, \nwhich will serve as a forum for consultation on matters such as \npeacekeeping operations, conflict prevention, and combatting terrorism.\n  But let me reemphasize to my colleagues that the Alliance will not in \nany way be subordinated to the NATO-Russia Joint Council.\n  When NATO members gather to discuss alliance policy, no outside \ncountry will have any right or privilege to prevent NATO from doing \nwhat is best for its member states. And no outside country will have \nany say in whether new countries are admitted to NATO.\n  Its purely consultative mandate, however, does not mean that the \nJoint Council cannot evolve into a truly valuable mechanism for \npromoting mutual trust.\n  As Russian officials better understand that NATO is not the rapacious \ncaricature of Soviet propaganda, but rather a defensive alliance and \nforce for security and stability in Europe, their animosity toward the \norganization may dissipate.\n  And by working together in the Joint Council, Russia can prove that \nit is a responsible partner for the West.\n  Through this mechanism and others, over time Moscow can come to \nrealize that the enlargement of NATO by moving the zone of stability \neastward to Central Europe will increase Russia's own security.\n  One problem, however, requires immediate attention. There needs to be \na mechanism by which the countries invited at Madrid can participate in \nNATO before their full accession to membership.\n  I would suggest in this regard making the candidates observers to the \nNorth Atlantic Council.\n  I am pleased that the chairman of the Subcommittee on European \nAffairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, my friend from Oregon, \nSenator Smith, plans to hold a hearing on the NATO-Russia Founding Act \nto examine these issues in detail.\n  Mr. President, it is also essential that arms control agreements with \nRussia be ratified and expanded. Of special importance is getting the \nState Duma to ratify the START II Treaty and then, together with the \nUnited States, to move on to further reductions in START III. Despite \nrecent press commentaries, I do not believe that the NATO-Russia \nFounding Act or NATO enlargement will substantially affect START II's \nratification prospects in the Duma.\n  Moreover, as the NATO-Russia Founding Act recognizes, the treaty on \nConventional Armed Forces in Europe [C.F.E.] must be adapted to reflect \nthe changed environment. The overwhelming Senate ratification last \nmonth of the C.F.E. Flank document, together with its approval by the \nother twenty-nine states parties to the C.F.E. Treaty, augurs well for \nthe C.F.E. adaptation negotiations.\n  In addition, it is vitally important that the United States continue \nits economic engagement with Russia, not through massive infusions of \nmoney, which Moscow, especially if it cleans up its corruption, does \nnot need, but more through broadened investment and trade, expanded \ngrassroots partnerships, and some targeted technical assistance.\n  Significantly, not a single senior official in Warsaw, Prague, \nBudapest, or Ljubljana whom I met wanted to isolate Russia from the \nWest.\n  In order for NATO enlargement to proceed, both our current allies and \nthe candidate countries invited to join at the Madrid Summit next month \nmust agree to shoulder their fair share of financial costs and all \nmutual obligations. An agreement on sharing these costs is essential \nnot only to enlargement, but to the continued viability of NATO itself.\n  The candidates for membership in NATO must assume the financial \nburden of making their armed forces interoperable with those of NATO \nmembers, in addition to meeting the costs of modernizing their \nmilitaries, which they must undertake in any event.\n  Other obligations are political and military, such as agreeing to \ncome to the aid of allies, as described in article 5; allowing basing \nof NATO troops on their territory, if necessary; and allowing \noverflights of NATO aircraft, if necessary.\n  The February 1997 Pentagon study on NATO proposed a distribution of \ndirect costs of enlargement whereby 15 percent would be assumed by the \nUnited States, 35 percent by the new members, and 50 percent by the \nother current members of NATO.\n  Calculating these ratios begins with the estimate that about 40 \npercent of direct enlargement enhancements could be nationally funded, \nand 60 percent common funded.\n  Estimated direct costs of enlargement total between $9 and $12 \nbillion over 12 years, through 2009. Let me point out to my colleagues \nthat it is only these direct costs that the United States would help \npay for. Additional costs not directly related to enlargement will have \nto be paid for by our current allies and our new allies.\n  The central European countries must modernize their militaries--a \ncost they will incur whether or not they join NATO. Those costs are \nestimated at $10 to $13 billion through 2009. And the responsibilty for \nbearing these costs rests solely with the governments of the four \nleading candidates.\n  Another pivotal issue is that our current allies must develop power \nprojection capabilities, which the United States achieved in the \n1980's, if they are to contribute to the new missions of the alliance.\n  While these capabilities will allow them to help defend new members, \nthey are necessary even if NATO were not to enlarge. As a result, these \ncosts of $8 to $10 billion over 12 years are, likewise, not a direct \ncost of enlargement, but they are essential to the future of NATO, and \nthey must be borne alone by our current allies.\n  The expected U.S. contribution of $150 to $200 million per year for \n10 years, although a small fraction of our total defense budget, is \nnonetheless not trivial, given our mandate to balance the U.S. Federal \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, prospective new NATO members must keep that basic \npolitical fact of life in mind, lest they get\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\nthe erroneous impression that their accession to the alliance would be \na painless, free ride.\n  The candidate countries must make the financial means available if \nthey expect current members to ratify their accession to membership. As \nI told one Polish military official, ``If you want to fly first class, \nyou have to buy a first class ticket.'' They must realize that freedom \nisn't free, and security isn't cheap.\n  Having given this warning, I fear that the 50 percent share of direct \nenlargement costs allocated to the Western European NATO partners and \nCanada may, in fact, be politically more difficult than the 35 percent \nallocated to the new members, particularly after our current allies pay \nfor their power projection enhancements.\n  One of the complicating factors is that the 11 European NATO members \nwho are also members of the European Union are currently engaged in \npainful budget cutting in order to meet the Maastricht convergence \ncriteria for Economic and Monetary Union [E.M.U.] on January 1, 1999. \nThose who qualify may be held to rigid fiscal discipline thereafter, if \na stability pact is enforced without ``political'' criteria.\n  Resentment against this belt-tightening played a key role in the \ndefeat of President Chirac's conservative coalition in the French \nelections on June 1st.\n  As a politician, I empathize with the challenge our European friends \nface. But we all have to make difficult choices, and if our European \nallies want continued American involvement in their security, they must \nstep up to the plate.\n  In order for NATO to remain a vibrant organization with the United \nStates continuing to play a lead role, the non-U.S. members must assume \ntheir fair share of direct enlargement costs and for developing power \nprojection capabilities.\n  To do otherwise would cast the United States in the role of ``the \ngood gendarme of Europe''--a role that neither the American people, nor \nthe Senate of the United States, would accept.\n  Mr. President, there is one more dark cloud looming on the horizon of \nEuropean-American relations. I fear that a coincidence of events in the \nlate spring of 1998 may make Senate ratification of NATO enlargement \nproblematical. Just when the Senate is likely to be voting on amending \nthe Washington Treaty to accept new members, American ground forces \nwill be completing their withdrawal from Bosnia.\n  As it now stands, our European NATO allies will follow suit, \nrepeating an ``in together, out together'' mantra, despite a United \nStates offer to make air, naval, communications, and intelligence \nassets available to a European-led follow-on force, with an American \nRapid Reaction Force on standby alert ``over the horizon'' in Hungary \nor Italy.\n  Many of my colleagues, mindful of the repeated calls by some European \nNATO members, led by France, for more European leadership in the \nalliance and a sturdier ``European pillar'' within NATO, may see in the \neuropean refusal to maintain troops in Bosnia evidence of inequitable \nburden-sharing or--worse still--may question the worth of NATO \naltogether.\n  Therefore, I believe that our European NATO partners, especially \nFrance and the United Kingdom, should reconsider their unwillingness to \nlead a post-SFOR ground force in Bosnia after mid-1998.\n  Mr. President, international organizations other than NATO also have \nmeaningful security components and should be encouraged to intensify \ntheir efforts.\n  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [O.S.C.E.], \nwhich during the past few years has undertaken conflict-prevention, \ncrisis management, and electoral missions in Nagorno-Karabakh, \nAbkhazia, Chechnya, Bosnia, and Albania, will likely continue to grow \nin importance. The United States is playing an increasingly important \nrole in the O.S.C.E. And should continue to do so.\n  The European Union also plays a profound role in stabilizing the \ncontinent. The E.U.'s immense economic clout has made it vital to the \ndevelopment of central and Eastern Europe, and it is therefore \nvirtually inconceivable that even a non-NATO E.U. member state would be \nthe object of aggression.\n  The E.U. hopes some day to create a common foreign and security \npolicy, and in the recent past France concentrated on giving the E.U. \nan independent military dimension through the Western European Union \n[W.E.U.].\n  Two events in the 1990's have altered this development. First, the \ngulf war revealed how far the U.S. was ahead of Europe in military \ntechnology. Second, NATO endorsed a European security and defense \nidentity within the alliance, which would allow European members to \ncarry out contingency operations under W.E.U. political control and \nstrategic direction.\n  As a result, Paris reconsidered and now intends to re-enter NATO's \nintegrated command. Its demand, however, for European control of the \nsouthern command in Naples--a nonstarter idea, totally rejected by the \nUnited States--is complicating the issue.\n  There is, though, a sub-surface tension between NATO and the E.U. \nfrom the early 1990's the E.U. firmly proclaimed that NATO enlargement \nhad to precede E.U. expansion [the accession 2 years ago of Austria, \nFinland, and Sweden excepted]. Some observers have feared that the E.U. \nhas used NATO enlargement as a pretext for postponing the admission of \nqualified central and Eastern European countries.\n  Now that NATO has set a 1999 date for completion of its first round \nof enlargement, the E.U. should move ahead with its own expansion. A \nfirst-round target date of 2002 has been cited and should be met.\n  In the meantime, as President Clinton advocated 2 weeks ago in the \nHague, western governments and private enterprise should cooperate on \ninvestment mechanisms to assist the economies of the new democracies to \nmove rapidly forward.\n  Public opinion polls in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary \nreveal that, to a greater or lesser degree, the citizenries are unclear \nabout the mutual military obligations that NATO membership entails.\n  With these data in mind, I have personally urged the three national \ngovernments quickly to embark upon public education campaigns so that \ninvitations to join NATO in Madrid in July will not catch their \npopulations off guard and unaware of the action their governments are \nproposing.\n  The process of NATO enlargement must not lead to the drawing of new \nlines through Europe. In order to prevent such a development, NATO must \nmake unmistakably clear that the first round of enlargement is not the \nlast, but rather the beginning of an ongoing process.\n  Moreover, NATO should take steps to strengthen and deepen ties with \ncandidate countries that do not receive invitations at Madrid, in \npreparation for their joining the alliance at a future date. The newly \ncreated Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, an enhanced partnership for \npeace program, and bilateral agreements should all be used to \nunderscore the ongoing nature of the NATO enlargement process.\n  To sum up, NATO is necessarily transforming itself from an alliance \nthat defended its members against the Soviet threat into an alliance \nthat allows democracies to maintain stability in Western Europe and \nthat extends that zone of stability to central and Eastern Europe to \ndeter conflicts and prevent crises from escalating.\n  An enlarged NATO will allow the new, free-market democracies of \nCentral Europe to undertake their share of the burden of the common \ndefense of their continent. It will allow them to cooperate with one \nanother and with neighboring alliance members. And, contrary to what \nmany critics have argued, it will allow them to save money in providing \nfor their defense.\n  There will continue to be other institutions essential for European \nsecurity affiliated with NATO such as the new Euro-Atlantic Partnership \nCouncil to enable closer cooperation between NATO and nonalliance \ncountries in the partnership for peace.\n  There will be a joint commission between NATO and Ukraine similar to \nthe NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. And there continue to be \nfundamentally important organizations like the European Union and the \nO.S.C.E., all of which I discussed earlier.\n  By combining NATO enlargement with a formalized relationship with \nRussia in the new permanent joint\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\ncouncil, the United States and its allies can take advantage of the \nhistoric opportunity presented by the end of the cold war and lay the \nfoundation for long-term European security.\n  I believe it is squarely in our national interest to do so, and in \nthe coming year as the Senate prepares to exercise its constitutional \nresponsibility of ratifying or rejecting the accession protocols to the \nWashington Treaty, I will continue to speak out on the course of NATO \nenlargement.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5590-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5594-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 11:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 543.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to assist the \ndevelopment of small business concerns owned and controlled by women, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill \nthat strengthens this country's small business sector, and that is the \nWomen's Business Centers Act of 1997. I am also extremely pleased to \nhave the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, Senator Bond, \njoin me on this bill as my principal cosponsor, along with the ranking \nDemocrat from the Small Business Committee who is also an original \ncosponsor. I note the arrival on the floor of Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts. He is the ranking member of the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n  There are a number of Senators in a very limited period of time who \nhave joined us from both sides of the aisle. I ask unanimous consent \nthat those Senators who are listed in my statement be original \ncosponsors, because they have indicated a desire to do that.\n  I thank the ranking member from Massachusetts for his diligence. He \nhas procured a number of cosponsors, and we have also. I believe from \nthe committee itself we have overwhelming support. I would like to take \na couple of minutes to explain what we are doing.\n  First, let me acknowledge that in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nstarting last year, Congresswoman Nancy Johnson took a lead in this \nmatter and introduced a women's business bill. I introduced the \ncompanion bill in the Senate. By way of the recent history of this \nissue, we have been funding the women's business centers through \nappropriations. I take a great deal of pride in saying for the last few \nyears, while the administration either did not fund this effort or \nreduced it in half, we funded it fully with the assistance of Chairman \nBond, Senator Hutchison, and others, at $4 million a year. We are \nasking that this effort, which we will explain briefly, now be funded \nat $8 million a year.\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, it might come as a shock \nto many that the fastest growing part of America's small business is \nwomen's small business. As a matter of fact, 2 years ago, we had a \nstartling statistic that women-owned businesses employed more people--\neven then, 2 years ago--than all of the 500 major corporations in \nAmerica. That means that there is a major business impact in America. \nWomen are doing marvelously well by adding more women's ownership to \nthe business sector. There is more diversification and more segments of \nthe American population are becoming owners of businesses or have a \nreal opportunity to do so.\n  In my particular State, there exists an entity that helps women's \nsmall businesses expand, in some instances, get started. I am very \nproud of that organization, and, frankly, it is growing. One will note \nthat our bill varies a little bit from Representative Johnson's\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nin that we don't want the funds under our bill to be restricted to only \nthose 22 or so States who do not have centers, but rather with the \ndiscretion of the administrator, to also use the funds in those States \nto expand growing programs.\n  In a very orderly and organized way, without a lot of overhead, \nwomen's business centers, by various names, are helping women who have \nan idea about a small business, providing them with technical \nassistance, in some instances to provide micro loans, and in all \ninstances to provide the knowledge and wherewithal and planning that is \nnecessary so that they start off on the right foot.\n  I have had the luxury of visiting with many of the women who are \nbeing helped in our State by our women's business center. I have been \nstartled. If I could share by way of anecdote with the Senate, if we \nhad enough time, some of the exciting things women are doing in trying \nto set up their own businesses and how successful they are, it would \ntake me a long, long time. But let me suggest, there is no lack of \nwillingness to compete and take a risk, which is very, very important \nto being entrepreneurs, and that is not something that is solely in the \nprovince of men. Across America, women are succeeding in business with \nrelish and gusto.\n  There are many statistics and numbers that we could now talk about in \nterms of how we go about concluding that this is an important part of \nthe private sector--this women's entrepreneurship in America, and the \ncreation of new jobs in America. Suffice it to say that it is the \nfastest growing portion of the American small business group.\n  Women are succeeding and they are not succeeding in any less numbers, \nless percentages of success than are men. So what we are encouraging is \nthat every State has one of these centers, and it is modeled after \nsuccessful ones across this country. In my case, we have the Women's \nEconomic Self-Sufficiency Team, which has a corporate name of WESST \ncorp. It is the only technical assistance group of this type in our \nState devoted to women's business needs. It is doing a marvelous job of \nhelping hundreds of women find out whether their business idea has a \nchance of succeeding, giving them technical assistance, in some \ninstances getting them loans through normal loan channels, and in some \ninstances using some of the small moneys they get for startup loans.\n  Funds for this program are small, but the women's business centers \nderive from a grand idea with a marvelous goal. You can't do much \nbetter. Senator Burns, who occupies the Chair, wants to be added as a \ncosponsor, and I so request.\n  We are also very pleased the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nKerry, is joining us in support of this measure, along with other \nSenators serving on the committee: Senators Kempthorne, Snowe, \nLandrieu, Bumpers, Harkin, Levin, Lieberman, and Wellstone. As well, we \nwelcome and appreciate the support of other non-committee cosponsors: \nSenators Kay Bailey Hutchison, Moseley-Braun, Kohl, Lautenberg, \nDaschle, Mikulski, and Cleland.\n  Mr. President, the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 bill reflects \nour commitment for a stronger and more dynamic program for women-owned \nbusinesses. Supporting women's businesses is not just common sense, it \nmakes economic sense.\n  The National Foundation for Women Business Owners cites these \nstatistics to illustrate the importance of women-owned businesses to \nour U.S. firms, and provide employment to 26 percent of U.S. workers. \nThey contribute over $2.3 trillion in annual revenues to the U.S. \neconomy. Since 1987, women-owned businesses have grown in number by 78 \npercent. And, they have done so in nontraditional areas such as \nconstruction, wholesale trade, transportation, communications, and \nmanufacturing. Forty percent of women business owners have been in \nbusiness 9 years or longer.\n  Given these phenomenal statistics, it is time we give more attention \nto this critical segment of our business community. Women-owned \nbusinesses are run by creative and professional entrepreneurs who \nemploy millions of workers and deliver trillions of dollars into our \ncommunities. At the same time, these entrepreneurs are far too often \noverlooked and underestimated by our banking and financial communities, \nas well as by the Small Business Administration.\n  I believe it is fair to say that a significant number, if not most, \nwomen entrepreneurs have achieved their goals and successes because \nthey are disciplined and committed. We can probably say the same about \nmen who have achieved their business objectives. The difference, \nhowever, is that we know there has been a disproportionate amount of \ntraining, technical assistance, procurement opportunities, and ready \naccess to capital for male entrepreneurs compared to women.\n  Despite these disparities, women business owners have achieved their \nmonumental feats because of their business acumen, self-reliance, \ningenuity, and dogged determination. Since it is projected that women \nwill own 50 percent of all businesses by the year 2000, the time is now \nto assist these women entrepreneurs.\n  Looking at the Small Business Administration's [SBA] record, we can \ncongratulate them on their slowly but surely improvement in the \npercentage of loan guarantees to women borrowers. Within SBA's 7(a) and \n504 loan programs, the agency reports that it has tripled its number of \nloans to women borrowers from 3,588 in 1992 to 11,452 in 1996. That \nrepresents an increase in the dollar amount from $634 million in 1992 \nto $1.6 billion in 1996. That is the pretty side of the picture.\n  Turn the picture over, however, and these figures mean that women \nrecipients constitute approximately one-fifth of the total loan \nclientele and receive approximately one-seventh of the loan guarantee \nfunds. This is at a time when the SBA reports that over the last \ndecade, ``new women-owned firms--one-third of all firms--have grown at \ntwice the rate of men-owned businesses.'' I do not suggest this SBA \npicture is all bleak, but I do believe the record is less than optimal, \nand considerably more effort must be given to addressing women's \nbusiness needs.\n  This year we are committed to improving and enlarging the scope of \nthe SBA's women's program.\n  One of the most beneficial programs within the SBA is the Women's \nBusiness Centers Program, managed by the Office of Women's Business \nOwnership. I personally know the excellent record of these centers, of \nwhich there are 53 sites in 28 States.\n  In my State of New Mexico, I have talked with the clients and toured \ntheir businesses. Thanks to the able leadership of the centers' \npersonnel, these businesses are growing financially, employing new \npersonnel, and creating new markets for their goods and services.\n  In New Mexico, the Women's Economic Self-Sufficiency Team--WESST \ncorp--is the only business and technical assistance organization \nspecifically focused on the needs of women. Its mission is to \nfacilitate the startup and growth of women- and minority-owned \nbusinesses.\n  Its target market is low-income, unemployed, and underemployed women. \nAmong its important accomplishments is its expansion to five additional \nsites, thereby providing much-needed assistance to both rural and urban \nwomen across our vast State. Since incorporating in 1988, WESST corp \nhas facilitated the startup and growth of over 500 small businesses. \nThis has created more than 750 jobs and businesses which have average \nannual gross receipts of $75,000. WESST corp has also established a \nlow-interest revolving loan fund, with 75 percent of the loans extended \nto rural women and 65 percent to startups.\n  Under the direction of the very able and creative Agnes Noonan, WESST \ncorp is one of New Mexico's best business services. WESST corp is one \nof the 28 State organizations that participates in the SBA's Women's \nBusiness Centers Program. It is obvious that its contributions are \ncritical to our State's economy.\n  Between 1987 and 1996, U.S. census figures indicate that the number \nof New Mexico women-owned firms increased by 60 percent, employment \nincreased by 138 percent, and sales grew by 154 percent. Women-owned \nfirms in New Mexico employ nearly 115,000 people and generate nearly \n$11 billion in sales. Moreover, women-owned firms\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\naccount for 41 percent of all firms in New Mexico, provide employment \nfor 35 percent of its workers, and generate 21 percent of its business \nsales.\n  As Agnes Noonan says,\n\n       Women's business centers across the United States play a \n     critical role in helping women develop and grow successful \n     small businesses. The acquisition of technical business \n     skills is obviously important. Equally important, however, is \n     the provision of long-term mentoring and support without \n     which many women would never make it beyond an initial \n     orientation session.\n\n  It is important that Women's Business Centers, like WESST corp, \ncontinue to target their expertise to the thousands of potential and \nexisting women entrepreneurs. These centers are able to leverage public \nand private resources to help their clients develop new businesses or \nexpand existing ones. The centers' personnel are skilled professionals \nwho give specialized assistance to women.\n  For example, the Women's Business Development Center in Miami, FL, \nreports that its programs are:\n\n     tailored to meet the specific needs of the community, i.e., \n     evening and weekend classes, counseling at business sites \n     and other non-traditional methods of providing \n     entrepreneurial training and technical assistance. Classes \n     are often held in Spanish and other languages. Many sites \n     provide child care, transportation and distance training \n     when necessary.\n\n  I am 100 percent behind establishing business centers in States that \ndo not have them. At the same time, based upon the extraordinary record \nof WESST corp in New Mexico, it is also equally important that an \nexisting business center be allowed to expand its services into other \ngeographical sites that will serve women entrepreneurs who would not, \nor could not, otherwise be served at the so-called flagship center. The \nprimary business site has established its record of activities and \nservices, and it is able to offer valuable expertise and guidance to \nthe new center. Therefore, I believe very strongly that requests for \nreplication of existing programs into new sites must also be given a \nfair and honest appraisal for financial assistance.\n  This bill will strengthen the Women's Business Centers Program across \nthe United States. The bill will allow the SBA program to extend its \nassistance to the individual State organizations from 3 years to 5 \nyears. This will enable the State centers to have a longer period of \ntime to develop their private sector funding base.\n  Additionally, we have modified the Federal to private matching \nrequirements to ensure the centers have sufficient time to develop the \none Federal to each non-Federal dollar match by the 4th year of \nactivity. Most important, this bill authorizes up to $8 million for \nassisting existing centers, developing new State programs, or for \nreplicating business center sites in other geographical areas. This is \nan increase in funding for the business centers' programs from the \npresent, and modest, $4 million annual funding.\n  Senator Bond and I, along with the other cosponsors of the bill, \nstrongly support expansion of the SBA's Women's Business Centers \nProgram. We know how instrumental these programs are in helping women \nentrepreneurs, and how very critical these businesses are to families, \ncommunities, and the overall economic well-being of our States. We urge \nother Members of the Senate to join us in support of this small but \npowerful program.\n  I yield the floor now for Senator Bond who does a marvelous job with \nthe Small Business Committee, has made it a viable active entity, and I \nthank him for his support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto join my distinguished colleague, Senator Domenici, in introducing \nthe Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. I appreciate the kind words, \nbut Senator Domenici has long been the leading proponent of women-owned \nbusinesses. He has worked hard to secure the additional funding for the \ncenters. I am delighted to work with him on the bill.\n  Also I am very pleased that my ranking member on the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Kerry, and many of our colleagues are working \ntogether with Senator Domenici and us as original cosponsors of the \nbill.\n  I think once again this is an opportunity for Congress to demonstrate \nits strong support for effective programs serving current and future \nwomen entrepreneurs. It was just 1 year ago that many of my colleagues \nwill remember that the administration sought to zero out the budget for \nwomen's business demonstration sites, and Congress stepped in to ensure \nfull funding. Now we are reaching for new heights--making the program \nan ongoing effort to fund women's business centers through 5-year \ngrants.\n  The Committee on Small Business began its work in this session of \nCongress with the cooperation of my ranking member at a hearing on \nwomen-owned and home-based businesses. I will talk more about that in \njust a few moments. But the hearing we held then and others has \nprovided the committee with extensive testimony and letters of \nendorsement on the important economic contribution being made by women \nentrepreneurs and the role played by women business centers. With \nnearly 8 million firms owned by women--a third of all firms--and 18.5 \nmillion people are employed by women-owned firms, which is 1 of 4 \nworking men and women in the U.S., the contribution of women-owned \nbusinesses to the economy, which includes nearly $2.3 trillion in \nsales, deserves recognition and encouragement.\n  In my home State of Missouri, there are approximately 120,000 women-\nowned businesses. And, in 1997, the recipient of the Avon Women of \nEnterprise Award is Georgia Buchanan, president and CEO of All Pro \nConstruction in Grandview, MO. In 1995, Georgia's company was also \nrecognized by the SBA as the National Minority Construction Firm of the \nYear.\n  Last year, Missouri's entrepreneurs were recognized as well when \nPhyllis Hannan, owner of Laser Mark It and Laser Light Technologies, \nwas named SBA's National Small Businessperson of the Year.\n  We have other women business leaders, including Carol Jones, of \nSpringfield, who operates a large and well-respected realty company, in \naddition to her civic work and service on the Federal Home Loan Bank \nBoard, and Stella Olson, who is serving as a member of the Small \nBusiness Fairness Board for SBA region 7 and is the owner of STAT \nEnterprises, Inc., a transcription company.\n  These women are all local success stories taking an active role in \nexpanding their own businesses with management financing and market \ntraining necessary for its success.\n  The Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 recognizes the important \ncontributions made by the 53 women's business centers located in 28 \nStates. The bill increases the level of funding authorized for \nestablishing additional women's business centers to $8 million per year \nfor 3 years, double when compared to the current authorization of $4 \nmillion per year. The Clinton administration's budget request for \nfiscal year 1998 is $4 million. Significantly, the additional funding \nis intended to ensure that women's business centers exist in all 50 \nStates.\n  Other important provisions of this bill include allowing Centers \nreceiving funds on the day prior to enactment to apply to extend their \neligibility for funding for 2 additional years. Also, for all women's \nbusiness centers receiving funds under this bill, the private sector \nmatch is structured to facilitate a smoother transition to self-\nsufficiency. The program is designed to provide seed money for women's \nbusiness centers that can then flourish with the financial support of \nthe local community. Training and services are to be tailored to the \nlocal community, and the grantees running the centers must have the \nrequisite experience and commitment to deliver the services suited to \nwomen in the area.\n  The introduction of this bill coincides with the work of the \nCommittee on Small Business to reauthorize the programs of the Small \nBusiness Administration, the SBA. The committee has supported the \ncreation and expansion of business development centers dedicated to the \nunique needs of women who are either current or potential business \nowners. The women's business centers created under this bill will \nprovide the tried and true ongoing training and assistance, offered by \nthe current demonstration sites, to ensure that their clients have the \nskills and know-how to build and maintain successful businesses.\n  This is a win-win bill. It provides women owning businesses or those \nwomen preparing to start new small businesses with the tools necessary \nto support their transition and the challenges faced when trying to \nexpand.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this bill as \npart of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The concepts \nendorsed today will be incorporated with other reforms so that the \nservices delivered by SBA and its numerous resource partners are \nbeneficial to men and women alike. The committee has important work to \ndo in this regard, and we appreciate Senator Domenici and \nRepresentative Johnson's efforts in this regard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have sent the bill to the desk for \nappropriate referral, but I ask unanimous consent that it be held at \nthe desk before being referred for the remainder of the day in case \nothers want to cosponsor it. They can be original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be held at the \ndesk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, whatever time I have remaining --I do \nnot believe Senator Bond needs any additional time--I yield to Senator \nKerry, and he can control it with other Members. I think there is \nadequate time for others who need it, but I yield whatever time I have \nto Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized, \nand the Chair informs him he has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I want to thank the \ndistinguished Senator for his leadership on this issue and also the \nSenator from Missouri, the chairman of the Small Business Committee. I \nam delighted to join with both of them. I think this will have an \nenormous, positive impact, and their leadership is greatly appreciated.\n  I am pleased to stand in support as we introduce the Women's Business\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nCenters Act of 1997. Nine years ago, when we first established a \ndemonstration program for helping women-owned businesses attain capital \nand assistance in business development, a lot of people had some doubts \nabout it. The legislation brought together the SBA and independent \norganizations in order to deliver assistance to women-owned businesses.\n  Nine years ago, Mr. President, many people in the country were \nskeptical about the need for women-owned business assistance. There was \na kind of perception problem with respect to whether or not it was \nneeded and whether or not a lot of women in the country were going to \ntake advantage of it and, in some cases, doubts even by some about \nwhether or not they could. Everything in the years since then has \ndestroyed the stereotypes. It changed attitudes and has proven that the \npeople who believed in this effort were correct.\n  The program has matured since its creation. And, to date, nearly \n50,000 American women have been served by 54 sites in 28 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The bill that we introduce today is really only underscoring a small \npart of the many contributions that women make to the economy of this \ncountry. One of the reasons that we are currently enjoying such a \nsignificant economic boom is because of the contributions in the last \nfew years from women-owned entrepreneurs.\n  The Committee on Small Business is particularly pleased to champion \nthis program. All of my Democratic colleagues from the Small Business \nCommittee--Senators Bumpers, Levin, Harkin, Lieberman, Wellstone, \nCleland, and Landrieu--have joined us in sponsoring this bill which \nwill make the program permanent.\n  The program is operated by SBA's Women's Business Ownership Office, \nwhich also would become permanent under the legislation. With the SBA's \nhelp, we have begun to tap the remarkable resource of women-owned \nbusinesses that has been proven to exist over the course of the last \nyears. I know that many knew it always existed, but this pilot project \nhas really given the evidence greater weight than it has ever had \nbefore. And I think this should pass overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. President, women-owned businesses have been a critical component \nof the remarkable growth spurt we are enjoying in the country. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, women-owned businesses represent one-\nthird of all U.S. companies, and they annually contribute more than \n$1.5 trillion in sales to the U.S. economy. The National Federation of \nWomen Business Owners and Dun & Bradstreet reported that 7.7 million \nwomen-owned businesses employ more people than the Fortune 500 \ncompanies. So we must provide a strong policy that allows these women \nto meet their greatest potential and allow this country to benefit from \nthe full measure of their endeavors.\n  We know that women entrepreneurs are breaking records. Women-owned \nsole proprietorships have a startup rate twice that of male-owned \nbusinesses. Between 1987 and 1992, the number of women-owned businesses \nincreased by 43 percent, while businesses overall only grew by 26 \npercent. During the same time, employment by women-owned firms grew 100 \npercent. Particularly notable, women-owned companies with 100 or more \nworkers increased employment by 158 percent, more than double the rate \nfor all U.S. firms of similar size.\n  This country needs to preserve and to foster that special \nentrepreneurial spirit. And the Women's Business Centers Act is a great \nway to do that.\n  In Massachusetts, the 147,000 women-owned businesses represent over \none-third of all the companies in our State. And through the SBA's \nwomen demonstration program--the program which this bill would make \npermanent--the Center for Women & Enterprise, Inc., was established in \nBoston in 1995. In just 2 years, the center has served over 1,000 women \nbusiness owners, 40 percent of which are minorities.\n\n  The center offers scholarships for low-income women and provides \ncourses, workshops, and one-on-one counseling. One hundred cities and \ntowns in eastern Massachusetts are benefiting from the work of the \ncenter. I want to see that success continue. We can do that, and we can \nreplicate it in State after State by making the women's business \ncenters and the Women's Business Ownership Office permanent assets of \nthe SBA programs.\n  In addition to counseling, women business owners need access to \ncapital. Women are vital players in business, and yet their access to \ncapital for funding business enterprise has been limited, and it is \nstill limited. The SBA is trying to meet that demand by increasing \naccess to capital.\n  From 1992 until 1995, the number of SBA guaranteed loans going to \nwomen quadrupled. They received $3.8 billion in SBA guaranteed loans \nduring that period of time. And in fiscal year 1996, women-owned \nbusinesses received nearly $2 billion in loans from SBA guarantees.\n  So access to capital is beginning to improve for women business \nowners, but we need to guarantee that we support programs that continue \nthat trend.\n  Last month, I helped kick off a national initiative undertaken by the \nSBA's Women's Business Ownership Office, the National Women's Business \nCouncil, and the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, to convene workshops \nthroughout the United States. These meetings bring together women \nbusiness owners, lenders, and policymakers to discuss how to expand \ncapital markets to meet the increasing demand of women-owned \nbusinesses.\n  With input from the women's community, I have concluded that this \nissue is one that is going to be addressed at different levels. We need \nmore micro-loans for startup businesses. We need more business \ndevelopment and technical assistance, more loan package counseling, and \nmore access to venture and angel capital sources.\n  This program is one key way to maximize women-owned businesses and to \nwisely use Government resources to boost the private sector's success.\n  I join with Senator Domenici and Senator Bond in urging our \ncolleagues to support the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. It will \nprovide $8 million in funding that will be used to provide matching \ngrants for women's centers, and the bill will make the program and the \nWomen's Business Ownership Office a permanent part of the important \nwork that the SBA is doing to guarantee opportunity for all of those \nwho wish to create jobs in this country.\n  We hope to establish sites in every State to serve women \nentrepreneurs with the passage of this act. And I hope that our \ncolleagues will overwhelmingly support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter and \nSenator Boxer also be added as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of time for other Senators \nwishing to speak on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to announce my \ncosponsorship of the Domenici-Bond Women's Business Centers Act of \n1997, which will reauthorize this valuable program administered by the \nSmall Business Administration's, the SBA's, Office of Women's Business \nOwnership.\n  Women-owned businesses are a major driving force for America's \neconomy. As of 1996, there were nearly 8 million women-owned businesses \nnationwide, employing more than 18.5 million people and generating \nclose to $2.3 trillion in sales. According to the National Foundation \nfor Women Business Owners, women-owned businesses are growing faster \nthan the overall economy in each of the top 50 metropolitan areas in \nthe United States, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In a study \nreleased in March 1997, the foundation reported that as of 1996, \nPhiladelphia's 127,100 women-owned enterprises employed 448,500 people \nand generated over $56 billion in sales, and Pittsburgh's 54,800 women-\nowned enterprises employed 141,800 people and generated over $17 \nbillion in sales. These numbers are truly impressive and highlight the \nsignificant impact of women in business on Pennsylvania's economy.\n  Established through the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, the \nwomen's business centers have been vital in providing services and \nprograms that support and accelerate women's business ownership. My \nconstituents are fortunate to be served by the Women's Business \nDevelopment Center, located in Philadelphia. Since\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nits formation in July 1995, the center has provided information, \nbusiness assessment, training, and counseling sessions to over 3,000 \nprospective, emerging, and established women business owners. It is \ncritical to reauthorize the activities of these centers to ensure that \nwomen-owned businesses have the resources necessary to prosper and \ngrow.\n  Specifically, the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 would double \nthe authorized appropriation for the women's business centers to $8 \nmillion, authorize 5 years of project funding for new centers, extend \nfunding for existing centers for an additional 2 years, and modify the \nFederal funding match requirements to facilitate self-sufficiency of \nthe centers.\n  This legislation complements my efforts on behalf of minority and \nwomen-owned business enterprises. On April 23, 1997, I reintroduced the \nMinority and Women Capital Formation Act, S. 635, which provides \ntargeted tax incentives for investors to invest equity capital in \nminority and women-owned small businesses, as well as venture capital \nfunds dedicated to investing in minority and/or women-owned businesses.\n  I also worked to secure a $500,000 grant through the Small Business \nAdministration in fiscal year 1997 to support the activities of the \nNational Education Center for Women in Business, located at Seton Hill \nCollege in Greensburg, PA. The center promotes women's business \nownership by conducting collaborative research, providing educational \nprograms and curriculum development, and serving as an informational \nclearinghouse for women entrepreneurs.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support swift \nadoption of the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 so that we can \nmeet the needs of America's emerging women business owners, which are \ncritical to the economic health of our Nation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \ntoday as an original cosponsor of the Women's Business Centers Act of \n1997. I thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nBond, as well as Senators Domenici and Kerry, for their leadership on \nthis issue.\n  As a member of the Small Business Committee, I have followed the \nsuccess of the women's business demonstration sites--two of which are \nin Minnesota. I would like to note the effectiveness and good work of \nthose two organizations: Women in New Development, or WIND, of Bemidji, \nMI, and the Women's Business Center, which is operated in association \nwith the White Earth Reservation Tribal Council in Mahnomen, MI.\n  This program, and these centers, fill a crucial need in many \ncommunities across the country. They deliver needed technical \nassistance, and they ultimately help provide tremendous economic \nbenefits.\n  I recently received a letter from Mary Turner, director of the White \nEarth center. She pointed out that her center and others operated \nthrough the program are committed to delivering services aimed at \npromoting self-sufficiency, and which are ``as diverse as the women we \nserve--women of color, women on public assistance moving on to self-\nemployment, rural and urban women, and women starting home-based \nbusinesses.''\n  Mr. President, the bill will reauthorize the women's demonstration \nsites, increasing the program's annual funding and authorizing \ndemonstration sites to receive funding for 5 years rather than the \ncurrent 3 years. I look forward to working with the chairman and other \nmembers of our committee to include this measure as part of our broader \nreauthorization of SBA programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Boxer \n        and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 889. A bill to provide for pension reform, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, as I did once before in January of \nthis year, I rise to speak about an issue which is of vital importance \nto this Nation, the retirement security of our people into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, the facts are startling. Fifty-one million working \nAmericans are not covered by any type of retirement plan. An incredible \n87 percent of workers employed by small businesses, businesses with \nfewer than 20 employees, have no private retirement or pension \ncoverage. Less than 40 percent of the 33 million Americans, age 65 and \nolder, today collect a pension. These numbers are very, very \ndisturbing.\n  There are three foundations for a secure retirement: Social Security, \npersonal savings, and a pension. Each one of these foundations is \neroding. Social Security is unlikely to increase. Personal savings \nrates are falling. Fewer of today's workers will retire with a lifetime \npension.\n  In January, I spoke and mentioned some of the reasons that pension \ncoverage fails to reach so many workers. Some of those reasons include \nthe fact that our work force is changing. For the most part, our \npension laws have not kept pace with the changes in the American work \nforce. Think about current workers in an era of tremendous employee \nmobility--you don't work an entire career for one company, as was the \ntypical pattern for our parents and grandparents. Small business is a \ntremendously vital part of our economy. Yet, those very small \nbusinesses are faced with obstacles in establishing retirement plans.\n  There has been a decline in union membership, and unionized workers \nare the most apt to be covered under a defined benefit retirement plan. \nThere is a shift away from manufacturing jobs toward service and \nretail, and, again, pension coverage is higher in manufacturing sectors \nthan in these new expanding areas of the American economy.\n  Knowing that these trends will continue, it is obvious that we need \nto make certain that our pension laws have kept pace with the changing \nAmerican work force. My goal is to ensure that each American who works \nhard for 30, 40 years, or more, has every opportunity for a secure and \ncomfortable retirement. I share this goal with many of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and John Breaux, all \nof whom join me today in introducing this bipartisan bill.\n  To achieve the goal that every American who works hard for a lifetime \nwill have a secure retirement and pension, we have focused on five \nareas: Expanded coverage for small businesses, women's equity issues, \nportability, pension security and enforcement, and simplification. \nThose, Mr. President, are the five areas of impact for the legislation \nthat we introduce today.\n  I have been honored to participate with some of my colleagues' \nefforts to build retirement security for American workers. Senator \nDaschle has created a Democratic pension task force, which led to the \nintroduction of S. 14 on the first day of this session.\n  Senators Moseley-Braun, Murray, and Snowe have furthered the debate \nin helping women achieve a sound retirement, with the Comprehensive \nWomen's Pension Protection Act.\n  Senators Conrad and Hatch have focused on clarifying \nnondiscrimination rules for governmental plans.\n  Senator Boxer has fought to protect pension assets from abuse in \n401(k) plans.\n  Senator Gregg's leadership has guided the Republican pension task \nforce to introduce its pension proposal earlier this week.\n  The attention that this issue has received in the Congress highlights \nits importance to the American people. I am ready to work together and \nfind the common ground that will form the foundation for a secure \nretirement for millions of Americans.\n  We will take a common bipartisan approach that will be necessary for \nboth sides of the aisle, both employers and employees, in order to \nbuild that foundation for the future. We need to be able to offer \nbusinessowners and their workers uncumbersome portability, \nadministrative simplicity and the confidence that their plans are \nsecure and well funded.\n  To be honest, when I first saw the statistics of how many people are \nill prepared for retirement, I was amazed. I started asking ``Why?'' \nWhy do we have over 50 million Americans not prepared for their \nretirement? I asked Floridians directly. I have spoken with large and \nsmall chambers of commerce.\n  In my career, I have had the opportunity to spend a workday working \ndirectly with the people of our State at\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\nmore than 300 businesses. I have worked side by side with small \nbusiness owners, with executives, and their employees.\n  My staff, visiting a chamber of commerce in central Florida, recalls \nthe answer given as to why small businesses have few pension plans: \n``Administrative costs and red tape.''\n  When I traveled to Orlando to discuss this bill, I had the arduous \ntask of bringing along the United States Code books and current \nregulations dealing with pension and retirement. They are overwhelming \njust by their weight alone.\n  Our Nation's small businesses need simple options. They should be \nfocusing on what they do best--growing their businesses, growing our \neconomy, not attempting to apply a pension law that was written 30 or \nmore years ago for large businesses to their current circumstances. It \nis crucial that we make it as uncomplicated as possible for our \nNation's businesses to offer their employees retirement security.\n  We need to cut back on paperwork, eliminate obstacles to starting \npension plans, streamline the complex regulations, and provide \nemployers with the guidance and support they need to continue their \nvaluable efforts.\n  In the end, all of these provisions will encourage employers to offer \npension plans because of the lower administrative costs and reduction \nof red tape.\n  Let me mention a few specific ideas which are incorporated in this \nlegislation.\n  Small businesses are the most vital sector of today's economy. This \nis where job growth is, and all indications are where it will \naccelerate in the future. Yet, small businesses face many challenges in \nproviding a secure retirement for their employees: Higher \nadministrative costs to manage a plan; a fluctuating income stream--\nsome years profits are up; and sometimes they are down--and a lack of \nresources to keep current with changing laws and regulations.\n  This chart demonstrates the problem. Workers in America with a \nretirement plan: According to the Small Business Administration, if you \nwork for a company that employs 20 or fewer persons, your chances of \nhaving a retirement plan are 13 percent; if you work for a firm with \nbetween 21 and 100 employees, your chances are 38 percent; if you work \nfor a firm that employs over 500 people, 72 percent of the time you \nwill be covered by a pension and retirement program.\n  We need to make it a wise business decision for small businessowners \nto establish a retirement plan for themselves and for their employees. \nWe need to offer simple creative solutions to expand pension coverage \nfor small businesses.\n  Payroll deductions for individual retirement accounts is one example, \nMr. President, of the kind of change which is made in this legislation.\n  Even with every effort made for simplification, some businesses won't \nbe able to establish a retirement plan. But even the smallest of small \nbusinesses can help their employees. Any step we take to facilitate \nputting money away for retirement is a step in the right direction.\n  Payroll deductions are the easiest manner of savings. This provision \nwill facilitate the contributions to IRAs by direct deduction from \npayrolls.\n  Modification of the topheavy rules is another step that will \nfacilitate small businesses providing retirement programs. What are \ntopheavy rules? These are rules which were created to assure that \nprivate pension plans were not disproportionately tilted toward highly \ncompensated individuals. These rules affect small businesses much more \nthan large companies. Because topheavy rules are excessively \ncumbersome, small businesses simply don't offer retirement plans for \nany of their employees.\n  Our provisions attempt to address this inequity by repealing the \nfamily aggregation rules and simplifying the definition of key \nemployees and compensation.\n  It is important that retirement plans benefit all employees--but, if \nwe can modify these rules to help small family businesses prepare for \nretirement, millions of Americans would be better off in their \nretirement years.\n  Another area of special concern, Mr. President, in this legislation \nis the impact that old pension and retirement policies have on women. \nWe know that women are coming into the work force in much larger \nnumbers than they did in previous generations. We know that women are \nthe most mobile component of our work force. They change jobs more \nfrequently. They move in and out of the work force as family and other \nresponsibilities dictate. Women tend, during their career, to care for \nchildren and aging parents, which makes it difficult for them to stay \nin one job long enough to secure the benefits that require long periods \nof employment.\n\n  Statistics show that women will live longer in retirement than men. \nTherefore, they need more, not less, financial resources for their \nretirement years. Historically during a career, women will earn less \nthan men, thus making it more difficult for them to save for \nretirement. The provisions that we include in our women and family \nequity section help both women and men, but they disproportionately \nhelp women.\n  Some of the specific concerns women face during their working \ncareers:\n  Time away from work for child care, lower salaries, or divorce.\n  This section can provide a growing sector of our working population a \nfair chance at a productive and secure retirement.\n  It provides for faster vesting of employers' matching contribution. \nUnder current law, employers may require up to 5 years of service \nbefore an employee is entitled to the employer's matching contribution \nto the business' defined contribution plan.\n  Twenty percent of our work force age 45 to 64 have been in their \ncurrent jobs less than 4 years. That is a huge sector of the work force \nwho are most likely not to stay long enough to vest in their retirement \nplan. Women are a disproportionate share of that huge portion of the \nwork force. By reducing the vesting period from 5 years to 3 years, we \nmore accurately reflect the changes in our work force.\n  Spousal IRA is another example of a provision in the current law \nwhich particularly adversely affects women. In an American culture \nwhere we see more and more two-career couples, we need to encourage \neach of them to save in every way possible.\n  Under current law, if one spouse is participating in a retirement \nprogram at his or her job, no matter how small, the other spouse is \nprecluded from a tax deductible individual retirement account. Senators \nRoth and Breaux have worked long and hard on this issue, and we have \nincluded the results of their efforts in this proposal. It eliminates \none barrier that has stood in the way of many two-career families \nproviding for two individuals' pension and retirement security. \nIndividual retirement accounts have proven to be one of the most \neffective ways to plan for future financial security. Working couples \nshould be encouraged to plan and save through this option. We want to \neliminate this barrier to save.\n  Another aspect that particularly affects women is the fact that they \nare subject to periodic discontinuity in their employment careers.\n  As the father of four daughters and eight grandchildren, I know all \nthe joy a child can bring a family and how much planning is needed for \nthe new parents to assure that they and their children can provide for \ntheir future years.\n  Many employees today are taking unpaid leave to spend a few weeks or \nmonths with a newborn or a newly adopted child. But by doing so, they \nmay be taking a step away from their own retirement security by not \nbeing able to make their usual contributions to their retirement plan. \nOur provision allows them to do so when they return to the job.\n  This proposal is modeled after legislation that Congress adopted \nafter the gulf war in which returning veterans were allowed to make a \ncontribution to their retirement programs to cover the period that they \nwere away from their job serving their Nation. We will help our \nNation's new parents in the same way that we helped returning veterans.\n  Saving for retirement is not an easy task. It takes dedication month \nafter month. Under this provision, we will make certain that the good \nsavings habits that parents have started can be sustained even if they \ntake time away from work to be with a newborn child.\n  Another factor that peculiarly affects women is the issue of \nportability--the ability to move retirement benefits from one job to \nthe next.\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\n  Just looking at some of the current statistics, we know that the \naverage American worker over the course of a 40-year career will have \nseven different employers. The average worker in a 40-year career will \nhave seven different employers. Our pension laws were written in an era \nthat didn't anticipate this modern mobility of the work force.\n  Americans' retirement dreams can be dimmed by the consequences of \nmoving from job to job. They will have less retirement assets. Often \nthere is no choice but to make a job change. A spouse gets transferred \nto another city to keep the family together; the other spouse moves as \nwell. We in Congress have been in favor of keeping families together. \nLet's make certain that the family is not hurt in later years by a \ndifficult retirement, a constrained retirement, because of that very \nmobility. An employee can be downsized. Companies can go bankrupt. \nHard-working recent college graduates can move up the career leader. \nEach of these involve job changes.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that has distinguished the American \neconomy from many other industrialized nations has been this very \nfactor of our mobile work force, that people were willing to move where \nthere were new opportunities, where the changes in the economy dictate \nthat it was to their advantage as well as to the Nation's advantage for \npeople to move from one job to the other. We shouldn't constrain that \nby imposing a penalty on their long-term retirement security because \nthey have done what is in their interest and what is in the interest of \nour dynamic economy.\n  When such moves occur, we need to mobilize the pension money, to put \nwheels under it, to make it as portable as the people who will benefit \nby those retirement savings. Providing employees with a vehicle to take \ntheir pension money with them during their working careers will allow \nthe accrual of larger pensions making it easier on the worker and the \nemployers to keep track of retirement funds.\n  How can we do this? We can do it through several proposals which are \nincorporated in the bill that I introduce today. Similar defined \ncontribution plans should be able to roll over one into the other. \nMoney in a retirement stream should be kept there until retirement. \nWhen you leave one job for another, your retirement savings should be \nable to travel with you.\n  Mr. President, today American workers have their retirement plans in \nmany different types of specific forms. Well known is the 401(k) plan; \nalso, plans for workers who are employed by nonprofit organizations, \nworkers who are employed by the Government, individual retirement \naccounts.\n  What we provide in our legislation is that, if a worker moves, for \ninstance, from a Government employment to a private employment, they \nwould be able to carry with them their accumulated retirement benefits \nfrom their previous plan into their new employment.\n  This will require the consent of both the employees and the new \nemployer to do so. But the law will no longer erect arbitrary barriers \nagainst such transition of employment benefits.\n  All of these plans have their own specific but generally relatively \nmarginal differences. But they all have one common purpose--that is, \nallowing workers to save for retirement. This ability to move plans as \nemployment history requires a movement will facilitate achieving that \nobjective.\n  Mr. President, we also need to encourage businesses to allow their \nemployees to do this. We will eliminate the fear among businesses that \nby accepting a new employee's previous retirement assets, the business \nrisks the disqualification of its own plan.\n  Once a pension plan is in place, Congress needs to assure that the \nassets are invested wisely and securely. America's workers are \ndepending on the assets that are accumulating in retirement plans. Our \nlaws protecting pension assets need to give them the confidence that \nthey need to rely on these plans in retirement.\n  There should be stronger penalties for fraud and embezzlement of \nplans. We say clearly to the pension fund managers and administrators: \nIf you are guilty of fraud or embezzlement, then your own pension will \nbe at risk. Workers who are hurt by your action will be compensated out \nof your pension. America's pension fund managers have a sacred trust to \nmillions of employees who will depend on their expertise and skills for \na sound retirement. If that trust is broken, harsh sanctions are in \norder for the guilty party, or managers.\n  There should be greater access to information by employees as to what \nis the status of their pension retirement fund. Pension security will \nbe enhanced by an educated work force. Employees with the necessary \ninformation will be able to watch over their own retirement assets. A \nvital aspect of retirement security is keeping pension participants \nfully informed of what they have in their plans and what to expect when \nthey retire.\n  Senator Grassley is to be commended for his efforts in this area, \nmaking sure that employees receive accurate information and properly \ncomputed pensions.\n  To help employees plan for their retirement, we propose annual \nbenefit statements for all defined contributions plans and every 3 \nyears for defined benefits plans.\n  These statements will help all employees plan carefully and would \nalso help to reduce pension miscalculations. We are acting in an \nanticipatory way to cut off what we think could be a future threat to \nretirement security.\n  Once we have made every effort to keep our Nation's pension assets \nprotected from fraud and abuse, let us protect these assets from \nourselves.\n  There is already a consumer credit crisis in this country. Millions \nof American families are overextended, carrying huge balances on \nmultiple credit cards month to month.\n  Our measure will prohibit 401(k) or similar retirement assets from \nbeing tied to credit cards. If these credit cards were allowed, we \nwould be putting Americans on the slippery slope, spending retirement \nassets before retiring.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned that one of our principal areas of concern \nis simplification, to make it easier for all the participants in the \nretirement security process to know, to be in compliance with the \nstandards and therefore to be encouraged to provide more adequately for \ntheir retirement.\n  Summary plan descriptions and a summary of major modifications will \nnow be substituted for the detailed reporting requirements which are \ncurrently required. One less report will be filed. The Department of \nLabor probably has millions of these current detailed reports \nstockpiled.\n  Under our proposal, the Labor Department retains the right to request \none of these reports from a company, but for simplification's sake let \nus not require the reports to be sent in unless they are actually \nneeded.\n  We are also sanctioning the use of electronic communications. Our \npension laws should get on the information highway. We have asked the \nDepartment of the Treasury to look to the use of e-mail and modern \ntechnology in administering pension plans. It is common sense. It is \nsimpler to use. It is less expensive. It will encourage particularly \nsmall businesses to provide retirement plans.\n  Mr. President, common sense is the foundation of this proposal, to \nmake the punishment for failure to comply with the standards fit the \ncrime. Under current law, the IRS can threaten to disqualify an entire \npension plan for inadvertent errors. We are proposing intermediate \nsanctions, sanctions which are proportionate to the error that has been \ncommitted.\n  The IRS is to be commended for several programs they have initiated \nto work with businesses in this area. We want to codify elements of \nthose plans that are already in practice. As an example, a plan should \nnot be disqualified if a company finds and fixes an error prior to an \nInternal Revenue Service audit. Rank-and-file employees will not be \ntaxed even if a plan is disqualified.\n  Senators Hatch and Conrad have led the effort to permanently exclude \ngovernmental plans from nondiscriminatory rules. Congress placed a \ntemporary moratorium on those rules in 1977. Since then, we have \naddressed this issue every few years. After two decades, common sense \nsays let us make this permanent.\n  Mr. President, preparing this generation of workers for retirement \nis, in my view, almost an issue of national security. We know that \nbeginning early in\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\nthe 21st century there will be a surge of Americans who will reach \nretirement age. How well prepared those millions of Americans are for \nthe years after retirement will have a significant impact on the \neconomic, personal, and national security of this Nation. A strong \neconomic future depends upon this.\n  Mr. President, you represent a State with significant numbers of \npersons who have chosen to live there in retirement. That is also true \nof my State of Florida. Every time I go home to my State, I see the \nresult of persons who have conscientiously planned for their \nretirement--families that have worked hard, invested wisely, saved \ndiligently, and are now enjoying the benefits of retirement in our \nState.\n  Collectively, we Americans could learn a lot from this generation. I \nwant to provide this generation with every possible opportunity to have \nthe same lifestyle as our parents are currently enjoying. To achieve \nthis goal, we need businesses to work together with their employees. We \nneed Republicans and Democrats to collaborate in a bipartisan solution \nto those inhibitions which are currently resulting in over 50 million \nAmericans not having pension retirement plans. We need to work together \nto find the common ground and to take steps now on the items upon which \nwe agree. Every time we can make pensions more portable, simpler, \nfairer to women, more attractive to small businesses, more secure, we \nare helping every American reach their retirement goal. We are making a \nsignificant contribution to a better America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 890. A bill to dispose of certain Federal properties located in \nDutch John, UT, to assist the local government in the interim delivery \nof basic services to the Dutch John community, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                The Dutch John Privatization Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Dutch John \nPrivatization Act of 1997 with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  I want to explain to my colleagues the history of this community. The \ntown of Dutch John, UT, was established in 1958 by the Bureau of \nReclamation to house personnel and equipment during the construction of \nthe Flaming Gorge Dam and Reservoir on the Green River. During this \nconstruction period, the town housed over 2,000 people. After the \ncompletion of the dam, Dutch John continued to serve as the residence \nof approximately 175 people, including Federal Government employees and \nothers associated with the Flaming Gorge Dam and Recreation Area.\n  To this day, basic services for Dutch John, as well as the operative \nand administrative costs for the town, have been an unnecessary \nfinancial burden for the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Forest \nService. The cost of providing the full range of community facilities \nand services--including that of the landlord for the town--have \nsubstantially risen over the years, approaching $1 million annually. \nThe time has arrived to transfer the ownership and maintenance of this \ntown into local hands.\n  For several years, the involved Federal agencies have worked with \nDaggett County officials and residents in drafting a Dutch John \nprivatization proposal that would protect all affected interests. The \noutcome of this process is the Dutch John Privatization Act of 1997. \nThis legislation would provide for the transfer of selected Federal \nproperty into private ownership; dispose several residential units, \npublic building and facilities; provide for a transition to local \ngovernment administration and reduce long-term Federal expenditures.\n  This legislation would transfer approximately 2,400 acres of land, \nidentified by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Reclamation as \nno longer necessary to fulfill the agencies' mission, out of Federal \nownership. Residents would have the ability to purchase the homes they \ncurrently rent from the Bureau of Reclamation at fair market value. \nFederal agencies would retain ownership of identified needed \nfacilities, including the U.S. Forest Service warehouse and office \ncomplex, the Bureau of Reclamation industrial complex, certain \npersonnel housing and the heliport.\n  As the Federal Government ceases to provide basic community services, \nsuch as roads, water, and sewer, local government would be required to \nassume these responsibilities. Daggett County would receive an annual \ngrant from public power revenues, for 15 years, in order to offset the \ncosts of transition while a traditional community tax base is created.\n  This bill is a win-win situation. The Federal Government will \ninitially save more than one-half million dollars per year, and after \n15 years, will eliminate altogether an expensive obligation. Dutch John \nwill be a self-sustaining community while providing necessary services \nfor the 2 million people that visit the Flaming Gorge National \nRecreation Area each year.\n  After 25 years, Dutch John as a government-run town has become an \nanachronism. This legislation is in the best long-term interest of \nFederal, State, and local governments. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin saving the Federal Government the costs of administering the town of \nDutch John while providing the means to start a community with a small-\nresort commercial base in one of the most remote parts of Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise, along with Senator Bennett, to \nintroduce the Dutch John Privatization Act. Dutch John, a city in \nDaggett County, UT, was established in 1958 by the Bureau of \nReclamation to provide a community for the construction and operation \nof the Flaming Gorge Dam on the Green River. The dam was completed in \n1964.\n  This bill will remove the 2,400 acre township from Federal ownership \nby allowing for a buy-out of homes by existing lessees and permittees \nat fair market value and for a transition to local government ownership \nover 15 years.\n  This legislation is the result of years of discussion among local, \nState, and Federal officials, including the Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. \nForest Service, and Daggett County.\n  During the construction of Flaming Gorge Dam, the population of Dutch \nJohn reached more than 2,000 people. Today this remote town has \napproximately 175 persons. As small as it is, the Federal Government \nstill pays about $1 million each year to run the city. As the landlord \nfor Dutch John, the Federal Government must provide the water \ninfrastructure, the sewer system, city roads, and various other public \ngoods and services.\n  Privatizing Dutch John would release the Federal Government from the \nburden of the operation and maintenance of this town. The current \nmandate and budget constraints of the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nU.S. Forest Service act as disincentives for the Federal Government to \ninvest in Dutch John.\n  This legislation will allow Federal agencies to retain control and \nownership of facilities they have identified as needed for continued \nGovernment operation. Homes and properties not retained by the Federal \nGovernment will be sold at fair market value to current renters. \nHolders of federally issued permits and leases would have the right to \npurchase their underlying leased or permitted land at fair market \nvalue. All other properties will be transferred to Daggett County, and \nthe revenues from these sales would be used for costs related to Dutch \nJohn.\n  Under this bill, Daggett County will receive a $300,000 annual grant \nfor the next 15 years as it takes over responsibility for the town's \ngovernance and infrastructure. During this transition period, Daggett \nCounty would be able to create a local tax base to fund future \nmaintenance, sanitary, and public safety services.\n  Currently, an environmental assessment is underway that will analyze \nthe need for additional commercial recreation services for national \nrecreation area and Ashley National Forest visitors. We will certainly \nreview these recommendations carefully.\n  Nevertheless, this legislation reflects the work of many individuals \nwho have worked hard to create a viable plan for the future of Dutch \nJohn and that will allow residents to become self-governed. Self-\ngovernance, after all, is the cornerstone of our federal system, and \nDutch John has been, for all intents and purposes, a Federal colony.\n  We urge our colleagues to join us in supporting independence for \nDutch John.\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Coats, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. \n        Coverdell):\n  S. 891. A bill to require Federal agencies to assess the impact of \npolicies and regulations on families, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                THE FAMILY IMPACT STATEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 21 President Clinton issued an \nExecutive order purporting to defend America's children from \nenvironmental health and safety risks. At the very end of this order \nwas a simple, but cryptic statement. That statement was, ``Executive \nOrder 12606 of September 2, 1987 is revoked.''\n  With that simple statement, Mr. President, without consulting this \nbody or so much as naming the order revoked, President Clinton struck \nan unnecessary and uncalled for blow against American families and \nchildren.\n  Executive Order 12606 of September 2, 1987, signed by President \nReagan, was one of the most important policy statements of the last 25 \nyears.\n  As stated in its preamble, that Executive order was intended ``to \nensure that the autonomy and rights of the family are considered in the \nformulation and implementation of policies by Executive departments and \nagencies.''\n  That Executive order, which President Clinton so blithely, almost \nmutely discarded, required our Federal bureaucracy for the first time \nto consider their actions' effects on the families of this nation.\n  More than any Government program, America's children are protected, \nnurtured and given the means they need to lead good lives by their \nfamilies. No national village can replace the constant care and \nattention of parents.\n  By allowing Executive agencies to ignore the effects of their \npolicies on families, President Clinton promises more harm to children \nthan any Executive order he signs could possibly cure.\n  Because of President Reagan's Executive order, it was the official \npolicy of this country that our bureaucrats must think about families \nas they formulate and apply rules and regulations.\n  Do we seriously believe, Mr. President, that the American family no \nlonger needs protection?\n  Do we seriously believe that Federal rules, regulations, and programs \nno longer have serious effects on our families?\n  Do we seriously believe that bureaucrats here in Washington will just \nnaturally craft everything they do so as to serve the interests of our \nfamilies?\n  I do not think so, Mr. President. In fact I am convinced that now \nmore than ever our families need our protection. I am convinced that we \nmust ensure that those who work for the Federal Government stop and \nthink about how what they are doing effects our families.\n  That is why, along with Senators Faircloth, Sessions, Tim Hutchinson, \nDeWine, Coats, and Ashcroft, I am introducing the Family Impact \nStatement Act of 1997. This legislation will reinstate our national \npolicy requiring that Federal bureaucrats consider the effects of their \nactions on our families.\n  Specifically, and mirroring the Executive order recently revoked by \nthe President, the Abraham-Faircloth Family Impact Statement Act would \nrequire that executive departments assess measures that may have \nsignificant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-\nbeing in light of the following questions:\n  1. Does this action by Government strengthen or erode the stability \nof the family and, particularly, the marital bond?\n\n  2. does this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights of \nparents in the education, nurture, and supervision of their children?\n  3. does this action help the family perform its functions, or does it \nsubstitute governmental activity for that function?\n  4. does this action by Government increase or decrease family \nearnings? Do the proposed benefits of this action justify the impact on \nthe family budget?\n  5. can this activity be carried out by a lower level of Government or \nby the family itself?\n  6. what message, intended or otherwise, does this program send to the \npublic concerning the status of the family?\n  7. what message does it send to young people concerning the \nrelationship between their behavior, their personal responsibility, and \nthe norms of our society?\n  Again, mirroring the Executive order President Clinton recently \nrevoked, Abraham-Faircloth would require that the head of the \ndepartment or agency involved in any policy significantly effecting \nfamily well-being certify in writing that such measures has been \nassessed in light of these criteria. The department or agency head also \nmust provide an explanation of how such measures will enhance family \nwell-being.\n  The Office of Management and Budget will then, to the extent \npermitted by law, ensure that the policies of the executive departments \nand agencies are applied in light of these criteria.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this legislation will require that the \nWhite House Office of Policy Development assess existing and proposed \npolicies and regulations that impact family well-being in light of the \nsame criteria. That office will then provide evaluations on those \nmeasures to the Office of Management and Budget, and advise the \nPresident on policy and regulatory actions that may be taken to \nstrengthen the institutions of marriage and the family in America.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will restore a crucial protection for \nthe fundamental institution on which our society is based. By requiring \nthat our departments and agencies consider the impact of their actions \non our families it will protect those families from intrusive policies \nthat undermine them, their children's lives, and our social fabric.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me to make bureaucrats consider our \nfamilies' well-being before they act. I urge them to support Abraham-\nFaircloth.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mr. Reid, Mr. Ford, Mr. Robb, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Glenn, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 892. A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nrevise and extend the area health education center program; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the area health education center program extension act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation in \nconjunction with Senator McCain and 16 of our colleagues to reauthorize \nthe Area Health Education Center Program under title VII of the Public \nHealth Service Act.\n  Unfortunately, the law of supply and demand does not always operate \nto the benefit of rural Americans or the working poor in the health \ncare marketplace. Whether individuals live three counties away from the \nnearest full-service clinic or just across town, often their access to \nprimary and preventive care is limited.\n  While recent attention has focused on controlling run-away health \ncare costs, the problem is not only one of cost, but also one of \nallocation. We need to allocate both our abundant supply of health \nprofessionals and the highly concentrated resources of our world class \nacademic health centers to individuals who are underserved in the \nhealth care marketplace.\n  Since its inception in 1973, one of the most effective means of \nredistributing and reallocating manpower has been the Federal and \nState-funded Area Health Education Centers Program [AHEC]. AHEC's serve \nas bridges between medical schools and our Nation's underserved rural \nand inner-city communities, recruiting and training primary care \nproviders and health professionals, and providing continuing education \nto existing providers. Nine years ago, the AHEC Program was expanded to \ninclude the Health Education Training Centers Program [HETC], which are \ndesigned to address the persistent unmet health care needs of \npopulation groups such as migrants, minorities, and others.\n  As Governor of Florida, I became aware of the accomplishments of \nAHEC's in addressing the maldistribution of health professionals in \nunderserved areas of other southern States\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nsuch as North Carolina and helped catalyze the initial interest for the \ndevelopment of AHEC's in my State. Since then, I have been pleased to \nsee AHEC's and more recently HETC's grow and flourish throughout \nFlorida and throughout the country.\n  Based at each of the State's medical schools, Florida's four AHEC \nprograms now cover all 67 counties in the State. The programs and their \n10 affiliated centers conduct activities that address regional and \nState priorities in areas such as public and school health, recruitment \nof health professionals to medically underserved communities, and \nspecial health needs of migrant and immigrant populations.\n  With more than 44 AHEC programs operating in 42 States, we are \nfinally approaching the full evolution of AHEC into a national system \nwith an infrastructure through which to reach those communities and \npopulations in greatest need of basic health services. In 1994, 80 of \n142 allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were involved with AHEC \nand HETC programs nationally, and 13 percent of the Nation's total \nmedical school enrollment obtained community-based training through the \nprogram.\n  AHEC's effectiveness lies in this unique ability to combine the \nresources of academic health centers with those of medically \nunderserved communities and in such a way that enhances the primary \ncare training while increasing access to care. This role continues to \nincrease in importance as States struggle to adjust to changes in \nmedical reimbursements, limitations on welfare, and cutbacks in social \nservices.\n\n  One of the most important contributions AHEC's have made in Florida \nand around the Nation is in the training of health professionals in \ncollaboration with local health education institutions, public health \ndepartments, community health centers, rural hospitals, local school \nsystems, and volunteer organizations. As a result AHEC's have generated \na great deal of academic and community support. During fiscal year \n1994, 32 AHEC programs received $22 million in Federal allocations; \nthis was matched by approximately $106 million in State and local \nfunds. These programs have had such success in gaining local and State \nfunds because State legislators and community leaders have witnessed \nthe very real impact and benefits that AHEC's bring to the lives of the \npeople in their States and communities.\n  Despite promising health care reforms and increased enrollment in \nmanaged care networks, the number of uninsured and underinsured \nAmericans continues to rise. Hundreds of counties throughout the United \nStates are still without doctors, and for many low-income families, \nwhether they be located in the inner-city or a small, rural community, \npreventive dental care is considered a luxury.\n  Because these problems have yet to be resolved, and because AHEC is \nneeded as much today as when it was created, Senator McCain and I are \nsponsoring this legislation to reauthorize AHEC, as we did successfully \nin 1992. This reauthorization already enjoys widespread bipartisan \nsupport--a testament to the pliable nature of this program in meeting \nthe needs of diverse communities. In their first 25 years, AHEC's \naround the country have repeatedly shown that the sum total of Federal \nand State dollars that they have been allocated has been money well \nspent. We would like to see this successful program extended for 5 more \nyears.\n  Thanks to AHEC, the face of health professions education is changing \ninto a more community-centered enterprise that places higher priority \non the everyday needs of all Americans, including those who \nhistorically have been underserved. While we have already begun to see \nthe results of this change, many challenges lie ahead in the ongoing \neffort to ensure access to health care for all Americans. With the \ncontribution of AHEC, our communities and academic health centers will \nhave the means necessary to work together and meet those challenges.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join Senator McCain and me \nin supporting the reauthorization of this important program which \ntargets health care services to our Nation's most underserved areas. I \nask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and letters of \nsupport from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the \nAmerican Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Association of American Medical \n     Colleges (AAMC) strongly supports your legislation to \n     reauthorize the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) and \n     Health Education Training Centers (HETC) programs, which are \n     authorized under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act.\n       The Area Health Education Center Program Extension Act will \n     protect the primary objectives of the AHEC and HETC programs, \n     which seek to train physicians and other health professionals \n     to provide primary and preventive medical services to \n     communities that are medically underserved. The flexibility \n     and innovativeness of AHEC programs distinguish them among \n     Title VII programs. Medical schools have led AHEC programs \n     successfully since the inception of the program by Congress. \n     The success of the AHEC program is very much due to the \n     ability of the centers to make the substantial resources of \n     medical schools and their parent institutions available to \n     medically underserved communities. It is essential to these \n     communities that these linkages be preserved.\n       In a nation with over 2,000 health professionals shortage \n     areas and a changing health care delivery system, the federal \n     government and health professions community must continue to \n     develop innovative ways to train physicians and other health \n     professionals to address the health care needs of the \n     medically underserved. The goal of the AHEC and HETC programs \n     is to provide the catalyst to develop long-term \n     collaborations between medical schools and the community-\n     based health care delivery centers.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look \n     forward to working with you to sustain this vital partnership \n     between medical schools and the communities they serve.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jordan J. Cohen, M.D.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine,\n                                   Chevy Chase, MD, June 12, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The American Association of Colleges \n     of Osteopathic Medicine is very pleased to endorse the Area \n     Health Education Centers Program Extension Act. The AHEC \n     program provides clinical training opportunities to health \n     professions students in rural settings by extending the \n     resources of academic health centers in need of health care \n     and education. Through this linkage, AHEC projects form \n     networks of health related institutions to provide \n     educational services to students, faculty, and practitioners, \n     and ultimately improve health care delivery.\n       Senator Graham, we applaud your and Senator McCain's \n     leadership in introducing this important legislation. Please \n     contact us if we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Douglas L. Wood, D.O., Ph.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague Senator \nBob Graham in sponsoring the reauthorization legislation for the \nnational Area Health Education Center Program.\n  The Graham-McCain reuthorization legislation represents the consensus \nopinion of the Area Health Education Center community nation-wide. The \nArea Health Education Center Program Extension Act strives to not only \nreauthorize the existing act, but to do so in an innovative manner.\n  Currently, 42 States participate in the AHEC program which originated \nin 1976 when Congress recognized the lack of quality health care \navailable in our country--especially in our rural and low income urban \ncommunities. Too many of these cities and towns did not have access to \nprimary medical care services. Too many communities were losing their \nbright, educated youth to the larger, economically strong cities and \nmedical communities. Our rural and low income communities were faced \nwith many disadvantages including shortages of physicians and a lack of \naccess to basic health care services.\n  In response to the health care problems facing our rural and low \nincome urban communities, Congress created the Area Health Education \nCenter Program to generate partnerships between medical schools or \nacademic health centers and rural areas throughout a State. Through \nthese partnerships the AHEC program strives to improve the supply and \ndistribution of health care\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\nprofessionals while increasing access to quality health care.\n  The AHEC programs work to meet the medical needs of undeserved areas \nby creating and implementing innovative methods and educational \npartnerships. Each AHEC program is individually established and created \non a State-by-State basis and provides health professional student \ntraining, continuing professional education, student recruitment and \nplacement, development of remote site learning resources, and other \nprojects designed to influence the quantity and distribution of health \npersonnel. Several years ago, this program was expanded to include the \nHealth Education Training Center (HETC) program which addresses the \nhigh impact needs which exist in certain areas--particularly those \nalong the Mexican-American border.\n  However, despite all the progress and success of the AHEC and HETC \nprograms over the last 21 years, the need for recruiting and keeping \nhealth care professionals still remains a challenge for many of our \nrural and low-income urban communities. This is why Senator Graham and \nI, along with 16 of our colleagues are introducing the Area Health \nEducation Center Program Extension Act.\n  The Graham-McCain reauthorization of the Area Health Education Center \nProgram Extension Act would reauthorize for 5 years the core AHEC \nprogram and the existing HETC program. This bill would allow the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to award grants and enter into \ncontracts with schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to develop \nAHEC and HETC programs.\n  Under this bill, AHEC and HETC programs are required to continue \nimproving the distribution of health professionals in communities with \nserious, unmet health care needs. The programs are also required to \nincrease the number of primary care providers in under served areas \nwhile recruiting individuals from these areas and from populations not \nequally represented into health professions. In addition, the AHEC and \nHETC programs are responsible for conducting training and education \nactivities for health care students, including medical residents.\n  Initially, funding for AHEC programs is a Federal responsibility. \nHowever, after the first 6 years of operation the AHEC program must \nobtain 50 percent of their funding from their State, county or \nmunicipal government or the private sector in order to continue \nreceiving matching Federal funding.\n  It is important that we continue to support and promote programs like \nAHEC and HETC which have developed and are implementing innovative, \neffective and efficient approaches for making high quality health care \naccessible throughout our Nation, particularly in rural communities, \nborder States and low-income urban areas.\n  I believe the AHEC and HETC programs are both bright lights with \nregard to the potential for addressing the health provider shortage and \nunmet medical needs in our country. Both the AHEC and HETC programs \nhave clearly demonstrated they are fulfilling a very definite need and \nought to be reauthorized and extended. These programs have tremendous \npotential to continue assisting in effectively addressing the critical \nhealth problems in our communities. I urge all of my colleagues to \nreview this important legislation and consider joining us as a \ncosponsor of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 893. A bill to provide for the conveyance of a parcel of unused \nagricultural land in Dos Palos, CA, to the Dos Palos Ag Boosters for \nuse as a farm school; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           DOS PALOS MIDDLE SCHOOL LAND EXCHANGE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] the authority \nto sell much needed land to a local school district in my State of \nCalifornia.\n  This legislation will grant the USDA the authority to sell 22 acres \nof land in Dos Palos, CA to either a non-profit group or the Dos Palos \nSchool District. The transfer would be based upon an established fair \nmarket value of the land, determined by the USDA.\n  The local community will reap many benefits from this legislation. \nThe school district plans to use the land to establish a farm school to \neducate and train students and beginning farmers. Under the district's \nfarm school proposal, high school and middle school students will \nactually farm the land in order to learn all aspects of modern \nagriculture practices--including irrigation and conservation methods, \nintegrated pest management, agricultural marketing and administration. \nIn addition, the proceeds from the farm school will enable the students \nto purchase their own equipment and supplies for use at the site. \nImplementation of this proposal ensures that the land remain in \nagricultural use for years to come.\n  This legislation enjoys bi-partisan support, and companion \nlegislation has been introduced by Congressman Gary A. Condit in the \nHouse. The local school district, the community of Dos Palos, CA, and \nthe USDA have also expressed their support. During the 104th Congress \nthe legislation received expedited review by the House Agriculture \nCommittee, and passed the House by voice vote. Unfortunately, the \nSenate failed to pass this legislation before adjournment even though \nthere was no known opposition from the leadership or the Senate \nAgriculture Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 894. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain land in the \nSix Rivers National Forest in the State of California for the benefit \nof the Hoopa Valley Tribe; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n             THE HOOPA VALLEY SOUTH BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould allow the Hoopa Valley Tribe to obtain lands of deep cultural and \nhistorical significance.\n  The Hoopa Valley Tribe has resided in Hoopa Valley, beginning at the \nmouth of the Trinity River Canyon in Humboldt County, for 10,000 years. \nIn the 1950s, a settlement agreement between the Hoopa Valley Tribe and \nthe U.S. Government designated a 12-by-12 mile area for the Hoopa \nValley Reservation. When this land was surveyed and demarcated, a \n``dog-leg'' was created along the southern boundary which omitted \ncertain lands the tribe has deemed culturally and religiously \nsignificant.\n  My legislation will remedy this situation by transferring 2,641 acres \nof the Six Rivers National Forest to the Hoopa Valley Tribe. I join the \nU.S. Forest Service in commending the Hoopa Valley Tribe for its \nhistory of natural resource management and expertise. This legislation \nenjoys broad bipartisan support in California and in the House, where \nit was sponsored by Congressman Frank D. Riggs.\n  During the 104th Congress, the House version of this legislation was \nunanimously approved. Unfortunately, despite approval from the \nadministration and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the legislation \nwas never brought before the full Senate for a vote. I encourage my \ncolleagues to act quickly to provide the Hoopa Valley Tribe with lands \nnecessary to maintain their cultural and religious heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 895. A bill to designate the reservoir created by Trinity Dam in \nthe Central Valley project, California, as ``Trinity Lake''; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 THE TRINITY LAKE NAME DESIGNATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould change the name of the Clair Engle Lake in northern California to \nits commonly known name, Trinity Lake.\n  Clair Engle Lake is the largest body of recreational water in Trinity \nCounty. Every year, thousands of recreational users from all over \nCalifornia come to the lake to fish, boat, hike, and camp.\n  Since the reservoir was created by the building of the Trinity Dam, \nlocal citizens have referred to the lake as Trinity Lake. This usage \nhas been widely adopted by almost all of the general public as well as \nby Federal, State, and local officials. In fact, this widespread usage \nof a name other than the official name has become the cause of \nconfusion for visitors and tourists, and has had a negative economic \nimpact on the lake community.\n  My legislation would end this confusion by renaming the lake to \nTrinity\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\nLake. My legislation is supported by the Trinity County Board of \nSupervisors as well as the Bureau of Reclamation. I also am pleased to \nbe working with Representative Wally Herger who has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McConnell, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Robb, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bumpers, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        D'Amato, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Reed, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Feingold, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Ford, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Biden, and \n        Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 896. A bill to restrict the use of funds for new deployments of \nantipersonnel landmines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n                  the landmine elimination act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, with 56 \ncosponsors--Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, men \nand women--to ban new deployments of antipersonnel landmines beginning \nin the year 2000.\n  I am honored to be joined by Senator Chuck Hagel, who was injured by \nlandmines in Vietnam, and who is the chief cosponsor of this bill.\n  I also want to give special thanks to Senators Bob Kerrey and John \nMcCain, both decorated Vietnam veterans, who are cosponsors of this \nbill and know far better than I about the terror landmines inflict on \nour own soldiers. In and out of Congress, those who know these weapons \nbest, hate them most.\n  Landmines have some marginal military value. So, for that matter, do \nchemical weapons. But the damage done by these hidden killers long \nafter the guns fall silent and the armies have gone home far outweigh \nwhatever small benefits they add to our enormous and unsurpassed \nmilitary arsenal.\n  The victims are not only innocent civilians. There were more than \n64,000 American casualties from landmines in Vietnam. If that is not \nappalling enough, the overwhelming majority of those mines contained \nU.S. components. They were made here, and they killed and maimed our \nsoldiers half-way around the world.\n\n  In Bosnia, more than 250 soldiers under U.N. and NATO commands have \nbeen injured, and 29 killed, by landmines. Every American casualty from \nenemy causes in Bosnia has been from landmines.\n  And that does not include the thousands of civilians who have fallen \nvictim to these indiscriminate weapons, and the thousands more who will \nlose their legs, their arms, their eyesight and their lives in the \nfuture. For some 68 countries, the bridge to the 21st century is strewn \nand landmines. 100 million of them.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to exert U.S. leadership. But what \nwe propose here is no different, indeed it does not go as far, as what \nothers have already done. Great Britain, Canada, Germany, South Africa \nare some of the countries who have unilaterally renounced their \nproduction, use, and export of these weapons, and are destroying their \nstockpiles.\n  Some 72 nations have said they will meet in Ottawa this December to \nsign a treaty banning the weapons, and I suspect that number will \ncontinue to climb. Our country has not said if we will go to Ottawa. \nWhy is this administration--which showed such moral leadership on \nchemical weapons to isolate the rogue nations--putting the United \nStates in the role of a helpless giant when it comes to antipersonnel \nlandmines? Why can we not use that same moral suasion, as others have \ndone? We are not a pariah nation, and we should not act like one.\n  The United States shows leadership worthy of a great and powerful \nnation when we are bold on a practical and moral issue like this. We \nsquander that potential and are no different from other nations when we \nsit on the sidelines, as the administration has done here.\n  For the past 5 years, the leadership on banning landmines has come \nfrom Congress. I hope the President will step forward to move the \nUnited States into the front ranks of this global effort, along with \nCanada and our other allies.\n  Before some in the Pentagon start drumming up opposition to this \nbill, I would urge them to consider who is supporting it, and why we \nsupport it. Every Member of the Senate who has seen combat is a \ncosponsor of this bill. This is not about taking away a weapon the \nPentagon needs. It is about beginning the next century by renouncing a \nweapon that does not belong in the arsenal of civilized nations. The \nPentagon has far more to gain if the use of antipersonnel landmines is \nmade a war crime.\n  Finally, to those in the Pentagon who say that so-called smart \nmines--that are designed to self-destruct automatically--are the \nsolution to this problem, I challenge them to find me a landmine that \nis smart enough to tell the difference between a soldier and a child. \nAnd let us not fool ourselves--the rest of the world does not use self-\ndestruct mines, and they are not going to. They are not going to feel \npressured to give up their mines, if we refuse to renounce smart mines. \nWe saw that with chemical weapons, and with the nuclear test ban. There \nis no substitute for U.S. leadership.\n  I recognize that the Pentagon may be institutionally incapable of \ngiving up a weapon that has some value, however marginal. Their job is \nto protect American soldiers, and there are undoubtedly instances when \nantipersonnel landmines have done that. But they should consider the \nhorrendous casualties these weapons have inflicted on our troops. And \nthey should recognize that just because a weapon has some marginal \nvalue does not justify its use when the victims are overwhelmingly \ninnocent civilians, indeed whole societies.\n  Ultimately, it is a political decision, and the President, as \nCommander in Chief, needs to act. The question no longer is whether we \nwill ban antipersonnel landmines, but when. This bill moves us closer \nto that goal.\n  There is only one way to stop this, and that is to stop it. And the \nsooner the United States does that, as others have done, the sooner the \nworld can sweep these weapons into the dustbin of history.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am proud to serve as the principal \nRepublican sponsor of this important legislation. I want to express my \ngratitude to my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for the \ndedication and leadership he has shown in bringing this issue before \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I approach this issue from two perspectives. First, I've had a real \nlife experience with this issue. My brother and I were wounded twice \ntogether in Vietnam as a result of landmines. Second, I am a strong \nsupporter of our military. It's important that we not take any action \nthat would inhibit the military's ability to fight and win wars, do \ntheir jobs, and maintain valuable weapons options and strategies.\n  However, we are dealing with a different world than we fought in \nworld wars, Korea and Vietnam. Our recent military actions have been \nactions where we've been in and out relatively quickly. I am concerned \nwith the effects of laying down mines and then leaving them behind when \nour troops leave. There are already an estimated 110 million landmines \nin the ground around the world, and the destruction that these mines \ncontinue to inflict on innocent lives is devastating. It's the \nindiscriminate nature of their killing that makes landmines so hideous.\n  I believe this legislation addresses a number of the concerns \nexpressed by the military. Exemptions have been provided for when the \nmilitary needs specific options, such as Korea and the use of antitank \nmines and claymores.\n  We have a responsibility to those who've served and those who are now \nserving in the military and the peoples\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\nof the world to take a close look at this issue. This question comes \ndown to, is this really a military option we need today? I don't \nbelieve it is. After careful study and consideration and seeking the \nopinions of many present and former military commanders, I have decided \nthat America should show leadership on this issue. We can take the \nmoral high ground and still insure a strong, flexible military. I am \nproud that my five Senate colleagues who are also Vietnam combat \nveterans have joined me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original \ncosponsor of the bill to prohibit U.S. deployment of antipersonnel \nlandmines introduced today by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] and \nthe Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel]. I want to commend the Senator \nfrom Vermont for his countless hours of work to ban antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  As we all know, Mr. President, antipersonnel landmines continue to \nravage the populations of war-torn areas around the world long after \nthe last shot has been fired and the soldiers have gone home. These \nweapons pose an enduring threat to postwar reconstruction efforts and \nto innocent civilians in places such as Bosnia, Angola, and Cambodia. \nThese instruments of war lay in fields where children now play or where \nfarmers seek to grow food for the local populations. In fact, displaced \npopulations are often unable to return to their homes because of the \npresence of unmarked landmines, and roads have been rendered useless \nsince they cannot be traveled. Antipersonnel landmines cause such high \nlevels of civilian casualties, 500 wounded or killed per week in fact, \nthat they have been called weapons of mass destruction in slow motion.\n  In 1995, this body went on record against landmines by passing an \namendment offered by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] to the fiscal \nyear 1996 Department of Defense authorization bill which I was pleased \nto cosponsor. That amendment imposed a moratorium on the use of \nantipersonnel landmines except in limited circumstances.\n  While, unfortunately, we can never be sure that war-torn areas are \ncompletely clear of all active landmines, the current Leahy-Hagel bill \nwill prohibit any U.S. agency from deploying or arming any new \nantipersonnel landmines after January 1, 2000. This bipartisan \nlegislation also contains language relating to the deployment of \nlandmines on the Korean Peninsula. While I believe that this is an \nimportant first step in the eventual elimination of new landmines from \nthe face of the Earth, there is much work still to be done.\n  I, and many other Senators, believe that this legislation represents \nthe least we can do on this subject. Because of this view, I wrote to \nPresident Clinton in February to express my contention that a ban on \nantipersonnel landmines should be an urgent priority for the United \nStates.\n  In that same letter, I voiced my support for the so-called Ottawa \ninitiative, which calls for a total ban on the production, storage, \ntrade, or use of antipersonnel landmines and includes a plan to develop \nand sign a treaty by December 1997. In my view, the administration's \ndecision to pursue negotiations through the United Nations Conference \non Disarmament, rather than the Ottawa initiative, jeopardizes the \nlikelihood that the Ottawa initiative will succeed. I believe that we \nshould work within the framework of the Ottawa initiative because it is \nthe best avenue currently available to a total worldwide ban on \nlandmines.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I cannot ignore the \napproximately 110 million uncleared landmines across the globe. To \ntheir credit, some of the countries whose landscapes are riddled with \nthese weapons have begun to take positive steps to ban their further \nuse. In February, the South African Government announced its intention \nto ban the use, production, development, and stockpiling of \nantipersonnel landmines. In a news conference announcing this decision, \nthe South African defense minister said that the ``indiscriminate use \n[of landmines] has had a devastating effect internationally, in Africa \nand in our region. In Angola, the number of amputations resulting from \nantipersonnel landmines is, tragically, one of the highest in the \nworld, and in Mozambique, thousands of these mines remain uncleared.''\n  The worldwide devastation caused by landmines was discussed earlier \nthis year at the Fourth Annual NGO Conference in Landmines in Maputo, \nMozambique. While the conference focused on clearing landmines from \nSouthern Africa, the tales of destruction and death could apply to many \nareas of the globe. Since the 1992 Peace Agreement ending the civil war \nin Mozambique, more than 100 people have been killed by landmines, two-\nthirds of them children. Mr. President, we owe it to these children--\nwho have seen too much violence and death in their young lives--to make \nsure they have a safe place to play. And we owe it to our young men and \nwomen in uniform, who have represented our Nation so well across the \nglobe, to make sure that the United States will cease deploying new \nlandmines.\n  In closing, Mr. President, this legislation is an important first \nstep in protecting future generations from the devastation that many \nface on a daily basis all over the world. This bill gives the United \nStates the opportunity to take a leadership role in the banning of \nantipersonnel landmines. This is an opportunity we should not miss.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 897. A bill to make permanent certain authority relating to self-\nemployment assistance programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the self-employment reauthorization act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenator D'Amato to reauthorize the Self-Employment Assistance [SEA] \nProgram. The Self-Employment Assistance Program takes an innovative and \ncost-effective approach to helping eligible dislocated workers become \nself-sufficient: It enables them to use their weekly unemployment \nchecks to start their own businesses. The law has helped turn the \nunemployment safety net into a trampoline of opportunity for thousands \nof unemployed.\n  Today, in 38 States the unemployed who wish to start their own \nbusinesses are forced to give up their weekly unemployment compensation \nchecks as soon as their company starts generating revenue--but before \nit provides enough income to support them. It is exactly this problem \nthe Self-Employment Assistance Program is designed to correct. It gives \nmany skilled workers the chance to get back to work faster and helps \ncreate new jobs as well.\n  In a few short years, the Self-Employment Assistance Program (Public \nLaw 103-182; title V) has enabled thousands of unemployed Americans to \nuse their unemployment compensation to establish new businesses. \nModeled on experiments in Massachusetts and Washington, self-employment \nprograms can create jobs at no cost to the taxpayer. Using existing \nfunds, the Massachusetts program created dozens of new businesses but \nactually paid $1,400 less unemployment per worker than the State \naverage. The Washington program created more than 600 new jobs and the \nfirms were paying an average of $10.50 an hour to workers they had \nhired.\n  In Oregon, 122 UI claimants enrolled in SEA last year; 76 completed \nthe program. These entrepreneurs are now running an auto repair shop, a \nmarine maintenance and repair shop, distributing cleaning products to \nresorts and restaurants along the Oregon Coast and setting up a \ncomputer cleaning service.\n  In Grants Pass, OR, one participant said she could not have developed \nher publication business without SEA. It helped keep her afloat \nfinancially while she pursued her self-employment goal. She received \ncounseling from the local Small Business Development Center, and \nthrough the Center she was able to contact potential customers.\n  In Sweet Home, OR, another woman said the SEA program gave her the \nchance to have an income as she was starting up her day care business. \nShe presently cares for nine children by herself and has plans to \nincrease enrollment and add another teacher and three aides. The Small \nBusiness Development Center at Linn-Benton Community College helped her \ndevelop her\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\nbusiness plan and locate financial resources.\n  Over the past 3 years, 10 States used the 1993 legislation to create \nSelf-Employment Assistance programs: California, Connecticut, Delaware, \nMaine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Rhode \nIsland. To date, DoL has approved six States plans (California, \nDelaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Oregon) and four of these--\nDelaware, Maine, New York and Oregon--are actually up and running.\n  Here's how the program works. States are given the flexibility to \nestablish Self-Employment Assistance [SEA] programs as part of their \nunemployment insurance [UI] programs. It permits States to provide \nincome support payments to the unemployed in the same weekly amount as \nthe worker's regular unemployment insurance [UI] benefits would \notherwise be. It permits claimants to work full-time on starting their \nown business instead of searching for traditional wage and salary jobs.\n  The law directs the DoL to review and approve State SEA program \nplans. In States that operate SEA programs, new UI claimants who may be \neligible for SEA are identified through worker profiling--automated \nsystems that use a set of criteria to identify those claimants who are \nlikely to exhaust their UI benefits and need reemployment assistance. \nState SEA program provide participants on a weekly or biweekly basis \nthe same amount as regular UI benefits while they are getting their \nbusiness off the ground. SEA participants are required to participate \nin technical assistance programs--entrepreneurial training (accounting, \ncash flow, finances, taxes, etc), business counseling (business plans, \nmarketing, legal requirements, insurance, etc.), and finance--to ensure \nthey have the skills necessary to operate a business. Finally, SEA \nprograms are required to operate at no additional cost to the \nunemployment trust fund: the law stipulates that the payment of SEA \nallowances may not result in any additional benefits charges the \nunemployment trust fund.\n  Individuals may choose at any time to opt out of the SEA program; \nthey may resume collection of regular unemployment compensation until \nthe total amount of regular unemployment compensation paid and the SEA \npaid equals the maximum benefit amount. States, through the title III \nof the Job Training Partnership Act and Small Business Development \nCenters, support the costs of providing basic SEA program services, \nlike business counseling and technical assistance, but may allow \nparticipants to pay for more intensive counseling and technical \nassistance.\n  In effect, the program eliminates a high hurdle for those who have \nthe ingenuity, motivation and energy to start their own businesses. In \nthose States with SEA programs, an unemployed worker no longer has to \nchoose between receiving UI benefits and starting a new business.\n  Mr. President, as we move into the global economy of the 21st \ncentury, we must adopt fresh strategies so that our skilled but \nunemployed workers can start anew in the private sector. Harvard \nBusiness School reported last year that from 1978 to 1996, 22 percent \nof the workforce, or 3 million workers, at the country's top 100 \ncompanies had been laid off, and that 77 percent of all the layoffs \ninvolved white collar workers. Many of these highly-skilled and \nmotivated workers want to start their own firms. Congress should not \nstand in their way. Renewal of the Self-Employment Assistance Program \nwill give those States with programs continued flexibility to help \nunemployed workers create their own businesses and should encourage \nthose without programs to establish them.\n  Our bipartisan bill promotes the spirit of entrepreneurship. It \ncarries forward a reasonable and sensible reform of the unemployment \ninsurance system at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I would like to thank Senator D'Amato for joining me as an original \ncosponsor of this bill. New York has a very active and successful Self-\nEmployment Assistance Program, and I look forward to working closely \nwith him to see this important program reauthorized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \ncertain provisions applicable to real estate investment trusts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n          the real estate investment trust simplification act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President on behalf of myself and Senators Baucus, \nMack, and D'Amato, I rise today to introduce the Real Estate Investment \nTrust Tax Simplification Act of 1997. This legislation would simplify \nand reform the tax law concerning Real Estate Investment Trusts \n[REITs]. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by \nRepresentative E. Clay Shaw, Jr. along with many of our House \ncolleagues.\n  REIT's were designed to allow small investors to invest in large real \nestate projects that they otherwise could not afford, including \napartment buildings, office buildings, shopping centers, malls, \nwarehouses, etc. Real Estate Investment Trusts have become a very \npopular form of investment as indicated by the fact that the market \ncapitalization in the whole industry has risen from $9 billion in 1991 \nto over $100 billion today.\n  Mr. President, if a REIT properly follows all of the rules, it is not \nnormally taxed at the entity level, but passes through most items of \nincome to the shareholders to report on their own individual tax \nreturns. However, there are many minefields for the unwary that can \ninadvertently penalize investors and even the general public in some \ncircumstances. This bill is designed to alleviate these complexities \nand uncertainties.\n  Let me share with my colleagues an example of the difficulties facing \nsmall investors. Under the current rules, in order to gain the benefits \nof REIT taxation, the investment has to be passive in nature. Hence, \nthe normal procedure is for the REIT to buy the underlying property and \nlease it out to tenants. However, the REIT must be careful not to \nprovide directly to the tenants any services that are not customary in \nthe real estate business. If this rule is violated, severe consequences \ncan follow. For example, under a literal interpretation of the law, if \na REIT that operates a retail mall provides wheelchairs to the \ncustomers of the retail tenants, or even assists the tenant in moving \ninto its space, the entity's very status as a REIT could be placed in \njeopardy. This is ridiculous and needs to be changed.\n  Furthermore, current law imposes a tax on a REIT that retains capital \ngains and imposes a second level of tax on the REIT shareholders when \nthey later receive the capital gain distribution. We need to make the \nchanges necessary to help unsuspecting investors to avoid double \ntaxation. This bill would adopt the corresponding mutual fund rules \ngoverning taxation of retained capital gains by passing through a \ncredit to shareholders capital gains taxes paid at the corporate level. \nThe bill would also conform a REIT's 95-percent annual distribution \nrequirement to a mutual fund's 90-percent requirement.\n  Mr. President, this bill also relaxes some of the current law's \nonerous penalties for failing to perform some recordkeeping \nrequirements. Currently, a REIT could lose its favored tax status \nsimply by failing to send out or receive back shareholder demand \nletters for the purpose of verifying the fact that no five or fewer \nparties own controlling interest in the REIT. So, even though\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\nthe REIT in fact meets this test, Mr. President, simply by failing to \nhave on file sufficient shareholder letters substantiating this fact, \nall of the REIT shareholders could face the extremely harsh penalty of \nREIT disqualification and double taxation.\n\n  Rather than penalizing the REIT so severely for this oversight, Mr. \nPresident, this bill would impose a $25,000 penalty for failing to \ncomply with this requirement, if the failure is inadvertent in nature. \nThe penalty would rise to $50,000 in the case of willful noncompliance. \nI believe my colleagues would agree that this approach makes much more \nsense than the current rules. It serves as an adequate incentive to \nkeep the appropriate records without causing the unsuspecting, innocent \ninvestors severe and unnecessary tax penalties.\n  Mr. President, this bill also addresses other problems that are \ndetailed in the summary of the bill that I ask unanimous consent to be \nincluded in the Record after my remarks.\n  I do not believe this bill is controversial. And, according to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, it will have a negligible effect on \nrevenues. It is also important to note that this bill is endorsed by \nthe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which \nrepresents a high percentage of the REIT industry. Whenever we can do \nthings to simplify the Tax Code without causing substantial revenue \nloss or negative policy consequences we should do it.\n  Mr. President, this is an opportunity for us to do just that in the \narea of real estate investment trusts. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to join me in reforming and simplifying the tax law \nregarding this very difficult and complex area of the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na detailed summary of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 898\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Traps For The Unwary. First, current law disqualifies a \n     REIT that satisfies all required ownership tests but does not \n     follow certain administrative details relating to shareholder \n     demand letters. REITSA would replace the potential \n     disqualification with a reporting penalty imposed on a REIT's \n     failure to follow IRS notification rules.\n       Second, REITSA would create a de minimis exception to \n     current law so that a REIT's rental income would not be \n     disqualified if it performs nominal, although impermissible, \n     services for a tenant.\n       Third, REITSA would correct a technical ``glitch'' in which \n     stock ownership attribution may occur between unrelated \n     partners. The current constructive ownership rule results in \n     certain rents received by a REIT not qualifying for the REIT \n     income tests.\n       2. Mutual Fund Conformity. First, current law taxes a REIT \n     that retains capital gains, and imposes a second level of the \n     tax on the REIT shareholders when later they receive the \n     capital gain distribution. REITSA would mirror the \n     corresponding mutual fund rules governing taxation of \n     retained capital gains by passing through a credit to \n     shareholders for capital gains taxes paid at the corporate \n     level.\n       Second, REITSA would conform a REIT's 95% annual \n     distribution requirement to a mutual fund's 90% requirement.\n       3. Other Simplification Measures. First, REITSA would make \n     a technical change to how a REIT computes its earnings & \n     profits (``E''). Since 1986, a REIT must distribute all \n     pre-REIT earnings and profits within its first REIT taxable \n     year or lose its REIT status. However, if a REIT has \n     unexpected year-end earnings, the normal ordering rules \n     governing E distributions create a substantial risk that a \n     new REIT may fail to distribute all of its pre-REIT E, \n     notwithstanding its good faith efforts to comply with the \n     distribution requirement. REITSA would correct the ordering \n     rules for accumulated E distributions to make it easier for \n     a new REIT to comply with the distribution requirement.\n       Second, REITSA would simplify the administration of the \n     REIT foreclosure property rules by: (a) extending the time \n     period for the foreclosure election from 2 to 3 years; (b) \n     coordinating the foreclosure property independent contractor \n     rule with the primary independent contractor rule for REITs; \n     and (3) creating a more practical definition of independent \n     contractor for certain health care properties.\n       Third, REITSA would update the current REIT hedging rule to \n     include income from all hedges of REIT liabilities.\n       Fourth, REITSA would extend an exception to the current 95% \n     distribution rule to include other forms of phantom income, \n     e.g., income from the discharge of indebtedness.\n       Fifth, REITSA would correct a problem in the wording of \n     Congress' past liberalization of the safe harbor from the \n     100% excise tax on prohibited transactions, i.e., sales of \n     property in the ordinary course of business. The proposal \n     would not count as a dealer sale property that is \n     involuntarily converted.\n       Sixth, REITSA would create a safe harbor to the shared \n     appreciation mortgage (``SAM'') rules that would not penalize \n     a REIT lender for the borrower's bankruptcy. The proposal \n     also would clarify that SAMs could be based on appreciation \n     in value as well as gain.\n       Last, REITSA would codify an IRS ruling position by \n     allowing a REIT to use a wholly-owned subsidiary to hold \n     property even if the subsidiary previously had been owned by \n     a non-REIT.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 899. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide for \nflow control of municipal solid waste; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n                 THE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act of 1997. It seeks to correct the May 1994 Supreme Court \nDecision in the matter of Carbone versus Town of Clarkstown which has \nhad a devastating impact on Connecticut and States around the country. \nThis bill is very similar to the proposal that overwhelmingly passed \nthe Senate in the last Congress by a vote of 94 to 6. It protects \ncommunities and taxpayers that have invested hundreds of millions of \ndollars to build economical and environmentally clean solid waste \nfacilities --only to see those dollars now potentially lost because of \nthe Carbone decision. Carbone held that towns and cities cannot control \nthe flow of solid waste to facilities it has built or operated.\n  In this bill, flow control authority, would remain with those \ncommunities that were operating or constructing disposal facilities or \nhad contracted for such disposal prior to the Carbone decision. There \nis no prospective flow control; in fact, the authority would cease 30 \nyears after enactment of the legislation.\n  Approximately 35 States were adversely affected by the Carbone \ndecision, which invalidated local flow control authority an issue that \nis vital to the fiscal soundness and public safety of States and \nlocalities. The Justices left it to Congress to reinstate flow control, \nand it is my belief that if Congress does not enact this legislation, \nStates will continue to suffer environmentally and financially.\n  State and local governments and State-created entities have a vested \ninterest in how solid waste produced within their borders is \ntransported and disposed of. Flow control is the backbone of \nConnecticut's integrated waste management plan. My State and many \nothers had the foresight to plan ahead--to move away from landfills \ntoward a more environmentally and economically sound system of \nrecycling and waste-to-energy facilities. And it had been working.\n  Localities made significant capital investments to construct \nexpensive waste disposal facilities. In Connecticut, they incurred \nalmost $750 million in debt. More than 80 percent of municipalities in \nConnecticut have contracts with the State's six waste-to-energy \nfacilities.\n  By 1991, the recycling rate had increased to 23 percent, but has \nremained flat since 1994. In 1989, there were 50 landfills, and today, \nthere are only three, a sign of Connecticut's progress in devising a \nbetter way to dispose of its solid waste.\n  Revenues from the facilities, used to pay off the bonds, were to be \nensured by flow control authority. Without the ability to direct waste \nto appropriate facilities, these revenue bonds are in jeopardy. \nMunicipalities entered into put or pay contracts--wherein they agree to \ndispose of a set amount of waste at a designated facility or pay a \npenalty. Now, after Carbone they are forced to pay for the shortfall \ncreated by trash moving to cheaper, less environmentally friendly \ndisposal areas. Facilities in Connecticut are reporting tonnage \nreductions of more than 20 percent. That translates into hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in lost revenue from reduced energy production and \ntipping fees--what the waste haulers pay to dump the trash.\n  At a time when Congress is working to ease the tax burden on working \nfamilies, the Carbone case will cause taxes to increase for a great \nmany Connecticut residents if towns are unable to meet their trash \nquotas. Citizens would be forced to pay twice --first, to have their \nwaste transported, and again to cover the put-or-pay requirement.\n  This legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the interests \nof communities who must dispose of their solid waste and the interests \nof the haulers paid to move it. I am confident that if we pass this \nflow control legislation, Connecticut municipalities, and localities \naround the Nation will be able to administer their solid waste \nmanagement systems in environmentally sound and fiscally responsible \nmanners.\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\n  I understand Senator Chafee is currently working to craft legislation \non this subject. I look forward to working with him and my other \ncolleagues to resolve this complex problem facing our States and \nlocalities. Furthermore, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Donahue Jr., who had warned \n     the town it would be sued if the plan was implemented, had no \n     comment about the suit Tuesday.\n       USA Waste has reported having 175 commercial customers and \n     numerous residential customers in town. Donahue was not able \n     to say what the value of USA Waste's current contracts are. \n     The plan would void those contracts on July 1.\n       First Selectmen Donald Maranell said the suit was expected.\n       ``The town has spent a lot of effort researching court \n     cases, state statues and the needs of our residents,'' he \n     said. ``Our ordinance is clearly lawful and in the best \n     interests of the health, safety and welfare of the residents \n     of the Town of Stonington. It is the town's opinion we will \n     prevail.''\n       Surprisingly, USA Waste was one of the firms that submitted \n     bids to pick up trash for the town and is one of two firms \n     with which the town is negotiating. Maranell said that if USA \n     Waste agrees to terms, it would have to drop any action \n     against the town. A decision is expected in a few days.\n\n\n                       Residents vote for change\n\n       Residents voted in April to have the town take over all \n     garbage collection to ensure it would be delivered to the \n     Preston incinerator. Town officials said the town would face \n     a $500,000 deficit in the 1997-98 budget if plan was not \n     implemented.\n       The town said the plan was needed because haulers with \n     contracts to pick up garbage from businesses in town began \n     taking the trash to landfills with lower tipping fees than \n     Preston, such as the U.W.S. site in Warwick.\n       Town officials charged that haulers were making huge \n     profits because their contracts with businesses were based on \n     the higher Preston fee. They said taxpayers should not have \n     to pay for the deficit so haulers could continue making big \n     profits.\n       Because the town's contract with Preston requires a certain \n     amount of garbage each year, he shortfall in business garbage \n     meant taxpayers had to pay for the deficit. A court had rules \n     that towns could not force private haulers to take trash to \n     Preston.\n       Town officials said they could solve the problem by taking \n     over trash collection in town and hiring their own \n     contractor, which would be required to bring all garbage to \n     Preston.\n       They said a court decision from Babylon, Long Island, \n     allowed that town to implement a similar plan. The \n     Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority has agreed to pay all \n     the town's legal bills because it is looking for a solution \n     to the same problems in other towns.\n       Private haulers have argued it is unfair for the town to \n     take over garbage collection when the haulers have valid \n     contracts with the businesses.\n       The suit states the ordinance and regulations passed by the \n     town deprive USA Waste and U.W.S. of their interstate \n     commerce rights, prevent USA Waste from hauling and \n     collecting garbage and deprive U.W.S. of receiving waste from \n     Stonington.\n       The suit states the town is exceeding its authority and \n     violating state law and the U.S. Constitution. It also points \n     out that the town ``devised a scheme'' to illegally steer \n     garbage to Preston even though it knew about court decisions \n     preventing such action.\n       In addition to an injunction, the suit asks a judge to rule \n     that the ordinance and regulations are illegal and \n     unconstitutional.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 900. A bill to provide for sentencing enhancements and amendments \nto the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for offenses relating to the abuse \nand exploitation of children, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n       the child exploitation sentencing enhancement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child \nExploitation Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1997. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by my friend and colleague from the Senate \nCommittee on the Judiciary, Senator DeWine. The legislation we are \nintroducing today will increase the criminal penalties for individuals \nwho use computers and the Internet to commit crimes of sexual abuse and \nexploitation against children.\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\n  Just as the miraculous advances in computer technology have opened \nnew worlds to many of us, some have chosen to exploit these \ntechnologies to advance criminal activity. Most troubling are those who \nuse computers and the Internet to sexually exploit and abuse children. \nAccording to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nwhich supports this legislation, criminals are increasingly using \ncomputer telecommunications technology as a means to assist in the \nsexual victimization of young children.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt that the Internet and advancing \ncomputer technologies provide each of us with many new and promising \nmeans of communication. However, when these technologies are used to \nfurther the criminal sexual exploitation and abuse of children, it is \nessential, in my view, that this conduct be punished more severely. FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh recently testified before the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, Justice and State and \nhighlighted this problem;\n\n       The same marvelous advances in computer and \n     telecommunications technology that allow our children to \n     reach out to new sources of knowledge and cultural \n     experiences are also leaving them unwittingly vulnerable to \n     exploitation and harm by pedophiles and other sexual \n     predators in ways never before possible.\n\n  Mr. President, advances in technology should not be the shield from \nbehind which pedophiles and sexual molesters target and prey upon our \nchildren.\n  In responding to this problem, the Feingold-DeWine legislation \ndirects the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase criminal penalties \nfor people who intentionally use a computer to entice children into \nillicit sexual conduct. The bill also directs that sentences be \nincreased for those criminals who seek out children on the Internet and \nmisrepresent their true identity in a knowing effort to gain the trust \nof the child they intend to sexually victimize.\n  The provisions in this bill are directed squarely at those molesters \nand sexual predators who go on-line and hang out in computer chat rooms \ntargeting unknowing young victims. One distinct and unfortunate \nadvantage of the Internet for criminals is that they are able to reach \na much wider audience of potential victims than they would if physical \ncontact were required to initiate their criminal activity. Another \ntroubling aspect of this situation is that criminals are provided with \nnear fool-proof anonymity while cruising the Internet looking for \nvictims. In some cases, victims are enticed or lured to meet with the \nsexual molester. The ability for the criminal to misrepresent their \ntrue identity and thus gain the confidence of the victim is a \nsignificant aspect of these crimes. Director Freeh also noted this \nproblem recently:\n\n       Pedophiles often seek out young children by either \n     participating in or monitoring activities in chat rooms that \n     are provided by commercial on-line services for teenagers and \n     preteens to converse with each other. These chat rooms also \n     provide pedophiles an anonymous means of establishing \n     relationships with children. Using a chat room, a child can \n     converse for hours with unknown individuals, often without \n     the knowledge or approval of their parents. There is no easy \n     way for the child to know if the person he or she is talking \n     with is, in fact, another 14-year-old, or is a 40-year-old \n     sexual predator masquerading as a peer.\n\n  Clearly, Mr. President, a child molester who stalks children on the \ninformation superhighway derives benefits that are simply not present \nif direct physical contact is required to target and recruit the \nvictim. Director Freeh's testimony also noted that sexual criminals \nalso target young victims by posing as children looking for pen pals or \nby posting notices on computer bulletin boards in order to facilitate \nand develop relationships which can in turn provide a victim for the \npredator's illegal sexual activity.\n  In addition to increasing sentences for criminal activity involving \nthis type of conduct, the legislation expands the pattern of activity \nsentencing enhancement to a wider range of sexual abuse and \nexploitation crimes. In doing so, those criminals who have shown an \nongoing pattern of sexually exploiting minors will be held accountable \nfor their conduct through longer prison sentences. In doing so, the \ncriminal is incapacitated for a longer period of time thus reducing the \npotential that they will be set free to victimize again. This \nsentencing enhancement will now be applicable in cases of sexual abuse, \nsexual exploitation, and the coercion and enticement of minors for an \nillegal sexual activity. Additionally, this legislation targets repeat \noffenders by increasing penalties for repeat offenses and by increasing \nmaximum penalties available under the Federal criminal code. Finally, \nthe legislation authorizes funding to be used to appoint guardian ad \nlitem for children who are the victims of, or witnesses to, crimes \ninvolving abuse or exploitation.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt that our children are our most \nprecious resource. I am the father of teenage children and I, like any \nparent, worry about the health and safety of my children. I encourage \nmy children to utilize the Internet and to gain the benefits of these \namazing new technologies--technologies which simply did not exist a few \nyears ago or when I was growing up. During my tenure in this body I \nhave been a strong believer in the potential of the Internet and \nsincerely hope that as we move toward the next century that potential \nwill be realized. However, in doing so, I am mindful of the dangers \nthat always exist when individuals--criminals--exploit a new technology \nto further their illicit criminal activity. The legislation being \nintroduced today speaks directly to the small percentage of individuals \nwho intentionally misuse the Internet to sexually prey upon children. \nThe adoption of this legislation will send a loud and clear message \nthat the Congress of the United States will not tolerate the sexual \nexploitation of our young people and that the information superhighway \nwill not become a haven for pedophiles and sexual predators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record as well as a copy of a letter from the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children in support of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Exploitation \n     Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the sexual exploitation of children, including the \n     sexual abuse of minors, and illegal sexual activity with \n     minors, poses a significant threat to the health, safety, and \n     well-being of children in the United States;\n       (2) there is a compelling governmental interest in \n     preserving the health and safety of children, and the \n     prevention and elimination of the sexual abuse and \n     exploitation of children serves that interest;\n       (3) if computers are used to facilitate the sexual abuse or \n     exploitation of children--\n       (A) by facilitating the contact, persuasion, inducement, \n     enticement, or coercion of a child in order to exploit or \n     engage in illegal sexual activity with that child, the risk \n     of harm is magnified and more dangerous to children because--\n       (i) the use of a computer allows the sexual offender to \n     target and reach a wider range of potential victims than \n     would otherwise be possible if direct physical presence and \n     contact with the child was necessary to initiate and \n     facilitate the crime; and\n       (ii) the use of a computer allows the sexual offender to \n     avoid more readily detection by law enforcement officials, as \n     law enforcement officials may lack the resources or training \n     necessary to identify, pursue, and apprehend those \n     individuals who target children for sexual exploitation \n     through the use of computers; and\n       (B) the use of a computer allows a sexual offender to avoid \n     revealing, or to knowingly conceal from a potential victim, \n     the actual identity of the offender (including the offender's \n     sex, age, and name) and therefore allows the offender to gain \n     more readily the confidence of an unsuspecting child;\n       (4) there is a compelling governmental interest in \n     prohibiting repeated and continuing patterns of child sexual \n     exploitation through extended incarceration for offenders who \n     use computers to facilitate the sexual exploitation of a \n     child or to sexually exploit a child;\n       (5) individuals who engage in a repeated and continuing \n     pattern of sexual abuse or exploitation of children over a \n     period of time are particularly harmful to children;\n       (6) it is important to pay special attention to the \n     identification of those offenders who show the greatest risk \n     of continuing victimizing of children, so that the offenders \n     may be incapacitated through extended incarceration;\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\n       (7) consistently, experts in the field of criminal justice \n     find that criminal history, especially a history of sexual \n     offenses, is the most important and accurate predictor of \n     whether an individual might commit a sexual offense in the \n     future;\n       (8)(A) the report issued by the United States Sentencing \n     Commission in 1996 entitled ``Sex Offenses Against Children: \n     Findings and Recommendations Regarding Federal Penalties'' \n     contains a review of the cases of all Federal offenders \n     sentenced for offenses of pornography and transportation of \n     minors for illegal sexual activity and criminal sexual abuse;\n       (B) in the report, the United States Sentencing Commission \n     found that--\n       (i) in approximately 20 percent of the cases reviewed by \n     the United States Sentencing Commission, the defendant had a \n     prior sex-related conviction;\n       (ii) 64 percent of the defendants convicted under sexual \n     abuse guidelines who had prior convictions for sexual \n     offenses had committed sexual crimes against children; and\n       (iii) for all categories of sexual abuse, the probability \n     that a child was the prior victim of such a defendant was \n     high (ranging from a 50 to 70 percent probability);\n       (9) incapacitation through extended incarceration will \n     prevent those offenders who engage in a repeated and \n     continuing pattern of sexual exploitation of children from \n     continuing to commit the heinous sexual offenses against \n     children; and\n       (10) the prevention and elimination of the sexual \n     exploitation of children provides a compelling governmental \n     interest in prohibiting repeated and continuing patterns of \n     child sexual exploitation through extended incarceration.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Child; children.--The term ``child'' or ``children'' \n     means a minor or minors of an age specified in the applicable \n     provision of title 18, United States Code, that is subject to \n     review under this Act.\n       (2) Minor.--The term ``minor'' means any individual who has \n     not attained the age of 18, except that, with respect to \n     references to section 2243 of title 18, United States Code, \n     the term means an individual described in subsection (a) of \n     that section.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Russell D.

The \n     legislation you have proposed will go far to strengthen \n     penalties for offenders and provide justice for child \n     victims.\n       This bill will strengthen federal penalties for those \n     individuals who prey sexually on children and will assure \n     that the enhanced penalties will apply across the board, so \n     offenders don't slip through the cracks of the system and \n     serve one short sentence after another. This piece of \n     legislation will also accomplish the important goal of \n     providing authorization for the appropriation of federal \n     funds to the guardian ad litem program. This program permits \n     judges to appoint court guardians to a child victim or \n     witness, to insure that the child's interests and concerns \n     are considered. Unfortunately, the program is rarely \n     utilized, due solely to a lack of funding. This bill would \n     work towards changing that, and providing victimized children \n     with an ally in the courtroom. The components of this \n     legislation are well-researched, comprehensive, and narrowly \n     focused to achieve its specific and laudable aims.\n       The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     spearheads nationwide efforts to locate and recover missing \n     children, and raise public awareness about ways to prevent \n     child abduction, molestation and sexual exploitation. As you \n     continue your work in support of children and others \n     victimized by criminal offenders, please do not hesitate to \n     contact us if we can be of assistance in any way.\n       Again, we strongly commend your efforts, and urge other \n     members of the U.S. Senate and Senate Judiciary Committee to \n     join you. Thank you again for your dedication to the \n     interests of America's criminal victims, and feel free to \n     contact me in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ernie Allen,\n                                                    President/CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE:\n  S. 901. A bill to provide Federal tax incentives to owners of \nenvironmentally sensitive lands to enter into conservation easements \nfor the protection of habitat; to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to allow a deduction from the gross estate of a decedent in an \namount equal to the value of real property subject to an endangered \nspecies conservation agreement; and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n     THE ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION TAX INCENTIVES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation \nwhich is intended to provide tax incentives for private property owners \nwho wish to participate in the conservation of land for the \npreservation of endangered, threatened and other species.\n  For too long the Federal Government has used its enforcement \nprocedures and its regulatory authority to dictate conservation in aid \nof endangered and threatened species. This method has failed to produce \nthe kind of results we want. The Endangered Species Act as currently \nwritten is almost all stick and no carrot. I would like to begin to \nchange that today.\n  For 18 months I have worked on a bill to reauthorize the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Currently, I am in negotiations with the Democrats and the \nAdministration on a bill that will provide a variety of incentives to \nproperty owners to preserve habitat through conservation agreements and \nplans, prelisting agreements and other preservation tools.\n  I also have a number of ideas on how to provide tax incentives to \nprivate property owners to preserve habitat. Because of the opportunity \npresented by the budget reconciliation bill, I have suggested to the \nFinance Committee three of the many options I will later propose in a \ncompanion bill to the ESA reauthorization. Those three options are \nincluded in the legislation that we are introducing today.\n  Let me emphasize that inclusion of these new tax incentives will \ntruly benefit both species and people. I've met with many property \nowners who have said, ``we would be happy to step forward and preserve \nhabitat for species and we would grant a conservation easement if there \nwas an incentive.'' Well with adoption of the ideas included in this \nbill there will be.\n  I have had critics that have said that we should not provide these \nkinds of incentives to private property owners because we'll have too \nmany people coming forward and saying, ``I have an endangered species \non my land.'' What is wrong with that? To my mind, that would be a \nwelcome reversal from the current prevailing attitude that some have \nabout the presence of an endangered species on their property. Right \nnow you have a situation that some land owners believe that if they do \nhave an endangered species, or if it is suggested that they might, \nthey're just as likely to try to remove the habitat to avoid a problem \ndown the road. We need to change that attitude if we're going to \nrecover endangered species.\n  We are currently at the crossroads of two systems. One where you have \ngovernment overregulation that tells people what they can and cannot do \non their land, and the other a system that encourages property owners \nto step forward and do something good for species because it's good for \nyou too.\n  We can depend on our property owners to do what's right and what's \ngood for species. I know that our farmers and ranchers know how to be \ninnovative and creative. They know how to help species. And they know \nhow to manage land.\n  The right system is one where we encourage active involvement of \nlandowners through incentives. Certainly, I know that if I were an \nendangered species, I would much rather have a friendly and willing \nlandlord--one that viewed me as an asset--than a reluctant one who \nviewed me as a threat and a liability because of some bureaucrats and \nregulations handed down from Washington, DC.\n  That's what this legislation will do. It's going to make the people \nactive partners.\n  Later, when I introduce bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the \nEndangered Species Act I will also introduce a companion bill with \nadditional new ideas to promote conservation through incentives. But as \nyou know Mr. President, the key to legislating is idea and opportunity. \nWe should take advantage of the opportunities presented by the budget \nreconciliation bill to help both private property owners and our \nendangered and threatened species. We can do both.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 902. A bill to require physicians to provide certain men with \ninformation concerning prostate specific antigen tests and to provide \nfor programs of research on prostate cancer; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n               the prostate testing full information act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Prostate Testing \nFull Information Act. In a series of town meetings in my State of \nCalifornia, I brought together the top prostate cancer experts in the \nState, the head of the urology branch at the National Cancer Institute, \nand prostate cancer survivors to discuss what can be done to aid in the \nfight against this disease.\n  The statistics on prostate cancer are alarming. Based on current U.S. \nrates, about 19 of every 100 men born today will be diagnosed with \nprostate cancer during their lifetime, while approximately 4 of every \n100 men will die from the disease. Between 1973 and 1993, the rate of \nnew cases of prostate cancer rose by 173 percent. During 1997, \napproximately 370,000 new cases will be diagnosed and more than 40,000 \nmen will die of prostate cancer.\n  This bill will require physicians, at the time they perform a \nprostate examination on men over the age of 50, to inform the patient \nof the availability of the prostate specific antigen [PSA] test and \nother appropriate diagnostic procedures.\n  In addition, the bill increases prostate cancer research funding at \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Health Care Policy \nand Research.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change (in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Convention''), adopted in May 1992, entered into force in \n     1994 and is not yet fully implemented;\n       Whereas the Convention, intended to address climate change \n     on a global basis, identifies the former Soviet Union and the \n     countries of Eastern Europe and the Organization For Economic \n     Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United \n     States, as ``Annex I Parties'', and the remaining 129 \n     countries, including China, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South \n     Korea, as ``Developing Country Parties'';\n       Whereas in April 1995, the Convention's ``Conference of the \n     Parties'' adopted the so-called ``Berlin Mandate'';\n       Whereas the ``Berlin Mandate'' calls for the adoption, as \n     soon as December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, of a protocol or \n     another legal instrument that strengthens commitments to \n     limit greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I Parties for the \n     post-2000 period and establishes a negotiation process called \n     the ``Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate'';\n       Whereas the ``Berlin Mandate'' specifically exempts all \n     Developing Country Parties from any new commitments in such \n     negotiation process for the post-2000 period;\n       Whereas although the Convention, approved by the United \n     States Senate, called on all signatory parties to adopt \n     policies and programs aimed at limiting their greenhouse gas \n     (GHG) emissions, in July 1996 the Undersecretary of State for \n     Global Affairs called for the first time for ``legally \n     binding'' emission limitation targets and time-tables for \n     Annex I Parties, a position reiterated by the Secretary of \n     State in testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate on January 8, 1997;\n       Whereas greenhouse gas emissions of Developing Country \n     Parties are rapidly increasing and are expected to surpass \n     emissions of the United States and other OECD countries as \n     early as 2015;\n       Whereas the Department of State has declared that it is \n     critical for the Parties to the Convention to include \n     Developing Country Parties in the next steps for global \n     action and, therefore, has proposed that consideration of \n     additional steps to include limitations on Developing Country \n     Parties' greenhouse gas emissions would not begin until after \n     a protocol or other legal instrument is adopted in Kyoto, \n     Japan in December 1997;\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\n       Whereas the exemption for Developing Country Parties is \n     inconsistent with the need for global action on climate \n     change and is environmentally flawed; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly believes that the proposals \n     under negotiation, because of the disparity of treatment \n     between Annex I Parties and Developing Countries and the \n     level of required emission reductions, could result in \n     serious harm to the United States economy, including \n     significant job loss, trade disadvantages, increased energy \n     and consumer costs, or any combination thereof: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992, at \n     negotiations in Kyoto in December 1997, or thereafter, which \n     would--\n       (A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or \n     other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled \n     commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \n     Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period, \n     or\n       (B) would result in serious harm to the economy of the \n     United States; and\n       (2) any such protocol or other agreement which would \n     require the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification \n     should be accompanied by a detailed explanation of any \n     legislation or regulatory actions that may be required to \n     implement the protocol or other agreement and should also be \n     accompanied by an analysis of the detailed financial costs \n     and other impacts on the economy of the United States which \n     would be incurred by the implementation of the protocol or \n     other agreement.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am submitting a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, and joining me in the introduction of this resolution are \nthe following Senators: Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Craig, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Warner, Mr. Ford, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Helms, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Abraham, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nKempthorne, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Burns. As I say, Mr. President, I \nurge other Senators and their staffs to take note of this resolution \nand to consider joining as cosponsors within the next day or so because \nwe welcome the support of Democrats and Republicans.\n  This resolution addresses some central issues regarding the \nconditions for U.S. agreement to revisions to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. In particular, it addresses the \nclear need for the participation of developing nations in the ongoing \nnegotiations to undertake such revisions to the global climate change \nconvention, first signed in Rio in 1992, at the so-called Earth Summit.\n  As my colleagues know, President Bush signed the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which was subsequently \napproved by the Senate and ratified. The treaty calls on all \nsignatories to adopt policies and programs to limit their greenhouse \ngas [GHG] emissions on a voluntary basis. The goal was to exhort \nindustrialized nations to attempt to scale back their emissions to 1990 \nlevels by the end of the present decade, a goal that has not been \nachieved by the U.S. nor by the vast majority of the developed nations. \nThose nations that have met the voluntary goals are those like Russia, \nwhose economy has been in a free fall, its industries idle and its \npeople hurting. This is not the way that anyone wants to meet an \nemissions reduction target.\n  This is an important negotiation attempting to address the \nfundamental issues of man-created climate changes and how to limit the \nadverse consequences that have been projected by recent scientific \nanalysis. The perceived culprits in the warming of the globe--emissions \nof so-called greenhouse gases, including, particularly, carbon \ndioxide--are caused partly by fossil fuel combustion. Limiting and \nreducing such combustion and its resultant carbon dioxide are a \nprincipal objective of the treaty. It is an effort which has been led \nby Vice President Al Gore and he is to be highly commended for his \nsustained effort and achievement in moving this multinational \nnegotiation along. The schedule for the negotiations to revise the Rio \nPact is to culminate in meetings in Kyoto, Japan early this December.\n  The administration, as a result of the disappointing results of the \nvoluntary goals contained in the 1992 agreement, has moved toward \nsupporting mandatory, legally-binding, limitations on emissions to \naddress the long-term effects of the greenhouse gases on the global \nclimate. Worrisome as the prospects of adverse climate change are for \nall of us, I believe it is unfortunate that the developing world has \nnot seen fit to step up to the plate and assume its clear \nresponsibility to share in the effort being proposed by the United \nStates to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is most \ntroublesome because without the participation of the developing world, \nthe goals of the treaty will be largely frustrated, since the amount of \ncarbon dioxide which will be produced by the developing world will \nexceed--get that--exceed in total, that produced by the industrial OECD \nnations very soon--by the year 2015. That is not very far away. Indeed, \nthe amount of carbon emissions produced by China alone in that year \nwill exceed the amount produced by the United States. So we are talking \nabout the country with the greatest population in the world, China. \nIndia is another, and India probably has 800 million people, perhaps \nmore. But I should emphasize that China alone, in the year 2015, which \nis only 18 years away, will exceed the United States in its production \nof carbon dioxide. China is rapidly accelerating her demand for \nelectricity, soon to exceed that of the United States, but China has \nresisted all efforts to include her as a responsible party in the \nrenegotiation of the Rio Pact.\n\n  Mr. President, the big carbon dioxide emitters of the developing \nworld--including, as I have just indicated, in addition to China, the \ncountries of India, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, and Indonesia--cannot \nexpect to continue or expand their extremely inefficient methods for \nfossil fuel combustion, producing huge, growing quantities of carbon \ndioxide, and at the same time insist that only the developed nations, \nthe so-called Annex I nations under the Treaty, agree to legally-\nbinding targets and schedules for limiting these gases. This is \nparticularly troublesome, I believe, because, first, without the \nparticipation of the developing nations the process of climate change \nwill continue without much human control. Second, there are certainly \ntechnological ways that fossil fuel combustion techniques can be made \nfar more efficient than at present in these nations, so that the extent \nof economic sacrifice that may be required to limit greenhouse gas \nemissions may not be onerous if all nations will pull together. Third, \nunder the Treaty, industrial facilities in the Annex I countries will \nbe tempted to move behind the borders of developing countries in order \nto escape legally-binding controls on their greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause that means that if the developing countries are not also on the \nhook with the Annex 1 countries like the United States, industries will \nbe tempted to go overseas and to send their factories overseas to those \nso-called developing nations that are not required, if they are not \nrequired, to commit themselves to abide by the standards that are to be \nnegotiated by our Government. It would be cheaper, then, for U.S. \nindustries to go overseas. That means our jobs will go overseas. We \nhave seen too much of that already in West Virginia.\n  This would also frustrate the goals of the Treaty, and cause economic \ndistress, as I have indicated, in the Annex I countries. The developing \nworld should be encouraged to expand its industries in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner, knowing that it, too, must prepare \nto meet limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and not sink to the \ntemptation for quick and dirty development by harboring industrial \nfugitives from the developed world's mandatory emissions controls.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the resolution I am introducing today on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Hagel and the other Senators whose names I \nhave stated, resolves that the United States should not be a signatory \nto any protocol to the Rio Pact or to any other agreement which would \n``mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfor the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other agreement also \nmandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions for Developing Countries within the same \ncompliance period.'' In other words, what is good for the developed \ngoose\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\nshould be good for the developing gander, in that both should be \nresponsible for their actions if the effort to clean up the global \nbarnyard is to be anything other than a halfway effort. And a halfway \neffort, in the final analysis, rerves nobody.\n  In addition, Mr. President, it is not yet clear what regulatory and \nlegislative initiatives may be required in the United States to \nimplement the binding agreement now under negotiations. Therefore, the \nresolution would also require that any Treaty signed by the United \nStates, when it is submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent, \nbe accompanied by a ``detailed explanation of any legislation or \nregulatory actions that may be required to implement the protocol or \nother agreement and should also be accompanied by an analysis of the \ndetailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of the United \nStates which would be incurred by the implementation of the \nagreement.'' I understand that the distinguished junior Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Hagel], Chairman of the relevant Subcommittee of the \nForeign Relations Committee will be holding hearings on this matter \nbeginning on June 19, and I commend him for this initiative.\n  This is a matter that will require substantial consensus building. \nThat will take time. And I am delighted that Senator Hagel will begin \nthose hearings in the very near future, June 19. I hope that \nconsideration of the resolution that we are offering today will be seen \nas a contribution to that consensus building process.\n  Now, there may have to be some adjustments made to the verbiage that \nwe have chosen and I am sure that Senator Hagel and the other \ncosponsors and I will be willing to consider any proposed adjustments, \nbe willing to sit down and talk about any changes that need to be made. \nAnd with the hearings that Senator Hagel plans to conduct, the \nopportunity will be offered to Senators to appear and make statements, \nexpressing their support, raising questions, offering suggestions, as I \nsay, or whatever. But the important thing is this. We must begin to \nengage in this consensus building.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  I stand this morning to join my colleague, the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd], in the introduction of a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution on climate change negotiation.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and I agree that the administration \nneeds to understand the Senate is very concerned about the potential \nadverse consequences of the proposed changes to the U.S. Framework \nConvention on Climate Change to which this body gave its consent \nshortly after it was signed by President George Bush at the Rio de \nJaneiro conference in 1992.\n  I hope this resolution will be a much needed wake-up call to the \nadministration about the seriousness of the Senate's views on its \ncurrent negotiating position. I do not think it was proper for this \nadministration to change the position of the United States from a \nvoluntary approach that was endorsed by the entire developed world to a \nlegally binding treaty to impose enforceable greenhouse gas reduction \ntargets by a date certain.\n  I am particularly concerned the administration did not consult with \nCongress prior to taking this new position which I am told was reached \nin the early morning hours of the last day of the Berlin negotiations. \nSubsequently, the administration has not sought, and certainly not \nreceived, consensus support from the Senate on its new approach.\n  The attitude of this administration toward honest scientific inquiry \nis very troubling. I do not approve of using political science instead \nof real science. Mr. President, let me repeat that. I do not approve of \nthis administration's use of political science instead of the real \nscience that is critically necessary when negotiating and understanding \nan issue of this importance.\n  It is outrageous that this administration has been running around the \ncountry and the whole world, for that matter, claiming, as Deputy \nSecretary Tim Wirth has done on a number of occasions, that as far as \nthe scientific hypothesis that human activity is warming the planet is \nconcerned, ``the debate is over.''\n  Instead of fairly testing that hypothesis, this administration is \nusing its $1 billion-plus annual budget to try to prove only that \ncarbon dioxide is warming the planet and to discredit any studies that \nmight appear legitimate to the contrary.\n  The Earth has warmed about a degree centigrade since the depths of \nthe of the Little Ice Age of the early 1600's. All but a tiny amount of \nthat increase occurred prior to World War II before significant human \nloading of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In fact, the world's \nscientists are still debating the extent, if any, to which human \nemissions of carbon dioxide rather than predominantly actual causes are \nactually increasing Earth temperatures.\n  There is agreement on one point, however: That any future change in \nworld temperature caused by human activity will be slight and there is \nno reason to rush to a new agreement in Kyoto in December of this year.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is unacceptable that this administration \nhas refused to admit the details of its proposal or to release any \nanalyses of the anticipated impact of the proposal. The administration \nhas not revealed to us what kinds of differences its proposal would \nactually have on global temperatures.\n  The administration's negotiators have refused to release any of their \ninternal economic studies that show huge decimation in the industrial \nsector of our economy. One can only assume that it is to ensure that \nthey will have free rein to commit the United States to whatever they \ndecide to do in the early morning hours of the last day of the Kyoto \nconference in December. This kind of secret planning and hidden agenda \nis contrary to a democracy, and, Mr. President, it is just flat wrong.\n  The administration should immediately start a more public debate and \na more honest consultation with the Senate, which, after all, has the \nfinal say on whether the United States will be legally bound to any \ninternational agreement. A great time to begin to bring this position \ninto the sunshine will be during the Foreign Relations Committee's \nhearings scheduled for next week by my colleague and the prime \ncosponsor of the resolution that is coming to the floor this morning, \nSenator Hagel. So I look forward to a more open and honest airing of \nthe issue.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia is in the Chamber and let me \nagain thank him for his leadership in the authoring of this very \nimportant sense-of-the-Senate resolution on global climate change. I am \nproud to be a sponsor and to work with him on this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Craig, for his \ncomments. He is a cosponsor of the resolution which I introduce, and I \nwelcome his efforts and the work he is doing in support of the \nresolution. And I hope that we can get additional cosponsors as well. I \nam sure that he will be working to that end.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Hagel on the floor. He is the chief \ncosponsor of this resolution. I do not have the authority to yield to \nhim unless he is appearing on my time, and I will do that. I have 30 \nminutes at the beginning, as I understand it, so I yield such time as \nhe may consume from the time under my control to the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Hagel.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia in cosponsoring the resolution that he has brought \nto the floor this morning. As my distinguished colleague has already \nnoted, this resolution deals with U.S. policy on the global climate \nissue. This is a very serious issue, with potentially disastrous \nconsequences to the United States economy. Next week I will begin, as \nSenator Byrd noted, hearings in the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \nInternational Trade and Export Promotion on the global climate \nnegotiations.\n  Like Senator Byrd, I believe that the Senate must not simply wait \nuntil the negotiations are completed and then respond. If we do that, \nit then would be too late to exercise our constitutional responsibility \nto not only give our consent to treaties but, even more important, to \ngive our advice to the President.\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\n  Next week, my subcommittee will be hearing from the Under Secretary \nof State for Global Affairs, Tim Wirth. Secretary Wirth has been the \nadministration's chief negotiator in the U.N.'s global climate \nnegotiations.\n  I will be following that first hearing a week later with a second \nhearing. We will ask fair questions, tough questions, and we will \nexpect honest answers.\n  All Americans are concerned about our environment--of course, they \nare and should be--and how to ensure that it is protected for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  The responsibility we have as public servants, as policymakers, is to \nseek the best solutions where problems exist and come to a strong and \ncommonsense bipartisan consensus on what is the best policy to deal \nwith this problem.\n  This resolution offers a general baseline for what we can accept as \nsensible, commonsense policy.\n  This resolution does not address all the specific concerns many of us \nhave over this issue. We know that.\n  As the necessary debate over the global climate issue progresses over \nthe next few months, we will have an opportunity to hear from all \nsides, just as Senator Byrd pointed out, and further open up this issue \nand talk about the specifics associated with the global climate issue.\n  How we deal with this issue of climate control will have serious \nconsequences--serious consequences--for our economy, the environment, \nAmericans' future standard of living, energy costs, energy use, \neconomic growth, our global competitiveness, impact on jobs, trade, \nnational security and maybe, Mr. President, most important, our \nnational sovereignty.\n  All of these dynamics will be explored before the December meeting in \nKyoto, Japan, formally known as the ``Third Meeting of the Conference \nof Parties for the Framework Convention on Climate Change.''\n  Mr. President, this is clearly a very serious issue that demands a \nmajor national debate.\n  The purpose of this resolution that Senator Byrd and I are offering \ntoday, with a number of our distinguished colleagues representing \nStates from all over this country with varied economies, varied \ninterests, is to begin that debate, to begin that debate today and to \nlet the world know that the U.S. Senate intends to have a very serious \nand strong voice in shaping the American position on this global \nclimate issue.\n  Mr. President, thank you, and I yield back my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator made a very important point in closing his \nspeech. Here sit the representatives of the people in this body. Here \nsit the representatives of the States. It is the only forum in this \ncountry which represents the States. And so it is that it is important \nthat this body have a voice, it is important that this body has a \nresponsibility for oversight under the Constitution, has a \nresponsibility to monitor the events and proceedings and developments.\n  It is not my desire to kill the treaty. We are going to have to face \nup to this problem. It is going to impact on our grandchildren and \ntheir children and their children and their children. And so we have a \nresponsibility to face up to it now. It is not a pleasant thing to \nconsider, to contemplate. But that is the purpose of the resolution. \nThat is the purpose of the hearings the distinguished Senator will \nconduct. We want to be in on the takeoff, not just on the landing. We \nhave a responsibility to our people, we have a responsibility to this \ncountry and to its future. So that is why we have introduced the \nlegislation today, and I compliment the distinguished Senator, and I \nlook forward to working with him in this important, all important, \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution which I \nshall send to the desk may remain open for other signatories until the \nclose of business today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague again. I \nreserve the remainder of my time, send the resolution to the desk and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The resolution will be received and \nreferred to the appropriate committee.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Byrd's sense of \nthe Senate Resolution on the issue of climate change. A few weeks ago I \nwas back in Kentucky and my youngest grandson, Morgan, wanted some help \non his math homework. At first we were both stumped over the list of \nword problems his teacher had assigned. Then, after all those years, a \nlesson one of my teachers taught me came back. She taught us to cut out \nall the extraneous words in those problems. Once we'd stripped it down, \nshe promised we'd have a clear-cut math problem we could recognize how \nto solve. It wasn't long before Morgan and I had zipped right through \nthose problems.\n  I think my colleagues will find the same method will work with the \nGlobal Climate Change Treaty that's currently being negotiated. It \nsounds complicated and impressive when you first look it over, but once \nyou strip away all the extraneous language, it comes down to this \nsimple equation. Rules benefitting the economies of developing nations \nplus rules penalizing the economies of developed nations add up to a \nbig fat zero in net gains for the global environment.\n  That's because only developed nations would be legally bound by the \ntreaty hammered out by negotiators--the so-called Berlin Mandate. \nDeveloping nations are off the hook.\n  Right now, developed nations and developing nations have about equal \nlevels of carbon emissions. But within five years of the deadline, \ndeveloping nations will have more than 1\\1/2\\ times the 1990 level of \nthe developed world.\n  So when you subtract all the half-baked environmental promises, you \nfind the equation is heavily weighted against America and especially \nagainst American workers. That's because the United States will have to \nmake the steepest reductions and suffer the costliest and most damaging \nconsequences. Preliminary estimates put the loss at 600,000 jobs each \nyear.\n  And 600,000 jobs is probably a low estimate, because the treaty \ncreates an enormous incentive for American businesses to shift more and \nmore jobs overseas, to avoid the expensive emission reductions that \nU.S. businesses will have to meet.\n  The impact in Kentucky could be especially bad. Not only would miners \nworking in the coalfields of Eastern and Western Kentucky suffer job \nloss, but many of the businesses and factories that have created a \ngolden triangle in Northern Kentucky would be forced to close. And \nevery single Kentuckian will face higher electric bills and higher gas \nprices.\n  But what should really make you scratch your head over this puzzler \nis that when you add it all up, we won't get a cleaner environment. We \nwon't stop global warming. We won't even get reduced carbon emissions.\n  That's because every ton of reduced emissions in the United States \nand other developed nations will be made up--and then some--in the \ndeveloping world.\n  So, here's a quick math review. You've got a treaty with devastating \nconsequences for the American economy. You end up with virtually no \nenvironmental benefit. Stripped down it looks like nothing more than a \nmassive foreign aid package paid for with American jobs.\n  It's clear that many American interests are being neglected by our \nnegotiators and that we must come up with a better solution for the \nproblem of global emissions.\n  Time is limited for the Senate to act to make it clear that the \ntreaty, as currently reported, will get a failing grade. A December \nsigning ceremony is already set for December in Kyoto, Japan.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleague, Senator Byrd's resolution is \nthe right method. It sets commonsense parameters for our negotiators to \nwork from to assure that any treaty meets the goal of reduced emissions \nwithout penalizing one country over another.\n  And next time my grandson grumbles about why he has to learn things \nhe'll probably never use again, I'll just remind him that when you get \nright down to it, even the most complicated\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nglobal policy problems can be solved with some simple math.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Byrd, \nHagel, and Craig to speak about the threat posed by the \nadministration's support of an international global climate treaty. \nThis is a very serious issue, and for too long it has not received the \nattention it deserves. I applaud Senator Byrd for focusing attention on \nthis matter through his sense of the Senate resolution and I am pleased \nto be an original cosponsor.\n  In December of this year, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate \nChange will conclude negotiations on a binding treaty to control the \nemissions of greenhouse gases by the developed nations. The Clinton \nadministration has been pushing hard for such an agreement and intends \nto implement this treaty in the United States. I would note, however, \nthat this treaty applies only to developed nations. Emerging nations \nare not included. Countries such as China, India, and South Korea will \nnot pay the costs of the energy taxes or be constrained by the caps on \nmanmade emissions as will the United States. It will be business as \nusual for these nations despite the fact that emissions of carbon \ndioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, from developing nations will \nshortly surpass those of the developed nations.\n  Despite this obvious flaw, such a treaty might yet be logical if we \nknew that clear benefits would be derived as a result, but we do not. \nScientists are sharply divided as to whether the Earth is warming \nbecause of human activity. How then can we justify supporting a treaty \nwhich even the U.S. Department of Energy has concluded will be \ndevastating to the economy? How can we seriously consider any proposal \nwhich will cost American jobs, slow economic growth, and encourage \ndomestic industries to move offshore when the next century's greatest \ncontributors of greenhouse gases will not share even the smallest \nportion of this burden. Mr. President, the answer is simple: We cannot \nand should not.\n  The United States has made dramatic improvements in pollution control \nin the last two decades. A clean environment is of paramount importance \nto Americans, and we will continue to work responsibly toward \nprotecting this Nation's air, water, and land. We must not, however, \nsaddle our economy with new taxes and regulations the sole purpose of \nwhich is to limit American productivity. We cannot enter into an \nagreement which will do significant harm to our economy and put us at a \ncompetitive disadvantage relative to emerging nations when the jury is \nstill out on the effects that mankind may have on climate change.\n  If future research provides irrefutable evidence that manmade \nemissions are contributing to global warming, then all Nation's should \nwork together in concert to identify and reduce the greenhouse gases \nresponsible for such a phenomenon. Today, we are far from having such \nevidence, and to act without it is simply not sound policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5622-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5626-S5627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 99--RELATIVE TO OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources:\n\n\n                               S. Res. 99\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Food and Drug Administration has proposed that the \n     content and format of over-the-counter (OTC) drug product \n     labels be made more user-friendly to help consumers better \n     understand how to properly use these medications.\n       (2) Almost 60 percent of total OTC drug product sales of \n     $29,000,000,000 are made by community retail pharmacies, \n     where a pharmacist is available for consultation with the \n     consumer about the product.\n       (3) A significant number of potent prescription medications \n     have been switched to OTC status over the last few years and \n     others are likely to be switched over in the next few years. \n     Many consumers may be unaware of the potential problems that \n     may occur when OTC and prescription drugs are inappropriately \n     used together, and should be encouraged to consult with their \n     doctor and pharmacist. The pharmacist may have the only \n     complete record of all the medications being taken by the \n     consumer that would help avoid these problems.\n       (4) Pharmacists can help the consumer select the most cost-\n     effective OTC drug product based on the symptoms presented to \n     the pharmacist.\n       (5) Interaction with the pharmacist on using OTC drug \n     products is particularly important for older Americans, who \n     already use one-third of all prescription drug products and \n     one-third of OTC drug products. As the population ages, older \n     Americans are expected to use almost half of all OTC drug \n     products by the year 2000. According to recent studies, the \n     health care system, including the Medicaid and Medicare \n     programs, incur billions of dollars in unnecessary costs each \n     year as a result of medication-related problems.\n       (6) The importance of consumer interaction with the \n     pharmacist about OTC drug products was recognized by Congress \n     when it required that Medicaid prospective drug utilization \n     review programs include screening for ``serious interactions \n     with nonprescription or OTC medications''.\n       (7) Encouraging pharmacist interaction with consumers on \n     OTC drug products is consistent with recent attempts by \n     consumer groups, the pharmacy community, and the Food and \n     Drug Administration to increase the quality and quantity of \n     written and oral information being provided to consumers with \n     their prescription medications.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONSULTATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Food and Drug \n     Administration should include a provision in the \n     Administration's new final regulation on the content and \n     format of over-the-counter drug labels which requires that \n     such labels include the phrase ``Consult your doctor or \n     pharmacist''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nrecognizes the essential role our Nation's community pharmacists play \nin protecting the public health and educating consumers about over-the-\ncounter [OTC] medications.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has proposed revisions to the \ncontent and format of OTC product labels to make them more informative \nand consumer-friendly. Among these changes, FDA has proposed adding to \nOTC labels the recommendation: ``Ask your doctor or pharmacist.'' The \nFDA is currently soliciting comments on this proposed change, \nparticularly on the benefits and appropriateness of referring consumers \nto pharmacists for guidance on OTC medications. By demonstrating strong \nsupport for a labeling change that refers consumers to pharmacists as \nwell as to doctors, this resolution acknowledges the relevant expertise \nof community pharmacists and the contribution they make in assuring \nproper use of OTC medications.\n  Each year, millions of Americans purchase medications such as \npainkillers, allergy medications, cold and flu remedies, and other \nproducts to treat nonacute medical conditions. Most of these products \nare purchased at pharmacies, where an on-site pharmacist is always \naccessible to help the consumer select the medication that is most \nappropriate and cost effective for them. The labeling change this \nresolution supports acknowledges that consumers face an intimidating \narray of medication options, and it reinforces the fact that \npharmacists have the experience and expertise to help consumers make \nthe right choice about their medications.\n  Making this labeling change is also a matter of public health. A \nsignificant number of potent prescription medications are now available \non an over-the-counter basis, and many more are likely to be \nintroduced. Most consumers are unaware of the potential problems that \nmay occur when prescription drugs and OTC products are taken together. \nIn some cases, the pharmacist may be the only health professional with \na complete record of all medications being taken by the consumer. The \npharmacist's intervention may well prevent tragic consequences.\n  Recommending that consumers consult with their pharmacist is \nparticularly important for older Americans, who already use one-third \nof all prescription and OTC drug products. With the aging of the \npopulation, older Americans are expected to use almost half of all OTC \nmedications by the year 2000. As OTC products proliferate and more \npotent medications become available, the risks to seniors and other \nconsumers compound. It makes sense to foster the pharmacist-consumer \nlink to minimize the potential problems that may result from this \ntrend.\n  Finally, this labeling change can save the health system money. \nAccording to recent studies, Medicare, Medicaid, and the health care \nsystem as a whole incur billions of dollars in unnecessary costs each \nyear as a result of\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\nmedication-related problems. Input from the pharmacist can help reduce \nthis wasted spending, and more importantly, prevent the needless pain \nand suffering this spending reflects.\n  For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in urging the FDA \nto turn a good idea into a reality and make this labeling change. It is \na minor revision that could make a major difference as consumers \nnegotiate the increasingly complex array of medications available \nwithout a prescription.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5626-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5627-S5628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 32--RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING AMERICAN \n                                 AIRMEN\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Helms, Mr. Faircloth, \nMr. Torricelli, Mr. Reid, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Craig, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Ashcroft) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Birth \n     Defects Prevention Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant \n     mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five \n     infant deaths.\n       (2) Thousands of the 150,000 infants born with a serious \n     birth defect annually face a lifetime of chronic disability \n     and illness.\n       (3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all \n     racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose \n     excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared \n     to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American \n     infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina \n     bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American \n     infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.\n       (4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to \n     environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during \n     pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are \n     slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of \n     birth defects.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment I am \nsubmitting today to the product liability bill to protect the Nation's \npublic health from the dangers of tobacco. I am joined in this effort \nby my colleagues Senator Durbin, Senator Harkin and Senator Wyden.\n  Without this amendment, the product liability bill provides the \ntobacco industry with a backdoor escape hatch from the settlement \nnegotiations in which they are currently engaged. Without this \namendment, the tobacco industry will not have to make concessions to \nthe public health community that could save millions of American lives.\n  Mr. President, 36 States have now gone to court to recover the \nmillions of dollars in Medicaid and other health care costs that were a \ndirect result of the tobacco industry's deceitful and deadly practices. \nThousands of Americans who have been grievously injured by tobacco \nproducts, and the loved ones of those who have been killed by tobacco, \nare seeking compensation from the tobacco industry for their lethal and \naddictive products. Currently, a bipartisan group of State attorneys' \ngeneral are involved in sensitive negotiations with the tobacco \nindustry concerning compensation for the illness and death caused by \nits products. Whether one supports the concept of a settlement or not, \nthe fact that the tobacco industry has come to the table is an amazing \ndevelopment.\n  They have come to the table because they realize that this President \nand enough of us in Congress will not allow them to continue seducing \nand poisoning our children without an appropriate response. They also \nknow that they will be subject to increasing civil liability in the \ncourt system. I applaud the attorneys' general for bringing such strong \ncases against them, that they realized it was time to sit down and \npossibly release our Nation's children from their stranglehold.\n  Mr. President, right now, one of the major sticking points in the \ntalks between the attorneys' general and the Big Tobacco is the issue \nof restrictions on product liability suits that will be brought against \nthe tobacco industry in the future. The industry has asked for a cap on \npunitive damages, and it wants to eliminate joint and several liability \nin tobacco cases. The attorneys' general are currently trying to work \nthis issue out with the tobacco companies.\n  Mr. President, 17 of these attorneys' general have signed on in \nsupport of our effort to remove tobacco from the scope of the product \nliability bill. I ask unanimous consent that letters signed by the \nattorneys' general endorsing this effort be printed in the Record. As \ntime goes on, I expect additional pledges of support from more \nattorneys' general.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                                    June 12, 1997.\n       Dear Members of the U.S. Senate: We, the undersigned state \n     Attorneys General, ask you to support the Lautenberg Tobacco \n     Amendment to S. 648, the Product Liability Bill. While we do \n     not in this letter take a position on the overall product \n     liability bill, we support the exclusion of the tobacco \n     industry litigation and tobacco from the scope of the bill.\n       Frankly, we are asking you not to let the tobacco industry \n     off the hook. If the product liability bill passes without \n     the changes contained in the Lautenberg amendment, the bill \n     could affect the negotiations we are involved in today.\n       Senator Lautenberg's amendment excludes ``tobacco \n     products'' from the scope of product liability litigation \n     affected by S. 648. This is the right thing to do. Without \n     the amendment, the tobacco industry will gain substantial \n     protection without conceding anything to the state \n     governments and public health advocates who are now at the \n     negotiating table.\n       Therefore, we strongly urge you to support the Lautenberg \n     Amendment. We are trying to make historic breakthroughs in \n     these settlement negotiations. It would be a tragedy to take \n     a step backwards.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Miller,\n       Iowa Attorney General.\n     Winston Bryant,\n       Arkansas Attorney General.\n     Bob Butterworth,\n       Florida Attorney General.\n     Jeffrey Modisett,\n       Indiana Attorney General.\n     J.

Frank Lautenberg,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re S. 648\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I applaud your efforts to ensure \n     that the tobacco industry is exempted from the coverage of S. \n     648, the Products Liability Bill. As Missouri's chief law \n     enforcement officer, I have filed suit against a number of \n     manufacturers of cigarettes and other tobacco products. I \n     have been active in the negotiations between the Attorneys \n     General of the suing states and the tobacco industry. The \n     sweeping protections afforded manufacturers in S. 648 must \n     not be extended to the tobacco industry during the pendency \n     of these historic\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\n     lawsuits and negotiations. Good luck with your amendment and \n     thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Jeremiah W. (Jay) Nixon,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the product liability bill passes \nin its current form, the tobacco industry will get what it wants, and \nthe American public will receive nothing in return. As reported out of \nthe Commerce Committee, the product liability bill will cap punitive \ndamages and eliminate joint and several liability in tobacco liability \ncases. This would be another sweetheart deal for big tobacco, and it \nwould undercut the state attorneys' general. This is unacceptable. And \nwhat will America lose if we don't pass my amendment? Mr. President, I \nsay perhaps millions of lives.\n  The tobacco industry is on the verge of agreeing to stop marketing to \nAmerican children, to stop lying and hiding the truth from the American \npublic, to commit to actual target numbers for reduction of teen \nsmoking, to subject themselves to appropriate regulation by the Food \nand Drug Administration and to back real reforms that will put teeth \ninto laws that prohibit the sale of cigarettes to kids. Do we in \nCongress want to throw that away forever? Do we want to give big \ntobacco the green light to continue seducing and addicting our \nchildren? I certainly hope not.\n  Mr. President, that is why it is critical that we pass my amendment, \nwhich would exempt tobacco products from the restrictions on liability \ncovered by the product liability bill. Regardless of how any Senator \nfeels about the overall goals of the product liability bill, exempting \ntobacco is the right thing to do. We should not sell out our Nation's \npublic health to the tobacco lobby. Congress should not provide the \ntobacco industry with a back door deal through the product liability \nbill. To prevent this from happening, we must attach my amendment.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues might ask: ``Why should we give \ntobacco litigation a carve-out from the restrictions of this bill?' The \nanswer is simple and rather straightforward: The tobacco industry is \nunlike any other American industry. No other industry in this country \nkills over 400,000 Americans each year. No other industry has conspired \nto deviously addict children to its product. No other industry has \nsubmitted such highly questionable testimony to Congress and the \ncourts. Is this Congress prepared to undercut unprecedented public \nhealth programs and give the tobacco industry the sweetheart deal they \nhave been dreaming of? Is Congress going to bail out the industry once \nagain? The American people won't tolerate it.\n  Mr. President, this Senator will do everything I can to prevent that \nfrom happening. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this \neffort to remove tobacco litigation from the restrictions of the \nproduct liability legislation. It is the right thing to do for the \npublic health, for our State's highest law enforcement officials, and \nmost important, for our kids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5629-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

She has served in each of these capacities with \ndedication and distinction as a principal Federal health advisor to the \nNation on public health matters; advisor to the Assistant Secretary for \nHealth on policy matters pertaining to the USPHS; and leader for \napproximately 6,200 active duty members of the Commissioned Corps of \nthe USPHS.\n  Rear Admiral Manley, a native of Jackson, MS, graduated from Spelman \nCollege in Atlanta, GA. She received her medical education at Meharry \nMedical College in Nashville, TN, and was awarded a master of public \nhealth degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and \nPublic Health. Her training includes an internship at St. Mary Mercy \nHospital in Gary, IN, a residency at Cook County Children's Hospital in \nChicago, IL, and various fellowship, research, and teaching \nexperiences. She has also held positions on the faculties of several \nmedical schools.\n  Rear Admiral Manley became a member of the Commissioned Corps in \n1976. Included among her many assignments are Director of Genetic \nServices, Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, Deputy Associate \nAdministrator for Planning, Evaluation, and Legislation, and Associate \nAdministrator for Clinical Affairs, Health Resources and Services \nAdministration [HRSA]. In 1987, she was appointed Director of the \nNational Health Service Corps, a HRSA component that furnishes primary \nhealth care providers to medically underserved communities throughout \nthe country. In 1989, Rear Admiral Manley became the Principal Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Health, working with the Assistant Secretary in \nproviding leadership and support across the full spectrum of PHS policy \nand operational issues. She assisted in directing the eight agencies of \nthe USPHS with a combined budget of $22 billion and 45,000 employees. \nShe was designated Acting Assistant Secretary for Health from January \n1993 to July 1993. In July 1993, prior to assuming her current \nresponsibilities, Rear Admiral Manley was named Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Intergovernmental Affairs, where she was responsible for \n10 PHS Regional Offices and the Office of Emergency Preparedness. In \nthis role she was the principal PHS officer responsible for \ncoordinating the USPHS response to Hurricanes Andrew and Inikki, and \nTyphoon Omar; the Mississippi flood of 1993; the Los Angeles civil \nunrest (1991) and the Northridge earthquake of 1994.\n  Rear Admiral Manley's awards as a member of the Commissioned Corps \ninclude the PHS Meritorious Service Medal, the PHS Commendation Medal, \nthe PHS Unit Commendation Award, the Surgeon General's Exemplary \nService Medal, the PHS Distinguished Service Medal, and the Hildrus \nPoindexter Award. She has also received numerous honors and awards from \na wide variety of outside organizations.\n  Mr. President, Rear Admiral Manley has truly been a great credit to \nthe Commissioned Corps and the Public Health Service throughout her \ncareer. I know that my colleagues are personally aware of her dedicated \nservice to her country, especially during the 2-years plus in which she \nprovided critical leadership as the Nation's Acting Surgeon General. It \ngives me great pleasure to recognize Rear Adm. Audrey F. Manley and, \nalong with my colleagues, to wish her a fond farewell as she concludes \na distinguished career in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public \nHealth Service and assumes duties as the next president of Spelman \nCollege.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5630-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5630-S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nas an original cosponsor of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act of \n1997. I speak as a strong supporter of this legislation, because I have \nalways believed that every single American deserves fair treatment \nunder the law no matter their gender, race, religion, or sexual \norientation.\n  As one of only a few women to ever serve in the U.S. Senate, and the \nfirst ever from Washington State, I understand what it means to be part \nof a group that seeks fairness and equal opportunity. I have never \nadvocated for any special protection or special class, just equal \ntreatment and protection under the law.\n  Not long ago, many thought it would be impossible for women to serve \nin the Senate, much less elected office of any kind. It was felt that \nthis was not a suitable occupation for a woman and that by simply being \na woman, meant you were incapable of meeting the demands of the job. It \nwas alleged that women would take offense to the unpleasant world of \npolitics and that the presence of women would somehow jeopardize the \nwork done in the U.S. Congress. While these statements may seem \nimpossible to believe today, they do illustrate what many women faced. \nHowever, these stereotypes were overcome, and I am confident that none \nof my colleagues today would deny the tremendous contributions women \nhave made here, in the House, in State and local government, and at \nevery level of public service.\n  People suffer when stereotypes based on fear or ignorance are used to \njustify discrimination. I do not believe elected leaders serve our \ncountry well if they deny any citizen equal opportunities and equal \ntreatment under the law. A person's success or failure must depend on \ntheir qualifications, skills, efforts, and even luck. But, no one \nshould be denied opportunities because of their race, gender, religion, \nor sexual orientation.\n  I am continually disappointed when I hear about cases of economic \ndiscrimination based solely on one's sexual orientation. It defies \nlogic that in today's society any employer could refuse to hire an \nindividual, deny them equal pay, or professional advancement and \nsubject them to harassment simply because of their sexual orientation. \nWe have a proud history of ensuring basic civil rights for all \nAmericans. We have enacted landmark legislation that seeks to guarantee \nequal opportunity, but we have failed to ensure that these protections \nare extended to all Americans. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act \nwill correct this wrong.\n  As we would all agree, discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic \norigin, or religion is not just unfair, but illegal as well. ENDA would \nsimply add sexual orientation to this list. It is written even more \nnarrowly than current law, because it does not allow positive \ncorrective actions such as quotas or other preferential treatment. All \nit says, is a person cannot be treated differently in any decision \nrelated to employment, based on their sexuality--whether they are \nheterosexual or homosexual. Mr. President, this is a reasonable \nexpectation and in fact it has been adopted by nine States, many local \ngovernments across the country, and many Fortune 500 companies, who \nrecognize that it simply makes good business sense to value each and \nevery one of their employees equally. It is time our laws reflect these \nvalues as well.\n  To my colleagues who believe this bill would result in increased \nlitigation, I would ask these questions: Should we then have denied \nwomen equal rights, because it would have increased the number of cases \nin our courts? Should we have allowed segregation to continue because \nof the threat of litigation? Did the Framers of our Constitution think \nabout caseloads in our courts when they guaranteed religious freedom?\n  My answer to these questions is a strong, clear ``no'', and I am \nsurprised at the arguments against this legislation. They sound \nhauntingly familiar to the ones we have heard in the past against \nallowing women, the disabled, religious members, and racial groups \nequal protection under the law and equal economic opportunity.\n  Mr. President, this is not about one group's protection at another's \nexpense. It is about common sense, common decency and about our \nfundamental values as Americans.\n  To quote former Senator Barry Goldwater, ``anybody who cares about \nreal moral values understands that this is not about granting special \nrights, it is about protecting basic rights.''\n  In the last Congress, we came within one vote of adopting this \nimportant, bi-partisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis measure so that we can continue our proud tradition of protecting \nbasic civil rights and opportunity for all Americans. If we do not pass \nthis bill, our sisters and brothers, sons and daughters will remain \nvulnerable to discrimination. We can do better than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5630-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5631-S5632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MORTIMER CAPLIN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as a former student and longtime \nfriend of Mr. Mortimer Caplin, I rise today to honor him as a dedicated \nprofessor of law at the University of Virginia as well as for his \nservice to the United States. He is well known to the Members of the \nSenate for his expert counsel in the field of tax law, and is known to \npeople everywhere as a man of the highest integrity and deepest \ncommitment to public service. Mr. President, I ask that you join me in \nrecognizing the invaluable contributions of Mr. Caplin by submitting \nfor the Record the following remarks made by his son, Michael Caplin, \non the occasion of the naming of the Mortimer Caplin Pavilion at the \nUniversity of Virginia.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n\n    Dedication of the Mortimer Caplin Pavilion at the University of \n                    Virginia Law School, May 3, 1997\n\n                          (By Michael Caplin)\n\n       On a cold winter day in 1932, Daniel Caplin drove his only \n     son Mortimer from New York City to central Virginia to visit \n     family friends. If truth be told, Mortimer didn't really want \n     to go, and joined the expedition under protest.\n       By the time they reached Charlottesville, a light snow had \n     gently draped the town and the University grounds in a \n     sparkling blanket of white. Like everyone who has ever seen \n     that wondrous sight, Mortimer Caplin was completely \n     enchanted.\n       They stayed the night, and fate bumped them into a \n     childhood friend then enrolled at the University. He took \n     them both to Pi Lambda Phi, where a warm fraternal welcome \n     made the young man feel very much at home. On they went to \n     watch the mighty U.Va. boxing team successfully defend its \n     honor before an adoring crowd of 5,000 packed into Memorial \n     Gym. Mortimer Caplin was captivated by the fierce pride, the \n     superior sportsmanship, and the magical presence of Thomas \n     Jefferson.\n       Thus began what is now a sixty-five year relationship which \n     has enriched them both. He enrolled in the college and then \n     the law school, and immersed himself in every aspect of \n     campus life-arts, athletics, scholarship, and student \n     government. Here he learned many lessons and skills with \n     which he fashioned a life of stunning achievement. For that \n     he is profoundly grateful. And, like Mr. Jefferson, Mr. \n     Caplin believes that there is a debt of service due from \n     every man to the community which has enriched him. It's a \n     debt he is proud to repay.\n       He does so by serving our University as a committed \n     teacher, and a distinguished and devoted alumnus. Mr. Caplin \n     also serves on the Law School Foundation, as Chair of the \n     University Council for the arts, and, formerly, as a member \n     of the University Board of Visitors. Most recently, he is \n     Captain of the Law School's bold $100 million fund raising \n     campaign.\n       When I heard about that campaign, I asked my father if he \n     could honestly say that the world really needed more lawyers. \n     Without a moment's hesitation, he replied with \n     complete innocence, ``The world will always need more \n     Virginia lawyers.''\n       That's how he feels about this special place, and that is \n     why he continues to serve our University with unflagging \n     enthusiasm and energy. He always has and always will do \n     whatever he can to preserve and strengthen his most important \n     institution.\n       Commitment and service of this caliber are very special. My \n     father is a very special person and a very special role \n     model. He is a quiet giant of a human being--a great man who \n     does everything, truly everything, with modest excellence, \n     impeccable integrity, fairness, generosity, and an innocent \n     steadfast faith in the character and value of all people.\n       Like his father, our Grandpa Dan Caplin, he lives life, \n     attacks it with gusto, and finds joy in everything he does. \n     He laughs with children, chats with strangers, and gives help \n     to anyone in need. He rejoices at the sweet smell of spring, \n     and celebrates the glory of theater, art, and dance. His \n     energy and enthusiasm are boundless.\n       You may know him for his scholarly articles, his learned \n     discourse, and his many contributions to our government, our \n     society, and our school. You should also know him for the \n     funny games he plays with his grandchildren, lying on the \n     floor, sharing their fantasy babble. That, too, he does with \n     fervor and flair.\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\n       He loves his family with a fierce and constant passion that \n     makes us feel strong and safe in a chaotic world. For 51 \n     years he has always made time to check our homework, cheer \n     our victories, examine our failures, support our dreams, and \n     exhort us to make hard choices and disciplined commitment \n     necessary to excel. He is a wonderful, wonderful father. And \n     for 54 enchanted years he celebrated his greatest love and \n     matchless muse, my mother, Ruth Caplin. He is a devoted \n     husband.\n       Mortimer Caplin is a very special man. He has excelled in \n     everything. His life story is simply remarkable. He was a \n     skillful actor in college and president of the Virginia \n     Players. He was an NCAA boxing champ, graduated first in his \n     college class, first in his law school class, and was Editor \n     in Chief of the Law Review.\n       Did you know he commanded a navy battalion during the D-day \n     landing at Omaha Beach? Or, that he might have worked at the \n     FBI if his applications had not been mysteriously lost again \n     and again and again. I thank you, J. Edgar Hoover.\n       Did you know that when he came to teach at U.Va., Mortimer \n     Caplin was not a tax expert or especially versed in trusts & \n     estates. He was a corporate law buff, but threw himself into \n     these new areas with typical abandon, mastering them, and \n     then teaching with aplomb.\n       Like his father, he was dedicated to his students, and gave \n     them his very best. And, like his father, he is proudest of \n     his work as a teacher. He trained and disciplined a legion of \n     young lawyers to become assets to their profession and \n     community. Two of those students extolled his vast talents \n     and wisdom to their big brother, who then called Mr. Caplin \n     back into public service, where he served with integrity and \n     distinction.\n       Caplin & Kennedy's IRS never investigated enemies. They \n     computerized, closed loopholes, and spread the tax burden \n     equally. His superior performance earned him the Treasury \n     Department's highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Award.\n       The law firm he founded is excellent, staffed with good, \n     civilized people who, like himself, care about the law and a \n     duty of superior service. And the capital campaign committee \n     under his exuberant leadership, has nearly reached its \n     stunning $100 million goal, including the creation of this \n     magnificent pavilion.\n       This is an exemplary life. And, on top of all that, you \n     should know that he's been going to the gym at least 3 times \n     a week for 60 straight years, he is at all times within 3 \n     pounds of his college fighting weight, and he is currently #2 \n     nationwide in the number of lengths swum in the 80 years and \n     older category, and it's reported that #1 is probably taking \n     steroids.\n       I'm very happy to stand here today on behalf of my family \n     to say that we love our father dearly, that we are very proud \n     to be Caplins, and that we thank you all very much for giving \n     him this wonderful honor that he most certainly deserves.\n       Our society and our school really are better because of the \n     effort and achievement of Mortimer Caplin. And we all really \n     are enriched by his example of life lived passionately on \n     every single level. We all are summoned by his example of \n     integrity, civility, fearless enthusiasm, and uncompromising \n     discipline and resolve. Hit first, hit hardest, and keep on \n     hitting, his U.Va. Boxing coach once said. And so he does. \n     Focus, give of yourself honestly and unselfishly, be \n     optimistic, be kind. Then, everything is possible.\n       Congratulations, Mr. Caplin, and thank you for doing \n     everything for everybody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5631-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF SUE MATTHEW AND JAN WEGENKE'S ASSISTANCE DURING THE \n                             FLOODS OF 1997\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important work of Chuck Tinant in ongoing flood \nrecovery efforts in the Dakotas.\n  Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota and South \nDakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold \ntemperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof the upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother \nNature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the \nBig Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of \nWatertown, SD, to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the \ncity without sewer and water for three weeks. The city of Bruce, SD, \nwas completely under water when record low temperatures turned swollen \nstreams into sheets of ice.\n  The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND, and 10,000 residents of East \nGrand Forks, MN, were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the \nRed River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was \nastounding; an entire city under water and a fire that gutted a \nmajority of Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently \nwere allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and \ndifficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning.\n  As chairman of the Dakota Disaster Relief Fund, Chuck Tinant has been \nspearheading volunteer efforts on behalf of the Rapid City Chamber of \nCommerce. Through Chuck's coordination, the relief fund has raised over \n$78,000 for flood victims. In addition, Chuck helped organize efforts \nby students from area high schools and elementary schools, local \nbusinesses, and concerned individuals to collect and ship cleaning \nsupplies, toys, furniture, school books, and food items to Grand Forks.\n  While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction \nwrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness first \nhand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their \ncommunity to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood \nwaters. The selfless actions of people like Chuck Tinant illustrates \nthe resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of \ntrouble.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair \nGrand\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\nForks and other impacted communities. Chuck Tinant illustrates how an \nindividual can bring some relief to the victims of this natural \ndisaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking him for his selfless \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5633-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5634-S5635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SERVICE IN AMERICA\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, in April, President Clinton with \nformer Presidents Bush and Ford convened a Summit on Service in \nPhiladelphia. They and other national leaders called upon young people \nto serve their communities and urged them to spread the spirit of \nservice throughout the country.\n  The Corporation for National Service [CNS] is among those advancing \nthis spirit. Its mission, as my colleagues are well aware, is to help \nthe country meet its educational, environmental, and public safety \nneeds through service projects conducted and led by young people. The \nyoung people who participate in the AmeriCorps Program assist needy \nindividuals, families, and their communities, while building their own \nself-esteem and earning grants to help them meet the financial costs of \nhigher education.\n  Since its inception, the Corporation for National Service has taken \nsteps to address the charges of its critics by making necessary \nchanges. Today, CNS fulfills its mandates successfully, efficiently, \nand cost effectively. In fact, a University of Minnesota study shows \nthat AmeriCorps Programs in that State return $3.90 in benefits for \nevery dollar spent. Studies in Washington State reveal a similar return \non investment.\n  When the Senate considers the reauthorization of the Corporation for \nNational Service, I hope we will continue to foster the spirit of \nservice that was celebrated in Philadelphia. To open the discussion, I \nask my colleagues to take the time to read an article entitled ``The \nValue of Service,'' which appeared in the June edition of Government \nExecutive magazine. This article offers, I believe, a balanced view of \nCNS's first 4 years. Mr. President, I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord. The article follows:\n\n                          The Value of Service\n\n                            (By Annys Shin)\n\n       These should be heady days for the Corporation for National \n     Service, the 4-year-old agency that oversees AmeriCorps, \n     President Clinton's pet program to give students financial \n     aid in exchange for a year of community service.\n       In February, Clinton announced in his State of the Union \n     address that he would use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers \n     to mobilize an army of reading tutors for grade-school \n     children. In March, CNS chief executive Harris Wofford got a \n     favorable reception on Capitol Hill when he testified before \n     the House and Senate on his agency's budget request. A month \n     later, he stood with President Clinton and former President \n     Bush at a summit meeting on national service in Philadelphia.\n       All this just a year after AmeriCorps' budget was zeroed \n     out by the House (only to be restored later in negotiations \n     with the Senate) and Congress failed to bring CNS' \n     reauthorization up in committee.\n       Still, CNS is still fighting to prove that its programs are \n     worth the $600 million a year taxpayers spend on them.\n       President Clinton's proposed tutoring effort, known as the \n     America Reads Initiative, has further raised the stakes for \n     AmeriCorps and CNS. The Clinton administration has requested \n     $1 billion over the next five years to cover the costs of the \n     program and an additional 50,000 AmeriCorps Challenge \n     Scholarships. Any funding increase or new service initiative \n     can't go forward unless CNS is reauthorized by September, \n     according to a CNS spokesman.\n       Since CNS is the Clinton administration's most significant \n     expansion of the federal bureaucracy, its leaders have been \n     meticulous since 1993 about measuring the results of their \n     programs to show that they work. Other federal operations \n     will soon follow suit, as the Government Performance and \n     Results Act of 1993 takes full effect, forcing agencies to \n     develop outcomes-based approaches to running their programs.\n       However, few agencies are likely to face the relentless \n     criticism that CNS has from its Republican opponents, who see \n     the agency and its programs as little more than a political \n     boondoggle. So far, reams of positive data have not been \n     enough to get CNS out of the partisan cross hairs.\n\n\n                         AmeriCorps Under Siege\n\n       At the center of all the controversy is AmeriCorps, CNS' \n     flagship program. The agency administers two other service \n     programs, Learn and Serve and the Senior Corps, but neither \n     have received the scrutiny AmeriCorps has.\n       CNS jointly administers AmeriCorps with 48 state \n     commissions, which vary in size. CNS gives half of AmeriCorps \n     grant funding to the state commissions, which then issue sub-\n     grants to projects. CNS directly funds projects with the rest \n     of the money.\n       AmeriCorps members are involved in a variety of activities, \n     including assisting crime victims, immunizing children, \n     restoring national parks, developing community-based health \n     care programs and setting up credit unions in low-income \n     communities. In return for a year's service, they get living \n     allowances of $7,600 a year, which can be supplemented by the \n     member's employer. They also receive an education award of \n     $4,725 to put toward paying off student loans or to finance \n     higher education or vocational training. Members can receive \n     living allowances and education grants for up to two terms of \n     service.\n       Last year, the $215 million that AmeriCorps distributed in \n     the form of grants to states and direct funding of projects \n     went to 450 programs that operate at more than 1,000 sites \n     nationwide and employ 24,000 AmeriCorps members.\n       None of AmeriCorps' critics have disputed the value of \n     building housing for low-income families or teaching children \n     to read. But some members of Congress question whether the \n     program's benefits are worth its cost to taxpayers.\n       At many federal agencies, the cost-benefit calculation is \n     far from simple. The Government Performance and Results Act \n     is supposed to help by forcing agencies to come up with \n     strategic plans and to measure the results of their programs. \n     ``The Results Act is a major culture change for most \n     agencies,'' says Jerome F. Climer, president of the \n     Congressional Institute, a think tank that studies \n     governmental reforms.\n       But at CNS, which was created the same year GPRA became \n     law, no such culture change is necessary. ``There was a \n     decision made early on in the program that AmeriCorps had to \n     be judged on the basis of what it actually accomplished, on \n     services delivered,'' says Steven Waldman, assistant managing \n     editor at U.S. News and World Report, who wrote The Bill \n     (Viking, 1995), a book about Clinton's effort to start a \n     national service program, and later served as Wofford's \n     senior policy adviser. ``It was not sufficient to have \n     anecdotal evidence that it was good for the AmeriCorps \n     members. We had to have proof that it was good for the \n     communities it was serving.''\n\n\n                           Costs and Benefits\n\n       But measuring community impact has proved to be easier said \n     than done. Older service programs such as the Peace Corps \n     have tended to focus more on participant benefits, in part \n     because the impact on participants is easier to gauge than \n     the effect on communities, says JoAnn Jastrzab of the Boston \n     research firm Abt Associates, who has studied some of \n     AmeriCorps' efforts.\n       Last July, Jastrzab and her colleagues released the \n     findings of a 14-month study of the country's eight largest \n     and most-established youth conservation corps, which get \n     about a third of their funding through AmeriCorps. The study \n     was funded by CNS.\n       Jastrzab followed participants in one Washington state \n     project who went out into fields armed with toothbrushes to \n     talk to migrant farm laborers about oral hygiene and to try \n     to persuade them to visit a local health clinic on a regular \n     basis. Other volunteers served as translators in the clinic. \n     These services may have raised the number of workers who \n     receive preventive care, and the eventual cost-savings of \n     such preventive care to taxpayers could be measured, Jastrzab \n     concluded, but documenting it could be costly and would \n     require a separate study.\n       Nevertheless, after comparing operating costs to the value \n     of service provided and the gain in participant earnings in \n     the 15 months following service, Jastrzab and her colleagues \n     estimated that each hour of service youth corps members \n     performed resulted in $1.04 more in benefits than it cost to \n     employ them.\n       Evaluators have come up with similar cost-benefit ratios \n     for other AmeriCorps programs. Researchers from the Northwest \n     Regional Educational Laboratory found that every federal \n     dollar invested in two Washington state AmeriCorps projects \n     yielded a return up to $2.40 in benefits. University of \n     Minnesota researchers found benefits up to $3.90 for each \n     federal dollar put into several Minnesota AmeriCorps \n     projects. CNS officials say such figures show taxpayers are \n     getting bang for the bucks AmeriCorps spends.\n       CNS officials have also compiled lists of AmeriCorps \n     project accomplishments. The San Mateo, Calif.-based research \n     firm Aguirre International studied the program's first year \n     of service and put together a list of beneficiaries, which \n     included 10,000 children who were escorted to school through \n     safe corridors, more than 1,000 teen-agers who received \n     counseling about drug and alcohol abuse, more than 700 \n     families who were able to move into new or refurbished homes, \n     apartment units or shelters, and more than 1,200 people with \n     AIDS who received services.\n\n\n                            Tracking Results\n\n       But whether this laundry list of good deeds translates into \n     long-term impact is another story. AmeriCorps participants, \n     says Lance Potter, director of evaluation at CNS, ``are \n     people who are out there to solve the problem of homelessness \n     or to teach every child to read. They don't have goals that \n     you can reach in a year.''\n       However, social scientists say that the long-term effect of \n     service programs can be\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\n     measured through studies that track, for example, literacy \n     rates in areas where AmeriCorps members serve as reading \n     tutors. Such studies are being designed, Potter says. In \n     September, research firm Aguirre International is slated to \n     issue a report on the long-term impact of AmeriCorps' \n     programs.\n       Tracking the benefits of service work on the people who \n     join AmeriCorps is also a challenge. As with gauging a \n     project's community impact, economists and social scientists \n     have yet to slap a price tag on boosting participants' self-\n     esteem, raising their job aspirations, or increasing the \n     likelihood that they will volunteer in the future.\n       Adding another wrinkle to measuring benefits to \n     participants is AmeriCorps members' demographics. Programs \n     such as the Youth Corps recruit mostly among disadvantaged \n     youth. When comparing kids who participate in Youth Corps to \n     a group of their peers who didn't, gains in educational \n     attainment or work experience show up clearly. But in \n     evaluating AmeriCorps members, who are recruited regardless \n     of socio-economic status and tend to be older, more educated \n     and better off than Youth Corps members, the benefits to \n     participants are sometimes less dramatic.\n       An Abt Associates study of Youth Corps programs found they \n     did little to boost the incomes or job opportunities of white \n     male participants when compared to white males who didn't \n     perform a year of service. Black and Hispanic participants, \n     on the other hand, made more money and got better jobs than \n     their non-service counterparts.\n       The findings reflect a better job market for white males, \n     says Jastrzab, not a detrimental effect of service. But \n     without detailed explanation, the finding gave the appearance \n     of failure.\n       ``When the findings come around to showing different \n     impacts on young people by race, then CNS wants to distance \n     itself from that,'' says Andy Moore, a spokesman for the \n     National Association of Service Conservation Corps. ``This \n     study was publicized in spite of CNS, not because of it.''\n       When there really is bad news about a AmeriCorps-backed \n     project, it doesn't necessarily mean the project loses its \n     funding. But projects that show no interest in completing \n     evaluations at all probably will be cut off, according to \n     Potter.\n       After its first year, CNS defunded only 50 AmeriCorps \n     grantees, and only 20 in its second year. ``We don't want to \n     be in the business of punishing programs for finding out that \n     they have shortcomings,'' Potter says. ``If we do that, we \n     send the message that we don't provide an incentive for them \n     to look hard at their program and find ways to improve it.''\n       In order for an outcome-based approach to work ``there must \n     be consequences,'' argues the Congressional Institute's \n     Climer. ``Poorly performing programs must be repaired.'' \n     There also have to be rewards for improvements, he says.\n       AmeriCorps' critics have kept CNS officials keenly aware of \n     what will happen if the agency doesn't meet their \n     expectations. This spring, AmeriCorps' congressional critics \n     were disappointed by what they saw as the agency's lack of \n     improvement in management practices and cost control, and \n     renewed threats to kill the program if it doesn't make \n     significant strides over the next year.\n       Such threats carry greater urgency in the current climate \n     of deficit reduction.\n       ``One of the greatest difficulties that we have is that \n     [AmeriCorps'] funds compete directly with dollars for federal \n     housing programs, veterans benefits, the space program, \n     natural disaster relief and more than a dozen other federal \n     agencies,'' says David Lestrang, an aide to Rep. Jerry Lewis, \n     R-Calif, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee \n     that has jurisdiction over the CNS budget. ``It all comes \n     down to a matter of priority. I know this is a priority for \n     the administration but they have to weigh it against other \n     priorities. For Congress, the jury is still out on \n     AmeriCorps.''\n       ``If you focused entirely on the cost, you could justify \n     killing any program if you never looked at the benefits,'' \n     counters Waldman.\n\n\n                               Dual Goals\n\n       The question of whether CNS' programs are cost-effective \n     depends largely on how you define its goals.\n       In the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, \n     the agency's mission is defined as helping ``the nation meet \n     its unmet human, education, environmental and public safety \n     needs.'' But President Clinton also sold AmeriCorps as a way \n     for young people to earn money for college.\n       Senator Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a vocal AmeriCorps \n     critic, doesn't dispute the benefits of its programs. But he \n     questions whether it is an efficient way to help kids get to \n     college.\n       Grassley ``has no problem with the work AmeriCorps \n     volunteers are doing-it's valuable work,'' says Jill Kozeny, \n     one of his aides. ``He has a problem with the huge burly cost \n     structure.''\n       Grassley has commissioned several General Accounting Office \n     studies of CNS operations. Two years ago, a GAO study he \n     ordered concluded that the agency was expending about $17,000 \n     in resources on each AmeriCorps participant. Adding state, \n     local and private support for the program, GAO pegged average \n     resources per participant at $26,654. Grassley said this \n     figure was way too high. He also blasted CNS for giving \n     grants to other federal agencies and not garnering more \n     private support for projects.\n       CNS officials say it's unfair to include other federal, \n     state, local government, and private contributions when \n     estimating program costs. But last year CNS chief executive \n     Harris Wofford said he would implement a plan to require \n     grantees with above average per-participant costs to lower \n     them by 10 percent in the next grant cycle. Wofford also \n     agreed to end funding to other federal agencies, which had \n     totaled $12 million a year for programs such as WritersCorps, \n     a tutoring program underwritten by the National Endowment for \n     the Arts. And he said he would raise requirements for \n     matching private funds from 25 percent to 33 percent of a \n     grantee's budgets. Grassley then helped save AmeriCorps \n     funding for another year.\n       In March of this year, Grassley and others found more \n     fodder for discontent in another GAO report on the role of \n     state commissions in administering AmeriCorps. The report \n     included costs, attrition rates, and rates of educational \n     award usage among several AmeriCorps projects. One project, \n     the Casa Verde Builders Program in Texas, had an attrition \n     rate of more than 50 percent and cost $2.5 million, half of \n     which came directly from CNS. Grassley's office estimated \n     costs for the program at close to $100,000 per participant.\n       ``We have to look at whether this program is the most cost-\n     effective way to help people go to college,'' Grassley said \n     on NBC Nightly News shortly after the report came out.\n       Wofford protests that AmeriCorps is not simply a \n     scholarship program, but a national service one as well.\n       That is exactly what bothers some of AmeriCorps' critics, \n     who say that the federal government shouldn't be in business \n     of promoting service. Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., \n     abhors the idea that AmeriCorps members are in essence ``paid \n     to volunteer,'' according to one of his aides, Fred Greer. \n     ``The aim is worthy,'' Greer says. ``But why does it have to \n     be a public program from the start?\"\n       AmeriCorps supporters counter that federal investment is a \n     vital catalyst to boosting community service and a necessary \n     incentive for overworked citizens to volunteer.\n       Still, even the most ardent AmeriCorps supporters are \n     starting to concede that the non-government sectors have a \n     bigger role to play in national service. At the April summit \n     on service in Philadelphia, Clinton proposed the creation of \n     50,000 new AmeriCorps Challenge grants that would allow \n     AmeriCorps to add 33,000 members over five years. The new \n     grants would only cover the education award; private and \n     nonprofit organizations would pick up the tab for other \n     program costs and living expenses.\n       ``We're extremely open-minded to ideas from all parts of \n     the political spectrum on how to make national service \n     work,'' Waldman said in an interview before he left the \n     agency. ``Outside of Washington, AmeriCorps is much more a \n     nonpartisan issue.''\n       Congressional opposition puts CNS officials in a bind, \n     because they're forced to be accountable for the \n     effectiveness of projects that they don't directly run, half \n     of which they don't even choose to fund. ``Congress set it up \n     this way and if they believe in it they ought to take it \n     seriously,'' Waldman said. ``It puts us in a ridiculous \n     position: Congress wants us to not have any control but hold \n     us accountable.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5634-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5635-S5636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE TOWNS OF NASHUA, PORTSMOUTH AND MANCHESTER ON BEING \n        NAMED TO MONEY MAGAZINE'S BEST PLACES TO LIVE IN AMERICA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize the great citizens of Nashua, NH, Portsmouth, NH, and \nManchester, NH, on being named to Money magazine's best places to live \nin America. Nashua, NH, came in at No. 1, with Portsmouth and \nManchester finishing fifth and sixth respectively based on Money \nmagazine's rankings.\n  The national investment magazine released their list of America's top \nten communities based on business climate, economic well-being, quality \nof life and other factors that comprise a positive environment in which \nto work and raise a family. New Hampshire's tourism industry, scenic \nbeauty, lack of sales or income tax, low crime rate, quality education, \nand family and community spirit make the State attractive for families \nand businesses to locate here. The people of these communities, and of \nthe entire State, have good reason to be extra proud.\n  Nashua, the Gate City of the Granite State, named number one by Money \nmagazine, is the only State to receive this honor twice, of which I and \nthe citizens are very proud. The former mill town which borders the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, has a booming economy with manufacturing \nfacilities, hi-tech firms, and defense contractors. Nashua is also \nclose to many cultural arts venues and major medical faculties of \nneighboring communities,\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\nwhich make it number one as touted by Money magazine.\n  Portsmouth, New Hampshire's Port City, placed sixth as the most \ndesirable place in the country. The Portsmouth community relies on many \nmajor technology and communications firms to help thrust to the \nforefront of the Nation. The Portsmouth community is a great place to \nraise a family with its many fine schools and major colleges nearby \nincluding the University of New Hampshire in nearby Durham. The Port \nCity is also the home of one of our Nation's finest military \ninstitutions, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.\n  Manchester, the Queen City, picked up the sixth place honors in the \nNation. The Queen City has many high-tech firms and major \ntelecommunications businesses which help add to the economic power of \nthe city. Manchester sits on the banks of the Amoskeg river, the home \nto many of the historic manufacturing plants of the late 1800's and \nearly 1900's. Situated in the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire, \nManchester is also home to a booming cultural arts center which is the \npride of northern New England.\n  Mr. President, it is no surprise that New Hampshire is the only State \nwith three towns in the top ten. I can think of no cities in America \nmore deserving of these top honors than Nashua, Portsmouth, and \nManchester.

They helped \nbring about an economic revival that has propelled New Hampshire into \nnational recognition once again. I am proud to represent them all in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5635-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL HOME OWNERSHIP WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week we mark the second \nanniversary of the National Home Ownership Week. I rise to join with my \nconstituents and citizens across the Nation to celebrate the efforts to \npromote and expand the rate of home ownership in this country.\n  It is my view that home ownership activities foster and encourage the \nrevitalization of neighborhoods. Home ownership stabilizes local \ncommunities by providing families with a renewed sense of civic \nresponsibility and commitment to the well-being of their neighborhoods. \nIn addition, home ownership is one of the single most important \nvehicles for personal financial growth and wealth accumulation. New \nhome ownership encourages investment and job growth in areas where such \ninvestment has been lacking. While a majority of Americans today are \nhomeowners, many moderate and low income families are unable to \novercome the economic barriers to owning a home. The National Home \nOwnership Week is part of the national strategy to make the dream of \nhome ownership a reality for these families.\n  Study after study has demonstrated that many families with high \nenough incomes to buy homes and who may, in fact, be paying as much in \nrent as they would be in mortgage payments, are locked out of home \nownership because they cannot generate the down payment or closing \ncosts necessary. Helping families to surmount those barriers, and then \nproviding them with mortgages at affordable rates so that they can \nbecome home owners, means moving those families toward long-term \neconomic security. Therefore, it is imperative that we work to increase \nthe availability of credit and affordable mortgages for moderate and \nlow income families who labor to own their piece of the American dream.\n  The number of local events being held across the country to celebrate \nNational Home Ownership Week now exceeds 600. In my state of Maryland, \nI had the privilege of attending an event in Wheaton, MD, to announce \nthe ``Home Ownership Montgomery'' initiative as part of this week's \ncelebration of home ownership activities. I was proud to stand with \nrepresentatives from the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities \nCommission, the county government, Fannie Mae and other dedicated \nhousing advocates. As part of the strategy to increase the number of \nMaryland home owners, Montgomery County has partnered with Fannie Mae \nto make millions of dollars of low interest loans available to low \nincome families who need assistance with closing costs and mortgage \npayments. It is my hope that these efforts and numerous others will \nincrease the current home ownership rate in Maryland from 65.9 percent \nto 67.5 percent, the national goal set by the National Partners in Home \nOwnership.\n  The success of National Home Ownership Week is made possible by many \ninnovative public-private partnerships. In this age of shrinking \nFederal resources, partnerships have leveraged funds to support \nmillions of dollars in home ownership activities. National \norganizations such as the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the \nEnterprise Foundation, local nonprofits and for-profits such as \nInterfaith Housing of Western Maryland, and local governments have \ndeveloped thousands of homes for low income families. I salute these \ncombined efforts to rebuild local communities. At the same time, we \nmust not forget that federal funding for affordable housing assistance \nand homeless individuals has been on the decline. The dream of home \nownership is a dream that many families of varied incomes desire. It is \nmy hope that National Home Ownership Week will not only help to raise \nthe awareness of the need for increased home ownership, but at the same \ntime, heighten the public's consciousness of the benefits of providing \naffordable housing for all families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5636-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MACON COUNTY\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to today to recognize Macon \nCounty--a beautiful county in my home state of Tennessee.\n  The people of Macon County are hard and prosperous workers who have \nnever lost touch with their core community values, even as they have \nresponded to our ever changing times. For instance, with their deep \nroots in tobacco farming, Macon County farmers have had to adapt to \nrapid changes in agriculture and agribusiness. For many, that has meant \nexpanding to grow alternative crops--like sweet peppers--to remain \ncompetitive throughout the Nation.\n  Other residents have recognized the value of the area's natural \nbeauty, and the county's tourism has grown as a result. Places like \nUnion Camp Waterfall, Winding Stairs natural rock formation and Red \nBoiling Springs draw many visitors from Tennessee and throughout the \ncountry.\n  Every year Macon countians celebrate those values, the success of \ntheir community and the common bond they share in many different ways. \nWhether it's their award-winning county fairs or the perfect balance \nthey have achieved between the county's unique natural features, \nresidents of Macon County can take pride in their work and in \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, the citizens of Macon County are hardworking, forward-\nthinking individuals dedicated not only to the growth and success of \ntheir community, but also to the growth and success of their community \nspirit. I salute them all. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5636-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5636-S5637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I would like to salute 13 \noutstanding young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold \nAward by Connecticut Trails Girl Scout Council in North Haven, CT. They \nare Katherine Berinato, Amy Suzanne Brink, Anne T. Dwyer, Sarah Erling, \nCarolyn Greeno, Paige Henninger, Bri Lyn Howell, Theresa Lacombe, \nKristen A. McAree, Elizabeth Shepherd, Jennifer R. Westmoreland, \nRebecca Wonneberger, and Heather Swanson. They are being honored on \nJune 8, 1997, for earning the achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting. \nThe Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in \nareas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal \ndevelopment. The award can be earned by girls aged 14-17, or in grades \n9-12.\n  Girls Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million \ngirls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior \nGirl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the \naward a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career \nExploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior \nGirl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold \nAward project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by \nthe Senior Girl Scout and is\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\ncarried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult \nGirl Scout volunteer.\n  As members of the Connecticut Trails Girl Scout Council, we believe \nthey should receive the public recognition due them for their \nsignificant service to their community and their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5636-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5637-S5639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RIEGLE-NEAL CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, the trigger date for nationwide \ninterstate branching has passed--June 1, 1997. This important \nlegislation will preserve the benefits of the dual banking system and \nkeep the State banking charter competitive in an interstate \nenvironment. It is critical that the Senate now consider and pass H.R. \n1306, the Riegle-Neal Clarification Act of 1997.\n  The dual banking system has served this country well for over 100 \nyears. The State banking system has been the source of major advances \nin the banking industry for the past 70 years.\n  Mr. President, the dual banking system is under attack. The bill is \nnecessary to preserve confidence in a State banking charter for banks \nwith such a charter that wish to operate in more than one State. In \naddition, it will curtail incentives for unnecessary Federal preemption \nof State laws. Finally, the bill will restore balance to the dual \nbanking system by ensuring that neither charter operates at an unfair \nadvantage in this new interstate environment.\n  Mr. President, the importance of this bill to my State has been \ncommunicated by Governor Pataki and the superintendent of banking. New \nYork has more than 90 state-chartered banks with a total of more than \nhalf a trillion dollars in assets. These institutions play a vital role \nin the economic wellbeing of the State of New York. Without this \nlegislation, the largest of these institutions may be tempted to \nconvert to a national charter in order to operate in more than one \nState. The local bond with these institutions could be broken. New York \nState bank examiners would be no longer be examining these institutions \nfor compliance with our State community reinvestment and consumer \nprotection laws.\n  H.R. 1306 will help prevent this alarming scenario. It protects the \ndual banking system.\n  Mr. President, the problem cured by this bill can be simply \ndescribed. The current law may be unclear as to whether consistent \nrules are used to determine what laws and powers apply to the out-of-\nState branches of State and federally chartered banks. To the extent it \nremains uncertain that current law establishes rough parity between \ncharters in this regard, some banks may conclude that the national bank \ncharter is the preferable option. This is not a hypothetical concern; \nKey Corp., one of the largest State-chartered banks in New York, \nconverted to a national bank because of this uncertainty. H.R. 1306 \nwould resolve any such ambiguity.\n  First, it would establish that a host State's law would apply to the \nout-of-State branches of a State-chartered bank only to the same extent \nthat those laws apply to the branches of out-of-State national banks \nlocated in the host State. Second, it would make clear that host State \nbranches would be allowed to exercise powers granted by their home \nState if such powers are permissible for either banks chartered by the \nhost State or for national bank branches in that host State.\n\n  Enactment of H.R. 1306 also would bolster efforts in New York and \nother States to make sure that the State-chartered banks have the \npowers they need to compete efficiently and effectively in an \ninterstate environment.\n  Mr. President, this bill is especially important now because of the \nefforts of the Comptroller of the Currency to preempt State laws and \npromote the national bank charter at the expense of the States and \nother Federal regulators. At a recent oversight hearing, I presented \ndocumentation, prepared by the OCC, that confirms that the OCC has \nmounted an unprecedented, aggressive marketing effort to convince State \nchartered banks to flip to a national charter.\n  I am pleased that our colleagues in the House, particularly Chairman \nLeach and Representative Roukema, were able to expeditiously guide this \nbill through the House, where the bill passed on the suspension \ncalendar. I also want to thank my Senate colleagues for their \ncooperation, especially Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes has reviewed and analyzed carefully \nthe House bill and he has identified the need for a technical \nclarification to the House-passed bill contained in the amendment we \nhave developed. The amendment would modify the title of the bill, \nprovide a technical clarification to ensure that a national statute \nthat applies to a State-chartered bank in its home State will also \napply to a branch of the bank in a host State; and, finally, require \nthe OCC to report to Congress on its preemption decisions since January \n1, 1992, and annually thereafter.\n  The information yielded by this preemption reporting requirement on \nthe OCC's preemption of State law in numerous areas will assist \noversight of the Comptroller's use of preemptive authority. In my \njudgment, in recent years the OCC has used his authority over national \nbanks to thwart traditional areas of State regulation--such\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\nas regulation of insurance and consumer protection. With the benefit of \nthe information and analysis the amendment will require, Congress will \nbe in a better position to determine whether current law regarding \npreemption is too broad or its administrative interpretation and \napplications have been too expansive.\n  Mr. President, again I thank my distinguished ranking minority \nmember, Senator Sarbanes, and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment and the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered \ntogether with Chairman D'Amato to H.R. 1306 would make three changes in \nthe legislation.\n  First, it would make the title of the legislation the Riegle-Neal \nAmendments Act of 1997. This reflects the fact that this legislation \nmakes significant substantive changes to current law, and is not merely \na clarification or technical change.\n  Second, the amendment requires that no provision of subsection 24(j) \nof the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by H.R. 1306, shall be \nconstrued as affecting the applicability of Federal law to State banks \nand State bank branches in the home State or the host State. There was \na concern that subsection 24(j)(1), as amended by H.R. 1306, could have \nthe unintended result of Federal law not applying to a branch in a host \nState of an out-of-State State bank that would apply to the bank in its \nhome State.\n  Third, the amendment would require the Comptroller of the Currency to \nconduct an annual review of the actions it has taken with regard to the \napplicability of State law to national banks or their branches during \nthe preceding year, and include in its annual report to Congress the \nresults of the review and the reasons for each action. The first such \nreview and report after the enactment of this legislation shall \nencompass all such actions taken on or after January 1, 1992.\n  There are a couple of reasons for the inclusion of this reporting \nrequirement in this amendment. First, under current law, actions by the \nComptroller preempting State law only benefit branches of national \nbanks in the affected State. H.R. 1306 would expand the applicability \nof those preemption decisions to branches of out-of-State State banks. \nGiven this significant expansion of the consequences of the \nComptroller's preemption decisions, it seems reasonable and important \nto require the Comptroller to include in its annual report to Congress \na review and explanation of these decisions.\n  In addition, when Congress enacted the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking \nand Branching Efficiency Act in 1994, it specifically provided that \nState laws regarding consumer protection, community reinvestment, fair \nlending, and intrastate branching apply to the branches of State and \nnational banks. The act provided that this set of State laws would not \napply if Federal law preempts the application of such State laws to a \nnational bank, or if the Comptroller of the Currency determines that \nthe application of such State laws would have a discriminatory effect \non the branch in comparison with the effect the application of such \nState laws would have with respect to branches of a bank chartered by \nthe host State.\n  Concerns have been raised by consumer groups, both before and since \nthe enactment of Riegle-Neal, that the Comptroller has undertaken \npreemptive actions which were unnecessarily expansive. The conference \nreport which accompanied the enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act \nspecifically addressed this point. The report stated:\n\n       The Conferees have been made aware of certain circumstances \n     in which the Federal banking agencies have applied \n     traditional preemption principles in a manner the Conferees \n     believe is inappropriately aggressive, resulting in \n     preemption of state law in situations which the federal \n     interest did not warrant that result. One illustration is OCC \n     Interpretive letter No. 572, dated January 15, 1992, from the \n     OCC to Robert M. Jaworski, Assistant Commissioner, State of \n     New Jersey Department of Banking, concluding that national \n     banks in New Jersey are not required to comply with the New \n     Jersey Consumer Checking Account. It is of utmost concern to \n     the Conferees that the agencies issue opinion letters and \n     interpretive rules concluding that Federal law preempts state \n     law regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, \n     fair lending, or establishment of intrastate branches only \n     when the agency has determined that the Federal policy \n     interest in preemption is clear. In the case of Interpretive \n     Letter No. 572, it is the sense of the Conferees that the \n     fact the Congress has acknowledged the benefits of more \n     widespread use of lifeline accounts through the enactment of \n     the Bank Enterprise Act did not indicate that Congress \n     intended to override State basic banking laws, or occupy the \n     area of basic banking services to such an extent as to \n     displace State laws, or that the existence of State basic \n     banking laws frustrated the purpose of the Congress.\n\n  The ruling referred to in the conference report has been under review \nby the OCC but has not been changed. Other actions have been taken by \nthe Comptroller since the enactment of Riegle-Neal which have raised \nsimilar concerns. For example, in 1996 the OCC finalized a regulation \nexempting national banks from State laws protecting consumers from high \ncredit card fees.\n  Given these concerns, and the more expansive application the OCC's \nrulings will have as a result of H.R. 1306, it is important for the \nComptroller to report to the Congress annually on its preemption \nactions, if any, and the rationale for the preemptions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Mr. D'Amato, and the distinguished ranking member, Mr. \nSarbanes, for accepting this modification to H.R. 1306, which preserves \nthe right of States to opt out of Federal preemption under provisions \nof the 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control \nAct [DIDA]. With this amendment, the measure retains a key distinction \nbetween DIDA and the National Bank Act by continuing to allow States \nthe right to regulate, except as to national banks, both interest rates \nand noninterest rate terms, such as late charges, over the limit fees, \nand not-sufficient fund fees, and I am pleased to offer this \nmodification.\n  As the former chairman of the Wisconsin Senate Banking Committee, I \nknow the important role of State in this area, and of the contribution \nState regulation makes to the entire banking system. As the interstate \nbanking and branching laws are implemented, it is critical that States \nretain that vital role.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Banking \nCommittee, on which I serve, has come to an agreement on the Riegle-\nNeal clarifications bill. This legislation provides legal certainty for \nbanks and bank supervisors regarding the Riegle-Neal interstate banking \nlaw passed in 1994. The Congress passed the Interstate banking law to \nend the patchwork of laws that had arisen in this area, and to provide \nfor an efficient system for banks to operate in more than one State. It \nwas legislation that was badly needed and long overdue, given the huge \nchanges that have been ongoing in our economy generally, and in the \nfinancial services area, specifically.\n  However, some confusion remains regarding the application of home \nState law versus the application of host State law to a State-chartered \nbank that branches outside its home State. Although the 1994 law \nclearly reserved the areas of intrastate branching, community \nreinvestment, consumer protection, and fair lending for host State \njurisdiction, the extent to which other host State laws applied to an \nout-of-state state chartered bank remained ambiguous. State-chartered \nbanks wanting to expand across State lines have faced legal uncertainty \nabout what law governs their powers outside their home State, and many \nwere contemplating switching to a national charter in order to gain \nthat certainty. This bill, the Riegle-Neal Clarification Act of 1997, \neliminates that ambiguity, ensuring the viability of our dual banking \nsystem by clearly stating that host State law applies to branches of \nState-chartered banks only to the extent that it applies to national \nbank branches.\n  This bill levels the playing field between State-chartered banks and \nnational chartered banks that branch across State lines. It is \nimportant to the preservation of a strong, State-chartered banking \nsystem, which benefits the safety and soundness of the banking system \nas a whole. I wish to commend my colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee who have worked hard on this agreement and I urge swift \npassage of the bill.\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

In \n     developing recommendations, the Commission shall--\n       (A) solicit and analyze information on projected private \n     sector development, including, but not limited to, tourism, \n     manufacturing and industry, agriculture, and transportation \n     and shifting trends based on alternative forecasts of \n     economic, political and social conditions in the Pacific;\n       (B) analyze capital infrastructure, education, social, \n     health, and environmental needs in light of these alternative \n     forecasts;\n       (C) assemble relevant demographic, economic, and revenue \n     and expenditure data from over the past twenty-five years;\n       (D) review the application of federal laws and programs and \n     the effects of such laws and programs on the local economy \n     and make such recommendations for changes in the application \n     as the Commission deems advisable;\n       (E) consider the impact of federal trade and other \n     international agreements, including, but not limited to those \n     related to marine resources, on American Samoa and make such \n     recommendations as may be necessary to minimize or eliminate \n     any adverse effects on the local economy.\n       (2) The recommendations of the Commission shall be \n     transmitted in a report to the President, the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives no later than June 30, 1999.

The \n     report shall also include projections of the need for direct \n     or indirect Federal assistance for operations and \n     infrastructure over the next decade and what additional \n     assistance will be necessary to develop the local economy to \n     a level sufficient to minimize or eliminate the need for \n     direct Federal operational assistance. As part of the report, \n     the Commission shall also include an overview of the history \n     of American Samoa and its relationship to the United States \n     from 1872 with emphasis on those\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n     events or actions that affect future economic development and \n     shall include, as an appendix to its report, copies of the \n     relevant historical documents, including, but not limited to, \n     the Convention of 1899 (commonly referred to as the \n     Tripartite Treaty) and the documents of cession of 1900 and \n     1904.\n       (d) Powers.--\n       (1) The Commission may--\n       (A) hold such hearings, sit and act at such times and \n     places, take such testimony and receive such evidence as it \n     may deem advisable: Provided, That the Commission shall \n     conduct public meetings in Tutuila, Ofu, Olosega, and Tau;\n       (B) use the United States mail in the same manner and upon \n     the same conditions as departments and agencies of the United \n     States; and\n       (C) within available funds, incur such expenses and enter \n     into contracts or agreements for studies and surveys with \n     public and private organizations and transfer funds to \n     Federal agencies to carry out the Commission's functions.\n       (2) Within funds available for the Commission, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall provide such office space, \n     furnishings, equipment, staff, and fiscal and administrative \n     services as the Commission may require.\n       (3) The President, upon request of the Commission, may \n     direct the head of any Federal agency or department to assist \n     the Commission and if so directed such head shall--\n       (A) furnish the Commission to the extent permitted by law \n     and within available appropriations such information as may \n     be necessary for carrying out the functions of the Commission \n     and as may be available to or procurable by such department \n     or agency; and\n       (B) detail to temporary duty with the Commission on a \n     reimbursable basis such personnel within his administrative \n     jurisdiction as the Commission may need or believe to be \n     useful for carrying out its functions, each such detail to be \n     without loss of seniority, pay or other employee status.\n       (e) Chairman.--Subject to general policies that the \n     Commission may adopt, the Chairman of the Commission shall be \n     the chief executive officer of the Commission and shall \n     exercise its executive and administrative powers.

Robert Bernard Flowers\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr, President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nthe nomination of Maj. Gen. Robert Bernard Flowers to be member and \npresident of the Mississippi River Commission. Last Thursday, June 5, \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously reported out \nGeneral Flowers' nomination.\n  General Flowers has an impressive background. He has served in the \nU.S. Army since 1969 and is a registered professional engineer. General \nFlowers presently is the Army Corps of Engineers Division Commander of \nthe Lower Mississippi Valley, which comprises districts headquartered \nin St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg and New Orleans. In his current \nposition, General Flowers oversees the Corps of Engineers' water \nresources program in this 156,000 square mile area of the lower \nMississippi Valley.\n  General Flowers' experience will serve him well in the position \nbefore him. If confirmed as president of the Mississippi River \nCommission, General Flowers will be responsible for the planning and \nimplementation of a program to control and develop the lower \nMississippi Valley. The MRC also is responsible for the management and \noversight of the Mississippi Rivers and Tributaries Project.\n  I might add that General Flowers is no stranger to the flooding and \nissues involved in controlling the Mississippi River. In fact, he was \nunable to join the Committee at his confirmation hearing this past \nMarch because of the urgency of terrible flooding in that area. He is a \ndedicated individual who will continue to be an asset to the \nMississippi River and the Nation alike. Thank you.\n\n\n            Statement on the Nomination of Michael Armstrong\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nthe nomination of Michael Armstrong to be Associate Director of \nMitigation for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The President \nnominated Mr. Armstrong for this position on April 28. Last Thursday, \nJune 9, the Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously \nreported out Mr. Armstrong's nomination.\n  During Mr. Armstrong's confirmation hearing, Senators Campbell, \nAllard, Conrad, and Dorgan, as well as Representatives Skaggs and \nPomeroy, spoke in support of his nomination. In addition, Senator \nDaschle, Governor Romer of Colorado, Governor Racicot of Montana, \nGovernor Janklow of South Dakota, and the Association of State \nFloodplain Managers have written letters of recommendation on Mr. \nArmstrong's behalf.\n  I am pleased to report that Michael Armstrong has an impressive \nbackground that suits him well to the position before him. For the past \n3\\1/2\\ years, he has served as the Director of FEMA Region 8, which \nincludes the States of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, \nUtah, and Wyoming.\n  Mr. Armstrong has done an excellent job as Region 8 director. He has \nassumed tremendous leadership during major disasters, such as the \nrecent floods in North Dakota. Moreover, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\nArmstrong has done a great deal to encourage public outreach and \ncoordination between Federal, State, and local response resources.\n  FEMA is the central agency within the Federal Government responsible \nfor emergency planning, preparedness, mitigation, response, and \nrecovery. The position for which Mr. Armstrong has been nominated, \nAssociate Director of Mitigation, carries out FEMA's policies and \nprograms to eliminate or reduce risks to life and property from natural \nhazards such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes.\n  Federal emergency management has always focused primarily on how to \nrespond to a disaster, after it strikes. We in Congress are no \ndifferent; almost every year, we pass supplemental emergency \nappropriations legislation to pay for the additional, unanticipated \ncosts of timely disasters.\n  FEMA is beginning to place greater emphasis on the mitigation or \nprevention of long-term risks before the disaster strikes. The purpose \nof this shift in focus is hopefully to reduce liabilities and \nultimately to reduce the cost of disaster response. This appears to be \na smart move, and we are all eager to see FEMA succeed in carrying out \nthis initiative.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Armstrong will lead FEMA's efforts in mitigating \nthe risks of natural disasters. This task is not an easy one, but I am \nconfident in Mr. Armstrong's ability to face the challenge ahead.\n\n\n             STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF JAMES A. HARMON\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nthe nomination of James Harmon as President and Chairman of the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States.\n  Mr. Harmon is a life-long resident of New York State. After he was \nborn in New York City, his family moved to Mamaroneck where he was \nraised. After graduating from Brown University and then receiving his \nM.B.A. in finance from the Wharton Graduate School at the University of \nPennsylvania, he returned to New York to launch his professional \ncareer.\n  Currently, Mr. Harmon serves as senior chairman of Schroder Wertheim \n& Co., Inc., an international investment bank headquartered in New York \nCity. Prior to his assumption of the senior chairmanship in 1996, Mr. \nHarmon was the chairman and chief executive officer of Schroder \nWertheim where he oversaw the expansion of the firm's domestic and \ninternational investment banking activities. The merger of Schroder ple \n[UK] and Wertheim in 1985, initiated by Mr. Harmon, created a global \ninvestment bank with approximately 5,000 employees operating in 33 \ncountries around the world. In addition, to his work at Schroder \nWertheim, the finance background which Mr. Harmon would bring to the \nExport-Import Bank was honed during his tenure as a member of the \nAdvisory Committee on International Capital Markets and former chairman \nof the nominating committee of the Board of Governors of the New York \nStock Exchange, Inc.\n  Mr. Harmon's influence in New York City extends beyond banking. In \n1994, along with former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, he founded \nthe Barnard-Columbia University Center for Public Policy where he still \nserves as chairman of its advisory board. Mr. Harmon is also a member \nof the executive committee and board of directors of the New York City \nPartnership, the principal vehicle for private-sector activities which \nimprove the city's economic and social health.\n  I congratulate the distinguished nominee and wish him great good \nwishes and congratulations. I thank the President for bringing Mr. \nHarmon's nomination forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5645-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, recently I spoke just before Mother's Day \nwith reference to what that day meant to me and generally, I think, to \nmost Americans. It is a day that originated in West Virginia. This \ncoming Sunday, June 15, is Father's Day. While I am proud to note the \nmany valuable contributions made by fathers in the raising of our \nprecious future generations, these words are harder for me to speak, \nsince that collective noun ``fathers'' also includes myself. Like, I \nsuspect, most fathers whose jobs necessarily consume much of their time \nand attention, I carry with me both the realization, of which I regret, \nthat I did not spend as much time with my daughters over the years as I \nwould have wished, and the gratitude that my very capable wife was at \nhome to shoulder so much of the effort in the rearing of our children. \nAnd she did a fine, fine job.\n  Over the course of my life, the American family has changed a great \ndeal. More and more fathers are assuming an ever greater role in the \nraising of their children, from the changing of diapers to attending \nparent-teacher conferences. ``Soccer moms'' now share the sidelines--\nand the car pooling--with ``soccer dads.'' Fathers, as well as working \nmothers, have learned the day\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\ncare drop-off and pick-up routine. There are even growing numbers of \nsingle dads taking over the traditional role of mother in addition to \ntheir usual career track, and fathers who have opted to be stay-at-home \nor work-at-home dads in order to become more involved in their \nchildren's lives.\n  When I was a child, children were ``seen but not heard'' by their \nfathers, and no man was considered capable--or interested--in the \ndetails of raising a young child. Indeed, few men would have had any \nidea of how to go about caring for an infant, I suppose. And that is \nwhy I was reared by my aunt and uncle after my own dear mother died in \nmy first year of life. I can understand and even empathize with my \nfather, and I will always be grateful to my Aunt Vlurma and her \nhusband, Titus Dalton Byrd, for the care and the love, the affection, \nthe attention, and the advice that they gave to me. But, naturally, I \nwill always wonder how my life might have been different had I remained \nwithin my own birth family. I remember nothing of my natural mother. I \nwish that I had more memories of time spent with my father and my \nsiblings. I only can recall spending one week during my lifetime with \nmy natural father.\n  But I do well remember a kind and gentle foster father, my aunt's \nhusband, who gave me my name and who encouraged me to study and to draw \npictures and to play a musical instrument, who encouraged me to reach \nfor the stars and to try to attain goals that were far beyond those \nwhich were the norm in our small mining community in southern West \nVirginia.\n  Now, he did not want me to toil in the mines as he did. He encouraged \nme to read. He never bought me a cap buster or cowboy suit. He always \nbought a drawing tablet or a water color set or a violin or a mandolin \nor a guitar. He urged me to play music, urged me to develop my \nabilities.\n  His education probably did not go beyond the second or third grade. \nHe could manage poor handwriting. He could read. And he read the family \nBible. When he left this world, he did not owe any man a penny. In all \nthe years that I lived with him, I never heard him once use God's name \nin vain, I never heard him grumble at what was put on the table before \nhim. And he and my Aunt Vlurma lived together 53 years. I do not recall \never having heard either of them raise a voice in anger against the \nother.\n  He never forgot his little foster son. He always saved something from \nhis lunch for me. He was a coal miner. And I can recall that late in \nthe afternoon I would look up the railroad tracks and watch for him \ncoming down the railroad tracks, carrying his dinner bucket. I would \nrun to meet him. And when I came to him, he would set his dinner bucket \ndown and take the lid off the dinner bucket and reach in and get an \napple or a piece of cake. In those days, cakes could be bought for 5 \ncents at the store--cupcakes, as we called them, some were chocolate, \nsome had coconut icing, and so on. But whatever the cake, he always \nmanaged to save it for me. He never failed.\n  I remember his strong weathered face, his long sturdy hands and his \nkind, thoughtful eyes as clearly as if he had only this morning patted \nme on the head and gone off for another backbreaking day in the mines.\n  He represented strength and security and ageless wisdom to me--it was \na time when things were certain and clear and uncomplicated because he \nwas there to make everything right.\n  As in my own experience, a father's presence looms large in a child's \nlife. A father who sits down to help with homework reinforces the \nimportance of schoolwork. And when a father takes his children to \nworship services, or better yet, leads them in their bedtime prayers, \nhe instills in them the importance of devotion and respect for the \nCreator's role in our daily lives.\n  I am glad that more fathers are taking an interest in their children, \nas a general matter, I think. It is not always the case, by any means. \nBut they are taking an interest in their children beyond the financial \naspect that was all-important during my early days as a father--when I \nwas making $70 a month working as a produce boy, working as a \nmeatcutter, $70 a month--although that is a role that cannot be \nabdicated. Children are a joy and a delight, but they are also a very \nserious lifetime responsibility, both financially and morally. Children \nare not like a job--they cannot be fired, one cannot quit or resign \nfrom the responsibility of being a father, and even declaring moral and \nfinancial bankruptcy does not relieve one of the responsibility for the \nwelfare of the children.\n  So on this Father's Day, as we all remember or honor our fathers--and \nthe scriptures tell us to ``honor thy father and thy mother;'' most of \nus were taught at home, to ``honor thy father and thy mother''--on this \nFather's Day, as we all remember or honor our fathers may we also \ncontemplate the great joy that is fueled by a special dad. The material \nthings which daily drive and obsess so much of American life are only \ntransient. When all is said and done they do not amount to much. So \nmany things that occupy our thoughts and our concerns, most of the \nthings we worry about, of course, never happen, but these things that \nwe generally worry about and that loom so large in our daily lives \nreally, really, are not all that large. Among the things that best \nendure are the love, the values passed on, and the small shared moments \nrecalled with a caring, loving father.\n  May I say that the man who took on the responsibility of rearing me \nfrom the tender age of less than 1 year, I have no doubt that, in \nParadise, he is aware of what I am saying today, and I have no doubt \nthat one day, according to the scriptures' promise, I can meet him \nagain. Jesus was mindful of the Heavenly Father when he taught us to \npray, saying, first of all, ``Our Father who art in heaven.''\n  So let me for a moment, in closing, attempt to recite some lines that \nwere written by someone whose name does not occur to me at the moment, \nbut I think this little bit of verse quite appropriately speaks the \nthoughts of most Americans, as we look forward to Father's Day. I hope \nwe will take a little time on that day to contemplate the sacrifices of \nour fathers and to consider the fact that they had concerns about us \nand loved us.\n\n                            That Dad of Mine\n\n       He's slowing down, as some folks say,\n       With the burden of years from day to day;\n       His brow bears many a furrowed line;\n       He's growing old--that dad of mine.\n\n       His shoulders droop, and his step is slow;\n       And his hair is white, as white as snow;\n       But his kind eyes sparkle with a friendly light;\n       His smile is warm, and his heart is right.\n\n       He's old? Oh, yes. But only in years,\n       For his spirit soars as the sunset nears.\n       And blest I've been, and wealth I've had,\n       In knowing a man like my old dad.\n\n       And proud I am to stand by him,\n       As he stood by me when the way was dim;\n       I've found him worthy and just as fine,\n       A prince of men--that dad of mine.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my attention has just been called to the \nfact that this is the last day in which we will all be blessed by the \nservices rendered to all Senators on both sides of the aisle by these \nwonderful young people who sit on the dais, to our right and to our \nleft, who are the pages. Daniel Webster appointed the first page. \nTomorrow, these pages will graduate. They go to school while they do \nthis work here for us and for our country. They work for our country, \njust as we Senators seek to do our best in serving our country. Without \nthese pages, we would find our work to be more difficult, and we can't \nthank them enough.\n  They get up early and they go to school. They have to continue to \nmaintain good grades while they are doing the Senate's work. And this \nis demanding work. They run here, they run there. They are at the beck \nand call of every Senator all day long.\n  Tennyson said, ``I am a part of all that I have met.'' I hope these \nyoung pages, when they go back to their homes and to their communities\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nthroughout the country, will take with them, as I know they will, a \npart of us, as we will keep with us a part of them.\n  I take occasion to talk with these young people every now and then. I \nhave told them some stories over the days and weeks. I have told them \nthe story of ``The House with the Golden Windows.'' I have told them \nTolstoy's story, ``How Much Land Does a Man Need?'' And then I related \nto them a story that was told by Russell Conwell, one of the early \nChautauqua speakers, which he had related 5,000 times--the story titled \n``Acres of Diamonds.'' And, of course, there have been other stories. \nBut I have found the pages to be so eager--eager to learn, eager to \nserve.\n  I think we can all be proud of our young people. We hear sometimes \nabout the bad apples, and there are a few bad apples around. The \nproblem is, they crowd out our view of the good apples. Most of our \nyoung people are wholesome, fine young people. They are working in the \nschool rooms, the libraries, the laboratories, and seeking to develop \ntheir minds. Perhaps we don't hear as much of them. But they are the \nfuture citizens of this country, the great resource of the country. And \none day, they will be the chemists, the architects, the teachers, the \nministers, the lawyers, the Senators. I know, I have seen that gleam in \ntheir eyes. Some of them are thinking about coming back here already--\nas Senators.\n  I hope that we Senators have conducted ourselves in a way that will \nmake the pages feel proud of us--proud that you have had the honor and \nthe good fortune to serve here, because it is an honor and you have \nbeen fortunate. There are millions of young people throughout this \ncountry who would love to serve as pages in the Senate. So I hope that \nwe have, in some way, inspired you to serve and to want to learn. I \nhope that you will continue to learn. Always seek to excel, to be the \nbest at whatever you are doing. There is always a place for you at the \ntop.\n  Unfortunately, not too many people want to start at the bottom \nanymore. But you should be willing to start at the bottom and seek to \nexcel and to learn. In due time, you will be rewarded. Solon said, ``I \ngrow old in the pursuit of learning.'' So continue to learn all of your \nlives.\n  We praise the great athletes, but no ballgame ever changed the course \nof history. Study math, science, chemistry, physics, read well; and in \ndue time, you will contribute to your community and to your country.\n\n       A careful man I want to be, a little fellow follows me.\n       I do not dare to go astray, for fear he will go the self \n     same way.\n       He thinks that I am good and fine, believes in every word \n     of mine.\n       The base in me he must not see, that little chap that \n     follows me.\n       I must remember as I go, through summer's sun and winter's \n     snow,\n       I am building for the years to be, that little chap that \n     follows me.\n\n  That is the way we feel about you. Most of us, certainly, have \nchildren and grandchildren, and you are somebody's children and \nsomebody's grandchildren, and we know that they are proud of you.\n\n       I took a piece of plastic clay,\n       And idly fashioned it one day.\n       And as my fingers pressed it still,\n       It moved and yielded to my will.\n       I came again when days were past,\n       The bit of clay was hard at last.\n       The form I gave it, it still bore,\n       And I could change that form no more.\n\n       I took a piece of living clay,\n       And gently formed it day by day.\n       And molded with my power and art,\n       A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n       I came again when years were gone,\n       He was a man I looked upon.\n       He still that early impress wore,\n       And I could change him nevermore.\n\n  As I look back across the 80 years of my life, I have lived a full \nlife, and it seems that it was only a little while ago when I was \nyoung, like the boys and girls who are our pages. Even then, I wanted \nto learn all that I could cram into my head, and I wanted to make \nsomething of myself, and to be somebody when I grew up to be a man. I, \ntoo, like you, had dreams of all the future years, of what I would do \nin the days to come.\n\n       Ah, how great it is to believe the dream,\n       As we stand in youth by the starlit stream,\n       But greater still to live life through,\n       And find at the end that the dream is true.\n\n  One thing, finally, I want to leave with you. Always take God with \nyou. I have lived beyond the psalmist's promise.\n\n       The days of our years are threescore years and ten. and if \n     by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their \n     strength, labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we \n     fly away.\n\n  I have lived almost 80 years and I have seen times when I have felt \nGod was near me and listening to me, and you will see those times, too. \nThere will be times in your lives when you will be walking in deep \nvalleys, and you may walk in crowds, but there will be someone closer \nthan the crowd to you. There may be no one else around you, but there \nis someone with whom you can communicate, someone who will share your \ngrief, and someone who will give you strength, someone who will help \nlift you up from under great burdens, and that someone is the Heavenly \nFather. No man is good. We all fall short of the glory of God. But \nthere is a God up there.\n\n  Look at the stars tonight, if the skies are clear, and see God's \nwonderful handiwork. And remember that some of those stars are so far \naway that the light from them has been traveling millions of light-\nyears--millions of light-years, that some of those stars are so large \nthat they would not be able to pass between the Sun and the Earth. The \nSun is 93 million miles away. Yet there are stars so huge that they \ncould not pass between the Earth and the Sun.\n  Napoleon, as he sat listening to the discussions about material \nthings on the deck of a ship one night, pointed upward and said, ``Say \nwhat you wish. Who made all of that?''\n  So you will come across doubters and skeptics and cynics. But you can \ntrust in God. Remember, there are great physicists, great scientists, \nmen and women who have earned degrees from the higher institutions of \nlearning, but they know that there is a hand greater than the hand of \nman that has created the Earth and the universe--the universes. Keep \nyour faith in Him.\n  These are the little random thoughts that I have, as we say goodbye \nto you tomorrow. We will always wish for you these things: work for \nyour hands, a straight path for your feet, sunshine on your windowpane \nin the morning, a song in your treetop at evening, soft rains for your \ngarden, happiness in your hearts, love at your firesides, and God's \nblessings always.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/senate-section/article/S5647-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M., MONDAY, JUNE 16, 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
