I thank the Chaplain again for his prayer. Over the past \nfew days, as we have tried to negotiate in good faith, it has been so \nimportant we try to maintain respect for each other. Yesterday morning \nI had reached the point where I had lost that. But I referred to the \nChaplain's book ``One Quiet Moment,'' and there was a passage in there, \nI believe from Proverbs, that said you must respect your fellow human \nbeings. And I thought about that, and I thought from the unborn child \nin late term, they have a right to respect for human life, or a young \nman in Wyoming who is killed, for whatever horrible motives, they have \na right to respect, and also for strong action against those who caused \nthis problem. So the admonition to negotiate in good faith and have \nrespect for each other has certainly been a source of strength to me \nduring the last 48 hours.\n\n                                                   N O T I C E\n      If the 105th Congress adjourns sine die on or before October 16, 1998, a final issue of the Congressional\n  Record for the 105th Congress will be published on October 28, 1998, in order to permit Members to revise and\n                                              extend their remarks.\n       All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the\n Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, between the hours of\n     10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through October 27.

Mr. President, negotiations are still ongoing with respect \nto the omnibus appropriations bill, but I think I can say that it is in \nits very final stages, and we should have a final conclusion before 2 \no'clock so that all of the drafting can be carried out. I emphasize, \nthough, there are a few minor issues that have not been finally \ncleared, and there are a couple of big issues that are still being \ndebated about exactly what the effective date would be, for instance, \nwith regard to the census issue.\n  I think it is a very important issue. The census is in the \nConstitution. And the Constitution says that the census shall be taken \nby enumeration; that means count, head count. No amount of modern \nmanipulation or technology can replace what the Constitution says. \nTwice Federal courts have ruled 3-0 that the census must be done by \nenumeration.\n  But rather than fight this out on and on and on, I think the logical \norder to do business is, let the Supreme Court rule, which they will do \nin March, and then we will proceed from there. That issue has not been \nfinally resolved, but it will be in the next couple of hours, and then \nevery Senator and House Member will have an opportunity to ask \nquestions, to look at the language.\n  There are hundreds--thousands--of issues that are in this \nlegislation. But the legislation will be available. There will be staff \nand Senators and Congressmen who have been involved, who can answer \nquestions about things as varied as education and agriculture and \ndefense and the drug war and missile defense. It is all in this bill.\n  I must say that while there are some great disappointments on my part \nabout what is not in the bill and some disappointments about some \nthings that are in the bill, on balance this is going to be good for \nAmerica. I had a question a moment ago about who is the winner and who \nis the loser. The only question should be: Is America the winner? Are \nour children going to be better off, safer? Will there be a greater \neffort to fight the scourge of drugs in our schools and in our society? \nThe answer is yes.\n  We will have a stronger defense. For the first time since 1985, we \nhave stopped the free-fall in spending for the necessary readiness and \nequipment for our men and women in uniform. We added some $9 billion in \nthis legislation for the drug war, for defense of our country, for \nintelligence, and for missile defense.\n  We also agreed to $690 million for a greater effort in the drug area. \nWe did agree to the President's request for more funds for education. A \nlot of time has been spent this year in the education area, and we have \nmade some progress. We have a better higher education bill. We are \ngoing to have a stronger vocational education bill. And that is an area \nwhere I think we should put a lot more emphasis.\n  We did improve on some of the programs connected to Head Start, and \nwe are going to have more teachers in our schools in America, smaller \nclass sizes. But the decision of how it is going to be done will be \nmade at the local level in the individual school districts; it will not \nbe dictated by and run by bureaucrats here in Washington, DC. So I \nthink that was a significant achievement on both sides of the issue.\n  I will not go down the list of all the areas in this bill, but when \nyou look at them all and you consider what we have done and what this \ncan lead to next year, I think it is progress, and I hope the Members \nwill believe that they can support it.\n  There will be time for Members to review its content. If a rollcall \nis requested, it is expected to occur at either 10 o'clock in the \nmorning on Friday or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, to accommodate the \nmaximum number of Senators and give them time to review the language \nthat is included in the final agreement. Certainly, we will make \nMembers aware of any specific time for votes, if necessary. I will be \nconsulting with Senator Daschle on that.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and for their cooperation \nthroughout the year.\n  I do have a number of issues that we would like to do in terms of \nsome tributes and resolutions on travel and other issues. So I would \nlike to do that now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12608-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ORDER FOR PRINTING OF INDIVIDUAL SENATE DOCUMENTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I will \nmiss him here but I will be with him in other areas.\n  And, of course, John Glenn makes history once again flying off into \nspace. And many Senators and their spouses will be there to see that \nevent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12608-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ELECTION OF SERGEANT AT ARMS AND DOORKEEPER OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to add one note. I have never seen a \nmore diligent Senator than Senator Thurmond has been in opening the \nSenate. He and Senator Byrd are living institutions. They have \nreverence for this institution. Many times, Senator Thurmond had been \nup late, had committee hearings, had been involved in moving the \nThurmond bill, which was the armed services authorization bill, and had \nworked well into the night for a year. But when the Senate would open \nat 8:30, 9 o'clock, or 9:30, he was in the Chair and always very kind \nto our Chaplain. That exemplifies what the Senate should really be \nlike. So I add my special appreciation to the President pro tempore.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12609-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mack).

Mr. President, we have just heard the Republican majority \nleader outline in brief the negotiations between the White House and \nthe Congress as it relates to a final package of fiscal affairs for \nthis Government for the coming year.\n  Over the course of the last several days, I have had the opportunity \nto attend a variety of those negotiations, and on occasion, based on my \ncertain areas of knowledge, to be consulted as to what directions we \nmight head.\n  I thought for a few moments this morning I would discuss briefly the \nagricultural package, because it is one of those major areas of concern \nand dispute for a period of time up until late last evening--that, of \ncourse, and the educational package that most of our colleagues are now \nbecoming aware of.\n\n[[Page S12610]]\n\n  While the final language on the agricultural package is being put \ntogether, there are some fundamental principles we adhered to that I \nthink are important for our colleagues to understand when they begin to \nexamine this package for their final consideration of it tomorrow.\n  First and foremost, it is important to recognize that this Republican \nCongress back in May and June began to recognize the very critical \nsituation that American agriculture was in and the character of the \ndecline in commodity prices that was evident out there, along with loss \nof foreign markets, that was producing what I consistently called on \nthe floor of this Senate and across my State of Idaho an ``agricultural \ncrisis.''\n  It was in late June that I, along with six other Senators and the \nmajority leader, sat down with about 15 commodity group representatives \nin this community, representing national agricultural commodity groups, \nto examine the crisis from their perspective and to look at a variety \nof things that we might do here within current policy and current \nbudget constraints to deal with the crisis, recognizing that if we \nweren't responsive, we would see many of our farmers on the edge of \nbankruptcy, and potentially by next crop season they would be out of \nproduction. That is not good for America. It is not good for our \neconomic base or for the food-consuming public.\n  Fewer farmers mean larger farmers, usually, or fewer farmers with \nlarger acreages. And in many instances what we find is large \ncorporations buying up smaller production units that find themselves in \nbankruptcy.\n  Consistently we have looked at farm policy recognizing the need to \nkeep farm families intact and a production unit in American agriculture \nthat was sympathetic to the American farm family. So it was with that \nspirit in mind that we met with these commodity groups and came up with \na list of items that we would attempt to be responsive to.\n  First and foremost in the general discussion with that commodity \ngroup was to keep the current farm policy in place, keep the 1996 farm \nbill, better known as Freedom to Farm, in place. It is working. It \ngives farmers greater flexibility to decide what to farm, what to grow, \nand how to deal with market trends. It does so with less Government \ninterference, less opportunity to farm to a Government program instead \nof farm to what the market is demanding, what the consuming market is \ndemanding. That became a premise of operation for us here in the \nSenate--that we would not violate or attempt to go in and offer \ndramatic changes to farm policy.\n  Immediately before the August recess, we responded by reaching out \nand putting more of what we call the AMFTA payments into this year's \ncurrent payment to bump up some money that would go directly back to \nthat farmer and to that production unit.\n  Most of us, of course, in August visited our farmers, and we came \nback clearly with the understanding that we were in a crisis, that the \ncommodity prices were at a 20-year low, many times below the cost of \nproduction, and that the loss of Asian markets, the loss of markets in \nCentral and South America, was also driving this decline in commodity \nprices.\n  There was also a large influx of product coming in from Canada, which \nwas part of a program of opening the borders for the North American \nFree Trade Agreement. And we had to be sensitive to that.\n  But, most importantly, what our farmers were telling us, along with \nthe decline in commodity prices, was that when we had put the 1996 farm \npolicy in place, we had also said at that time there would be other \nthings we would have to do. We would have to review trade policy. We \nwould have to look at the cold war policy coming out of World War II \nthat put sanctions on a variety of countries and basically took 13 to \n20 percent of the world market out of reach of production agriculture \nby one or another sanctions that were built up as a product of foreign \npolicy statements and/or policy laws in this country that we had to \nreview.\n  Most immediate, when we came back in August, was the need to deal \nwith the inability to trade with Pakistan and India based on the \nconfrontation they were having and the nuclear tests they were engaged \nin, which was a direct violation of the nuclear test ban and, of \ncourse, the provisions we had put in there that would disallow us \ntrading with or dealing with countries that were in violation. We were \nable to strike those two sanctions down immediately, which then in a \nnear immediate sense put in play major sales of soft white wheat out of \nthe Pacific Northwest. Those sales have gone forward, and they have \nbeen very helpful to production agriculture nationwide.\n  We also said--and Chairman Lugar, chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, said--we have to look at the overall need to review \nsanctions, the attempted sanctions legislation. There were some \nmodifications in it, but it was not complete. He knows it; we know it.\n  One of our jobs coming back next year will be to take a serious look \nat the post-World War II era sanctions that have taken a large chunk of \nthe world market away from our farmers, because in Freedom to Farm we \nsaid: You are going to be free to farm, and we are going to use the \npolitical clout, the governmental clout, of your country to open up \nthese world markets to assist you. And we would look at another \nprovision.\n  That is the very provision that the negotiations moved toward in the \npast several days. That was a tax component--a tax provision that said \nto production units: You are cyclical by nature. By that I mean, 1-year \ncommodity prices are at an all-time high and the next year they are at \nan all-time low. Those who have ever farmed--and I farmed during my \nother life as a private citizen--know that very well, that some years \nyou make money and in other years you lose a lot of money. It is simply \nbecause of oversupply and then undersupply of certain commodities \nwithin the market.\n  As a result, we had historically said, up to 1986, that tax laws \nshould reflect that you ought to be able to reach back and pull forward \nsome of those losses into a crop year where there are high profits; you \nought to be able to income average those kinds of things out. In 1986 \nwe took that out--or I should say a Democrat Congress took that out--of \nthe tax policy of that year, in my opinion badly handicapping and \ncreating long-term injury to production agriculture. Last year we did \nsome tentative work in that area putting income averaging back.\n  But the package that our colleagues will have a chance to review \ntonight and tomorrow as a final work product of this Congress will have \nmade permanent the permanent income average, which is a key component \nto agriculture. Someone on the other side suggested to us that doesn't \nsolve the immediate problem. No, it doesn't. But we put $5.97 billion \nin to solve the immediate problem directly flowing through to \nproduction agriculture. But what we have to look at is the long-term \ncharacter that we had promised production agriculture when we changed \nthe farm bill. And we do that--permanent income averaging, a 5-year \ncarryback provision allowing farmers to account for, as I expressed a \nmoment ago, the cyclical character or future of production agriculture.\n  Then we went in and did some technical corrections to IRS tax laws, \nbecause, for example, when a farmer is guaranteed a Government payment \nbut the payment doesn't come until a certain time, the Government wants \nto tax you on the payment at the moment that you are eligible for it. \nWe say no; that payment should occur at that time.\n  The bill that is being reviewed now also recognizes the kind of \ndrought that your State of Florida had, Mr. President, and Texas and \nother parts of the southeastern part of the United States, Georgia. And \nthere are $3 billion in there to deal with economic disasters. That \nwill be critically important.\n  Between the payments that were scheduled in the Freedom to Farm 1996 \nfarm policy, along with recognizing the crisis created by loss of \nforeign markets and the typical natural cycling of our environment and \nour weather, we are going to recognize all of that.\n  I will conclude by saying this. We preserve current farm policy \nbecause American agriculture told us they needed that to happen for the \nflexibility of future years. We have also kept some promises that we \nmade in 1996, to begin to look at sanctions and to free\n\n[[Page S12611]]\n\nup opportunity in world markets. And also, most important, the third \npassage dealt with tax--tax law flexibility, so that that production \nunit, that farmer or rancher, can deal with the cyclical character of \nhis or her markets on good years versus bad years. So they pay their \nfair share in taxes but they do not pay taxes one year on substantial \nprofits and then the next year have tremendous losses that put them in \na bind.\n  They used to understand that. That is the way the law used to be. \nWith that flexibility, you kind of store it up in the good years to \noffset your needs in the bad years. That is the way agriculture ought \nto operate, and that is the way our tax laws ought to allow them to \noperate.\n  I thought I would give that synopsis of what we are doing and what I \nthink is important for our taxpayers to understand. Keeping this \ntremendous production unit in our country--known as agriculture--\nhealthy and producing is of critical importance to our country. The \nAmerican consumers today pay less for food than any other item they \nbuy. As a result of that, our consuming public has more spendable \nincome to buy cars, to buy homes, to provide for their children's \neducation. They are not paying 30 percent or 40 percent or 50 percent \nor 60 percent of their income for food. They are paying 13 to 14 \npercent, for the highest quality, safest, richest foods in the world. \nThat is a result of this marvelous production unit we call American \nagriculture.\n  I am proud that this Republican Congress, working with our colleagues \non the other side, represented that understanding in the current policy \nthat is embodied in this omnibus bill with which we will be dealing. It \nis an important area. I am glad our leaders were sensitive to it and \nthat we can turn to agriculture and say: We didn't save you, we didn't \nguarantee you, but we recognize the need to shore up, in those areas of \ndisaster, and to assure that those units of production--and those are \nfamily farms; these are people, men and women and their children who \noftentimes work from daylight to dark--are going to be held as whole as \nwe can possibly keep them at a time when farm commodities, because of \ncertain situations here and around the world, have plummeted to nearly \n25- and 30-year lows.\n  Mr. President, let me run through a few unanimous consent requests \ncleared by both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12609-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACTIVITIES OF THE MICCOSUKEE TRIBE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate agree to the amendment \nof the House-passed bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was proud to cosponsor the Federal Law \nEnforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996 and am again proud to \ncosponsor this bill, S. 1525, the Public Safety Officers Educational \nBenefits Assistance Act of 1998. I am delighted that the Senate is \nfinally sending this important bill to the President's desk for his \nsignature into law.\n  Our legislation extends the educational benefits that we previously \nprovided to the children of federal law enforcement to the families of \nState and local public safety officials who die or are disabled in the \nline of duty. Those families make the ultimate sacrifice for our public \nsafety and deserve our support and assistance. I commend Senator \nSpecter and Senator Biden and all the cosponsors for their work on \nthese measures.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996, known \nas the Degan Act after U.S. Deputy Marshall Bill Degan, who died in the \nRuby Ridge incident in 1992, provides Federal educational assistance to \nfamilies of Federal law enforcement officers\n\n[[Page S12612]]\n\nkilled in the line of duty. It is proper that we expand this \neducational assistance to the families of state and local law \nenforcement officers because most law enforcement needs are met at the \nstate and local level. I would have preferred to send the President the \noriginal text of our legislation since it provided full assistance to \nthese families, but the House of Representatives decided to impose a \nsliding scale means test to our bill.\n  This past May, I called for Congress to pass this legislation during \nNational Police Week and the annual memorial activities for law \nenforcement officers. I believe it would have been a fitting tribute to \nthose who gave their lives in preserving our public safety for Congress \nto enact the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance \nAct, S. 1525; the Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, S. 1985; and \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, S. 1605. Fortunately, \nPresident Clinton signed the Bulletproof Vests Partnership Act and the \nCare for Police Survivors Act into law on June 16, 1998 and now he will \nhave the opportunity to sign into law this third piece of legislation. \nTogether these measures make a significant package of legislation to \nbenefit the families of those who serve in law enforcement.\n  The unfortunate reality of contemporary life is that we may still \nlose upwards of 100 law enforcement officers a year nationwide. I wish \nthere were none and I will keep working to improve the assistance and \nsupport we provide our law enforcement officers. For those families \nthat sacrifice a loved one in the line of duty I support the college \neducation assistance that will be made possible by the Public Safety \nOfficers Educational Benefits Assistance Act. I look forward to the \nPresident signing this important legislation into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12611-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDING THE ORGANIC ACT OF GUAM\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2539) to protect the safety of United States \n     nationals and the interests of the United States at home and \n     abroad, to improve global cooperation and responsiveness to \n     international crime and terrorism, and to more effectively \n     deter international crime and acts of violence.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after months of review and careful \nCommittee action, I am proud that the full Senate is poised to approve \nthe International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998. Along \nwith Senators Leahy, Biden, and others, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhas undertaken a careful review of the ambitious and expansive \ninternational crime package developed by the administration and \nintroduced by President Clinton on May 12. This proposal took the best \nideas developed by the Department of Justice, the Customs Service, the \nTreasury Department, and other federal agencies involved in the fight \nagainst international crime.\n  Senator Leahy and I have worked with the Department to winnow the \nbill down to 17 sections which are generally noncontroversial but would \nprovide valuable assistance in the fight against international crime, \nterrorism, and drug trafficking. Potentially controversial sections \nhave been shelved in an effort to broaden support for the legislation, \nand Senator Leahy supports each of the remaining 17 sections. I hope \nthat next Congress we can undertake a broad review of these issues and \nconfront the more difficult provisions which have been placed aside for \nthe moment.\n  It is clear that the world has become a smaller place, with faster \ntransportation and communication, loosening of borders, and great leaps \nin transnational economic activity. But as these changes have benefited \nlaw-abiding citizens, they have also made it easier for criminals to \nspread their misery and destruction throughout the globe. Whether we \ntalking about drug cartels, arms smugglers, terrorists, or those \ninvolved in economic espionage, international crime is an increasing \nthreat to our national security and well-being.\n  This legislation should not be seen as a comprehensive response to \nthese problems, but rather as a package of moderate technical responses \nto weaknesses in current law that would make a real difference in the \nfight against international crime.

With the \n     expanded role of Federal law enforcement, specifically the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigations, in the investigation of \n     international organized criminal groups, additional \n     legislation is needed to counteract crimes occurring abroad. \n     Statutes now in effect are narrow and generally address these \n     kinds of issues only when they are related to international \n     terrorism matters. This provisions broadens the scope of \n     other current statutes so that they can be of assistance in \n     targeting violent criminal acts committed against U.S. \n     nationals by members of organized criminal groups. The same \n     safeguards are required that have been established in \n     statutes relating to international terrorism, i.e., such a \n     prosecution cannot be brought without the approval of the \n     Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an \n     Assistant Attorney General. In subsection (g), the statute \n     places a monetary limitation in extortion cases, and defines \n     an organized criminal group by reference to the RICO statute. \n     These limitations have been included to preclude any \n     expectation that the United States will devote resources to \n     investigate and prosecute cases which are or primarily local \n     (versus international) impact or those which the foreign \n     nation is adequately addressing.\n\n Section 102. Murder and serious assault of a state or local official \n                       abroad (old section 1002)\n\n       This section provides additional discretionary authority to \n     investigate and prosecute murders and serious assaults of \n     State and local Officials that occur abroad when the State \n     and local officials are involved in a federally-sponsored \n     training or assistance program. As the United States expands \n     its efforts to fight international crime and bring peace and \n     stability to nations the world over, the role of State and \n     local officials--law enforcement, judges, and others--in \n     federally-sponsored training and other forms of assistance \n     programs is also increasing. The scope of these programs is \n     broad, and includes programs designed to bolster law \n     enforcement, promote trade and tourism, and improve \n     education. As with United States military personnel, these \n     officials may become targets of violent acts committed \n     abroad. Insofar as these officials are often involved in \n     training designed to assist a host country in improving its \n     criminal justice system or other public-sector \n     infrastructures, the host country may lack the resources and \n     skills to effectively investigate and prosecute such crimes. \n     Because these officials are acting under the auspices of the \n     Federal Government, the United States has a strong interest \n     in prosecuting those criminals who attack and kill them. As \n     with other provisions of law that allow extraterritorial \n     jurisdiction over crimes, this provision requires that the \n     Attorney General approve any prosecutions under this section.\n\n\n        title ii--strengthening the borders of the united states\n\n     Section 201. Sanctions for failure to heave to, obstructing a \n         lawful boarding, and providing false information (old \n         section 2201)\n       The Coast Guard is authorized to enforce, or assist in the \n     enforcement of, all applicable federal laws on, under, and \n     over the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of \n     the United States (14 U.S.C. Sec. 2). Coast Guard \n     commissioned, warrant, and petty officers are also deemed to \n     be customs officers (14 U.S.C. Sec. 143; 19 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1401). The Coast Guard may board and examine any vessel \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (14 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 89). To carry out this broad grant of authority, \n     statutory sanctions are needed against the master, operator, \n     or person in charge of a vessel who fails to obey the order \n     of a federal law enforcement officer to heave to, or who \n     otherwise obstructs the exercise of law enforcement \n     authority.\n       Under existing law, a civil penalty can be imposed for \n     failure to heave to a vessel upon the command of a customs \n     officer (19 U.S.C. Sec. 1581(d)). However, the penalty only \n     applies to violations involving vessels at those places where \n     a customs officer is authorized to stop and board. In \n     addition, a criminal and civil penalty can be imposed for \n     failure to stop a vessel when hailed by a customs officer or \n     other government authority within 250 miles of the \n     territorial sea of the United States (19 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1590(g)(8)). However, these penalties may be imposed \n     only on vessels caught with prohibited or restricted \n     merchandise. As a last resort, to compel vessels to heave to, \n     the Coast Guard is authorized, after firing warning shots, to \n     fire into and disable a vessel which has failed to stop (14 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 637).\n       Appropriate sanctions are required to facilitate and \n     enhance the Coast Guard's interdiction of vessels smuggling \n     contraband. The Coast Guard requires an intermediate \n     measure--short of firing into a vessel--to compel a vessel to \n     comply with a lawful order to heave to. Without such \n     sanctions drug smugglers can delay or sometimes prevent the \n     legitimate exercise of Coast Guard law enforcement boarding \n     authority.\n       Such sanctions are necessary to address the following \n     scenario. The operator of a vessel fails to heave his vessel \n     to in order to delay a Coast Guard boarding. After a lengthy \n     pursuit, the vessel is finally boarded and no contraband is \n     found. Or the operator of a vessel avoids being boarded by \n     failing to heave his vessel to and fleeing; he eventually \n     enters the territorial waters of a safe haven country. In \n     either case, the vessel may have initially been carrying \n     contraband--which has been jettisoned--or may have been \n     acting as a decoy to divert Coast Guard assets away from \n     other vessels carrying contraband. The use of such tactics by \n     drug smugglers not only thwarts Coast Guard drug law \n     enforcement efforts, but diverts Coast Guard assets from \n     their other missions.\n       Sanctions are also required to deter non-forcible acts of \n     obstruction during a Coast Guard boarding. While forcibly \n     obstructing a federal law enforcement officer is a crime (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 111, 113), no statute provides penalties, \n     criminal or civil, for non-forcible acts of obstruction \n     during a Coast Guard boarding. Such penalties are needed as a \n     deterrent to prevent confrontational situations from \n     escalating from non-physical obstructions of boardings to \n     physical assaults on Coast Guard boarding officers.\n       Sanctions are also required as a means to compel persons on \n     board vessels to provide truthful information regarding the \n     vessel's destination, origin, ownership, registration, \n     nationality, cargo, or crew. False information concerning a \n     vessel's nationality or registration can delay the \n     determination as to whether the United States has \n     jurisdiction over a vessel, or hinder attempts to obtain \n     consent from a foreign country for the United States to \n     exercise jurisdiction. This offers drug smugglers the \n     opportunity to jettison contraband and destroy evidence. \n     Truthful information concerning the vessel's destination, \n     origin, ownership, cargo, or crew facilitates the ability of \n     the boarding team to determine whether the vessel may be \n     engaged in drug smuggling. This information is also important \n     for the successful prosecution of drug smuggling cases.\n       This section addresses these gaps in current United States \n     drug interdiction law and makes several changes to enhance \n     enforcement of federal law involving vessels. Subsection \n     (a)(1) provides that it shall be unlawful for the master, \n     operator, or person in charge of a vessel of the United \n     States, or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States, to fail to obey an order to heave to that vessel on \n     being ordered to do so by an authorized federal law \n     enforcement officer. Paragraph (2) provides that it shall be \n     unlawful for any person on board a vessel of the United \n     States, or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States, to: (1) fail to comply with an order of an authorized \n     federal law enforcement officer in connection with the \n     boarding of the vessel; (2) impede or obstruct a boarding or \n     arrest, or other law enforcement action authorized by any \n     federal law; or (3) provide false information to a federal \n     law enforcement officer during a boarding of a vessel \n     regarding the vessel's destination, origin, ownership, \n     registration, nationality, cargo, or crew. Nothing in this \n     section is a limitation on 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001, which makes \n     it a crime to give a false statement to a government agent.\n       Subsection (b) provides that this section does not limit in \n     any way the preexisting authority of a customs officer under \n     section 581 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or any other provision \n     of law enforced or administered by the Customs Service, or \n     the preexisting authority of any federal law enforcement \n     officer under any law of the United States to order a vessel \n     to heave to. This section is necessary to establish that this \n     statute in no way limits the potential actions of federal law \n     enforcement officers that exist under other statutes.\n       Subsection (c) specifies that a foreign nation may consent \n     or waive objection to the enforcement of United States law by \n     the United States under this section in an international \n     agreement, or, on a case-by-case basis, by radio, telephone, \n     or similar oral or electronic means. Consent or waiver may be \n     proven by certification of the Secretary of State or the \n     Secretary's designee.\n       Subsection (d) defines the terms used in this section, \n     including ``vessel of the United States,'' ``vessel subject \n     to the jurisdiction of the United States;'' to ``heave to;'' \n     and ``Federal law enforcement officer.''\n       Subsection (e) sets forth penalties for violation of this \n     section. Any person who intentionally violates the provisions \n     of this section shall be subject to: (1) imprisonment for not \n     more than five years; and (2) a fine as provided in this \n     title.\n       Subsection (f) authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of a \n     vessel that is used in violation of this section. Existing \n     customs laws and duties shall apply to such seizures and \n     forfeitures. This subsection further provides that any vessel \n     that is used in violation of this section is also liable in \n     rem for any fine or civil penalty imposed under this section. \n     This provision gives added force to the prohibitions \n     contained in the section, and provides additional incentives \n     to would-be portrunners to comply with the law.\n\n\ntitle iii--denying safe haven to international criminals and enhancing \n                      national security responses\n\n    Section 301. Exclusion of persons fleeing prosecution in other \n                      countries (old section 3201)\n\n       This section will add flight to avoid lawful prosecution as \n     an additional ground of inadmissibility under the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act and designate the country seeking to \n     prosecute such individuals as the primary country of \n     deportation. This section will be triggered if the crime for \n     which prosecution is sought is a crime of moral turpitude, \n     other than a purely political offense.\n       Individuals often seek refuge in the United States to avoid \n     prosecution for crimes committed in other countries. \n     Presently, if such persons are detected attempting to enter \n     the United States, the United States must either\n\n[[Page S12614]]\n\n     find some other basis for exclusion (e.g., having been \n     previously convicted of another crime), or embark on lengthy \n     extradition proceedings, assuming there is an applicable \n     extradition treaty, which is not always the case.\n       This section will provide an independent statutory basis to \n     remove persons who enter or attempt to enter the United \n     States for the purpose of avoiding lawful prosecution in \n     another country and to return them to the country seeking \n     their prosecution unless the Attorney General, in his/her \n     discretion, determines that such return would be \n     impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible. An additional \n     ground of removal under INA section 237 is not necessary \n     because such an alien fugitive found in the United States \n     would be removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) as an alien \n     inadmissible at the time of entry or adjustment of status. \n     The provision is intended to reach situations where the \n     person flees after a warrant has been issued or in \n     anticipation of a warrant being issued. Nothing in this \n     proposed new section would alter U.S. obligations to protect \n     bona fide refugees. Persons covered by this section remain \n     eligible to apply for withholding of deportation under INA \n     section 241(b)(3), and asylum under section 208, to the \n     extent those remedies would otherwise be available.\n\n  Section 302. Exclusion of persons involved in racketeering and arms \n                     trafficking (old section 3202)\n\n       This section will provide for inadmissibility of any \n     individual whom a consular officer has reason to believe has \n     or is engaged in certain RICO and arms trafficking offenses, \n     or any criminal activity in a foreign country that would \n     constitute such an offense if committed in the United States, \n     regardless of whether a judgment of conviction has been \n     entered or avoided due to flight, corruption, etc. This \n     section treats serious criminals with the same standard \n     applicable to drug traffickers and will make our ability to \n     exclude aliens involved in such activities less dependent \n     upon our ability to draw inferences about a person's intent \n     to do something illicit in the United States. With only minor \n     exceptions, the RICO offenses referenced constitute crimes \n     involving moral turpitude that are already grounds for \n     exclusion under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       The Provision includes a waiver provision that allows the \n     Attorney General to waive its applicability for offenses \n     other than aggravated felonies. This provision has been added \n     to provide the Attorney General flexibility to waive these \n     provisions in the event that there is a law enforcement, \n     humanitarian or other important national interest justifying \n     such waiver.\n       A part of this section related to spouses and adult \n     children of persons in this category has been removed before \n     Committee consideration.\n\n  Section 303. Clarification of exclusion of persons involved in drug \n                     traffickers (old section 3203)\n\n       This section makes minor changes to the law concerning \n     exclusion of those the Attorney General or a consular officer \n     has reason to believe are or have been an illicit trafficker \n     in controlled substances.\n       A part of this section related to spouses and adult \n     children of persons in this category has been removed before \n     Committee consideration.\n\n   Section 304. Exclusion of persons involved in international alien \n                      smuggling (old section 3204)\n\n       This section will address the problem of excluding \n     international alien smugglers where there is evidence that \n     they have assisted aliens to illegally enter countries other \n     than the United States, but not the United States. Often \n     there is a strong likelihood that such assistance was part of \n     a scheme to illegally bring such aliens into the U.S. or \n     could develop into a scheme to illegally bring such aliens \n     into the U.S., but under current law the alien providing such \n     assistance may not be excludable. This provision will allow \n     consular officers and the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service to find such aliens ineligible for entry into the \n     U.S. when the alien should have known that the illegal entry \n     into another country would have assisted other aliens to \n     enter the U.S. in violation of law.\n\nSection 305. Seizure of assets of persons arrested abroad (old section \n                                 4008)\n\n       This section relates to situations where a person has been \n     arrested in a foreign country and there is a danger that \n     property subject to forfeiture in the United States in \n     connection with the foreign offenses will disappear if it is \n     not immediately restrained. In the case of foreign arrests, \n     it is possible for the property of the arrested person to be \n     transferred out of the United States before U.S. law \n     enforcement officials have received from the foreign country \n     the evidence necessary to support a finding a probable cause \n     for the seizure of the property in accordance with federal \n     law. This situation is most likely to arise in the case of \n     drug traffickers and money launderers whose bank accounts in \n     the United States may be emptied within hours of an arrest by \n     foreign authorities in the Latin America or Europe.\n       To ensure that property subject to forfeiture in such cases \n     is preserved, the new provision provides for the issuance of \n     an ex parte restraining order upon the application of the \n     Attorney General and a statement that the order is needed to \n     preserve the property while evidence supporting probable \n     cause for seizure is obtained. A party whose property is \n     retrained would have a right to a post-restraint hearing in \n     accordance with Rule 65(b), Fed.R. Civ.\n\n Section 306. Administrative summons authority under the Bank Secrecy \n                         Act (old section 4015)\n\n       This section will amend 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5318(b)(1) to expand \n     the situations in which an administrative summons will be \n     sufficient to obtain information from financial institutions \n     subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). At present, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is permitted to examine information \n     maintained at financial institutions under the requirements \n     of the BSA, but is permitted to summon information or \n     individuals only ``in connection with investigations for the \n     purpose of civil enforcement of violations of'' BSA, it \n     regulations, or certain related statutes. BSA policy requires \n     the government to focus on the efficacy of compliance systems \n     rather than attempt to identify particular BSA violations. \n     Restriction of summons authority to investigations for the \n     purpose of civil enforcement of BSA violations could hamper \n     the ability of the Secretary to review the adequacy of \n     compliance systems. In addition to existing civil enforcement \n     authority, this amendment will enable the Secretary to review \n     the adequacy of BSA compliance systems. Subpoena requests \n     will remain subject to the account holder rights specified in \n     the Right to Financial Privacy Act.\n\n   Section 307. Criminal and civil penalties under the International \n            Emergency Economic Powers Act (old section 4018)\n\n       This provision will increase the monetary limits of the \n     civil and criminal penalty authorities provided for in the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). IEEPA \n     currently provides for civil penalties of up to $10,000 per \n     violation of IEEPA prohibitions, and criminal penalties of up \n     to $50,000 per violation for individual and corporations, and \n     imprisonment for up to 10 years per violation by individuals \n     and participating corporate officers. These limitations no \n     longer constitute effective deterrents for flagrant or \n     willful violations of IEEPA and are significantly less than \n     the penalty limitations provided for in the Trading with the \n     Enemy Act for violations of economic sanctions imposed under \n     that statute. The ineffectiveness of the civil penalty cap is \n     particularly apparent in situations where the IEEPA violation \n     relates to transactions (and profits) valued at many times \n     the maximum penalty amount. This section will raise the IEEPA \n     civil penalty authority to $50,000 per violation, and raise \n     the criminal penalty monetary limits to $250,000 per \n     violation for individuals and participating corporate \n     officers, as is provided for criminal offenses generally in \n     18 United States code Sec. 3571(b)(3), and $1 million per \n     violation for corporations.\n\n  Section 308. Attempted violations of the Trading With the Enemy Act \n                           (old section 4019)\n\n       This section will amend the Trading with the Enemy Act \n     (TWEA) to provide that criminal and civil penalties may be \n     imposed not only against any person who violates a license, \n     order, or regulation issued under TWEA, but also against a \n     person who attempts to violate such a license, order, or \n     regulation. last year, Congress added an ``attempt'' \n     provision to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n     (IEEPA), but did not add a similar provision to its companion \n     statute, TWEA. TWEA lacks an attempt provision similar to \n     those found in other export administration statutes, for \n     example, the Export Administration Act. Recent executive \n     orders imposing economic sanctions and regulations \n     implementing such orders typically include language \n     prohibiting attempted violations. Current case law in the \n     federal circuit courts of appeal supports promulgation of \n     regulations prohibiting attempts to violate statutes not \n     explicitly containing attempt language. In spite of these \n     factors, the absence of an attempt provision in TWEA makes \n     prosecution of attempted violations more problematic. to \n     clarify existing law and to insulate prosecutions of \n     attempted violations from any possibility of attack based on \n     the scope of the President's authority, these amendments \n     expressly prohibit attempts to violate TWEA.\n\n\n      title iv--responding to emerging international crime threats\n\n   Section 401. Enhanced authority to investigate computer fraud and \n             attacks on computer systems (old section 5101)\n\n       This section would add certain violations relating to \n     computer crime to the list of serious criminal activity for \n     which 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516 permits court authorized \n     interception of wire, oral, and electronic communications \n     when the rigorous requirements of chapter 119 (including \n     section 2516) are met. Violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030 can \n     include computer fraud and attacks on computer systems, such \n     as those controlling the public telecommunications networks, \n     air traffic control, and the electric power network. In \n     computer attack cases, since the evidence of the crime may \n     lie largely in cyberspace, interceptions of wire and \n     electronic communications may be the primary or only \n     available avenue of investigation. Moreover, in computer \n     cases where the activities originate from a business or \n     university, voicetaps may be the only way to complete the \n     identification of the criminal actually using the terminal \n     involved. The statute limits wiretap authority to \n     investigation of felony offenses.\n\n   Section 402. Jurisdiction over certain financial crimes committed \n                       abroad (old section 5102)\n\n       This section clarifies the extraterritorial jurisdiction of \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 1029 (access device\n\n[[Page S12615]]\n\n     fraud). It expressly recognizes United States jurisdiction \n     over access device fraud--including credit card fraud, debit \n     card fraud and telecommunications fraud--in cases where the \n     fraud causes an effect on an entity within the jurisdiction \n     of the United States, even if the defendant has never \n     physically entered the United States. Such a clarification is \n     of great importance to the United States' ability to protect \n     its financial system. The modern financial system relies \n     substantially on access devices to access and utilize a vast \n     array of accounts and systems, including credit and debit \n     card accounts, accounts in banks and other financial \n     institutions, electronic funds, and telecommunications \n     systems. Increasingly, U.S. financial, corporate and \n     government entities have implemented access device payment \n     systems to conduct transactions reaching billions of dollars \n     per day. The dramatic increase in electronic and computerized \n     access to such systems from outside the United States has \n     enhanced the vulnerabilities of these systems to criminal \n     activities internationally. By recognizing that the United \n     States has the authority to protect its access device systems \n     against both foreign and domestic threats, this section \n     ensures the security and integrity of United States based \n     payment systems in the same way that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 470 \n     ensures the integrity of United States currency. Together, \n     this section and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 470 will enhance the United \n     States' ability to protect its financial system and combat \n     transnational financial crimes that target that system.\n\n\n      title v--promoting global cooperation in the fight against \n                          international crime\n\n   Section 501. Sharing proceeds of joint forfeiture operations with \n            cooperating foreign agencies (old section 6001)\n\n       This proposal provides for expansion of the authorization \n     to share forfeited property with foreign governments that \n     cooperate in federal forfeitures. It was Section 406 of the \n     ``Forfeiture Act of 1996'' which has been previously \n     submitted to Congress. Section 981(i) of Title 18, U.S. Code, \n     authorizes the sharing of forfeited property with foreign \n     governments in certain circumstances. It currently applies to \n     all civil and criminal forfeitures under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 981, 982, which are the forfeiture statutes for \n     most federal offenses in Title 18. Older parallel provisions \n     applicable only to drug cases and Customs cases appear in 21 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 881(e)(1)(E) and 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1616a(c)(2), \n     respectively.\n       The amendment simply extends the existing sharing authority \n     to all other criminal and civil forfeitures, including those \n     undertaken pursuant to RICO, the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Act, the antipornography and gambling laws, \n     and other statutes throughout the United States Code. Because \n     the amendment makes the parallel provisions in the drug and \n     customs statutes unnecessary, Section 881(e) is amended to \n     remove the redundancy.\n\nSection 502. Streamlined procedures for execution of MLAT requests (old \n                             section 6002)\n\n       This section expands the authority of U.S. district courts \n     to execute, or order execution of, foreign requests for \n     assistance in criminal matters made pursuant to mutual legal \n     assistance treaties (MLATs), conventions, and executive \n     agreements such as an ``antitrust mutual assistance \n     agreement'' (see, e.g., 15 U.S.C. Sec. 6201 et seq.). This \n     section applies only when the execution of such a request \n     requires or appears to require the use of compulsory measures \n     in more than one district. On such occasions, this section \n     permits a judge or judge magistrate in any district involved \n     in a multidistrict execution, or in the District of Columbia, \n     to execute the entire request.\n       The U.S. generally relies on 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1782--which \n     authorizes the practice of appointing a ``commissioner'' to \n     execute a foreign request for assistance--to provide the \n     framework for executing foreign requests for assistance, \n     whether made by letter rogatory, letter of request, request \n     pursuant to an MLAT, or other similar form of request. \n     Section 1782 calls for execution of the foreign request in \n     the district where the witness resides or is found, or where \n     the evidence is located. Consequently, the Attorney General--\n     the authority to whom foreign requests in criminal matters \n     are generally sent for execution--often transmits the same \n     request to each district in which a witness or evidence may \n     be located for execution of that portion directly connected \n     to the district.\n       This practice of transmitting a request to each and every \n     district in which assistance requested may be found is \n     inefficient and prone to creating delay. A majority of \n     requests entail execution in multiple districts. Execution of \n     a multiple district request requires substantial coordination \n     by U.S. authorities (e.g., often documents located in \n     different districts must be produced and analyzed before \n     testimony from witnesses located in other districts can be \n     profitably taken) and duplication of efforts by U.S. \n     authorities (e.g., a judge or magistrate judge, prosecutor, \n     and assisting agent or agents in each district must become \n     familiar with and involved in executing the same request). In \n     addition to the profligate expenditure of U.S. resources, the \n     practice often results in delay, rendering the U.S. unable to \n     provide foreign law enforcement authorities, and especially \n     foreign treaty partners, with the level of service that the \n     U.S. would like to receive with respect to U.S. requests. \n     Another problem often encountered with multidistrict requests \n     is that a U.S. Attorney's Office designated to execute a \n     portion of a request is unable to devote the necessary \n     resources at the time requested. If timing is critical, and \n     it often is, execution of the request in a district involved \n     in another aspect of the execution, or in the District of \n     Columbia, is a reasonable solution.\n       This proposal provides an alternative to the current \n     practice of executing foreign requests for assistance only in \n     each and every district in which a witness or evidence is \n     located. Placing authority in a U.S. district court for a \n     district otherwise involved in the execution of a \n     multidistrict request, or in the U.S. District Court for the \n     District of Columbia, should dramatically improve: (1) the \n     efficient use of U.S. resources to execute foreign requests \n     that involve multiple districts, and (2) the execution of \n     requests involving multiple districts in a timely manner.\n       Providing the U.S. District Court for the District of \n     Columbia as an alternative venue also permits the Attorney \n     General, with requests that require substantial allocation of \n     resources or coordination, to provide attorneys to undertake \n     execution in the District of Columbia in conjunction with the \n     United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n       Finally, this proposal recognizes that executing foreign \n     requests in criminal matters by requiring witnesses to appear \n     in different districts from those in which they are located \n     may create some hardships for witnesses, just as it does in \n     domestic criminal investigations and prosecutions where the \n     U.S. prosecutor subpoenas witnesses to appear anywhere in the \n     U.S. (i.e., where in the U.S. the investigation or \n     prosecution is taking place). This proposal contemplates the \n     same possibility of travel to comply with a commissioner's \n     order as in a domestic criminal investigation or prosecution; \n     however, it provides a procedure to balance the hardship \n     against the exigencies of the request. Upon notice to either \n     the court or the commissioner executing the request, the \n     court will decide whether to transfer execution involving the \n     complaining witness to that witness' district by balancing \n     the (1) inconvenience to the witness against the (2) negative \n     impact upon execution of the request.\n\n\n      TITLE VI--STREAMLINING THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF \n                  INTERNATIONAL CRIMES IN U.S. COURTS\n\nSection 601. Reimbursement of state and local law enforcement agencies \n            in international crime cases (old section 7001)\n\n       This proposal authorizes the Attorney General to designate \n     funds to defray unusual expenses incurred by state and local \n     jurisdictions in international extradition cases, including \n     the costs of transporting the fugitive back to the United \n     States and the cost of translating the extradition documents \n     into the language of the foreign state.\n       State and local prosecutors are sometimes forced to abandon \n     efforts to extradite serious offenders who have fled abroad \n     because the prosecutors lack the resources to pay the cost of \n     international extradition. Because extradition in cases \n     involving violent offenders or career criminals is a national \n     priority, this provision would authorize the Attorney General \n     to allocate funds to pay the costs of such extraditions in \n     serious cases if the state or local authorities certify that \n     the financial assistance is needed. The Marshals Service \n     spent about $900,000 last year transporting federal fugitives \n     back to the U.S., and it estimates that transportation of all \n     state and local fugitives could cost twice that amount. The \n     Marshals Service currently retrieves fugitives from abroad \n     for state and local jurisdictions, on a reimbursable basis.\n       This provision is not intended to shift the entire \n     financial burden that may be involved in international cases \n     from states and localities to the federal government. Rather, \n     it provides authority to assist state and localities in \n     meeting extraordinary expenses that could not reasonably be \n     anticipated in the local jurisdiction's ordinary budget \n     process.\n\n Section 602. Facilitating the admission of foreign records in United \n                    States courts (old section 7002)\n\n       This section provides a statutory basis to authenticate and \n     admit into evidence, in federal judicial proceedings, \n     foreign-based records of regularly conducted activity \n     obtained pursuant to official requests. The section expands \n     the extant statutory basis with respect to foreign business \n     records, making records produced in accordance with the \n     statute admissible to civil proceedings (whereas the statute \n     currently authorizes admission only in criminal proceedings). \n     The section also provides an independent statutory basis for \n     foreign official records, treating official records produced \n     in accordance with the statute as admissible in a fashion \n     similar to foreign business records. The section continues to \n     incorporate elements of the Federal Rules of Evidence, \n     especially Rule 803(6), that ensure the reliability of the \n     foreign records and maintains the requirement of a foreign \n     certification or similar certification provided by treaty, \n     convention, or agreement.\n       To make foreign business records admissible in a civil \n     proceeding under Federal Rules of Evidence 803(6) and \n     901(a)(1), a foreign custodian or other qualified witness \n     must give testimony, either by appearing at a proceeding in \n     the U.S. or by providing a deposition taken abroad and \n     introduced at the U.S. proceeding, which testimony or \n     deposition establishes that the foreign business records are \n     authentic (901(a)(1)) and reliable (Rule 803(6)). The United \n     States has no means by which to compel the attendance of a \n     foreign\n\n[[Page S12616]]\n\n     custodian or other qualified foreign witness at a U.S. \n     proceeding to testify. Thus, to adduce the requisite \n     testimony, U.S. authorities must (1) rely on the prospective \n     witness' willingness to voluntarily appear (which is rare and \n     subject to vicissitude) or (2) attempt to depose the witness \n     abroad. The latter process is unduly cumbersome and not \n     available in many situations (e.g., in matters involving tax \n     administration pursuant to tax treaties or agreements). This \n     section provides a streamlined process for making foreign \n     business records admissible without having to rely on the \n     unpredictability of a foreign witness' voluntary travel to \n     the U.S. or the unpredictable and cumbersome process of \n     deposing the witness abroad.\n       Foreign official records include records of birth, vehicle \n     registry, property transfer and liens, foreign business \n     incorporation, and the like. Such records are routinely kept \n     in much the same manner as business records. This section \n     authorizes a single certification for both self-\n     authentication and foundation for an exception to the hearsay \n     rule similar to that currently available for foreign business \n     records. It, likewise, will streamline the process of \n     securing documents admissible in U.S. judicial proceedings \n     while, at the same time, maintaining assurances of \n     reliability.\n\n Section 603. Prohibiting fugitives from benefitting from time served \n                       abroad (old section 7004)\n\n       This proposal is designed so that defendants who become \n     fugitives either by fleeing the United States, or by \n     remaining outside the United States (in the event they are \n     sought based on an assertion of extraterritorial \n     jurisdiction), in order to avoid trial and punishment do not \n     inappropriately benefit from their actions. Because U.S. \n     prison time is now credited to fugitives after their return \n     to the U.S. for the time during which fugitives pursue \n     tactics in foreign countries designed to delay their return \n     and trial in the United States, the current law unwittingly \n     encourages fugitives to file every frivolous challenge to \n     their rendition which is available, in order to delay the \n     case and perhaps weaken the prosecution's case. This proposal \n     is needed because the time consuming and complex nature of \n     the international extradition process which involves foreign \n     sovereigns, foreign legal laws and processes, and foreign \n     languages, typically creates substantially longer delays than \n     the delays that occur in the comparable domestic situation. \n     Nationwide Federal jurisdiction and interstate compacts \n     typically result in the swift rendition of interstate \n     fugitives.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have been able to work with \nthe Senator from Utah to gain passage of this important legislation, \nthe Improvements to International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments \nof 1998. It will give United States law enforcement agencies important \ntools to help them combat international crime.\n  Unfortunately, recent incidents have made amply clear that crime and \nterrorism directed at Americans and American interests abroad are part \nof our modern reality. The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania are just the most recent reminders of how vulnerable American \ncitizens and interests are to terrorist attacks. In a shockingly brutal \nattack, more than 250 men, women and children, were murdered in cold \nblood. Among those 250 victims were 12 of our fellow citizens.\n  With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the \nworld with ease. They can transfer funds with a push of a button, or \nuse computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens \nand businesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans \nhere and abroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to \nchange with it.\n  This bill does exactly that, not with sweeping changes but with \nthoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by \nlaw enforcement. The bill gives tools and protection to investigators \nand prosecutors, while narrowing the room for maneuver that \ninternational criminals and terrorists now enjoy.\n  I initially introduced certain provisions of this bill on April 30, \n1998, in the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in \nPrisons Act of 1998, S. 2011, with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, \nand Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden, \non behalf of the Administration, the International Crime Control Act of \n1998, S. 2303, which contains many of the provisions set forth in this \nbill. Virtually all of the provisions in the bill were included in \nanother major anti-crime bill, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and \nSecure Borders Act of 1998,'' that I introduced on September 16, 1998, \nalong with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, \nLautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and Torricelli.\n  We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete \nimprovements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions \nmay be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law \nenforcement priority.\n  The bill would provide discretionary authority for investigations and \nprosecutions of organized crime groups that kill or threaten violence \nagainst Americans abroad, when in the view of the Attorney General, the \norganized crime group was trying to further its objectives. This should \nnot be viewed as an invitation for American law enforcement officers to \nstart investigating organized crime around the world, but when such \ngroups are targeting Americans abroad for physical violence and the \nAttorney General believes it is necessary, we must act.\n  In addition, the bill would expand current law to criminalize murder \nand other serious crimes committed against state and local officials \nwho are working abroad with federal authorities on joint projects or \noperations. The penalties for murder against such state or local \nofficials, who are acting abroad under the auspices of the federal \ngovernment, are the same as for federal officers, under section 1119 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, and would therefore authorize imposition \nof the death penalty. While I oppose the death penalty, there is no \nreason to distinguish the penalties for murder of federal versus non-\nfederal officials, who are both acting under the auspices of the \nFederal Government.\n  Also, the authority of the Attorney General to bring such \nprosecutions is limited so as not to interfere with the criminal \njurisdiction of the foreign nation where the murder occurred. Thus, I \nwould expect this authority to be exercised only in the rare \ncircumstance in which the Attorney General believes the foreign country \nis not adequately addressing the crime.\n  The bill contains provisions to protect our maritime borders by \nproviding realistic sanctions for vessels that fail to ``heave to'' or \notherwise obstruct the Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able \nto stall or resist Coast Guard commands with impunity. The additional \nsanctions for resisting ``heave to'' orders and for lying to law \nenforcement officers about a boat's destination, origin and other \npertinent matters, will help the Coast Guard in its efforts to \ninterdict illegal drugs and other contraband.\n  The bill also provides specific authority to exclude from entry into \nour country international criminals and terrorists, including those \nengaged in flight to avoid foreign prosecution, alien smuggling, or \narms or drug trafficking under specific circumstances. At the same \ntime, we ensure that the Attorney General has full authority to make \nexceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons.\n  The bill includes important money laundering provisions strongly \nsupported by law enforcement. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing \non anti-terrorism, FBI Director Louis Freeh noted the importance of \nmoney laundering laws as a tool in stopping not only international drug \nkingpins, but also international terrorists, such as Usama bin Laden, \nthe multi-millionaire terrorist who has been linked to the recent \nembassy bombings.\n  The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it \nprovides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover \ncomputer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over \naccess device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, \nwhere the victim of the fraud is within our borders.\n  We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, \nhowever. This bill facilitates such cooperation by allowing our country \nto share the proceeds of joint forfeiture operations, to encourage \nparticipation by foreign countries. It streamlines procedures for \nexecuting MLAT requests that apply to multiple judicial districts. \nFurthermore, the bill addresses the essential but often overlooked role \nof state and local law enforcement in combating international crime, \nand authorizes reimbursement of state and local authorities for their \ncooperation in international crime cases. The bill helps our \nprosecutors in international crime cases by facilitating the admission \nof foreign records in U.S. courts. Finally, it will speed the wheels of \njustice by prohibiting international criminals from being credited\n\n[[Page S12617]]\n\nwith any time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face \ncharges in our country.\n  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. \nThey are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. \nWorking together, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will \naccomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure \nplace.\n  Finally, I would like to address the encryption amendment that \nSenator Kyl offered and then withdrew during Committee consideration of \nthis bill. This amendment would have criminalized the use of encryption \nin the commission of any federal felony.\n  Unlike analogous provisions incorporated into pending encryption \nbills, the Kyl amendment was not limited in any way to the criminal use \nof encryption ``for the purpose of avoiding detection by law \nenforcement agencies or prosecution'', as reflected in the SAFE bill, \nH.R. 695, or ``with the intent to conceal that communication or \ninformation for the purpose of avoiding detection by a law enforcement \nagency or prosecutor,'' as reflected in the Ashcroft-Leahy E-PRIVACY \nbill, S. 2067. The scope of the offered Kyl amendment raised concerns \nabout inviting government over-reaching. There is no requirement in the \namendment, for example, that a conviction for use of encryption be \npredicated on a conviction of any underlying criminal offense.\n  Moreover, were this amendment to become law, it could chill even the \nroutine use of encryption in the course of every day business, such as \ncommunications between clients and lawyers or accountants, since the \nmere use of encryption could result in exposure to substantial criminal \npenalties of up to five years in prison.\n\n  In addition, as I noted during the committee's discussion of the \namendment, the definition of encryption in the offered Kyl amendment \nvaried greatly from definitions used in pending legislation, including \nbills I have introduced and cosponsored, that have been thoroughly \nvetted with encryption and other technical exports. The Kyl amendment \ndefinition of ``encryption'' is drafted so broadly that it could apply \nto any transformation of analog to digital communications, without any \nuse of mathematical algorithms commonly associated with encryption. We \ncan and should do better if we are going to add a definition of this \nhighly technical operation to the criminal code for the first time.\n  I appreciate the chairman's efforts, and Senator Kyl's willingness, \nto address this issue in a considered fashion in the next Congress.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have long been concerned about helping law \nenforcement have the tools necessary to deal with changing \ntechnologies, and at the same time provide procedural safeguards to \nprotect privacy and other important constitutional rights of American \ncitizens. That is why I sponsored, among other laws, the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act in 1986 and the Communications Assistance \nfor Law Enforcement Act in 1994, and worked with Senator Kyl and \nChairman Hatch on passage of the National Information Infrastructure \nProtection Act in 1996 and, most recently, on identity theft \nlegislation.\n  When it comes to encryption, I fully appreciate the challenge such \ntechnology poses for law enforcement officers, who may increasingly \nfind that the communications they capture during court authorized \nelectronic surveillance is unintelligible because it is scrambled with \nencryption technology. In the last Congress, I introduced legislation, \nS. 1587, that contained a provision to criminalize the use of \nencryption to obstruct justice. Again, in this Congress, I have \nintroduced a bill with such a provision, S. 376, and cosponsored with \nSenator Ashcroft yet another bill, S. 2067, that contains a criminal \npenalty for the willful use of encryption to conceal incriminating \ncommunications or information. Thus, taking the step of creating a new \ncrime to address the criminal use of encryption is not a new idea to \nme.\n  I remain frustrated that sound encryption legislation was not enacted \nthis year, particularly since this technology is such an effective \ncrime prevention tool. The longer we go without addressing encryption \npolicy in a comprehensive fashion, the longer our computer information, \nnetworks and critical infrastructures remain vulnerable to cyber-\nattacks and theft.\n  I encourage the FBI to continue working with industry to try to \ndefine some cooperative efforts to facilitate court ordered access to \nencrypted files and communications. But the job of Congress is to \nensure that procedural safeguards are in place to guide such \ncooperation in ways that comport with our Constitution. I look forward \nto working with Senator Kyl, as we have successfully in the past on \ntechnology issues, and with other members, on comprehensive encryption \nlegislation that addresses both the criminal use of encryption as well \nas policy changes to promote the widespread use of encryption as a \nshield against cyber-crime.\n\n\n                  criminalizing the use of encryption\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am concerned over our inability to advance \ngood policy on encryption this Congress. The Senate has held many \nhearings on encryption, and there have been a number of bills \nintroduced, with nothing concrete to show for it. What these bills have \nin common is an approach that would fold all aspects of national policy \non encryption into one legislative vehicle. That has been a recipe for \ngridlock.\n  Meanwhile, terrorist and criminals and drug lords are increasingly \nusing encryption to hide their acts from law enforcement investigators. \nThis already serious problem will continue to worsen unless we find \nsome way to level the playing field.\n  In committee, I offered an amendment I believed to be \nnoncontroversial. It would criminalize the use of encryption in \nfurtherance of a crime. It echoes language that appeared in each and \nevery encryption bill introduced this Congress. And yet, it was \nrejected by some Members because it did not address other aspects of \nencryption policy. We need to get beyond this all-or-nothing approach.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am generally supportive of the concept embodied in the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona which was discussed in \ncommittee, and I regret that it was not possible to work out acceptable \nlanguage to include in this bill. Next Congress, I believe the \nJudiciary Committee should take up the challenge of reviewing this \nNation's encryption policies and ensure that law enforcement agencies \ncan continue to fulfill their critical responsibilities. This review \nwill include a hearing to consider the FBI's proposed Technical Support \nCenter, in order to evaluate its potential for solving some of law \nenforcement's access concerns. I pledge my support to help enact \nlegislation to address the use of encryption in furtherance of a \nfelony.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2539) was read the third time and passed as follows:\n\n                                S. 2536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the crews of the\n\n[[Page S12621]]\n\nUnited States Navy destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 61 who participated \nin the July 22, 1945 surface naval engagement in Tokyo Bay. That night, \nthe squadron detached from Admiral Halsey's Task Group 38.1, avoided a \ntyphoon, and steamed towards the Japanese mainland. The alert sailors \nof the squadron identified radar contacts that turned out to be a four-\nship Japanese convoy. The squadron commander maneuvered his destroyers \non various courses and attacked the convoy with gunfire and torpedoes. \nAt the conclusion of the daring surface engagement, two enemy ships had \nbeen sunk, one probably sunk, and one damaged. United States forces \nsuffered neither damage nor casualties. The nine destroyers of the \nsquadron were: U.S.S. DeHaven, U.S.S. Mansfield, U.S.S. Swenson, U.S.S. \nCollett, U.S.S. Maddox, U.S.S. Blue, U.S.S. Brush, U.S.S. Taussig, and \nU.S.S. Moore. The sailors who manned those destroyers during this \nunprecedented operation are deserving of this nation's deepest \ngratitude, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in this small act \nof recognition.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statement relating thereto be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have just learned that the Federal \nReserve Board has moved to reduce interest rates by a quarter of a \npoint. The irony for me is that about an hour ago, I came to the floor \nto give a speech to urge the Federal Reserve Board to take action to \nreduce interest rates. I left my office to come here, and just when I \narrived, the Chair had left for the press informational meeting.\n  I do not know exactly when the Federal Reserve Board acted, but I was \ngoing to urge them to take such action because of the growing financial \ncrisis we see around the world. I noted in the speech that I intended \nto give about an hour ago, urging the Federal Reserve Board to take \nthis action, that recently Newsweek magazine had a cover story entitled \n``The Crash of 1999: It Doesn't Have to Happen.''\n  I also noted that yesterday in the Wall Street Journal there was an \nopinion piece by Robert Eisner entitled ``Act Now to Prevent a \nRecession,'' and a news story also in yesterday's Wall Street Journal \nindicating that ``Asia Waits in Vain for Money to Return.''\n  Mr. President, the point that is critically important to understand \nis that we cannot be an island unto ourselves. I noted with interest \nthe statement of Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, on \nSeptember 23, 1998, when he said:\n\n       It is not credible that the United States, or for that \n     matter Europe, can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected \n     by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.\n\n  It seems very clear the United States is being affected. We have seen \ngrowth in the second quarter of 1998 drop to 1.6 percent--down from 5.5 \npercent in the first quarter. And if corporate profits sag, the \nbusiness investment which has accounted for nearly a third of our \ngrowth over the last 4 years could decline.\n  Most importantly, the world economic situation is deeply troubling. \nIf we look at what has happened in world stock markets, going back to \nSeptember of last year and then looking forward to August of this year, \nonly the United States has been holding up. We have seen dramatic \ndeclines in Japan, in Hong Kong, and, of course, a virtual collapse in \nRussia.\n  Earlier this summer, I was at a meeting with the Russians in Europe. \nAt that meeting, I met with the top people of their economics institute \nwho went through the actual numbers, the financial numbers, for Russia. \nAnd I must say, I left there increasingly alarmed. Frankly, Russia is \nin much deeper trouble than I think is commonly understood. They \nexplained to me that they have at the national level about $3 billion a \nmonth of income--$3 billion. They have about $5 billion of fixed \nexpenses.\n  Mr. President, they have short-term debt due by the end of this year \nof $41 billion. They are in deep trouble. They are engaged in a giant \nPonzi scheme of taking in money from outside and paying those that they \nare under the most pressure to pay. None of it adds up.\n  This financial collapse in Russia, coupled with the Asian financial \nsituation, threatens not only most of the developing world but it also \ncan certainly have a dramatic effect on economic growth here at home. \nThat is why I believe it is imperative that the United States take \naction, specifically with regard to the Federal Reserve Board reducing \ninterest rates to give an additional lift to this economy.\n  I am very pleased that the Federal Reserve Board took action today to \nreduce rates a quarter of 1 percent. But I\n\n[[Page S12622]]\n\nthink it is going to take more than that to get us through this crisis, \nto prevent a recession from hitting America.\n  Total U.S. export volume has fallen nearly 6 percent this year, a \nvery sharp reversal over the steady export increases in the preceding 6 \nyears. In addition, the dollar value of our exports to Asia has dropped \n13 percent this year while our trade deficit with Asia is projected to \nincrease by nearly $50 billion from last year.\n  Prices received by U.S. exporters, including our farmers, have \nfallen. I represent a farm State, perhaps the most agricultural or \ncertainly one of the most agricultural States in our Nation. I can tell \nyou, we are already in a deep recession because of collapsing commodity \nprices. Those prices are at a 52-year low, adjusted for inflation. So \nin real terms, the prices our farmers are getting are at a 52-year low. \nNo wonder we have just had to pass a $6 billion rescue package.\n  In addition, I think it is important to understand that one of the \nkey reasons the Federal Reserve Board has been reluctant to reduce \ninterest rates is because they are concerned about inflation. Well, I \ndo not think inflation is the threat. There currently is virtually no \ninflation in the U.S. economy.\n  Over the last 12 months, consumer prices are up less than 2 percent; \nin fact, they are up about 1.7 percent. Producer prices are actually \ndeclining. We are actually experiencing deflation in producer prices. \nAnd at that very moment, the real Federal funds rate is at a very high \nlevel. The real rate is at about 4 percent. Historically, if we look at \nthe record, the real Federal funds rate is about 2 percent. So the real \nrate we are paying for interest on money today is about double the \nhistorical rate.\n  Mr. President, that could be understood if we were facing an \ninflationary threat. But I believe, and I think the evidence suggests, \nthat the greatest threat we are facing is a threat of recession. That \nis why I am very pleased the Federal Reserve acted today to reduce \nrates an additional one-quarter of 1 percent. I was disappointed when, \nat their last meeting, they did not cut more aggressively. And I hope \nthey do not stop here. Further easing of interest rates is going to be \nnecessary to avoid a very serious economic slowdown not only here but \naround the rest of the world.\n  If you look at economic history, when other countries are slowing \ndown--and we have seen dramatic slowdowns in much of Asia, in Russia, \nand now we are seeing the creeping effect of that slowdown in Central \nAmerica, in Latin America, and South America--the only way to prevent \nthis all from leading to recession here at home is to give a lift to \nthe economy. And the best and simplest and most direct way to give a \nlift to this economy is to lower interest rates.\n  As I have indicated, the real rate of interest in this country is at \nabout double the historical rate. So certainly there is room for \nadditional easing to avoid recession here and to help lift the rest of \nthe world out of economic slowdown--in some cases a recession, in some \ncases potentially much worse than that.\n  Mr. President, lower interest rates will expand consumer buying \npower, provide an important stimulus to the U.S. economy, and help \nrestore consumer confidence, which has dropped markedly since the \nbeginning of the year. Businesses, of course, will also be paying less \nin interest costs, which will help to sustain profits and to encourage \ncontinued strong business investment. Finally, lower interest rates \nwill make other investments in troubled economies more attractive, \nhelping to stem capital outflows from those countries that are so \ndeeply troubled.\n  Additional interest rate cuts will send important psychological \nreassurance to world markets and to American consumers and businesses. \nCutting interest rates is, I believe, a prudent insurance policy \nagainst the threat of recession here at home and a deepening recession \nabroad.\n  The Federal Reserve Board should be commended for taking action \ntoday. And I would urge them to be prepared to take further action to \navoid the kind of slowdown in this country that will only make world \nrecovery that much more difficult.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12621-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12622-S12624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also want to note that we have now had a \nbudget agreement. I just heard the announcement of our colleagues that \nwe have reached a conclusion. I know there are details still to be \nsorted out, but this is good news. But I must say, I do not think we \nare ending on a proud note. We are going to wind up with eight \nappropriations bills grouped together in one omnibus package.\n  That isn't the way we ought to do business here. And, frankly, this \nsituation with omnibus appropriations bills has been getting worse \nevery year. Five bills were grouped together 3 years ago; six bills \nwere grouped together two years ago; and now eight bills will be \ngrouped together this year. This is not the way we ought to conduct \nourselves. And I think there was a failure this year, a failure for the \nfirst time in 24 years, with no budget resolution. The budget \nresolution, after all, is the blueprint that guides us in the \nappropriations process.\n\n  I think there was a substantial failure this year, the first time \nsince we have had a Budget Act, a failure to achieve a budget \nresolution. That slowed the appropriations process and left us in this \nposture of having to group all of these bills together--which comprise \na third of all federal spending--and pass them, perhaps in a vote that \nwon't even be a recorded rollcall vote. It is a sorry spectacle and one \nwhich I think brings dishonor to this Chamber.\n  I hope very much we find a way to avoid this practice in the future. \nI hope very much that next year we would have a budget resolution, we \nwould have it on time, or close to on time. After all, the budget \nresolution was supposed to have been done April 15. For the first time \nin 24 years we did not have a budget resolution. In addition, we missed \nthe deadlines, although that has happened often, but always before we \nhave achieved a budget resolution. This year, for the first time in 24 \nyears, there was none.\n  I remember very well President Reagan said in his 1987 State of the \nUnion Message that we should never again have a continuing resolution \nthat had multiple appropriations bills all stacked together. In his \nbudget message in February of 1988 he said very clearly to Congress, \n``Don't do this anymore. Don't do it again. It is wrong.'' Yet here we \nare, falling back into these old ways. It is unfortunate.\n  With respect to this agreement, I think it is also important to say \nthat the surplus has, by and large, been preserved. There are emergency \nspending measures, that Congress and its Leadership must designate as \n``emergencies.'' I think one could question whether all of them really \nconstitute emergencies, but, by and large, they are emergencies. The \nagriculture emergency, certainly that is an emergency response; the \nspending for the embassies that were destroyed by terrorist attack, \ncertainly that constitutes emergency spending; much of the spending \nthat is in the defense bill constitutes emergency spending.\n  Those items, under our own budget rules, are considered outside the \nnormal budget process. We have avoided what some were advocating--a \nvery massive multi-year tax reduction, which would have come directly \nfrom the Social Security surplus. I think that would have been a \nprofound mistake. I, for one, believe the American people deserve a tax \ncut, but I don't think it should come from raiding Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  Some of the language we use in this town is somewhat misleading. We \nsay that there is a $70 billion surplus on a unified basis. That means \nwhen you put all of the revenue of the Federal Government in the pot \nand all of the spending of the Federal Government into the same pot, we \nhave $70 billion more in terms of revenue than we have in terms of \nspending. But it is important to remember that is counting the Social \nSecurity funds. This year Social Security is running a $105 billion \nsurplus. If we put the Social Security money aside--which we should \ndo--we would still be running a budget deficit of $35 billion.\n  Until and unless that operating deficit is ended--and we now project \nthat will end in 2002, and we won't be using any Social Security \nsurpluses in that year, and we will actually balance on what I consider \na true basis--until that is achieved, I don't believe it is appropriate \nto have new nonemergency\n\n[[Page S12623]]\n\nspending or to have unpaid-for tax cuts. If we are going to have new \nspending that is nonemergency spending, it ought to be paid for. If we \nare going to have tax reductions, they ought to be paid for. New \nspending and new tax breaks should not be paid for by taking it from \nthe Social Security surplus. That is truly robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  I am pleased that other than the emergency spending, we don't have \nnew spending that is not offset by cuts in other spending. I am also \npleased that we didn't embark on a risky tax cut scheme that would have \nbeen paid for, in whole, out of Social Security surpluses. I believe \nthat would have been irresponsible.\n  I am remiss if I do not end on a note on agriculture. As I indicated, \nagriculture is critically important to my State. North Dakota has 40 \npercent of its State's income, 40 percent of its State's economy, based \non agriculture. North Dakota, like many agricultural States, is in deep \ntrouble. From 1996 to 1997, we saw farm income decline 98 percent. That \nis a disaster. That is an emergency by any definition. It is the result \nof a combination of the lowest prices in 52 years, coupled with natural \ndisasters that have spread the disease called scab through our fields \nwhich have reduced production, coupled with bad policy. Frankly, it is \na trade policy that allows unfairly traded Canadian grain to sweep into \nour country, displacing our own grain, reducing our own prices, putting \nenormous pressure on our farm producers.\n  In the midst of all of this, our chief competitors, the Canadians and \nthe Europeans, are spending 10 times as much as we are to support their \nfarm producers. They are spending nearly $50 billion a year while we \nare spending, under the new farm bill, about $5 billion a year.\n  Those are the pressures that our producers are under. It is an \nemergency. It is a disaster. I am very pleased that we have responded \nwith a $6 billion package. I want to be swift to say that is not \nenough. The pain felt by farm families and the hole in income in farm \ncountry is so deep that even $6 billion won't fill it, but it will \ncertainly help. We have come a long way from the moment in July that I \noffered on this floor a $500 million indemnity payment plan for those \nareas devastated by natural disaster.\n  I say a special thanks to my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who \ncosponsored that amendment, and to Senator Craig, of Idaho, who is on \nthe floor, who gave great help and support to us in that effort and who \nhas played a leading role in trying to win greater support as the need \nincreased, as natural disasters spread from our part of the country to \nother parts. We saw later this year drought conditions in Oklahoma, \nTexas and Louisiana, and hurricanes that affected much of the coastal \nareas of the southeastern United States. It started in our part of the \ncountry but it spread. That required a greater response. Again, I thank \nmy colleague, Senator Craig, for the very constructive role that he \nplayed in assisting us to get a much stronger, more robust package of \ndisaster assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank my colleague from North Dakota for those kind \nwords. While he and I might disagree on policy as it relates to how we \nrespond to American agriculture, we did not disagree and we do not \ndisagree on the need. There are consequences if we fail to respond to \nthat need at a time when markets are being taken away from production \nagriculture in this country. We have seen dramatic declines in \ncommodity prices across the board.\n  He and I agree on Canadian trade policy. We are very frustrated by \nwhat appears to be a one-way flow of commodities out of Canada with \nvery little moving from our side into Canada; and when it attempts to \nmove, finding all kinds of restrictions.\n  I must tell the Senator from North Dakota I have been very frustrated \nwith this administration, that they have not taken a more aggressive \nrole in trying to determine why those differences have come about and \nresponding to them. Thanks to our Governors, collectively, and our \nurging, the administration is now making some response in that area. I \nhope it is very, very productive.\n  Canadians need to understand that under the North American Free Trade \nAgreement it is not a one-way street, nor should it be.\n  I would agree also with my colleague from North Dakota as it relates \nto the response by the chairman of the Federal Reserve today. We \nprobably would not differ on our concern over the analysis of the \ncurrent world economic situation. I hope that our economy will respond \nto lower interest rates, but I must say that our economy also responds \nto tax cuts. Our economy also responds when consumers are having to pay \nless to their Federal Government and are allowed more of their own \nhard-earned money to stay in their pockets.\n  But this administration was adamant this year, and we were unable to \neffectively respond to what I thought, and others thought, was a need \nfor a reasonable tax cut in certain areas. There is an interesting \nanalysis that we have just done as it relates to the obstructive nature \nof policy used on the floor of the Senate this year by our colleagues \non the other side. In the last four years, the need for cloture--that \nis a term used here in a procedural effort to shut down a filibuster \neffort so that we can proceed to deal with a bill--had to be used four \ntimes more than in the preceding years under a Democrat-controlled \nSenate. In other words, there was a concerted effort this year by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to simply stop the process, \nto slow it down, to force cloture, to seek endless debates.\n  So it becomes very frustrating when you are trying to do the business \nof the citizens, to move a timely budget process, a timely \nappropriations process that requires the necessary voting on 13 \ndifferent appropriations bills to fund Government, to get it done when, \nday after day, debate is made on issues that are not relevant to the \nprocedure and, in some instances, not relevant to the policy at hand. \nBut that is a tactic that can be used and is legitimate before the \nSenate. I am not denying its legitimacy; I am denying the \nrepetitiveness in which it was used as compared to the prior four years \nunder a Democrat Senate, with George Mitchell as leader of the U.S. \nSenate. There has been nearly a four times greater need to file cloture \nso as to move the process forward. In other words, was there a directed \neffort to slow down the Congress, to slow down the Senate this year? I \nthink the statistics and the history will clearly demonstrate that is \nthe case.\n  Be that as it may, it was important that we ultimately finish our \nwork and that we adjourn. We are now on the eve of an adjournment \nbecause our work is done. We now have completed the appropriations \nprocess. We have done so in a way that dealt with the needs of this \nadministration and the balance of power that, by Constitution, must and \ndoes occur in our Government. I will tell you that the end product \nisn't all that I would like, and there is a lot in it that I don't care \nfor. But that is not unusual in any process where compromise is \nnecessary to produce a final product.\n  So I am pleased to say that that final product has been produced, \nthat our majority leader labored mightily with the speaker, with \nrepresentatives from the administration, and with representatives of \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle to resolve this issue. \nShould it have been done here on the floor in open debate? Yes. If we \nhadn't had to file over 100 cloture motions in the last four years, the \nprocess would have been much different. But that is the character of \nthe Senate itself, and those are the rules under which we operate. \nHaving to deal with those rules and the obstructive nature that can be \napplied to the process, I think we can declare a successful session. I \nhope that is the case in the end.\n  Is the surplus produced by a balanced budget, which Republicans are \nproud of, intact? Yes, it is, by a very large amount. But it is also \nimportant to say that we never argued in the first place that all of \nthe surplus would be held intact, and that it must be guaranteed to \nSocial Security. That was a marker the President laid down. And while \nwe agreed with him that there was adequate money in the surplus to \nreform Social Security for present and future purposes, it was the \nPresident that laid that marker down and, just in the last 48 hours, \nhas tried to redefine what he\n\n[[Page S12624]]\n\nmeant by the marker. I am sorry, Mr. President, ``is'' is. Let me \nrepeat that for the President. Mr. President, ``is'' is. We don't need \nto redefine it. We explain it. We totally understand it. We know what \nyou said in your budget statement. All of the surplus went to Social \nSecurity, except you wanted about $20 billion of it to go somewhere \nelse without getting blamed for it, and were simply saying that the \nargument is much different. We have used a very limited amount of \nmoneys that we had not appropriated that could arguably be called \nsurplus.\n  But the surplus is intact. The budget is balanced. There is adequate \nmoney to begin what I think is a generational opportunity to not only \nassure and guarantee Social Security in the outyears beyond 2020 but, \nmost importantly, to guarantee that it is done in a way so that our \nchildren and our grandchildren will not have to pay excessively to get \na reasonable return on a guaranteed retirement annuity as Social \nSecurity has become. Those are the issues that we will deal with in a \nnew Congress, and those are issues that are going to be paramount to \nthe strength and stability of our country, and to the well-being of our \ncitizens. I hope that we will deal with them in a reasonable and \nbipartisan fashion, because the correct solution to Social Security \nmust be bipartisan by its nature and by its definition, and I am sure \nthat we can accomplish that.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12622-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3828\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the definition of ``money laundering and related \n                          financial crimes'')\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senators Grassley and D'Amato have an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig), for Mr. Grassley, for \n     himself and Mr. D'Amato, proposes an amendment numbered 3828.\n       On page 2, strike line 21 and all that follows through page \n     3, line 3 and insert the following:\n       ``(2) Money laundering and related financial crime.--The \n     term `money laundering and related financial crime'--\n       ``(A) means the movement of illicit cash or cash equivalent \n     proceeds into, out of, or through the United States, or into, \n     out of, or through United States financial institutions, as \n     defined in section 5312 of title 31, United States Code; or\n       ``(B) has the meaning given that term (or the term used for \n     an equivalent offense) under State and local criminal \n     statutes pertaining to the movement of illicit cash or cash \n     equivalent proceeds.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to see this historic \npiece\n\n[[Page S12626]]\n\nof legislation will pass the Senate. After much careful work with \nSenator D'Amato, the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department, \nas well as our colleagues in the other body, we have crafted a bill \nthat I believe will lead to much improved coordination in fighting \nmoney laundering. I want to thank everyone involved for their hard work \non this legislation.\n  The bill will hit the criminals where they feel it the most--in their \npocketbooks. By implementing a strategy on a national level, hundreds \nof communities across our country will no longer be held hostage by \nthese criminal enterprises. As you know, money laundering involves \ndisguising financial assets so they can be used without detection of \nthe illegal activity that produced them. Through money laundering, the \ncriminal transforms the monetary proceeds derived from the criminal \nactivity into funds with an apparently legal source. Money laundering \nprovides the resources from drug dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and \nother criminals to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. \nToday, experts estimate that money laundering has grown into a $500 \nbillion problem worldwide.\n  The Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Strategy Act of \n1998 will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nthe Attorney General and other relevant agencies, to coordinate and \nimplement a national strategy to address the exploitation of our \nNation's payment systems to facilitate money laundering and related \nfinancial crimes. I look forward to the delivery of this first strategy \nnext February, and believe it will be a valuable document not only for \nlaw enforcement agencies, but also for Congress as we look to react to \nthe increasingly inventive ways criminals take advantage of our \nfinancial system. I hope this legislation will be the beginning of a \nserious effort by Congress to impact the growing threat of money \nlaundering not only to our Nation, but worldwide.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Today, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe passage of H.R. 1756, the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes \nStrategy Act of 1997. I am glad that we have been able to reach this \npoint. The House has sent over H.R. 1756, a strong antimoney laundering \ntool for law enforcement, and after some negotiation, we have amended \nthe language slightly. The House has agreed to accept the compromise \nand I have a letter from James E. Johnson, Under Secretary for \nEnforcement at the Treasury Department supporting the goals of this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe we are now ready to proceed to passage of the \nbill providing sufficient time for the House to act.\n  Mr. President, this is an important tool for the counternarcotics \neffort. Drug traffickers and dealers are destroying our families, \ncommunities and the future of our children, and we must fight them \nwith Every weapon at our disposal. This bill will attack drug \ntraffickers by making it harder for these criminals to profit from \ntheir illegal windfalls.\n\n  Mr. President, through money laundering, drug traffickers are able to \ntake their blood money and launder it clean. Their ill gotten gains are \nthen filtered throughout our economy. Money laundering sustains drug \ntraffickers and arms dealers, as well as terrorists and other criminals \nsearching for a way to prolong their illegal enterprises.\n  That is why I joined with Senator Grassley and Congresswoman \nVelazquez to develop the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy \nAct which the House passed on October 5, 1998. The bill will provide \nthe means for federal, state and local crime fighters to pursue and \nprosecute the drug traffickers and those that finance their criminal \ntrade.\n  This bill will allow the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral to create a national money laundering strategy and designate \nhigh risk zones. State and local officials within these zones will be \nencouraged to form a task force and become eligible for enforcement and \ntechnical assistance and, most importantly, anti-money laundering \ngrants.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why this is especially important for \nNew York, where money launderers have benefited from the financial, \ntrade and transportation systems in the metropolitan area. New York is \nthe largest financial center in this country--and one of the top three \ninternational money centers in the world. Unfortunately, money \nlaunderers have used this infrastructure to pursue their own criminal \nactivities.\n  Assistance by state and local officers in New York has been \ninvaluable in stopping drug traffickers from sending money back to the \ncartels. In 1997, in the New York area, law enforcement officials \ndetermined that organized narcotics traffickers were using the services \nof unscrupulous money remitters and their agents to send the proceeds \nof drug sales back to the drug source countries.\n  Utilizing a temporary Geographical Targeting Order (GTO) for the New \nYork metropolitan area, remitters and agents were required to report \ndetailed information about the remittances of cash to Colombia of more \nthan $750.\n  Within a week of the GTO's issuance, the local, state and federal \nagencies that made up the El Dorado Task Force found that money \nlaundering activity in that area, Jackson Heights, dropped \ndramatically. The number of remittances to Colombia dropped 95 percent \nand the dollar amount dropped 97 percent (from $67 million to $2 \nmillion). The New York GTO resulted in the seizure of millions in \ncurrency that was diverted to bulk shipments through the air and \nseaports and most importantly, disrupted the profit back to the drug \ncartels.\n  Mr. President, this operation was a huge success--thanks to the \ncooperative efforts of federal, state and local law enforcement. We \nshould build on that cooperation with this legislation.\n  Law enforcement efforts must follow the financial schemes and cash \nflows of the drug traffickers. As the drug cartels change their method \nof laundering their proceeds, law enforcement must respond. This bill \nprovides law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and \nflexibility to do just that. This monumental effort will cripple the \ndrug traffickers where it hurts--in their pockets--and take an \nimportant step forward in our war on drugs.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored the Senate measure with Senator \nGrassley and to have worked with Representative Velazquez to enact this \nimportant tool in antidrug efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important anticrime bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During the course of this year we have \n     been following a bill introduced by Congresswoman Velazquez, \n     the ``Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Strategy \n     Act'' (H.R. 1756). On June 16, the Treasury Department \n     provided testimony on H.R. 1756 indicating support for the \n     bill's overall goals and objectives.\n       We continue to support these goals. We appreciate that \n     Congresswoman Velazquez's bill recognizes the scope of the \n     money laundering problem, and attempts to develop a mechanism \n     to address these challenges. Developing an anti-money \n     laundering strategy could prove useful in setting priorities \n     and communicating them to Congress and the public. Moreover, \n     money laundering enforcement is complex and resource-\n     intensive. Enforcement of money laundering laws could benefit \n     from proper coordination among federal, state, and local law \n     enforcement.\n       We also appreciate the bill's goal of providing additional \n     resources for state and local antimoney laundering \n     activities. Financial crime investigations are complex and \n     require specialized expertise, as well as resource \n     commitments to follow leads that often take time to develop. \n     Cases themselves may span years and are information-\n     intensive. Because of this, state and local law enforcement \n     could benefit from additional resources and expertise to \n     fully join the fight against money laundering.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     Committee in combating money laundering and other financial \n     crimes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James E. Johnson,\n                                    Under Secretary (Enforcement).\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \nagreed to, the bill considered read a third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12627]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EMPLOYER ELECTRONIC STORAGE OF FORMS.\n\n       If an employer is required by any Federal law or regulation \n     to collect or store, or to file with a Federal agency forms \n     containing information pertaining to employees, such employer \n     may, after 18 months after enactment of this Act, store such \n     forms electronically unless the relevant agency determines by \n     regulation that storage of a particular form in an electronic \n     format is inconsistent with the efficient secure or proper \n     administration of an agency program. Such forms shall also be \n     accepted in electronic form by agencies as provided by \n     section 8.\n\n     SEC. 8. IMPLEMENTATION BY AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Implementation.--Consistent with the Privacy Protection \n     Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 2000aa) and after consultation with \n     the Attorney General, and subject to applicable laws and \n     regulations pertaining to the Department of the Treasury \n     concerning Federal payments and collections and the National \n     Archives and Records Administration concerning the proper \n     maintenance and preservation of agency records, Federal \n     agencies shall, not later than 18 months after the enactment \n     of this Act, establish and implement policies and procedures \n     under which they will use and authorize the use of electronic \n     technologies in the transmittal of forms, applications, and \n     similar documents or records, and where appropriate, for the \n     creation and transmission of such documents or records and \n     their storage for their required retention period.\n       (b) Establishment of a Timeline for Implementation.--Within \n     18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, Federal \n     agencies shall establish timelines for the implementation of \n     the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) General Accounting Office Report.--The Comptroller \n     General shall report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Commerce 21 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act on the proposed implementation policies and \n     timelines described in subsections (a) and (b).\n       (d) Implementation Deadline.--Except where an agency makes \n     a written finding that electronic filing of a form is either \n     technically infeasible, economically unreasonable, or may \n     compromise national security, all Federal forms must be made \n     available for electronic submission within 60 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 9. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       Because there is no meaningful difference between contracts \n     executed in the electronic world and contracts executed in \n     the analog world, it is the sense of the Congress that such \n     contracts should be treated similarly under Federal law. It \n     is further the sense of the congress that such contracts \n     should be treated similarly under State law.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION WITH OTHER LAWS.\n\n       Nothing in this this Act shall apply to the Department of \n     the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent \n     that--\n       (1) it involves the administration of the internal revenue \n     laws; and\n       (2) it conflicts with any provision of the Internal Revenue \n     Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 or the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 11.

Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to discuss \nlanguage that has been added to this legislation, the Government \nPaperwork Elimination Act. In May, I introduced S. 2107 to enhance \nelectronic commerce and promote the reliability and integrity of \ncommercial transactions through the establishment of authentication \nstandards for electronic communications. S. 2107 was reported by the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation last month.\n  After the bill was reported, it was discovered that the bill was \nerroneously referred to the Commerce Committee and should have been \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. S. 2107 deals with \nFederal Government information issues and, according to the \nparliamentarian, falls directly within the jurisdiction of Governmental \nAffairs. I understand a similar bill had been approved by Governmental \nAffairs last Congress.\n  Obviously, this was discovered late in the session. Nevertheless, \nSenator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nworked with me to develop language which combines language from the \nbill reported by his committee last Congress and S. 2107. I want to \nthank my colleague from Tennessee for his help and insight. He spent a \ngreat deal of time assisting me with this legislation and, in my \nopinion, his language makes many improvements to the original bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the digitization of information and the \nexplosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer \ntremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct \ncommerce, and interact with their government. This bill, S. 2107, will \nmake the United States government more accessible and accountable to \nthe citizenry by directing federal agencies to accept ``electronic \nsignatures'' for government forms that are submitted electronically.\n  I am pleased that Senator Abraham has addressed my concerns about the \nprivacy issues raised by this legislation. As reported out of \ncommittee, S. 2107 would have established a framework for government \nuse of electronic signatures without putting in place any privacy \nprotections for the vast amounts of personal information collected in \nthe process. Without such\n\n[[Page S12629]]\n\nprotections, people could be forced to sacrifice their privacy as the \nprice of communicating with the government electronically.\n  For example, to submit a particular form electronically, a person \nmight be required to use an electronic signature technology that offers \na high level of security, such as the increasingly popular \ncryptographic digital signature. This will usually involve the use of a \ncommercial third party--we'll call it ``X Corp.''--to guarantee the \nperson's identity. X Corp. will need to collect detailed personal \ninformation about the person, such as home address, phone number, \nsocial security number, date of birth, and even credit information. \nSome of the most secure systems even collect biometric information such \nas fingerprints or handwritten signatures. X Corp. might also collect \ninformation about how the person uses electronic signature services, \namassing a detailed dossier of the person's activities on-line. Nothing \nin the original bill prevented X Corp. from using or selling such \nprivate information without permission.\n  We have corrected this oversight by adding forward-looking privacy \nprotections to the amendment, which strictly limit the ways in which \ninformation collected as a byproduct of electronic communications with \nthe government can be used or disclosed to others. The provision we \nhave crafted is designed to prevent anyone who collects personal \ninformation in the course of providing electronic signatures for use \nwith government agencies from inappropriately disclosing that \ninformation.\n  We recognize that this is just the beginning of Congress's efforts to \naddress the new privacy issues raised by electronic government and the \ninformation age. Congress will almost certainly be called upon in the \nnext session to consider broader electronic signature legislation, and \nissues of law enforcement access to electronic data and mechanisms for \nenforcing privacy rights in cyberspace will need to be part of that \ndiscussion. For the time being, however, this legislation will ensure \nthat Americans can interact with their government on-line, and that \nthey can do so with the necessary safeguards in place to protect their \nprivacy and security.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nhis hard work on and dedication to information technology issues. The \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs which I chair has had a long and \ninvolved history with this issue.\n  This bill which we are addressing today seeks to take advantage of \nthe advances in modern technology to lessen the paperwork burdens on \nthose who deal with the Federal Government. This is accomplished by \nrequiring the Office of Management and Budget, through its existing \nresponsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-\nCohen Act, to develop policies to promote the use of alternative \ninformation technologies, including the use of electronic maintenance, \nsubmission, or disclosure of information to substitute for paper, and \nthe use of acceptance of electronic signatures.\n  The Federal Government is lagging behind the rest of the nation in \nusing new technologies. Individuals who deal with the Federal \nGovernment should be able to reduce the cumulative burden of meeting \nthe Federal Government's information demands through the use of \ninformation technology. This bill hopefully will provide the motivation \nthat the Federal Government needs to make this possible for our \nNation's citizens.\n  I thank Senator Abraham for offering us the opportunity to work with \nhim on this important issue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3829) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2107), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Senators Leahy, Smith of Oregon, and Hatch \nhave an amendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon and Mr. Hatch, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3830.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC PATENT INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The United States Patent and Trademark \n     Office shall develop and implement statewide computer \n     networks with remote library sites in requesting rural States \n     such that citizens in those States will have enhanced access \n     to information in their State's patent and trademark \n     depository library.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``rural States'' \n     means the States that qualified on January 1, 1997, as rural \n     States under section 1501(b) of the Omnibus Crime Control and \n     Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 379bb(b)).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nthe ``Plant Patent Amendments Act of 1998,'' H.R. 1197. This \nlegislation closes a loophole in the law by providing patent \nprotection, not only for an entire plant, but for parts of a plant as \nwell.\n  Since the 1930s, U.S. patent law has benefited agriculture, \nhorticulture and the public by providing an incentive for breeders to \ndevelop new plant varieties. This incentive is the availability of \npatents for new plant varieties.\n  An unforeseen ambiguity in the law, however, is undermining the \nincentives for breeders holding U.S. plant patents. Because current \nU.S. law only provides patent protection for entire plants, plant parts \nare being traded in U.S. markets to the detriment of U.S. plant patent \nholders. The resulting lost royalty income has been inhibiting \ninvestment in domestic research and breeding activities associated with \na wide variety of crops.\n  By clearly and explicitly providing that U.S. patent law protects the \nowner of a plant patent against the unauthorized sale of plant parts \ntaken from plants illegally reproduced, H.R. 1197 will close the \nexisting loophole in the law and will strengthen the ability of U.S. \nplant patent holders to enforce their patent rights.\n  Another matter of special interest to me is the amendment that I \noffered to the ``Plant Patent Amendments Act of 1998'' to enhance \naccess to all types of patent information. I have long thought that \nelectronic access should be more widespread and want to work with the \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to ensure the effective \nimplementation of statewide electronic accessibility of patent \ninformation in rural states and eventually in all areas to make it \neasier for inventors to study prior art and make further advances. This \nshould be of particular benefit to Vermont, which last year established \na patent and trademark depository library.\n  The Articles of Association of the Vermont Patent and Trademark \nDepository Library (Vermont PTDL) state that the library will ``create \na vital educational and economic development resource that will provide \nall Vermonters with access to patent and trademark records and \nsupporting research materials and reference services.'' At this time, \nhowever, all Vermonters do not, in a practical sense, have access to \nthe wealth of resources at the Vermont PTDL. In fact, it can be as much \nas a four hour drive for certain Vermont citizens to drive to the \nVermont PTDL at the University of Vermont's Bailey/Howe Library.\n  The intent of my amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Orrin \nHatch of Utah and Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, is for the PTO to \nwork with the people in the trenches currently operating the patent and \ntrademark depository libraries to develop and implement the statewide \ncomputer networks with remote library sites; it only makes sense for \nthe PTO to work with the people who most fully understand the needs of \nthe constituents they currently serve and may serve in the future.\n  This legislation is timely, because the Senate is considering the \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office Reauthorization Act, Fiscal \nYear 1999, H.R. 3723. As the lead Senate Democratic champion for H.R. \n3723, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this measure today so the \nPTO will not suffer a reduction in revenue for the current fiscal year. \nI am also committed to working with the PTO, now and in the future, as \nit ensures the effective implementation of statewide electronic \naccessibility of patent information in rural states.\n  I would like to pay a special thanks to Eric Benson, President of \nVermont PTDL, former State representative Kerry Kurt, who was \ninstrumental in the development of the Vermont PTDL, and everybody who \nserves on the Board of the Vermont PTDL. These Vermonters were the \ninspiration for my amendment, and they have worked hard to make the \nVermont PTDL an asset of which all Vermonters can be proud.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate passage \nof H.R. 1197, the Plant Patents Amendment Act of 1997. This \nlegislation, passed by the House last Friday, would close a loophole in \nthe Patent Act through which foreign infringers are able to exploit the \nproducts of their infringements within the United States, depriving \nAmerican plant patent owners of millions of dollars in royalties. This \nbill is identical to legislation introduced in the Senate by Senator \nGordon Smith, and its substantive provisions are mirrored in the \nomnibus patent bill I introduced and which was reported favorably to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee last year.\n  The development of new plant varieties in the United States is \nencouraged by chapter 15 of the Patent Act, which grants patent-like \nprotection to anyone who develops new, distinct varieties of asexually \nreproduced plants. Plant patent owners are rewarded for their ingenuity \nwith a limited monopoly that allows them to prevent others from \nasexually reproducing the plant or selling or using a plant so \nreproduced.\n  The so-called loophole exists because the sale or use of plant parts \nis not explicitly prohibited. As a result, plant\n\n[[Page S12631]]\n\npatent owners must stand by while their patents are infringed abroad \nand the products of such infringement--for example, fruit or cut \nflowers--are then imported to and sold within the United States, \nwithout a single dime in royalty revenue to the patent owner. This is \nno small problem. Royalty losses with respect to some key horticultural \nplants have been estimated to reach between $50 to $100 million over \nthe past five to ten years. This is money that rightfully should be \ndirected to American plant patent owners--many of whom are small \nbusinesses and family farmers--and which would otherwise contribute \ntremendously to the U.S. economy.\n  Enactment of this legislation is not only good for American business \nand the economy, it is consistent with our international treaty \nobligations. The International Convention for the Protection of New \nVarieties of Plants (UPOV) was last revised in March 1991, and the \nUnited States signed the convention in October 1991. This convention \nprovides protection for plant breeders by requiring member countries to \naccord certain plant patent rights, including specifically the right to \nprohibit others from selling, importing, or exporting harvested \nmaterial (i.e., plant parts) derived from unauthorized asexually \nreproduced plants.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped to enact this change in the context of a \ncomprehensive patent reform bill. I am disappointed that consideration \nof that bill has been blocked by a few senators with unrelated and \nrather non-descript objections, and that we are forced to take this \nmeasure up as a stand-alone bill. Nevertheless, I am pleased that the \nHouse has acted on this measure, and I commend the efforts of my \ncolleague, Senator Smith, to bring this bill to a vote in the Senate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3830) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1197), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12630-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THROTTLE CRIMINAL USE OF GUNS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that corruption \nand fraud are major problems in the procurement of goods and services \nfunded by multi-lateral lending programs. Since these programs are paid \nfor by U.S. taxpayers, the Senate Appropriations Committee identified \npotential mechanisms in its report accompanying the fiscal year 1999 \nForeign Operation Appropriations bill to ensure that procurement \nprocesses by borrowing or recipient nations are transparent, non-biased \nand open.\n  One of the mechanisms identified by the committee is independent \nthird party procurement monitoring. An independent third party \nprocurement monitor provides an independent review and assessment of \ngovernment procurement projects by auditing and certifying that the \nprocurement process is non-biased, open, transparent and fair. \nImportantly, independent third party monitoring provides technical \nassistance and training in country to improve the quality of the \nprocurement process, thereby making the procurement process more \neffective. The program also verifies that the contractual, technical, \neconomic and financial obligations of the supplier are fully \ndischarged.\n\n[[Page S12637]]\n\n  I encourage the Administration to support the use of programs such as \nindependent third-party procurement monitoring which have proven their \nvalue in reducing costs by deterring corruption and fraud, ensuring the \nquality of the goods and services provided, stimulating competition and \nfree trade, as well as enabling U.S. business to compete more \nsuccessfully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12636-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12637-S12639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOREIGN POLICY: AN UNFINISHED AGENDA\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have some good news, and I have some bad \nnews.\n  First the good news: We won. The Cold War, that is. Now the bad news: \nWe may find the burden of winning that war as heavy as the burden of \nfighting it. I say that is the ``bad news,'' Mr. President, because it \nseems like bad news. But I believe it is both our destiny--a mantle \nthat history has placed on our shoulders whether we like it or not--and \nan opportunity. The opportunity is this: the furnace in which American \nvalues are forged throughout the world is fiery hot, and its door is \nopen.\n  That furnace will not be hot forever, Mr. President. Our triumph in \nthe Cold War dissolved an empire and set free the nations that had been \nchained up by it. The totalitarian idea was stripped of the thin \nthreads of legitimacy to which its aging adherents continued to cling. \nThe birth of freedom--the opportunity to build new institutions of \ndemocracy and world stability--opened.\n  This furnace was hot, and still is, Mr. President, but the \nopportunity to build from the rubble of a fallen empire also brings \nturmoil. As what we hope are the transitional problems of economic \ninstability, ethnic conflict, and proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction cool and harden into habits, the door to that furnace of \nopportunity is closing.\n  America has learned before that the smoldering embers of victory \ncontain the fires of reignited conflict. Once in this century we got it \nwrong. After the first world war, we made the fatal mistake of a \nvengeful peace. The result was a second world war, after which we got \nmuch more right, especially our leadership in rebuilding a crumbled \nworld. Now, like then, we are weary of war's toll, but now, like then, \nwe must bear the burden of leadership in victory. And we must do it \nwhile the furnace is hot and the opportunity right.\n  That, Mr. President, is why I am concerned that the 105th Congress is \npreparing to adjourn with too much foreign policy business left \nunfinished. The challenges we face around the world are burdens not \njust for this Congress, but for this country, for every American. The \nbell of leadership will toll for all of us, and we should not be \nsurprised when it does. I want to outline just a few places where we \nmay hear that call.\n  First, we face a global economic meltdown. Economies throughout the \nworld are slowing and more uncertainty seems to arise everyday. Over \nthe past year we have seen how instability in the Asian financial \nmarkets can quickly spread and undermine the stability of the global \neconomy.\n  The impact has been devastating. Overnight, people in Asia and Russia \nhave seen their entire life savings disappear. They have seen the \nchance to give their children an education and a shot at a better life \nevaporate. They have seen their standards of living plummet to the \npoint where they must struggle to acquire basic necessities. Failure to \nact quickly to reverse the situation and promote global economic growth \ncould consign an entire generation--who only months ago were on the \nverge of building a middle class--to a life of continued poverty.\n  We must know that global prosperity is not possible without a strong \nU.S. economy. I am pleased with the recent decision by the Federal \nReserve to cut U.S. interest rates; although I admit I wish they would \nhave cut it further. As the economic engine that drives the world, we \nmust be prepared to take bold action to ensure world economic growth. \nLet me be clear, not only do we seek to improve the lives of people \naround the world through economic growth, we act with an element of \nself interest. A healthy global economy is the surest way to maintain a \nrobust economy in the United States. As the farmers in my state know, \nwithout markets for U.S. products abroad, our own prosperity is \nthreatened. Should this economic crisis deepen, should we start seeing \ncredible signs of global depression, this Congress and the \nAdministration must be prepared to act boldly to stimulate economic \ngrowth.\n  In that regard, I am pleased we are taking a proactive role in trying \nto prevent the economic crisis from spreading further to places like \nLatin America. We should continue to work cooperatively with other \nnations, like Japan, to assist them in implementing the kind of \neconomic and legal reforms that will help them rebuild their economies.\n  Out of this crisis, we are also learning that economic instability \nleads to political instability. We see this in Russia, where financial \nshocks have created a political crisis which threatens Russian \ndemocracy. The situation in Russia demands our attention. As a nation \nwith a capability to launch thousands of nuclear weapons, we cannot \nafford to allow Russia to slip into anarchy. I still believe the \nRussian transition will be successful, but it will be measured in \ndecades, not years. We must be prepared to help the Russian people over \nthe long run to create a democratic system based on the rule of law.\n  At the same time, we cannot allow the wealth of challenges we face \nboth at home and abroad to embolden despotic leaders to flaunt \ninternational standards. Recent missile tests by North Korea only too \nclearly demonstrate the need to remain committed to the security of our \nfriends in Asia. It refocuses our attention on this troubled region.\n  A divided Korea is one of the few lingering vestiges of the Cold War. \nBut a change there is inevitable. I see two potential scenarios on the \nKorea Peninsula. In the first scenario, North Korea will acquiesce to \nthe tide of history, renounce totalitarianism, embrace democracy, and \npeacefully reunite with the South. In the other scenario, North Korea \nimplodes into an irrational and dangerous nation threatening the peace \nand security not only of South Korea, but of the entire region. While \nwe should strive to ensure the former scenario, we should prepare for \nthe latter.\n  First, we should reaffirm our military ties with South Korea and \nJapan. The 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea, and the \ntens of thousands stationed throughout Asia, should serve as ample \nwarning of our intent to stand by our allies and respond to all \nthreats. Second, we should continue to support South Korea as it \nrebuilds its economy and implements further democratic reforms. \nFinally, we must maintain our active containment of North Korea with \nthe cooperation of all of our partners in the region.\n  As we remain vigilant in Korea, we cannot release the pressure we \nhave built on Saddam Hussein's regime. We are all concerned about \nSaddam's unwillingness to live up to his agreements, to fully disclose \nall information on his weapons of mass destruction programs, and to \ncooperate with United Nations Security Council Resolutions and \nmandates. Iraq's refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM monitors can not be \nallowed to go unchallenged.\n  But ultimately, our success in Iraq will not come from winning a game \nof hide and seek with Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, but through \nthe establishment of democracy in Iraq. We must change our policy from \ncontainment of Iraq to the replacement of Saddam Hussein with a \ndemocratic government. I am pleased legislation sponsored by Senator \nLott and myself--designed to set the Iraqi people on the path to self-\ngovernment--was recently passed by both the House and the Senate. As \nAmericans, we should strive for no less. This policy is both noble, and \nwith our assistance, possible.\n  In the Balkans, recent election victories by Serbian hardliners in \nBosnia once again raise concerns about the prospects for a lasting \npeace. While enormous progress has been made since the days of open \nwarfare and ethnic cleansing, more must be done to assure that Bosnia \nwill become a peaceful, multi-ethnic state.\n  Let us be clear, the chance for peace in Bosnia did not come from a \nsudden willingness of the warring parties to come together. It came \nfrom our willingness to use our own military power.\n\n[[Page S12638]]\n\n I am extremely proud of the men and women of the United States Armed \nForces who have served in Bosnia as a part of IFOR and SFOR. Their \nability to bring peace to Bosnia is the best example of the \neffectiveness of U.S. leadership in the world. We should not forget \nthat before the U.S. military intervention in Bosnia, our nightly news \nwas filled with images of the destruction of Bosnian villages; of men, \nwomen, and children being gunned down in the streets of Sarajevo; and \nof families being separated and never seeing each other again.\n  But because we acted--because men and women in America's armed forces \nput their lives on the line--the fighting was stopped, the Dayton Peace \nAccords were signed, and the people of Bosnia have been given the \nchance to return to a normal life. Ultimately, the success or failure \nof our efforts in Bosnia will be determined by the capability to fully \nimplement the civilian components of the Dayton Accords and our ability \nto help the people of Bosnia establish democracy and the rule of law \nbased on ethnic security.\n  However, just as we allow ourselves to be hopeful for the people of \nBosnia, we see more senseless killing of innocent civilians in the \nBalkans. The situation in Kosovo--while different and perhaps more \ncomplex than Bosnia--presents another challenge. Once again, we are \nfaced with the question: do we have the resolve to confront Serb \naggression and to halt the spread of ethnic conflict in the region? In \nanswering this question, we must heed the lesson of Bosnia--at times, \nthe credible use of force precedes diplomacy.\n  Over the past few months, Serbia has been given ample warning by the \ninternational community that its policies of ethnic cleansing, \nindiscriminate destruction of villages, and brutality toward civilian \npopulations would not go unchallenged. However, Mr. President, \nPresident Milosevic did not respond to the demands of the international \ncommunity until NATO began serious consideration of military action. \nOne of the reasons I voted for NATO enlargement earlier this year was \nmy firm belief that the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic--nations that had only recently thrown off the yoke of \ndictatorial regimes--would make the Alliance more willing to act in \ndefense of freedom. Therefore, I was heartened to see President Vaclav \nHavel providing leadership and insisting that NATO respond to Serb \naction in Kosovo.\n  I am hopeful that the agreement reached earlier this week will \nimprove the prospects of peace in Kosovo and will avert the pending \nhumanitarian crisis. But if we have learned one lesson in dealing with \nSlobodan Milosevic in the past it is this: believe his actions, not his \nwords.\n  Mr. President, as I look out onto the world these are only a few of \nthe foreign policy challenges we face. I come before my colleagues \ntoday with a simple message: America must lead. But for America to \nlead, Congress must act.\n  First, Congress must ensure a strong national defense. I am pleased \nthat we have passed both the Defense Authorization and Appropriations \nBills, which in my opinion are two of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we pass on an annual basis. The United States maintains the \nbest equipped and most skillfully trained military the world has ever \nseen. This is not bravado, but a fact. A fact that should serve as a \nconstant reminder to any nation contemplating a challenge to our \ninterests. A strong American military, one that's ready to deploy and \none that's backed up by the will of the American people, is a \ntremendous deterrent, and is likely to prevent conflict and the need \nfor U.S. intervention.\n  Next, we must ensure that we maintain our intelligence capabilities. \nAmericans should not suffer the illusion that we currently have the \nintelligence capacity to know everything that's going on in the world. \nWe simply do not. We are not allocating enough resources to make \ncertain our military is getting the intelligence it needs to identify \nthreats and protect our national interests. But more importantly, we \nare not allocating enough resources to make certain policymakers are \ninformed so that conflicts that might occur can be avoided. Mr. \nPresident, I believe we will not be able to allocate sufficient \nresources to our intelligence needs until we declassify the current \nbudget and have a public debate about how we spend those dollars.\n  As I look at the legacy of the 105th Congress, I see many areas in \nwhich we have failed to provide the leadership necessary to guide the \nUnited States through these troubled times. We have left an unfinished \nagenda that we must confront in the 106th Congress.\n  Our first line of national defense is diplomacy. But we in Congress \nhave spent far too little of our time and resources on ensuring we have \na strong, well-financed diplomatic corps. In fact, as of today, the \nSenate has failed to act on over 20 State Department nominees--\nincluding over 15 nominations for ambassadorial positions. How can the \nUnited States represent its interests abroad without having our \ndiplomatic representatives in place? Like our military, we should \nstrive to make our diplomatic corps the envy of the world. I am \nconvinced a strong diplomatic presence would reduce the chance of \nhaving to use our military forces.\n  In the same manner, Congressional refusal to provide funding to meet \nour international financial obligations puts a range of U.S. interests \nat risk. Currently, the United States owes over $1 billion in arrears \nto the United Nations. At a time in which we are trying to strip Saddam \nHussein of his weapons of mass destruction programs through the \nauspices of UNSCOM and the U.N. Security Council, it would be foolish \nto believe that our failure to pay our debts does not impact our \ncredibility. While I support efforts to reform U.N. operations, too \noften the payment of our arrears has been held hostage by those simply \nopposed to U.S. engagement in the world or by unrelated political \ndebates. Former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci said it best: ``One \nthing is certain--we can't reform the U.N. if we're the biggest \ndeadbeat.'' It's time for the United States to act like the most \npowerful nation in the world, it's time for Congress to pay our debts \nto the United Nations.\n  This Congress has not done enough to promote arms control. \nSpecifically, our failure to debate and ratify the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty during this Congress has relinquished our historic role as \nthe leader in the effort to end the testing of nuclear weapons. Mr. \nPresident, the American people overwhelmingly support the Test Ban \nTreaty because they understand ratification of the treaty will give us \nnew tools to fight the proliferation of nuclear materials and \ntechnology and will help us better monitor compliance of other nations.\n  The nuclear tests conducted earlier this year by India and Pakistan \nhighlight the danger that can arise when nations engage in nuclear \nbrinkmanship. The potential consequences of increased tensions in the \nregion arising from additional testing by India and Pakistan should \ncause each of us concern, and should elevate this issue to the top of \nour priority list. The recent declaration by the Prime Ministers of \nboth India and Pakistan of their intention to join the CTBT offer hope \nthat we can make this treaty work. When the 106th Congress reconvenes, \nthe Senate must bring this treaty to the floor. We cannot insist that \npotential rogue nuclear states adhere to the precepts of the CTBT if \nthe United States Senate gives it less time for debate than bills \nchanging the names of airports.\n  I spoke earlier about the challenge presented by the global economic \ncrisis. One of the few tools the international community has for \nextinguishing the sudden brush fires of global crisis is the \nInternational Monetary Fund. In response to the crisis, President \nClinton requested $18 billion to replenish the IMF's capital base. On \ntwo separate occasions, the Senate has overwhelmingly voted to provide \nthis funding, sending a clear message of our belief that the threat to \nthe prosperity of the American people is too great not to act. I am \npleased with reports that the funding will be provided as a part of the \nFY99 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. While imperfect, the IMF is the only \ninstitution that pools the world's resources to address large-scale \nfinancial crises.\n  Finally, I was disappointed by our failure to renew fast track \nauthority for the President to negotiate future\n\n[[Page S12639]]\n\ntrade agreements. I believe it's unfortunate because without fast track \nauthority it will be more difficult to negotiate reductions in non-\ntariff barriers throughout the world that would stimulate demand for \nAmerican products and create jobs for American citizens.\n  I have outlined a heavy burden, Mr. President, one whose weight may \nsurprise us. Many Americans thought we won, no doubt, and that the \nburden of leadership--along with the cloud of danger--had passed. We \ndid win, Mr. President, our blood and treasure struck a tremendous blow \nfor freedom. Our pride is not diminished by the fact that our work is \nnot done.\n  Shortly before the Soviet Union fell, one of the great soldiers of \nthe Cold War, General Colin Powell, met with General Jack Galvin--\ncommander of NATO--to discuss threats to our security. General Galvin \nwore a worried look on his face as he plodded through threat after \nthreat after threat that remained. General Powell responded: ``Smile, \nJack. We won.''\n  Smile, Mr. President. But we must also steel our will. The burden of \nwar is behind us. The burden of victory remains.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12637-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXPORT-IMPORT BANK AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I understand that my good friend and \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, has recently introduced legislation \nwhich would amend the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to assure that the \nUnited States is consistent with other G-7 countries in evaluating \nenvironmental concerns whenever the Bank undertakes project financing. \nI understand the Senator's concerns. However, I feel that this issue \nwould be much better addressed with a full hearing. Adding this \nprovision onto the Omnibus Appropriations bill without fully discussing \nit and analyzing its implications with a hearing, may not be prudent.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my good friend from New York, the \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs, Senator D'Amato, is correct. I have introduced a bill, S. \n2537, to amend the Export-Import Bank's environmental provisions. The \nbill does two things. First, it directs the Ex-Im Bank to negotiate a \nmulti-lateral agreement with the export financing agencies of all G-7 \ncountries to address environmentally sensitive development overseas. \nSecond, until such agreement is reached, my legislation would ensure \nthat U.S. companies have access to Ex-Im Bank financing of overseas \nprojects where other G-7 countries are providing or have indicated an \nintent to provide financing to the project in question without \nconditioning such assistance on environmental policies or procedures. \nThe net effect of this law is to impose unilateral sanctions on U.S. \ncompanies in the name of the environment.\n  I had intended to discuss this legislation as part of Senate action \non trade issues, because the issue here is trade and competition. This \nyear, however, trade legislation may only be adopted as part of the \nomnibus spending bill, or not at all.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Clearly, my friend has raised a valid concern. \nCertainly, no member in the Senate is in favor of needlessly denying \nthe necessary financing to a U.S. company, and allowing them to compete \ninternationally, especially in light of the disproportionate levels of \nfinancing, and in some cases subsidization provided by many foreign \ngovernments to their domestic businesses. I share the Senator's \nconcerns that the Bank not give any other country an unfair advantage \nwhen it comes to competing for jobs abroad. However, I am also \nconcerned that this issue has not been addressed properly by the Senate \nBanking Committee, the committee of jurisdiction with regard to this \nissue. When ever the Bank considers financing projects abroad, there \ncertainly should be consideration given to the effects on the \nenvironment. And additionally, the U.S. should continue to participate \nin negotiations with the rest of the international community which seek \nto establish some set of standards for all countries.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of the \nSenator form New York about this legislation, particularly because he \nis chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the Export-Import \nBank. And I agree that this matter is so important that it deserves the \nattention of the full Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. \nIs the Senator saying that when the Senate reconvenes for the 106th \nsession, the Chairman will schedule a hearing on my legislation at the \nearliest possible convenience?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, that is precisely what I am suggesting, \nand I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Alaska and his \nunderstanding on this matter.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my good friend from New York. As a result of \nhis commitment on hearings. I will not attempt to include my Ex-Im \nlegislation in the omnibus spending bill. I will look forward to \nworking with the Chairman next year to address this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12639-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOFTWARE COMPETITION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. As many of my colleagues are aware, on October 7, a \ncoalition of prominent consumer groups released a study entitled ``The \nConsumer Case Against Microsoft.'' The report reviews quantitative \nevidence, journalistic accounts of the software industry and evidence \npresented by the Department of Justice and the states Attorneys General \nin its discussion of four major areas of alleged attempts at \nmonopolization--operating systems, desktop applications, web browsers \nand electronic commerce. The report concludes that Microsoft has a \nmonopoly in several important segments of the consumer software market \nand is likely to continue to use its market power to gain monopoly \nmarket share in other existing and developing markets. In addition, the \nreport argues that Microsoft's business practices and monopoly status \ncombine to deprive consumers of cost savings, quality and choice. These \nare important issues, and I hope the next Congress will further explore \nthis matter.\n  Later this month, after we adjourn, the antitrust case against \nMicrosoft will go to trial, and it may conclude before the next \nCongress convenes. During the course of this trial, the public will \nlearn much about business practices in the software industry, and \nissues surrounding competition in the software industry will likely \ngain a higher degree of visibility. I commend all of my colleagues to \nmonitor this trial and the questions that it may raise.\n  I also ask my colleagues to review the consumers groups' report along \nwith any rebuttal which Microsoft may put forth. The issues raised in \nthe report and during the trial may force Congress to examine whether \nexisting antitrust law sufficiently addresses market abuses in the new \ndigital age. They may also force Congress to consider new and important \nconsumer protection and market dominance issues absent traditional \nantitrust examination. In the final analysis, we must strive to ensure \nthat all consumers, large and small, are able to benefit from a vibrant \nand competitive electronic marketplace marked by innovation, \ncompetitive pricing and consumer choice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12639-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MANUFACTURED HOUSING IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office Reauthorization Act, Fiscal \nYear 1999, H.R. 3723. This bill, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives on May 12, 1998, is an important measure that would \nbenefit all American inventors and would, for the first time in the \nhistory of the U.S. patent system, reduce patent fees.\n\n[[Page S12640]]\n\n  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is totally funded \nby user fees. Prior to 1990, the PTO was funded through a combination \nof user fees and taxpayer revenue. However, in a deficit reduction \nexercise in 1990, taxpayer support for the operations of the PTO was \neliminated and user fees were substantially increased by the imposition \nof a surcharge on patent fees. The temptation to use the surcharge has \nproven to be increasingly irresistible to Congress and the \nAdministration, to the detriment of sound functioning of our nation's \npatent system. Through Fiscal Year 1998, a total of $235 million has \nbeen diverted from the PTO to other unrelated agencies and programs.\n  At the urging of the inventor community, Congress allowed the \nsurcharge to sunset at the end of Fiscal Year 1998. This means, \nhowever, that Congress must take affirmative action to adjust patent \nfees or the PTO will suffer a drastic reduction in revenue for the \ncurrent fiscal year which will leave it unable to hire the patent \nexaminers needed to reduce the time required to get a patent to \neighteen months. Prompt processing of patent applications is \nparticularly important for those inventors who need their patents to \nraise risk capital.\n  The Administration forwarded a draft bill to the Congress which would \nhave continued patent fees at the current levels. However, in an \noversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Commissioner \nLehman stated that the PTO would be unable to use all the revenues that \nwould be generated if patent fees were to be continued at their current \nlevel in fiscal year 1999. Commissioner Lehman stated that keeping fees \nat their current level would generate $50 million in excess fee revenue \nwhich the Administration planned to divert to other government \nprograms. The response by the House of Representatives was to craft a \nbill, H.R. 3723, that would adjust patent fees to provide all of the \nmoney which the PTO indicated that it could use in fiscal year 1999, \nbut which would not generate an unneeded $50 million simply to support \nother government programs.\n  In the absence of any action on H.R. 3723, Congress had to include \nspecific language in the continuing resolution signed by the President \non September 25, 1998 addressing the level of patent fees that the PTO \ncould charge. Section 117 of Public Law 105-240 provides that the PTO \ncan continue to charge patent fees at the same level that existed on \nSeptember 30, 1998 through October 9, 1998. As I previously noted, \npatent fees at this level are higher than they need to be to fully fund \nthe PTO in fiscal year 1999. In a fiscal year when there are debates \nover how to use the billions of dollars of budget surplus, it is \ninappropriate for Congress to require the PTO to charge inventors more \nthan the cost of rendering the services which they receive. By enacting \nH.R. 3723 we serve American inventors and provide them with the first \nreal patent fee reduction in the history of the nation. This bill is \ngood for American inventors and good for the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12639-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS ACT 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the passage \nof S. 1754, the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998. \nThis legislation reauthorizes the health care training programs \ncontained in titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act and \nits enactment will improve health workforce quality, diversity, and the \ndistribution of funds--while requiring greater accountability of both \nthe grant recipients of federal funds and the agency that administers \nthem. I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Act.\n  Senate bill 1754 reauthorizes and consolidates 37 categorical grant \nand contract authorities of title VII and VIII of the Public Health \nService Act into 8 clusters to provide for the support of health \nprofessions training programs and related community-based educational \npartnerships. To preserve the integrity of the programs, 15 funding \nlines will continue. This legislation provides comprehensive, flexible, \nand effective authority for the support of health professions training \nprograms and the related community-based educational partnerships.\n  In my own State of Vermont, the students of the University of \nVermont's College of Medicine have benefited from a number of these \nprograms and scholarships, including those relating to family medicine \nand professional nurse and nurse practitioner training. The newest \ntitle VII program in Vermont is the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) \nwhich opened its first site in April 1997 in the Northeast Kingdom of \nVermont. The AHEC will decentralize health professions education by \nhaving portions of the training provided in primary medical personnel \nshortage areas and by improving the coordination and use of existing \nhealth resources. Over the next two years, two additional sites are \nplanned in other underserved areas of the State. These efforts have \ncontributed to making Vermont a better place to obtain health care \nservices and they have improved the quality of life for its residents.\n  I want to thank Senator Frist and his excellent staff for their \ndedication and hard work in drafting the Health Professions Education \nPartnerships Act of 1998. The enactment of this act will improve the \ntraining of our nation's health workforce and, also, provide for \ngreater accountability of the public funds used to support these \neducational programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12640-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12640-S12641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE MEDICAL RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE GAP\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before this Congress ends, I want to bring \nto my colleagues' attention an important issue confronting our nation's \nbiomedical research enterprise and its search for medical breakthroughs \nas we move into the next century.\n  First, I want to say how pleased I am that we were able to provide \nthe biggest increase ever for medical research this year. We worked \nhard to make that happen and I want to commend my colleague, Senator \nArlen Specter, for his leadership and work with me on this important \naccomplishment. The Conference Agreement of the Fiscal 1999 Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee, provides a $2 billion, or 15 percent, \nincrease for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the principal \nsource of Federal funding for medical research conducted at our \nnation's universities and other research institutions. That 15 percent \nincrease puts Congress on course to double funding for the NIH over the \nnext five years, a target I've called for and agreed to by the Senate \nearlier in this Congress.\n  However, as Congress embarks on this important investment in improved \nhealth, we must strengthen the totality of the biomedical research \nenterprise. While it is critical to focus on high quality, cutting edge \nbasic and clinical research, we must also consider the quality of the \nlaboratories and buildings where that research is being conducted, as \nwell as the training of future scientists and the salaries of those \nscientists.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the infrastructure of research institutions, \nincluding the need for new physical facilities, is central to our \nnation's leadership in medical research. Despite the significant \nscientific advances produced by Federally-funded research, most of that \nresearch is currently being done in medical facilities built in the \n1950's and 1960's, a time when the Federal government obligated from \n$30 million to $100 million a year for facility and equipment \nmodernization. Since then, however, annual appropriations for \nmodernization of our biomedical research infrastructure have been \ngreatly reduced, ranging from zero to $20 million annually over the \npast decade. As a result, many of our research facilities and \nlaboratories are outdated and inadequate to meet the challenge of the \nnext millennium.\n  Over the past decade, I've worked hard both as chair and now Ranking \nMember of the health subcommittee to get the NIH budget increased to \n$15.5 billion. Yet, over that same period, support for facility and \nlaboratory modernization totaled only $110 million. In the Fiscal 1999 \nappropriations bill, only 0.2 percent of the NIH budget will be \ndirectly devoted to improvement of the extramural laboratories that \nhouse NIH-funded scientists and support their research.\n  As we work to double funding for medical research over the next 5 \nyears, the already serious shortfall in the\n\n[[Page S12641]]\n\nmodernization of our nation's aging research facilities will grow \nunless we take specific action. According to the most recent National \nScience Foundation study of the status of biomedical research \nfacilities (1996), 47 percent of all biomedical research-performing \ninstitutions classified the amount of biological science research space \nas inadequate, and 51 percent indicated that they had an inadequate \namount of medical science research space. Only 45 percent of biomedical \nresearch space at research-performing institutions was considered \n``suitable for scientifically competitive research.''\n  The 1996 NSF Report further found that 36 percent of all institutions \nwith biomedical research space reported capital projects, involving \neither construction or renovation, that were needed but had to be \ndeferred because funding was not available. The estimated costs for \ndeferred biomedical research construction and renovation projects \ntotaled $4.1 billion. The problem is more severe for Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, where only 36 percent of their biomedical \nresearch space was rated as being suitable for use in the most \ncompetitive scientific research.\n  The extramural facilities gap has been recognized by leading research \norganizations, the members of which have recommended a major \nconstruction and renovation funding initiative as part of any proposal \nto significantly increase funding for the NIH. In a March 1998 report, \nthe Association of American Medical Colleges found that ``recent \nadvances in science have generated demand for new facilities and \ninstruments, much of which could most rationally be provided through \nfederal programs that are merit reviewed. The AAMC report concluded \nthat ``the government should establish and fund an NIH construction \nauthority, consistent with the general recommendations of the \nWyngaarden Committee report of 1988, which projected at that time the \nneed for a 10-year spending plan of $5 billion for new facilities and \nrenovation.''\n  These sentiments are echoed by a June 1998 report of the Federation \nof American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), one of the \nleading organizations of basic researchers. The FASEB report concluded \nthat ``laboratories must be built and equipped for the science of the \n21st century. Infrastructure investments should include renovation of \nexisting space as well as new construction, where appropriate.''\n  Mr. President I am committed to addressing this need. I believe \nfuture increases in federal funding for the NIH must be matched with \nincreased funding for repair, renovation, and construction of our \nextramural research facilities. To this end, I plan on introducing \nlegislation next year to significantly expand our investment in \nresearch facility modernization to assure that 21st century research is \nconducted in 21st century labs and facilities. And over the next year I \nplan to meet with patients, health professionals, and academic leaders \nfrom across the country to discuss this initiative which is so vitally \nimportant for the future of the entire medical research enterprise.\n  Mr. President, this is a very exciting time in the field of \nbiomedical research. We are on the verge of major medical breakthroughs \nwhich hold the promise of improved health and reduced costs for the \npeople of this nation and the world. The ravage of killers like cancer, \nheart disease and Parkinson's and the scores of other illnesses and \nconditions which take the lives and health of millions of Americans can \nbe ended if we devote the resources. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the coming months and years to assure that this promise \nis realized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12640-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12641-S12642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TERRORISM AND THE GROWING THREAT TO HUMANITARIAN WORKERS ABROAD\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I wish to call attention to a \ntarget of terrorism that is rarely discussed. Increasingly, acts of \nviolence are directed at some of the noblest members of our community, \nnamely, humanitarian relief workers. I have been requested by \ninternationally-respected aid agencies to call attention to this issue \nto encourage risk assessment solutions to minimize humanitarian aid \nworker fatalities. Borrowing from a recent GAO report entitled \nCombatting Terrorism, finding solutions demands a ``threat and risk \nassessment approach used by several public and private sector \norganizations [who] deal with terrorist and other security risks.'' \nUnfortunately, little security expertise has been directed to their \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  How great is this threat? A March study presented at Harvard warned \nof sharp increases in security threats against the humanitarian \ncommunity. The United Nations reports that the safety risks for relief \nworkers has altered dramatically in the last 5 years. We know that at \nleast 25 relief workers from America and other countries died in 1997. \nBetween 1995 and 1997, the International Red Cross, alone, recorded 397 \nseparate security incidents of aggression and banditry against its \npersonnel.\n  In the farthest corners of the earth, aid workers feed the hungry, \nheal the sick, comfort the persecuted, and shelter the homeless. Non-\nprofit aid organizations do the hardest work for the littlest pay under \nthe greatest risks with the least support. From Kosovo to Cambodia, \nAngola to Afghanistan, Liberia to Chechnya, selfless people from \nAmerica and beyond are serving in increasingly dangerous situations \nwith tremendous personal exposure.\n  Some of these voluntary organizations have become household names \nlike CARE, World Vision, the American Red Cross, and Catholic Relief \nServices. Some are smaller community-based charities. Some are \nmissionary organizations in the most isolated places. Some are faith-\nbased, others are secular, but all of them have one thing in common: \nthey are at greater risk than ever before of murder, abduction, and \nassault.\n  Their extraordinary vulnerability is illustrated by the following \nstories: In Tajikistan, a health care worker for street children was \nkidnaped. Ultimately, both the worker and her 5 abductors were killed \nby a grenade they set off. In Rwanda, a worker transporting emergency \nfood relief died during an attack by unknown assailants at a military \ncheckpoint. The truck was then set on fire, resulting in the loss of 15 \ntons of humanitarian relief food which would have fed some 1,700 people \nfor the next month. These are only a few of the countless untold \nstories of worker maiming and death.\n  At a recent training course in security for humanitarian \norganizations held by InterAction (a coalition of international aid \norganizations), an instructor asked if anyone present had ever \nevacuated a country under hazardous conditions or had been physically \nassaulted in the course of their work. Nearly all of the assembled \nfield workers raised their hands. Many asked, ``Which time?''\n  These voluntary organizations play a central role in foreign \nassistance, and significant American foreign assistance is being \nfunneled through them at an increasing rate. As these groups distribute \nUS foreign relief, they represent America in difficult and dangerous \ninternational arenas. And they do it well--they are lean, efficient, \nand flexible as is demanded by the extremities of working in the most \nconflicted regions worldwide. Their accomplishments are legendary. Over \nthe years, they have stood between life and death for countless \nmillions during numerous, threatened famines which were averted because \nof their efforts.\n  This is the central point of my concern. These courageous and \nselfless groups are more exposed than ever as terrorism continues to \nescalate against Americans worldwide. The least we can do during the \ncurrent, on-going public debate on ``terrorism'' is to direct attention \ntheir way to generate risk assessment solutions. They cannot isolate \nthemselves behind compound walls as would an embassy or arm themselves \nwith military equipment. Their job description requires them to live \namong the people, and by necessity, become vulnerable.\n  What can be done? First, I do not want to implement more cumbersome \nlegislation. I do, however, hope to energize private sector solutions \nrelating to risk assessment in this new era of violence. I hope that \nboth public and private sector expertise will be directed towards their \nunique security challenges.\n  One immediate solution is information sharing. Even though most \nexperienced humanitarian workers can relate\n\n[[Page S12642]]\n\nharrowing stories, hard data is difficult to obtain. Experts agree that \nsecurity incidents among voluntary organizations operating overseas are \nvastly under-reported. By working cooperatively, aid organizations can \nshare information and resources as incidents occur. Another solution \ninvolves training; InterAction, in conjunction with the Office of \nForeign Disaster Assistance, recently developed a security training \ncourse for aid organizations which was well received. I encourage their \ncontinued endeavors and commend all groups seeking ways to improve \nsecurity training. Training resources could be developed and shared via \na consortium.\n  The gathering of more information quantifying the problems is another \nstep towards solutions. The skills and equipment that once well-served \nfield workers in the past may no longer be adequate. To get a better \nunderstanding of the scope and nature of these new problems, I am \nworking with the General Accounting Office to provide a detailed study \nto assess this problem.\n  Aid workers are one of America's great natural resources--living in \nobscurity at great personal sacrifice to ease the suffering of \nstrangers, they express the best of the American character through \ntheir extraordinary generosity. They already sacrifice their personal \nlives, they should not also pay with their blood. We should not lose \nthem to senseless acts of violence if this can be avoided by \nappropriate risk assessment and resource sharing. I believe there are \nunique solutions for these unique challenges, where the best security \nexperts will creatively address these special needs. We should not let \nthese heroes be defeated by heartless terrorism--we should not \nunnecessarily lose our best to this insidious form of violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12641-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12642-S12643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for some months now, pressure has been \nbuilding for the enactment of legislation that would address the long-\nneglected but widespread problem of religious persecution in a number \nof countries, notably persecution of Christians. This legislation, \nwhich has been approved by both Houses of Congress and has been sent to \nthe White House, addresses that problem in a manner that will allow the \nflexibility to protect U.S. interests. Because there was no Committee \nReport for this legislation, it is important that appropriate guidance \nbe given as to the intent behind the legislation, for the benefit both \nof the Executive Branch and, in particular, the Commission established \nby the Act. As an original cosponsor of the legislation, I wish to \nsupplement the Statement of Managers submitted by Mr. Nickles to draw \nparticular attention to two provisions in the Act that address what is \nthe fundamental duty of any government: to protect the rights of its \nown citizens.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to address the rampant \npersecution in many foreign countries by the governments of those \ncountries against their own people. But however repugnant we find \npersecution of citizens of foreign countries--and properly so--it is \neven worse when we find that the U.S. government has too often turned a \nblind eye to violations of Americans' religious freedom by persecuting \nregimes. For example, the State Department has collaborated with the \ndenial of religious freedom by shutting down Christian services on the \npremises of the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) and punished a \nwhistle-blowing State Department official who protested. Similarly, the \nState Department has refused to take any meaningful action to secure \nthe release of an unknown number of minor U.S. citizens who have been \nkept from leaving Saudi Arabia and who have been forcibly converted to \nIslam. This is an especially acute problem in the case of girls, who \nwill not be able to leave Saudi Arabia even after reaching the age of \nmajority--in effect, theirs is a life sentence.\n  This bill addresses both of these issues, and the intent of Congress \nis clear. First, the bill requires the State Department to report on \nboth practices as they affect the rights of American citizens (section \n102(b)(1)(B) (i) and (ii)). This report should be detailed and specific \nboth as to the nature of the violations and the remedial actions that \nhave been applied. Second, because forced religious conversion is among \nthe violations that mandate presidential action under this bill, \ndocumentation of the victimization of minor U.S. citizens in this \nmanner by any foreign government should be of particular note in the \nPresident's decision to take action. Third, section 107 mandates access \nfor U.S. citizens to diplomatic missions and consular posts for the \npurpose of religious services on the same basis as the many other \nnongovernmental activities unrelated to the diplomatic mission that \nfrequently are permitted access. Fourth, the Commission should take \nparticular note of Congress' intent in the provisions relating to \nviolations of Americans' rights in making its recommendations and \nshould be strict in reviewing U.S. government policies in this area. \nAnd fifth, notice of these violations of U.S. citizens' rights should \nprompt a thorough review of the Department of State's too-often \ndismissive attitude toward these concerns in comparison to its desire \nto cultivate good relations with foreign governments.\n\n\n                     access to u.s. missions abroad\n\n  It is important to note that these concerns were not invented in the \nabstract but are drawn from real problems of real people. On the \nquestion of the State Department's negative attitude toward the desire \nof American citizens to be afforded the opportunity for worship in \ncountries where this is forbidden, the following is relevant (from The \nAmerican Spectator, ``Saving Faith: Why won't the State Dept. stand up \nfor Christians?'' By Tom Bethell, April 1997):\n\n       The Saudi dictatorship forbids all non-Muslim religious \n     activity, but services were for years held on embassy and \n     consular grounds in Riyadh and Jeddah. In the 1970's, \n     hundreds of Catholics attended Mass within the U.S. mission \n     each week; Protestant services were equally well attended, \n     and Mormons had their own service. (No American diplomats \n     thought to be Jewish are stationed in Saudi Arabia.) Within \n     the British mission, such religious services continue today. \n     But the U.S. mission has now phased them out. In contrast, \n     the U.S. consulate in Jeddah sets aside special facilities \n     for Islamic worship, five times a day, whether by Americans, \n     Saudis, or embassy employees from other countries.\n       I met with Tim Hunter at a restaurant near his home in \n     Arlington, Virginia. Before joining the Foreign Service, he \n     told me, he had worked for the U.S. Army in \n     counterintelligence and as a political appointee to various \n     federal agencies. When he arrived in Saudi Arabia in 1993 he \n     was told by the Consul General that his ``informal duties'' \n     would include monitoring the ``Tuesday lecture,'' a euphemism \n     for the Catholic Mass held on consulate grounds. By then, the \n     number of attendees had dwindled to fifteen. The reason was \n     not hard to find. Hunter's job was to tell any inquiring U.S. \n     citizens that the embassy knew nothing about any such service \n     or ``Tuesday meeting.'' Only if callers were extremely \n     persistent was he to meet with them and gauge their \n     trustworthiness.\n       Since this was entirely irregular and contrary to U.S. law, \n     Hunter decided to blow the whistle. He even told the FBI what \n     was going on. Within days of telling visiting officials from \n     the Inspector General's office he was ordered to return to \n     the U.S. A State Department review panel observed that Hunter \n     had not ``absorbed the Foreign Service culture''--an \n     understatement. In April 1995, Hunter recalled, ``two \n     uniformed officers of the State Department's Diplomatic \n     Security Service, displaying brightly polished 9mm caliber \n     pistols, appeared at the office of my supervisor [James \n     Byrnes] and advised him that I was being removed from further \n     employment.'' Today Hunter calls the U.S. mission in Saudi \n     Arabia a ``rogue part of the U.S. diplomatic establishment.'' \n     Thomas Friedman provided an oblique corroboration in the New \n     York Times, noting in December 1995 that the U.S. has \n     ``withdrawn diplomats from Riyadh whom the Saudis felt became \n     too knowledgeable and frank about problems in the kingdom.''\n\n  Section 107 of this bill will remedy this problem. The State \nDepartment may not adopt a cavalier attitude toward the requests of \nU.S. citizens for access for the purpose of religious worship or \nsuggest that such requests are uniquely unrelated to the conduct of the \ndiplomatic mission in comparison to other permitted activities, for \nexample, the dispensing and social consumption of alcoholic beverages \nand the serving of pork products, that are also contrary to Saudi law. \nMany other social and American community activities without any \ndiscernable diplomatic purpose will no doubt continue, and in most \ncases should continue, but religious service access requests under \nsection 107 may receive no less consideration. The fact that several \nother foreign consulates afford access to worship for their citizens \ndisproves any\n\n[[Page S12643]]\n\nsuggestion that diplomatic interests preclude similar provisions for \nAmericans by the State Department. The annual report required under the \nbill must make this clear, and the Commission should give strict \nscrutiny to enforcement of this provision according to its clear \nintention. Finally, the victimization of Mr. Hunter for blowing the \nwhistle on this matter is unconscionable, and the Commission should \nrecommend and monitor speedy redress of his status by the State \nDepartment.\n\n\n                forced conversion of minor u.s. citizens\n\n  If the neglect of the worship needs of Americans abroad is \ndeplorable, inaction in the cases of the victimization of minors who \nhave been taken to a foreign land, subjected to forced religious \nconversion, and prevented from returning to the United States where \nthey would enjoy religious freedom is intolerable. One particular case \nillustrates the severity of this problem, that of Alia and Aisha Al \nGheshiyan. In Chicago, Illinois, on January 25th, 1986, Alia, aged \nseven, and Aisha, aged three and a half, visited the apartment of their \nfather, Khalid Bin Hamad Al Gheshiyan, a citizen and Saudi Arabia. The \ngirl's mother, Patricia Roush had been awarded custody of the children \nby a U.S. court but had agreed to permit their father to have the \nchildren for an overnight visit. He promised to return them to their \nmother the next day. However, instead of returning the girls to their \nmother, Al Gheshiyan abducted the two girls and took them to Saudi \nArabia. On January 28th 1986, an Illinois court issued a warrant for Al \nGheshiyan's arrest on charges of child abduction.\n  Having been removed from the United States and placed under the law \nof Saudi Arabia, where no non-Islamic region may be practiced, the \ngirls (who had been baptized as Christians) were obliged to give up \ntheir previous Christian identity. According to their mother, who has \nsecured documentation of her daughters' mandatory conversion to Islam:\n\n       My daughters Alia and Aisha Gheshiyan were raised in a \n     Christian home by a Christian mother and were not familiar \n     with Islam or their father's family, culture or religion. \n     (Which he stated he was disobeying when he was in the United \n     States for twelve years). My daughters are now young women \n     who are nineteen and sixteen years of age with no possible \n     choices of religious freedom. If they do not practice Islam, \n     they could be killed--quite possibly by their own father. \n     This is not uncommon in Saudi Arabia. If a child, especially \n     a daughter, does not submit to her father's commands, he has \n     the right to put her to death.\n\n  It is important to remember that in cases like that of Alia and \nAisha, their plight amounts to a life sentence, because under Saudi \nlaw, even after attaining majority (as Alia already has) they may not \ntravel abroad without their father's permission (in the case of \nunmarried girls and woman) or their husband's permission (in the case \nof married women).\n  As if the total denial of rights to these Americans were not bad \nenough, even more deplorable has been the response of the Department of \nState, which has simply dismissed the matter as a ``child custody'' \ncase and has advised Ms. Roush to hire a lawyer for proceedings in a \nShari's religious court--a court in which she, as a non-Muslim and a \nwoman, has virtually no standing. There is no evidence that the State \nDepartment has ever dealt with this (and other such forced conversions) \nas not just a private dispute or a routine consular access case but as \na state-to-state matter involving not only the solemn obligation of the \ngovernment of the United States to secure the rights of its citizens \nbut of the indefensible hostility of the Saudi government toward \nreligious freedom. If the United States could make the fate of \nprominent Soviet Jewish ``refuse-niks'' Natan Scharansky and Ida Nudel \na matter of national policy in American relations with the Soviet \nUnion--as we should have--the fate of Alia and Aisha must be seen as a \nlitmus test of the willingness of the State Department to give proper \nweight to the requirements of this statue in its relations with the \nRiyadh government. The Commission should recommend specific action as \nthe highest level to ensure that the United States no longer gives the \nimpression that such treatment of its citizens is acceptable or is only \na routine ``private'' or ``family'' matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12642-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 1529\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, almost everyone has heard of the impending \n``Year 2000'' or ``Y2K'' problem, also commonly known as the \n``millennium bug.'' The problem itself is fairly simple. In the early \nyears of computers, programmers set aside only two digits to denote the \nyear in dates. To the ``minds'' behind computers and other technology-\ndriven devices, the year 2000 is indistinguishable from the year 1900. \nThe problem is present in billions of lines of software as well as \nbillions of small computer chips embedded in electronic devices used by \nAmericans every day. Without the necessary checks to ensure that \nelectronic devices can operate by January 1, 2000, the impact of this \ncomputer bug could be wide-ranging and even disastrous. Household \ngadgets like garage door openers or VCRs could break down. Traffic \ndelays could be caused by non-complaint traffic lights. Stock exchanges \nand nuclear reactors could shut down.\n  Although the problem is easy to describe, it has proven difficult and \ntime-consuming to solve. To make the necessary corrections, each line \nof computer code must be hand-checked by a computer programmer, and all \ncomputer chips must be tested. In the United States alone, it is \nestimated that it will cost over $600 billion to correct the millions \nof lines of computer program code. Not only are these corrections \nexpensive, the process of analyzing, correcting, testing and \nintegrating software and hardware has become a heavy management burden \non all levels of government as well as the private sector.\n  Although the federal government has been working to meet the time \nconstraints of the Y2K deadline, the General Accounting Office has \nfound that problems still remain with computer systems at every federal \nagency they examined. Overall, it is estimated that the federal \ngovernment must check at least 7,336 mission critical computer systems. \nSome larger systems, those used by the Internal Revenue Service, for \nexample, have more than 60 lines of code per system. The Office of \nManagement and Budget has established an interagency committee to \nfacilitate federal efforts to instruct each federal agency on the best \npossible solutions.\n\n  Some federal agencies are closer to achieving Y2K compliance than \nothers. The Treasury Department's Financial Management Service, \nresponsible for paying Social Security disability and retirement \nbenefits, Veterans' benefits, and IRS refunds, installed two new Y2K \ncompliant systems earlier this month. Treasury Department officials are \nconfident they will be ready and checks will arrive on time.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration is among the agencies furthest \nbehind in this process. This is of particular concern to me. A recent \nsurvey by the Air Transport Association of America shows that 35 \npercent of our nation's airports surveyed do not yet have a Y2K plan \nand that only 20 of 81 of our country's larger airports are on schedule \nto fix their Y2K problems. Although FAA officials testified that they \nwill, in fact, be fully compliant by the end of June 1999, this will \nnot give their administrators much time for testing the updated \nsystems. The Transportation Department is prepared to shut down unsafe \naviation systems domestically and will be working with the State \nDepartment to access the safety of international systems so they will \nbe ready to stop flights to unsafe airports. Unless we can accelerate \nY2K compliance at our airports, the rippling Y2K effect on air travel \ncould make air travel inconvenient and costly to the American traveler.\n  During this session of Congress, we have devoted a great deal of \nattention to the Y2K challenge. A special Senate Subcommittee on Y2K, \nheaded by our colleague from Utah, Senator Robert Bennett, held several \nhearings to raise awareness of this problem and to discuss possible \nsolutions. To expedite the federal government's efforts to correct\n\n[[Page S12644]]\n\nall agency computer systems, last year Congress provided $86 million to \nperform Y2K updates at the Federal Aviation Administration, the \nTreasury Department and the Health Care Financing Administration. This \nfall, Congress is expected to provide another $3.25 billion in \nemergency funding to ensure the federal government can fully meet the \nY2K challenge.\n  We also need to encourage companies, large and small, to meet this \nchallenge. During congressional hearings, representatives from the \nprivate sector discussed hesitancy to disclose any information about \ntheir own Y2K progress. Companies are reluctant to work together based \nalmost entirely on fears of potential litigation and legal liabilities. \nFor example, in my state of Ohio, NCR, a world-wide provider of \ninformation technology solutions, has been working on Y2K solutions \nsince 1996. NCR made valuable progress in research on its own \npreparedness for Y2K and in finding solutions to help other businesses \nprepare for the millennium. Unfortunately, they were hesitant to \ndeliver these statements for fear that they would be sued. In order to \nencourage the private sector to share valuable information and \nexperiences, these lines of communication need to be open. Congress \nrecently passed legislation, S. 2392, to encourage companies to freely \ndiscuss potential Y2K problems, solutions, test results and readiness \namongst themselves. This law will provide businesses the temporary \nprotection from lawsuits regarding statements made about Y2K.\n\n  As the chairman of the Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition \nSubcommittee, I am usually reluctant to support any exemption from our \nantitrust laws. As a general proposition it is very important that \nthese laws apply broadly to all sectors of the economy to protect \nconsumers and allow businesses to operate in an environment of fair and \nrigorous competition. However, I do support the narrow, temporary \nexemption passed by Congress as a part of our overall effort to address \nthe Y2K problem.\n  This exemption does not cover conduct such as price fixing or group \nboycotts. Even with these important limitations this antitrust \nexemption should provide significant protection for those who might \notherwise be reluctant to pool resources and share information.\n  S. 2392 is crucial to opening the lines of communication between \ncompanies, particularly those in the utility and telecommunications \nindustries, which were cited by the Senate Y2K Subcommittee as its top \npriority for review. This legislation will be a giant step in \nimplementing Y2K solutions. Not only will the bill promote discussion, \nit will also establish a single government website for access to Y2K \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, both the supplemental spending and information sharing \nbills represent the kind of effort we need to meet the Y2K challenge. \nWithout question, we are in an era of rapid communication and \ninnovation, and the role computer technology plays in our daily lives \nis a constant reminder of this fact. Now, with this technology at risk \nof disrupting our lives as we usher in a new century and millennium, \nour ability to both communicate and to innovate will be put to the test \nover the next 14 months. It will take a combined effort from the public \nand private sector to pass this test.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12643-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12644-S12645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FAILURE TO PASS JUVENILE CRIME LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Friday, the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, my good friend from Utah, spoke on the floor about juvenile \njustice legislation. He indicated that he will be urging the Majority \nLeader to make this issue one of the top legislative priorities in the \n106th Congress. It is indeed unfortunate that the Senate has failed to \nconsider legislation in this important area.\n  Improving our Nation's juvenile justice system and preventing \njuvenile delinquency has strong bipartisan support in Congress and in \nthe White House. That is why I and other Democrats have introduced \njuvenile crime legislation both at the beginning and the end of this \nCongress. Within the first weeks of the 105th Congress, I joined \nSenator Daschle in introducing the ``Youth Violence, Crime and Drug \nAbuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, and last month introduced, with the \nsupport of Senators Daschle, Biden and other Democratic members, the \n``Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484. \nThat is why the Administration transmitted juvenile crime legislation, \nthe ``Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1997,'' S. 362, which \nI introduced with Senator Biden on the Administration's behalf in \nFebruary 1997.\n  Given the strong interest in this issue from both sides of the aisle, \nthe failure of the Senate to consider juvenile crime legislation would \nappear puzzling. Indeed, the House passed juvenile justice legislation \nthree times this year, when it sent to the Senate H.R. 3 on May 8, \n1997, H.R. 1818 on July 15, 1997, and both these bills again attached \nto S. 2073 on September 15, 1998. The Senate juvenile crime bill, S. \n10, was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997, and then left \nto languish for over a year.\n  The Republicans have never called up S. 10 for consideration by the \nfull Senate. Instead, in early September they rushed to the floor with \nno warning and offered terms for bringing up the bill that would have \nsignificantly limited debate and amendments on the many controversial \nitems in the bill. For example, although the substitute juvenile crime \nbill that the Republicans wanted to debate contained over 160 changes \nfrom the Committee-reported bill, the majority wished to limit \nDemocratic amendments to five. This offer was unacceptable, as the \nRepublicans well knew before they ever offered it.\n  We should recognize this offer for what it is: a procedural charade \nengaged in by the Republicans in a feeble effort to place the blame on \nthe minority for the majority's failure to bring up juvenile justice \nlegislation in the Senate. Nevertheless, I suggested a plan for a full \nand fair debate on S. 10. On September 25, 1998, I put in the record a \nproposal that would have limited the amendments offered by Democrats to \nthe most controversial aspects of the bill, such as restoring the core \nprotection for juvenile status offenders to keep them out of jail, \nkeeping juveniles who are in custody separated from adult inmates, and \nensuring adequate prevention funding.\n  I never heard back from the Republicans. They simply ignored my \nproposal, and failed to turn to this issue again on the floor of the \nSenate. These facts make clear that assertions about Democrats refusing \nproposals to limit the number of amendments to S. 10, and refusing to \npermit a conference on House-passed legislation, could not be farther \nfrom the truth. Indeed, no proposal to agree to a conference was ever \npropounded on the floor of the Senate.\n  During the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at \nhearings on numerous occasions about my concerns with S. 10, including \non November 13, 1997, January 29, 1998, April 1, 1998, June 23, 1998, \nand September 8, 1998. On each of those occasions, I expressed my \nwillingness to work with the Chairman in a bipartisan manner to improve \nthis bill. Since Committee consideration of the bill, I have continued \nto raise the areas of concern that went unaddressed in the Committee-\nreported bill. Specifically, I was concerned that the bill skimped on \neffective prevention efforts to stop children from getting into trouble \nin the first place.\n  Second, I was concerned that the bill would gut the core protections, \nwhich have been in place for over 20 years to protect children that \ncome into contact with the criminal justice system and keep them out of \nharm's way from adult inmates, to keep status and nonoffenders out of \njail altogether, and to address disproportionate minority confinement.\n  Third, I was concerned about the federalization of juvenile crime due \nto S. 10's elimination of the requirement that federal courts may only \nget involved in prosecutions of juveniles for offenses with which the \nfederal government has concurrent jurisdiction with the State, if the \nState cannot or declines to prosecute the juvenile.\n  Finally, I was concerned the new accountability block grant in S. 10 \ncontained onerous eligibility requirements that would end up imposing \non the States a one-size-fits-all uniform sewn-up in Washington for \ndealing with juvenile crime. I know many States viewed\n\n[[Page S12645]]\n\nthis bill as a straight-jacket, which is why it was opposed by the \nNational Governors' Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National Association of Counties and the Council of \nState Governments.\n  Unfortunately, productive negotiations on this bill did not commence \nin earnest until the final days of this Congress. The fact that \nnegotiations began at all is due in no small part to the efforts and \nleadership of Representatives Bill McCollum, Charles Schumer, Frank \nRiggs, Bobby Scott and John Conyers. They and their staffs have worked \ntirelessly on this issue and to address many of the concerns that were \nraised about the juvenile crime legislation.\n  Over the past week, I have worked with Senators Hatch, Sessions, \nBiden, Kennedy, Kohl, Feingold and Bingaman, and our House \ncounterparts, to craft bipartisan legislation that could be passed in \nthe final days of this Congress. While our last-minute efforts to \ncomplete action on this bill were unsuccessful, I appreciate the good \nfaith in which these bipartisan, bicameral negotiations took place and \nrecognize the important compromises that were offered on all sides. \nTime ran out in this Congress to get our job done on this legislation.\n  I appreciate the frustration of many of my Republican colleagues \nabout our inability to achieve consensus on juvenile justice \nlegislation because I know that those frustrations are shared by me and \nmy Democratic colleagues. It is unfortunate that the majority did not \nchose to begin these negotiations, and did not chose to start \naddressing the significant criticisms of this bill, until the last \nminutes of this Congress.\n  When the 106th Congress convenes, and we again turn our attention to \njuvenile justice legislation, my hope is that the good work we have \naccomplished over the last week is the starting point. If not, I fear \nthat the 106th Congress will end up at the same place we are today: \nwith no juvenile justice legislation to show as an accomplishment for \nall of us. I thank all who have been willing to make the effort in the \nfinal days, and look forward to completing this work early next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12644-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12645-S12646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CBO PROJECT ANALYSES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the time the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources filed its reports on H.R. 4079, to authorize the \nconstruction of temperature control devices at Folsom Dam in \nCalifornia, and H.R. 3687, the Canadian River Prepayment Act, the \nanalyses from the Congressional Budget Office were not available. Those \nanalyses have now been received. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record for the advice of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n     H.R. 4079--An act to authorize the construction of \n         temperature control devices at Folsom Dam in California\n       Summary: H.R. 4079 would authorize the Secretary of the \n     Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to \n     construct devices for controlling and monitoring water \n     temperatures at Folsom Dam and certain nonfederal facilities. \n     Temperature control devices allow water to be diverted from a \n     higher point in the water column of a reservoir, thereby \n     preserving cool water for fish. The act would authorize the \n     appropriation of $7 million (in October 1997 dollars) for \n     construction and such sums as necessary for operating, \n     maintaining, and replacing the devices. A portion of these \n     amounts would be repaid by water and power users in the \n     region.\n       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4079 would result in \n     additional outlays of $7 million over the 1999-2003 period, \n     assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts. H.R. \n     4079 would affect direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4079 \n     would decrease direct spending by about $400,000 over the \n     1999-2003 period. The legislation contains no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would have no \n     significant impact on the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 4079 is shown in the following \n     table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        By fiscal years, in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        1999   2000   2001   2002   2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\nEstimated Authorization Level........      7  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)\nEstimated Outlays....................      5      1      1  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Less than $500,000.\n\n       Basis of estimate: For purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that H.R. 4079 will be enacted by the beginning of \n     fiscal year 1999 and that the estimated amounts necessary to \n     implement the act will be appropriated each year.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       H.R. 4079 would authorize the appropriation of $5 million \n     for constructing a temperature control device and monitoring \n     apparatus at Folsom Dam and $2 million for constructing \n     similar mechanisms at nearby nonfederal facilities. Those \n     amounts are authorized in October 1997 dollars and may be \n     adjusted to reflect inflation, but such adjustments would not \n     be significant if funds are provided in fiscal year 1999 or \n     2000. Based on information provided by the bureau, CBO \n     expects that construction at Folsom Dam would be completed in \n     1999 and that construction at nonfederal facilities would be \n     completed by 2001, if the necessary appropriations are \n     provided. CBO estimates that the annual cost of operating, \n     maintaining, and replacing these devices over the 1999-2003 \n     period would be negligible.\n     Direct spending\n       About $4 million of the cost of constructing the \n     temperature control device and monitoring apparatus at Folsom \n     Dam would be repaid by water and power users. (The costs of \n     devices at nonfederal facilities would not be repaid.) CBO \n     estimates that repayments would total $140,000 annually over \n     the 2001-2030 period. (Because water and power rates are set \n     one year in advance, there would be a one-year lag between \n     the year the project is completed, 1999, and the year that \n     repayment begins.)\n       Pay-as-you-go-considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4079 would affect \n     direct spending but that there would be no significant impact \n     in any year. Enacting this legislation would not affect \n     governmental receipts.\n       Estimated intergovernmental and private sector impact: H.R. \n     4079 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates \n     as defined in UMRA and would have no significant impact on \n     the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On August 10, 1998, CBO provided an \n     estimate for H.R. 4079, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Resources on July 29, 1998. The two versions of \n     the legislation and their estimated costs are identical.\n       Estimate prepared by: Gary Brown.\n       Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n                                  ____\n\n     H.R. 3687--Canadian River Project Prepayment Act\n       Summary: H.R. 3687 would authorize prepayment by the \n     Canadian River Municipal Water Authority of amounts due for \n     the pipeline and related facilities of the Canadian River \n     Project in Texas. Current law provides for conveying title \n     for these elements to the authority once repayment is \n     complete.\n       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3687 would slightly reduce \n     discretionary spending, and would yield a net decrease in \n     direct spending of $26 million over the 1999-2003 period. \n     That near-term cash savings would be offset on a present-\n     value basis, however, by the loss of currently scheduled \n     payments. Because H.R. 3687 would affect direct spending, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       The act contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). State and local governments might incur some costs as \n     a result of H.R. 3687's enactment, but these costs would be \n     voluntary.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 3687 is shown in the following \n     table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        By fiscal years, in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                     -----------------------------------\n                                       1999    2000   2001   2002   2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             DIRECT SPENDING\nSpending Under Current law: \\1\\\n  Estimated Budget Authority........       0      0     -3     -3     -3\n  Estimated Outlays.................       0      0     -3     -3     -3\nProposed Changes:\n  Estimated Budget Authority........     -35      0      3      3      3\n  Estimated Outlays.................     -35      0      3      3      3\nSpending Under H.R. 3687:\n  Estimated Budget Authority........     -35      0      0      0      0\n  Estimated Outlays.................     -35      0      0      0      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The next payment from the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority\n  is not due until 2001.\n\n       Basis of estimate: CBO assumes that H.R. 3687 is enacted \n     near the beginning of fiscal year 1999 and that prepayment \n     will occur within this fiscal year. (The authority to prepay \n     would expire 360 days after enactment.)\n     Direct spending\n       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3687 would result in a \n     prepayment to the federal government of about $35 million in \n     1999. After prepayment, the authority would no longer make \n     the regularly scheduled payment of $3 million a year over the \n     2001-2022 period.\n\n[[Page S12646]]\n\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority pays 100 \n     percent of the cost of operating and maintaining the Canadian \n     River project dam, reservoir, pipeline, and related \n     facilities. The Bureau of Reclamation reimburses the \n     authority for about 26 percent of the cost of operating and \n     maintaining the project dam and reservoir. The 1998 \n     appropriated amount for this purpose was about $30,000. \n     Enacting H.R. 3687 would eliminate this annual federal cost \n     as early as 1999.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in outlays that are subject to pay-\n     as-you-go procedures are shown in the following table. For \n     the purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the budget year and the succeeding four years are \n     counted. Enacting H.R. 3687 would not affect governmental \n     receipts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays........................        -35          0          3          3          3          3          3          3          3          3\nChanges in receipts.......................

The conveyance authorized by this legislation would \n     be voluntary on the part of the authority, and any costs \n     incurred as a result would be accepted by them on that basis. \n     As conditions of the conveyance, H.R. 3687 would require the \n     authority to prepay its outstanding obligations to the \n     federal government and to assume all responsibility for the \n     operations and maintenance costs of the project.

A bill to promote economically sound modernization of \nelectric power generation capacity in the United States, to establish \nrequirements to improve the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil \nfuel-fired electric utility generating units, to reduce emissions of \nmercury, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, to \nrequire that all fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units \noperating in the United States meet new source review requirements, and \nto promote alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we approach the close of the 105th \nCongress, it is time to take stock of our accomplishments, and reflect \non the work that remains. When the environmental record of this \nCongress is tallied up, there won't be much to show. At best, we have \navoided a great roll-back of environmental protections. We can't claim \nto have broken much new ground.\n  To her credit, Carol Browner and her staff at the Environmental \nProtection Agency have tried to push ahead in a very difficult \npolitical climate. Administrator Browner recently announced that EPA \nwas ordering 22 Eastern states to make sharp cuts in emissions of the \npollutants that result in summertime ozone pollution. A significant \nportion of these pollutants come from coal-fired power plants. The \npredictable howl from the utility companies and their lobbyists is \nbeing heard on Capitol Hill. I applaud Administrator Browner and her \nstaff for their persistence on this important issue.\n  Even though this is a good step, it doesn't go far enough. Stronger, \nmore comprehensive action is needed to finally address the whole gamut \nof air pollution problems that spew from power plant smoke stacks.\n  Taken collectively, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the \nlargest source of air pollution in the United States. It is clear by \nnow that the current Clean Air Act and its regulations are not up to \nthe job of addressing the local, regional and global public health and \nenvironmental burdens imposed by the emissions from these plants. \nCongress took a big step to control air pollution with the Clean Air \nAct of 1970, and it did major rewrites of the Act in 1977 and 1990. \nEven with all this legislation on the books, most fossil fuel-fired \npower plants produce as much pollution as they did prior to 1970. The \naverage fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the United States came \ninto operation in 1964--six years before the 1970 Act. Seventy-seven \npercent of the fossil fuel generating units in operation in the United \nStates began operation before the 1970 Clean Air Act was implemented, \nand are thus not subject to the full force of its regulations.\n  At the very heart of the environmental problems posed by this \nindustry are the antiquated and inefficient combustion technologies \nthat are used. Nothing in the Clean Air Act, or in other energy related \nstatues, tackles this inefficiency. The average plant uses technology \ndevised in the 1950's or before, and has a combustion efficiency of \n33%. Put another way, 67% of the energy available in the fuel is \nwasted. When you get so little energy out of the fuel, you have to burn \na lot more fuel to produce a given quantity of electricity. The more \nfuel you burn, the more pollution you get. Increasing efficiency is the \nonly way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and burning less fuel will \nresult in smaller amounts of all pollutants.\n  Burning all this fuel may be good for the bottom line of the \ncompanies that produce the coal, oil, and natural gas, but it imposes \ngreat environmental and health consequences on the rest of us. Many of \nmy colleagues came to the Senate after successful business careers. I \nimagine that most would agree with me that any other business that was \nthis wasteful would not survive for long.\n  To produce the power that our economy needs, some level of emissions \nis inevitable. But this inefficiency, coupled with the free ride on \nemissions that the pre-1970 plants get, exacts an enormous \nenvironmental cost. Consider the following power plant facts:\n  Every year, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States \nproduced a staggering 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the primary \n``greenhouse gas,'' the equivalent weight of 24,655 Washington \nMonuments.\n  Over 600 of these generating units produce over one million tons of \ncarbon dioxide per year--two produce more than 9 million tons per year.\n  On average, coal plants emit over 2,100 pounds of carbon dioxide for \nevery megawatt hour of electricity that is generated.\n  Coal-fired power plants emit at least 52 tons of mercury per year and \nare the leading source of mercury pollution in the United States.\n  Power plants emit particulate and urban ozone pollution that impair \nrespiratory function in people with asthma, emphysema, and other \nrespiratory ailments.\n  Power plant emissions result in acid deposition, which damages lakes, \nstreams and rivers, and the plants and animals that depend on them for \nsurvival.\n  Technology exists that can raise power plant efficiencies to 35% to \n50% above current levels. The question is how to get utilities to \nretire their inefficient processes and bring new, clean, and efficient \nones on line. We can see a better future, but we don't have a clear \npath to get there.\n  Today, I am introducing the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act \nof 1998'' to help us get to the other side. My goals with this \nlegislation are to\n\n[[Page S12649]]\n\nchart a sensible and balanced course for the future that: protects \npublic health and the environment; protects consumers, workers, and the \neconomy; and provides electrical power producers with a clear set of \nachievable performance expectations and financial incentives for \ninstalling new, clean, and efficient electrical power generating \ncapacity that will meet our needs into the 21st Century.\n  This industry plays a central role in the U.S. economy and in our \ndaily lives. We expect that electrical service will be reliable, \npredictable and affordable. We flip on the switch without giving a \nsecond thought that the light will go on. My bill will not change that.\n  Major changes cannot be made over night. We know about inertia From \nSir Isaac Newton's First Law of Motion that ``any object in a state of \nrest or uniform linear motion will remain in such a state unless acted \nupon by an external force.'' The inertia in the utility industry to \ncontinue business as usual is overwhelming. The old, inefficient, \npollution-prone power plants will continue to operate in perpetuity \nbecause they are paid for, they burn the cheapest fuel, and they are \nsubject to less stringent environmental requirements.\n\n  My bill provides an ``external force'' in the form of financial and \nregulatory incentives to prompt modernization that is beneficial for \nthe environment and the economy. It provides industry decision-makers \nwith a comprehensive and predictable set of requirements and incentives \nto guide their long-term business planning.\n  For investor-owned utilities, the bill provides accelerated \ndepreciation tax incentives for plants that meet the efficiency goals. \nUnder current tax law, new generating capacity is depreciated over a 20 \nyear period. Under my bill, new capacity that meets a 45% efficiency \nlevel would be depreciated over a 15 year period, and new capacity that \nmeets a 50% efficiency level would be depreciated over a 10 year \nperiod. Publicly owned utilities would be eligible for grants that have \nthe equivalent monetary value of the depreciation benefit received by a \nsimilarly-situated investor-owned utility. This approach will spur \ninnovation, and will reward utilities that aggressively move to \nincrease their efficiency and reduce their emissions.\n  To pay for these incentives and to achieve this within the balanced \nbudget constraints, my bill establishes a fee that would be levied on \ncarbon dioxide emissions. The emission fees would also provide funds: \nfor worker retraining for individuals adversely affected by reduced \nconsumption of coal; community redevelopment funds; research and \ndevelopment for renewable technologies such as wind, solar, and \nbiomass; development of a carbon sequestration strategy; and \nimplementing carbon sequestration projects including soil restoration, \ntree planting, preservation of wetlands, and other ways of biologically \nsequestering carbon dioxide.\n  I want to work cooperatively with the power companies on this \nlegislation, and I want to work with my colleagues from coal-producing \nstates to minimize the impact of reduced coal consumption on mine \nworkers and mining communities. I also want to work with my colleagues \non the Committees that are taking up utility restructuring legislation \nto ensure that this industry, whether in its current form or in a \nrestructured form, finally comes to terms with the environmental costs \nof its operations.\n  While the 105th Congress may not have much of an environmental record \nto brag about, pressure is mounting to dramatically reduce the \nenvironmental impact from fossil fuel fired power plants. The people of \nVermont are willing, I look forward to working hard in the first \nsession of the 106th Congress to enact this much needed and long-\noverdue piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the section-by-section overview be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2636\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old, \n     needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting powerplants to \n     provide electricity;\n       (2) the pollution from those powerplants causes a wide \n     range of health and environmental damage, including--\n       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the \n     deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;\n       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs \n     normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to \n     individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other \n     respiratory ailments;\n       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages \n     forests and wildlife;\n       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers, \n     and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them \n     for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;\n       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish \n     unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for \n     pregnant women and their fetuses;\n       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and \n     streams; and\n       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and \n     irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;\n       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--\n       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities \n     to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in \n     operation; and\n       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new, \n     clean, and efficient generating technologies;\n       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants \n     fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce nearly \n     two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;\n       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the \n     average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired \n     power plants in the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent \n     of the heat generated by burning the fuel is wasted;\n       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent \n     above current levels, and technological advances are possible \n     that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even \n     more;\n       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of \n     mercury emissions in the United States, releasing an \n     estimated 52 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;\n       (8) in 1996, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United \n     States produced over 2,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide, \n     the primary greenhouse gas;\n       (9) on average--\n       (A) fossil fuel-fired power plants emit 1,999 pounds of \n     carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity \n     produced;\n       (B) coal-fired power plants emit 2,110 pounds of carbon \n     dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity produced; and\n       (C) coal-fired power plants emit 205 pounds of carbon \n     dioxide for every million British thermal units of fuel \n     consumed;\n       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the \n     United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to \n     establish requirements for stationary sources;\n       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23 \n     percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to \n     stringent new source performance standards under section 111 \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and\n       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as \n     ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less \n     stringent requirements;\n       (12) on the basis of scientific and medical evidence, \n     exposure to mercury and mercury\n\n[[Page S12650]]\n\n     compounds is of concern to human health and the environment;\n       (13) pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of \n     childbearing age, and children are most at risk for mercury-\n     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;\n       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds \n     occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-\n     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--\n       (A) ingestion of breast milk;\n       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish, \n     that are contaminated with methyl mercury; and\n       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;\n       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to \n     Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific \n     knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury \n     emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and \n     mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;\n       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report \n     described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between \n     mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil \n     fuels and methyl mercury concentrations in freshwater fish;\n       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned \n     the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared \n     to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and\n       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased \n     from 899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent;\n       (17) pollution from powerplants can be reduced and possibly \n     eliminated through adoption of modern technologies and \n     practices, including--\n       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more \n     efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized \n     bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle \n     system;\n       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from \n     fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;\n       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution \n     controls;\n       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable \n     resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;\n       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy \n     from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel \n     cells; and\n       (F) methods of extracting and using heat that would \n     otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of heating or cooling \n     office buildings, providing steam to processing facilities, \n     or otherwise increasing total efficiency; and\n       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in \n     paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and \n     productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the \n     future.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while \n     safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired \n     generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are \n     technologically feasible through modernization and \n     application of pollution controls;\n       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon \n     dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the \n     environment from combustion of fossil fuels;\n       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by \n     increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil \n     fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through use \n     of commercially available combustion technology, installation \n     of pollution controls, and expanded use of renewable energy \n     sources such as biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind sources;\n       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to \n     retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace \n     them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency \n     combustion technology; and\n       (B) to increase use of renewable energy sources such as \n     biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind sources;\n       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund for the purpose \n     of encouraging and facilitating the modernization of fossil \n     fuel-fired generating units in the United States;\n       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean \n     Air Act relating to sources in operation before the \n     promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7411);\n       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent \n     reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are \n     accomplished through the retirement of old units and \n     replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act \n     should be credited to the utility sector in any climate \n     change implementation program;\n       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury \n     recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems, \n     and other methods of mercury pollution control;\n       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury \n     exposure and the threat to public health from mercury, \n     particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and \n     their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;\n       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health \n     and the environment posed by mercury;\n       (11) to promote energy efficiency in homes, including major \n     appliances;\n       (12) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely \n     affected by reduced consumption of coal; and\n       (13) to provide economic development incentives for \n     communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of \n     coal.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The bill \n     encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking.\n       The bill encourages ``retirement and replacement'' of old, \n     dirty, inefficient generating capacity. It does not utilize a \n     ``cap and trade'' approach. Many believe that the \n     ``retirement and replacement'' approach does a superior job \n     at the local and regional levels of protecting public health \n     and the environment from mercury pollution, ozone pollution, \n     and acid deposition. On a global level, the ``retirement and \n     replacement'' also does a much superior job of permanently \n     reducing the volume of carbon dioxide emitted.\n       Section 4. Combustion Heat Rate Efficiency Standards for \n     Fossil Fuel-Fired Generating Units.\n       Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States operate \n     at an average combustion efficiency of 33%. Put another way, \n     on average, 67% of the heat generated by burning the fuel is \n     wasted. Increasing combustion efficiency is really the only \n     way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Section 4 lays out a \n     phased two-stage process for increasing efficiency. In the \n     first stage, by 10 years after enactment, all units in \n     operation must achieve a combustion heat rate efficiency of \n     not less than 45%. In the second stage, with expected \n     advances in combustion technology, units commencing operation \n     more than 10 years after enactment must achieve\n\n[[Page S12653]]\n\n     a combustion heat rate efficiency of not less than 50%. \n     Carbon dioxide emission reductions of at least 650 million \n     tons per year are expected, and the potential exists for even \n     larger reductions.\n       If, for some unforeseen reason, technological advances do \n     not achieve the 50% efficiency level, Section 4 contains a \n     waiver provision that allows owners of new units to offset \n     any shortfall in carbon dioxide emissions through \n     implementation of carbon sequestration projects.\n       Section 5. Air Emission Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired \n     Generating Units.\n       Subsection (a) eliminates the ``grand father'' loophole in \n     the Clean Air Act and requires all units, regardless of when \n     they were constructed or began operation, to comply with \n     existing new source review requirements under Section 111 of \n     the Clean Air Act.\n       Subsection (b) sets mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur \n     dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards for units that \n     are subject to the 45% thermal efficiency standards set forth \n     in Section 4. For mercury, 95% removal of mercury contained \n     in the fuel is required. For carbon dioxide, the emission \n     limits are set by fuel type (i.e., natural gas = 0.9 pounds \n     per kilowatt hour of output; fuel oil = 1.3 pounds per \n     kilowatt hour of output; coal = 1.55 pounds per kilowatt hour \n     of output). Ninety-five percent of sulfur dioxide emissions \n     (and not more than 0.3 pounds per million Btu's of fuel \n     consumed), and 90 percent of nitrogen oxides (and not more \n     than 0.15 pounds per million Btu's of fuel consumed) are to \n     be removed.\n       Subsection (c) contains the same emission standards for \n     mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides as those in \n     Subsection (b). Greater combustion efficiency results in \n     lower emissions of carbon dioxide, and the fuel specific \n     emission limits at the 50% efficiency level are lowered \n     accordingly (i.e., natural gas = 0.8 pounds per kilowatt hour \n     of output; fuel oil = 1.2 pounds per kilowatt hour of output; \n     coal = 1.4 pounds per kilowatt hour of output). Section 6. \n     Accelerated Depreciation for Investor-Owned Generating Units.\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilities can \n     depreciate their generating equipment over a 20 year period. \n     Section 6 amends Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to allow for depreciation over a 15 year period for \n     units meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission \n     standards in Section 5(b). Section 168 is further amended to \n     allow for deprecation over a 10 year period for units meeting \n     the 50% efficiency level and the emission standards in \n     Section 5(c).\n       Section 7. Grants for Publicly-Owned Generating Units. No \n     federal taxes are paid on publicly-owned generating units. To \n     provide publicly-owned utilities with comparable incentives \n     to modernize, Section 7 provides for annual grants in an \n     amount equal to the monetary value of the depreciation \n     deduction that would be realized by a similarly-situated \n     investor owned generating unit under Section 6. Units meeting \n     the 45% efficiency level and the emission standards in \n     Section 5(b) would receive annual grants over a 15 year \n     period, and units meeting the 50% efficiency level and the \n     emission standards in Section 5(c) would receive annual \n     grants over 10 year period.\n       Section 8. Clean Air Trust Fund, and Section 9. Carbon \n     Dioxide Emission Fees.\n       To offset the impact to the Treasury of the incentives in \n     Sections 6 and 7, the bill establishes the Clean Air Trust \n     Fund. The Trust Fund is similar to the Highway Trust Fund or \n     the Superfund. The revenue for the trust fund will be \n     provided through phased implementation of a ``per ton fee'' \n     on emissions of carbon dioxide. Implementation of the fee \n     would begin 3 years after enactment at the rate of $25.00 per \n     ton. The rate would increase to $37.50 per ton seven years \n     after enactment, and would be fully implemented 10 years \n     after enactment at a rate of $50.00 per ton.\n       The Trust Fund will also be used to pay for assistance to \n     workers and communities adversely affected by reduced \n     consumption of coal, research and development for renewable \n     power generation technologies (e.g., wind, solar, and \n     biomass), and carbon sequestration projects.\n       Section 10. Extension of Renewable Energy Production \n     Credit.\n       Section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended to include solar power, and to extend renewable \n     energy production credit to 2010 (it is currently set to \n     expire in 1999). This section expands on S. 1459 (Senator \n     Leahy is a co-sponsor) which would extend the credit to 2004. \n     S. 1459 has been referred to the Finance Committee.\n       Section 11. Recognition of Permanent Emission Reductions in \n     Future Climate Change Implementation Programs.\n       This section expresses the sense of Congress that permanent \n     reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides \n     that are accomplished through the retirement of old \n     generating units and replacement by new generating units that \n     meet the efficiency and emissions standards in the bill, or \n     through replacement with non-polluting renewable power \n     generation technologies, should be credited to the utility \n     sector and to the owner/operator in any climate change \n     implementation program enacted by Congress.\n       Section 12. Renewable Power Generation Technologies.\n       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides \n     $75 million per year (for a total of $975 million over 13 \n     years) to fund research and development programs and \n     commercial demonstration projects and partnerships to \n     demonstrate the commercial viability and environmental \n     benefits of electric power generation from biomass, \n     geothermal, solar, and wind technologies. Types of projects \n     may include solar power tower plants, solar dishes and \n     engines, co-firing biomass with coal, biomass modular \n     systems, next-generation wind turbines and wind verification \n     projects, and geothermal energy conversion.\n       Section 13. Evaluation of Implementation of this Act and \n     other Statutes.\n       Not later than 2 years after enactment, DOE, in \n     consultation with EPA and FERC, shall report to Congress on \n     the implementation of the Clean Power Plant and Modernization \n     Act of 1998. The report shall identify any provision of the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Energy Supply and \n     Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, the Public Utilities \n     Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, or the Powerplant and \n     Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 that conflicts with the \n     efficient implementation of the Clean Power Plant and \n     Modernization Act of 1998. The report shall include \n     recommendations for legislative or administrative measures to \n     harmonize and streamline these other statutes.\n       Section 14. Assistance for Workers Adversely Affected by \n     Reduced Consumption of Coal.\n       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a \n     total of $850 million over 13 years ($75 million per year for \n     the first 8 years and $50 million per year for the following \n     5 years) to provide assistance to coal industry workers who \n     are adversely affected as a result of reduced consumption of \n     coal by the electric power generation industry. The funds \n     will be administered under the economic dislocation and \n     worker adjustment assistance program of the Department of \n     Labor authorized by Title III of the Job Training Partnership \n     Act.\n       Section 15. Community Economic Development Incentives for \n     Communities Adversely Affected by Reduced Consumption of \n     Coal.\n       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a \n     total of $850 million over 13 years ($75 million per year for \n     the first 8 years and $50 million per year for the following \n     5 years) to provide assistance to communities adversely \n     affected as a result of reduced consumption of coal by the \n     electric power generation industry. The funds will be \n     administered under the economic adjustment program of the \n     Department of Commerce authorized by the Public Works and \n     Economic Development Act of 1965.\n       Section 16. Carbon Sequestration.\n       This section authorizes expenditure of $45 million over 3 \n     years for development of a long-term carbon sequestration \n     strategy for the United States. This section also authorizes \n     EPA and USDA to fund up to $195 million over 13 years ($15 \n     million per year) for carbon sequestration projects including \n     soil restoration, tree planting, wetlands protection, and \n     other ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n       S. 2639. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to \n     submit a report on the feasibility and desirability of \n     recovering the costs of high altitude lifesaving missions on \n     Mount McKinley in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    mount mckinley in denali national park and preserve legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOSWKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would require the Secretary of the Interior to report \nto Congress on the feasibility and desirability of recovering the cost \nto taxpayers of rescuing high altitude climbers on Mt. McKinley in \nDenali National Park and Preserve in the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, Denali National Park and Preserve attracts \napproximately 355,000 visitors per year who come to see the wildlife, \nthe grandeur of our State, and to gaze at America's highest peak. Most \nare unaware that while they are taking in the breathtaking vista that \nis Mt. McKinley, there are approximately another 1,100 persons per year \nthat are attempting to attain the 20,320 submit.\n  Climbimg Mt. McKinley is certainly no easy walk in the Park. A \ntypical year sees a dozen major rescue incidents and one or two fatal \naccidents. Extreme and unpredictable weather on Mt. McKinley make high \naltitude rescues very dangerous and very expensive.\n  Over the last few years the National Park Service has actively and \nsuccessfully worked to reduce the loss of life and injury to climbers \nwho have made attempts to climb this mountain. The NPS spends more than \n$750,000 per year for education; pre-positioning supplies and materials \nat various altitudes on the mountain; the positioning of a special high \naltitude helicopter in the Park; and actual rescue attempts.\n  Just last summer the military and the Park Service spent four days \nand $221,818 rescuing 6 sick and injured\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\nBritish climbers who disregarded warnings and advice from park ranger \nstationed on the mountain. This rescue included what is probably the \nworld's highest short haul helicopter rescue at 19,000 feet and \nentailed a very high level of risk for the rescue team. This is just \none example of many rescues the Park Service conducts each year on Mt. \nMcKinley.\n  Mr. President, I personally do not feel that the American taxpayer \nshould be left with the bill for rescues on this mountain. The Federal \nGovernment does not force these climbers to climb; they engage in this \nactivity voluntarily and with full knowledge of the risks. While I \nadmire the courage and tenacity of mountain climbers, I do not think it \nis fair to divert scarce park funds from services that benefit the \nmajority of park visitors for the purpose of providing extraordinarily \nexpensive services to a small number of users who put themselves in \nharm's way with their eyes wide open. Mountain climbers are a special \nbreed who are proud of their self-sufficiency and independence--and \nrightly so. For that reason I think they should recognize the simple \nequity of paying their fair share of the public costs of their sport.\n  As a result of a recent field hearing on this issue, I found that \nwhile I have received many letters of support, there are a few stalwart \nindividuals who do not agree with my point of view and have raised some \nlegitimate questions. That is why I want the Secretary of the Interior \nto look at the feasibility and desirability of some sort of a cost \nrecovery system that puts a minimal burden on climbers, whether it be \nan insurance requirement or any other scheme. The pros and cons of \nthese cost recovery mechanisms need to be carefully explored before we \nact.\n  Last but not least, Mr. President, I want the Secretary to evaluate \nrequiring climbers to show proof of medical insurance so that hospitals \nin Alaska and elsewhere are not left holding the bag as they sometimes \nare under present circumstances. It is a good neighbor policy that \nshould be put into effect at the earliest opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12648-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 261\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Bennett) was added as a cosponsor of S. 261, a bill to provide for \na biennial budget process and a biennial appropriations process and to \nenhance oversight and the performance of the Federal Government.\n\n\n                                S. 1089\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from New York \n(Mr. D'Amato) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1089, a bill to terminate \nthe effectiveness of certain amendments to the foreign repair station \nrules of the Federal Aviation Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1529\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Leahy) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1529, a bill to enhance \nFederal enforcement of hate crimes, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2418\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2418, a bill to establish rural opportunity communities, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 55\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the name of the Senator from Idaho (Mr. \nCraig) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 55, a joint \nresolution requesting the President to advance the late Rear Admiral \nHusband E.

Res. 309\n\n       Whereas under the Vietnamese communist occupation of \n     Cambodia (the former People's Republic of Kampuchea and the \n     State of Cambodia) between 1979 and 1989, Hun Sen was among a \n     large number of former Khmer Rouge members who were \n     designated by the Vietnamese communists as surrogate leaders \n     of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, where international \n     human rights organizations documented widespread human rights \n     violations;\n       Whereas during the period leading to internationally \n     supervised elections in 1993, as Prime Minister of the State \n     of Cambodia and a Politburo member of the communist Cambodian \n     People's Party (CPP), Hun Sen was responsible for the \n     disappearances, murder, and assassination attempts against \n     democratic opponents of the Cambodian People's Party;\n       Whereas after the Cambodian People's Party lost the 1993 \n     national election, Hun Sen organized a military force that \n     threatened a military coup, resulting in his being given a \n     share of the Prime Minister position with Prince Norodom \n     Ranariddh, the election winner, and his Cambodian People's \n     Party maintaining control of the military, the internal \n     security forces, and provincial government administration;\n       Whereas in July 1997, Hun Sen ordered a coup d'etat against \n     First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh which resulted in the \n     deaths of a large number of civilians caught in the crossfire \n     and the torture and summary execution of at least 100 \n     government officials and the forced displacement of at least \n     50,000 people as assaults continued on people or communities \n     loyal to Prince Ranariddh;\n       Whereas during the period leading to the July 1998 national \n     election there were widespread threats, assaults, and the \n     suspected assassination of scores of members of parties \n     opposed to Hun Sen;\n       Whereas in September 1998, Hun Sen ordered a violent \n     crackdown on thousands of unarmed demonstrators, including \n     Buddhist monks, who supported credible investigations of \n     irregularities in the electoral process and the change in the \n     format for allocating seats in the National Assembly which \n     permitted Hun Sen to maintain a small edge over Prince \n     Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC Party and entitled Hun Sen to maintain \n     the post of Prime Minister, which resulted in the brutality \n     toward tens of thousands of pro-democracy advocates and the \n     deaths and disappearances of an unknown number of people, and \n     led to widespread civil unrest which threatens to further \n     destroy Cambodian society; and\n       Whereas Hun Sen has held, and continues to hold, high \n     government office in a repressive and violent regime, and has \n     the power to decide for peace and democracy and has instead \n     decided for killing and repression, who has the power to \n     minimize illegal actions by subordinates and allies and hold \n     responsible those who committed such actions, but did not, \n     and who once again is directing a campaign of murder and \n     repression against unarmed civilians, while treating with \n     contempt international efforts to achieve a genuinely \n     democratic government in Cambodia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is a sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should establish a collection of \n     information that can be supplied to an appropriate \n     international judicial tribunal for use as evidence to \n     support a possible indictment and trial of Hun Sen for \n     violations of international humanitarian law after 1978;\n       (2) any such information concerning Hun Sen and individuals \n     under his authority already collected by the United States, \n     including information regarding the March 1997 grenade attack \n     against Sam Rainsy, should be provided to the tribunal at the \n     earliest possible time;\n       (3) the United States should work with members of \n     interested countries and nongovernmental organizations \n     relating to information any country or organization may hold \n     concerning allegations of violations of international \n     humanitarian law after 1978 posed against Hun Sen and any \n     individual under his authority in Cambodia and give all such \n     information to the tribunal;\n       (4) the United States should work with other interested \n     countries relating to measures to be taken to bring to \n     justice Hun Sen and individuals under Hun Sen's authority \n     indicted for such violations of international humanitarian \n     law after 1978; and\n       (5) the United States should support such a tribunal for \n     the purpose of investigating Hun Sen's possible criminal \n     culpability for conceiving, directing, and sustaining a \n     variety of actions in violation of international humanitarian \n     law after 1978 in any judicial proceeding that may result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12655-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIMES STRATEGY ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               GRASSLEY (AND D'AMATO) AMENDMENT NO. 3828\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for Mr. Grassley for himself and Mr. D'Amato) proposed an \namendment to the bill (H.R. 1756) to amend chapter 53 of title 31, \nUnited States Code, to require the development and implementation by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury of a national money laundering and \nrelated financial crimes strategy to combat money laundering and \nrelated financial crimes, and for other purposes;

This unmet need for \nfamily planning is projected to result in 1.2 billion unintended \nbirths.\n  The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in \nCairo determined that a combination of political commitment and \nappropriate programs designed to provide universal access to voluntary \nfamily planning information, education and services can ensure world \npopulation stabilization at 8 billion or less rather than 12 billion or \nmore.\n  We are pleased to support the week of October 24-31, 1998 as World \nPopulation Awareness Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12657-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ISLAMIC HOUSE OF WISDOM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to recognize \nan outstanding young fifth grade student from Kansas, Molly Allen. \nMolly is a student at Sunset Ridge Elementary School in Shawnee \nMission, and was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes in July. Since that \ntime, Molly brought awareness about this disease to her fellow \nclassmates by sharing her personal experience.\n  In addition, Molly organized her school's effort to raise money for \nthe Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's walk, which was Saturday, September \n19, 1998. This courageous young lady exemplifies leadership and \ncourage. I am proud to recognize one of Kansas' outstanding young \nleaders. I wish Molly continued success in her future endeavors, and I \nask that the Kansas City Star article featuring Molly follow my remarks \nin the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Kansas City Star, Sept. 19, 1998]\n\n                   Student Walking To Fight Diabetes\n\n                         (By Anne Christiansen)\n\n       When 10-year-old Molly Allen participates in the Walk to \n     Cure Diabetes today, she'll have 4 miles ahead of her and 459 \n     feet behind her.\n       That's how many paper sneakers cover the windows of her \n     elementary school--the newly opened Sunset Ridge. They're put \n     there as a visual indicator of how much money students have \n     raised so far--$459--only halfway through a six--day fund \n     drive that ends Wednesday.\n       Molly was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes in July. Since \n     that time, she's talked to classes at the school from her own \n     fifth grade right down to kindergarten.\n       ``They asked me why I have to wear this bracelet,'' she \n     said, twirling the medical alert chain around her wrist. \n     ``They ask me if the (insulin) shots hurt. They were really \n     pretty mature about it.''\n       She's brought in the device that measures the glucose in \n     her blood. She's taught her friends to look for signs of low \n     blood sugar.\n       She's also spearheaded the school's effort to raise money \n     for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's walk, which begins at \n     10 a.m. today in Shawnee Mission Park.\n       Principal Jane Fletcher said she has been impressed with \n     Molly's dedication.\n       ``She got on the intercom, and she said, `Thank you for \n     helping me.' that took a lot of courage,'' Fletcher said.\n       When school first started, some of the students were afraid \n     they would ``catch'' diabetes from Molly.\n       ``I had to explain to them that it wasn't that kind of \n     disease,'' she said.\n       She also had to explain to her class why she was allowed a \n     mid-morning snack in class while the rest of the students \n     salivated jealously.\n       ``They said, `What are you doing?' because only a few of \n     the girls knew before school started that I had diabetes,'' \n     she explained.\n\n[[Page S12658]]\n\n       Molly's mother, Norma Allen, said it wasn't easy for Molly \n     at first.\n       ``No child wants to be singled out as being different,'' \n     she said. ``But once everyone at school understood the \n     disease, they've been so supportive.''\n       Judy Marino, school nurse at Sunset Ridge, said she's been \n     thrilled with the response the students and staff have given \n     Molly.\n       ``Of course, she's done most of it by herself,'' she said. \n     ``She's a great girl.''\n       With a snack in her pocket, Molly has been able to stay \n     active in her long list of athletic interests: basketball, \n     cheerleading, softball, soccer, swimming and tennis.\n       She said she's looking forward to the walk today.\n       ``I feel like a lot of people care about me,'' she said. \n     ``With this much help, we will find a cure for \n     diabetes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/15/senate-section/article/S12657-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.
