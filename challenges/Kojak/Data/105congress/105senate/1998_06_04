Mr. President, it was about four months ago that I called \nthe Senate's distinguished chaplain and suggested that he might \nconsider inviting Rev. Shirley Caesar of Raleigh, North Carolina, to \nserve as the U.S. Senate's guest chaplain on some mutually convenient \noccasion.\n  I recall Dr. Ogilvie's response--a friendly suggestion that I tell \nhim about Pastor Caesar. I replied that I would do better than that--\nand I did, by sending Dr. Ogilvie a copy of a lengthy article published \nby the Washington Post on February 22.\n  In a moment, Mr. President, I shall ask unanimous consent that \nportions of that article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  But before I do that, let me summarize the fascinating Christian \nwitness of Rev. Shirley Caesar, pastor of Mount Calvary Word of Faith \nChurch in my hometown of Raleigh, N.C.\n  The Washington Post described Pastor Caesar this way:\n\n       On weekdays, (Pastor) Caesar, with a record number of nine \n     gospel Grammys--hits the road to share her voice with those \n     who come to hear her music and witness her presence as a \n     legendary performer on stages across America. But on Sundays \n     she returns to a plain maple pulpit in a simple whitewashed \n     church--comes home, not far from where she was born, to her \n     husband of 15 years, Bishop Harold Ivory Williams, and \n     preaches, ministers to everyday problems, and hears the \n     refrains.\n\n  Mr. President, I have selected several paragraphs from the Washington \nPost story of February 22, 1998, and shortly ask unanimous consent that \nthis information be published in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  But before I make that formal request, let me extend my personal \nwelcome to the Senate's remarkable guest chaplain for this day. I am \nproud of her and at the first opportunity, Dot Helms and I intend to \nworship one Sunday morning with Reverend Caesar.\n  Now, Mr. President, I make the formal unanimous consent request that \nI mentioned a minute or so ago.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Excerpts of Washington Post Article About Rev. Caesar\n\n       Small in stature and verging on 60, she is almost dwarfed \n     by the pulpit. So she moves out, microphone in hand, her \n     stylish pumps gleaming signals that the spirit is lifting \n     this room of 400 people who pray, jump to their feet and \n     sweat with their pastor.\n       She embraces a niece who has survived a bout with drugs.\n       ``The things she used to do, she don't do no more,'' Caesar \n     says. Sounds like the beginnings of a song to lift up. A \n     black handkerchief wipes her brow.\n       ``I want to be ready,'' she says. ``I don't want Him to \n     come here and find me getting ready,'' she says. She is ready \n     to rise.\n       She says of her calling, ``I don't want it to be said, I \n     wonder where Shirley Caesar is, I wonder if she is still \n     singing. I am. I believe that singing and preaching go \n     together like ham and eggs. So I just praise God that I am \n     still here.''\n       Meanwhile, for 40 years, first with the famous Caravans, \n     then as a solo performer, Caesar has been one of the most \n     energetic and popular performers in the music\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\n     business. In the gospel world, she is the bridge between \n     pioneers like Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward; she rode the \n     tidal wave of Edwin Hawkins and James Cleveland and now \n     shares a national spotlight with the Young Turks of gospel, \n     Vickie Winans and Kirk Franklin.\n       Like Ella Fitzgerald, she puts her stamp on songs, and they \n     never sound the same again--from works by such gospel masters \n     as Thomas A. Dorsey to religious verses by Bob Dylan. She \n     performs songs, many of which she writes, that are highly \n     personal--they reveal complicated lives lived by people who \n     may not have money, love or opportunity but who do have \n     faith.\n       In many of her songs, Caesar starts with a vignette of \n     crisis, sometimes with just the piano or organ in back of \n     her.\n       ``Have you ever walked the floor/all night long/wondering \n     how you were going to pay your bills?'' she sings at the \n     beginning of the wonderful ``You're Next in Line for a \n     Miracle.''\n       She repeats the lyrics, her raw voice demanding emotional \n     response.\n       ``Get ready for your miracle/Move to the front of the line/\n     Today is your day . . . get ready, get ready, you are next in \n     line for a miracle--a miracle!''\n       The orchestration expands and the choir sings the refrain \n     above Caesar's ``Hallelujahs.'' On Wednesday, ``A Miracle in \n     Harlem,'' nominated for best traditional soul gospel album, \n     might win her a 10th Grammy. (She has also been nominated \n     more times than any other gospel artist.) From the religious \n     music community, she has won 15 Dove Awards and 10 Stellar \n     Awards.\n       Not confined to music arenas and churches, Caesar has done \n     four Broadway shows and contributed to the movie soundtracks \n     of ``The Preacher's Wife'' and ``Rosewood.'' In the spring, \n     she's scheduled to make a guest appearance on UPN's ``Good \n     News,'' and her autobiography is scheduled for publication in \n     May. When Dylan was chosen as a Kennedy Center honoree last \n     year, he asked that Caesar sing his ``Gotta Serve Somebody.'' \n     Caesar likes the fact that the salute portion of the night \n     ended as she shouted ``Jesus!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5583-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, in the short time that I will take to \ndeliver these remarks, a woman will be diagnosed with breast cancer. \nAnd every 12 minutes, a woman will die from it.\n  Just this past year, breast cancer has touched my life twice: one \nmember of staff, aged 37, and the spouse of another member of my staff \nboth developed breast cancer. Watching these women in their daily \nstruggles has been a heart-wrenching experience as well as a call to \naction.\n  I know that several of my colleagues' lives have also been personally \ntouched by breast cancer. The senior Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, \nlost her mother to breast cancer at a tragically young age. Throughout \nher career in Congress, Senator Snowe has been a tireless advocate for \nbreast cancer awareness and increased funding for research. Her \nleadership on this issue has been invaluable--even lifesaving--for \ncountless women across the country.\n  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the \nUnited States. However, when breast cancer is detected early and \ntreated promptly, suffering and the loss of life can be significantly \nreduced.\n  Approximately one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer \nduring her lifetime. In 1998 alone, an estimated 180,200 women will be \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. Even more disturbing, breast cancer is \nthe leading cause of death among women aged 35 to 54.\n  Washingtonians will have the opportunity to call attention to breast \ncancer and raise much-needed research dollars when the Susan G. Komen \nBreast Cancer Foundation hosts its 9th annual National Race for the \nCure on Saturday, June 6.\n  Those of us who work on Capitol Hill have an added opportunity to \ncontribute to the cure for breast cancer thanks to a challenge grant \nfrom Eli Lilly and Company. The third annual Lilly Capitol Hill \nChallenge will match the registration fees for all members of Congress, \ntheir spouses, and staff who participate in the National Race for the \nCure. Since 1996, Lilly and Capitol Hill have raised $200,000 for \nbreast cancer prevention, research, and treatment--75% of which stays \nin the DC metropolitan area.\n  Two weeks ago, all the women in the Senate joined me in circulating a \n``Dear Colleague'' letter encouraging Members of Congress and staff to \ntake advantage of Lilly's generous offer and register for this year's \nrace. And I would like to let my colleagues know that it is not too \nlate to participate. Late registrations are being accepted up until \nFriday evening at 6:30 in the lobby of the Department of Commerce.\n  Today, I rise to the floor to once again encourage my colleagues to \nalert members of their staff, their families and friends to this \nvaluable opportunity to support the Komen Foundation and Race for the \nCure on June 6th.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5584-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5584-S5601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1415, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2433 (to amendment No. 2420), to \n     modify the provisions relating to civil liability for tobacco \n     manufacturers.\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2434 (to amendment No. 2433), in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n       Gramm motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance and with instructions to report back forthwith, with \n     amendment No. 2436, to modify the provisions relating to \n     civil liability for tobacco manufacturers, and to eliminate \n     the marriage penalty reflected in the standard deduction and \n     to ensure the earned income credit takes into account the \n     elimination of such penalty.\n       Daschle (for Durbin) amendment No. 2437 (to amendment No. \n     2436), relating to reductions in underaged tobacco usage.\n       Daschle (for Durbin) amendment No. 2438 (to amendment No. \n     2437), of a perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of today we will continue \nour discussions and debate on the pending tobacco legislation, a topic \nthat has been the focus of much of our activity over the past several \nweeks, a focus which I hope will become increasingly addressed over \nthis week. I ask that amendments that are talked about being introduced \nare actually brought\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nto the floor so that they can be debated. We have legislation in the \nChamber that has a fascinating history, legislation that continues to \nevolve, legislation that I believe is very important as we stay focused \non that goal of decreasing, and maybe even someday eliminating, youth \nsmoking.\n  I am concerned that we have gotten off track in our consideration of \nwhat I believe has to be comprehensive tobacco legislation. There are \nsome people who would just like to establish a tax and have funds to go \npossibly to public health, but also to many other issues totally \nunrelated to what our focus should be, and that is youth smoking. There \nare others who say we need to address just the advertising aspects of \nthis particular bill. There are others who say that we look at just \nvending machines; and there are others who say we can solve this whole \nproblem by looking at just the public health initiatives of behavioral \nchange, of figuring out what causes addiction.\n  I for one believe we need to address all of these issues, and we run \nthe danger, maybe for political reasons, maybe for selfish reasons, of \ntaking a bill that did start as a comprehensive bill and stripping away \ncertain things so that we will end up with just a tax or just a public \nhealth initiative or just an issue of access itself, and I think we \nneed to do all of that.\n  As to youth smoking, we have talked again and again over the last 2 \nweeks about the alarming statistics of youth smoking. The one statistic \nthat seems to stick with people is one that is real, and that is that \nover the course of today, between now and tomorrow morning, 3,000 kids, \nunderaged children, will start smoking for all sorts of reasons.\n  We know it is peer pressure, we know it is advertising, we know it is \naccess, we know that it is looking cool; but regardless, the bottom \nline is that 3,000 kids who were not smoking yesterday by the end of \ntoday will be smoking.\n  What has become increasingly clear and possibly covered up by the \nindustry, in part--confused by politics--is that 1,000 of those 3,000 \nwill become addicted to smoking, and by being addicted, it means your \nbody becomes dependent on that, it is out of your control, to a large \nextent because of physiological responses. But, regardless, the bottom \nline is that one out of every three of those children, the age of my \nchildren, 15, 12, 11, 10 years of age, who start smoking today, one out \nof three will die prematurely; that is, die earlier than they would--of \nlung disease, of cancer, of emphysema--earlier than they would have if \nthey hadn't started smoking.\n  So, the problem is very, very clear today, much clearer than it was \neven 5 years ago or 10 years ago. Therefore, I think it is useful to \nstick with that statistic. You can argue the statistic, but the bottom \nline is that 1,000 children who start smoking today will die \nprematurely.\n  The other two out of three children may or may not continue smoking. \nThey may not be affected, because it is not crystal clear that smoking \n100 percent of the time causes cancer. But we know that it has a very, \nvery strong influence on whatever our genetic predisposition is to \ncancer, all sorts of cancer, and to heart disease which--as a heart \nsurgeon and heart specialist, I have operated on thousands and \nthousands and thousands of people whose heart disease I would \nattribute--to genetics? yes, but also in large part to smoking.\n  Focus on the health of our children and their children. Many of us in \nthis Chamber do have children who are in those teenage years. A \nfascinating statistic is that about half of the people who start \nsmoking, half of all people who start smoking today, are 8 years old, \n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 years of age. Half of all people who start \nsmoking today in this country are 14 years of age and younger. That is \nvery different from in the past. I think in large part that does come \nfrom the fact that that group of people have been targeted in recent \nyears, over the last 5 or 10 years--unlike 20 years ago--because if you \ncan addict people at that age, they will not only purchase more \ncigarettes as youths but, because of their addiction, over their entire \nlifetimes.\n  This whole passage through adolescence is something which really \nconfuses the issue. It would be much easier if we said let's stop \neverybody from smoking, because then you could really engage in huge, \nhuge policy. But if you really stay focused on the youth, it introduces \nall sorts of factors that may not apply later: Advertising, how we \nadvertise to youth--is it just Joe Camel, or is it other seductive \ntypes of advertising? And then, how you separate that advertising from \nbroader-scale advertising, something that we cannot do in the U.S. \nSenate or the U.S. Congress. I believe it does almost demand \nparticipation by the industry, to agree that somebody 8 years of age or \n10 years of age or 12 years of age should not be targeted by such \nadvertising, which clearly results in a crippling addiction which will \nultimately kill that child later in life.\n  For many years, individuals, if we look at the history, have not been \nsuccessful in suing the tobacco industry because of a doctrine called \nassumption of risk doctrine. No jury would side with a plaintiff, \nbecause the smoker had assumed the risk associated with smoking.\n  However, if we review very briefly this recent history, over the last \nseveral months a group of State attorneys general got together and \nstarting suing the industry to recover Medicaid costs, Medicaid costs \nbeing principally incurred by a State, because two-thirds of Medicaid \nfunds are paid for by the State and about a third from the Federal \nGovernment. And therefore it was the State attorneys general. The \nMedicaid Program is our joint State-Federal partnership program that is \ndirected at health care for our indigent population, a population that \nfalls below the poverty level. That is why this grassroots effort, now \nelevated to this body, started at the State level. The State attorneys \ngeneral got together to recover the Medicaid--predominantly State--\ncosts for smoking-related illnesses, thus avoiding this whole doctrine \ncalled the assumption of risk doctrine.\n  It has been fascinating, because in the course of these lawsuits, and \nin large part because of the lawsuits--and we have seen it unfold \nbefore committees here in the U.S. Congress as well--internal industry \ndocuments have been made public. They have been made public for the \nfirst time and are now on the Internet, accessible to the media, to \ncommittees here in the U.S. Senate, as well as to people who are, on \ntheir own, on the Internet; they have access to these documents today.\n  It is very clear the industry knew a lot more about the science--that \nis, the addictive nature of nicotine--than they had let on, that they \nknew a lot more about the destructive effects of smoking tobacco than \nwas ever previously thought.\n  The focus of the discussion today, which really demands that we \naddress the issue, is that the debate no longer is that smoking may be \nharmful to your health, as it was 20 years ago--we know that it is \nharmful to your health--the debate that we need to address in the U.S. \nSenate, however, is the youth smoking, where one really doesn't engage \nin free choice to start smoking at 10 or 11 or 12 years of age. That \nfree choice can be targeted, can be shifted by very aggressive \nmarketing. And that is what has been done today.\n\n  If we look back again a few months, some of these States began to \nsettle for huge sums from the tobacco industry. Mississippi, as we \nknow, just 2 years ago settled for $3 billion; Florida and Texas were \nthe next to settle, for $11.5 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. \nAnd then just last month, Minnesota, the most recent to settle, settled \nfor about $6.6 billion. Look a few months later and how all of this \nevolved. In the Spring of 1997, interested parties came to the \nbargaining table. I say ``interested parties,'' because you really did \nhave the public health advocates at the table: You had the State \nattorneys general representing the Medicaid population, representing \nthe expense of the States at the table; you had the industry--something \nwhich we don't have today in the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate--we \nhad the industry actually at the table, coming to certain agreements.\n  Let me add very quickly, it was fascinating, because I am from a \ntobacco State; we have 23,000 hard-working women and men and farming \nfamilies who work very hard, get up every morning to produce a legal \nproduct in this country. It is interesting, in this\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\ngreat agreement--I guess I should qualify ``great''--in this historic \nagreement, the tobacco farmers and the agricultural community were not \nrepresented at that table.\n  Regardless, the other three groups--the public health group, the \nindustry itself, the attorneys general--sat down, and the basic \nelements of that, and I would say historic, June 20 settlement included \na number of things: No. 1, industry payments of $368.5 billion, agreed \nto by industry, members of the plaintiffs' bar, the attorneys general, \nand the public health groups. That $368.5 billion was to be paid over \nabout 25 years. It would be funded by what calculated out to be raising \nthe price of cigarettes by 70 cents per pack over a 10-year period.\n  Second, an important component, I believe, is the advertising \nrestrictions. The industry came forward and said that, we will \nvoluntarily limit our first amendment rights by refocusing advertising, \nif the remaining aspects of that agreement would go into effect.\n  Third, there were youth access provisions and really some pretty \ntough licensing requirements for retailers who sell tobacco. All of us \nknow the problem we have with access today. If you go into any \ncommunity and ask a young 16-year-old or 15-year-old, ``Could you get a \npack of cigarettes?'' they would say, ``Yes, without a problem.''\n  Fourth, that June 20, 1997, settlement had $2.5 billion per year for \nsmoking cessation programs, public education campaigns, and State \nenforcement. It gave FDA authority to regulate tobacco and smoking. It \nhad no class action suits or suits by any government entity. It had \nimmunity for the industry from all punitive damages for past actions. \nIndividuals were allowed to bring suits to cover compensatory damages \nfor past conduct and compensatory and punitive damages for future \nconduct.\n  Because that settlement required the enactment of Federal law, it \ncame before the U.S. Congress. We are here today in large part because \nthat June 20 settlement requires us to be here or it just doesn't \noccur. Implementing the provisions of that settlement or implementing \nprovisions similar to it does require Federal legislation.\n\n  We had committees that had jurisdiction over several provisions in \nthis June 20 agreement. Judiciary had a role, the Labor Committee had \nits expertise in the FDA, the Finance Committee had jurisdiction over \ninternational trade aspects, the Commerce Committee had jurisdiction \nover the liability and interstate commerce expertise, the Agriculture \nCommittee had a keen interest in the effect of this type of really \nunprecedented legislation on farmers, all of which ultimately were \npulled together--at least that expertise was pulled together--through \nthe Commerce Committee and bringing it to the floor to be amended \naccordingly.\n  We are right now in the middle of that amendment process. A number of \npeople are talking about amendments to make the bill better, and the \nbill was brought to the floor recognizing it was not a perfect bill, \nthat it was important for that amendment process to take place to \nmodify it, to improve it, to make sure that it does achieve the \nobjectives of decreasing youth smoking over time. I encourage my \ncolleagues to come forward to participate with their amendments so we \ncan achieve that objective and, sometime within the next several days \nor next several weeks, bring this to some resolution.\n  I do believe, as I said, it takes a comprehensive approach. I think \nwe do have to address, first, the advertising targeted at children. An \narticle in the Journal of the American Medical Association of February \n17 stated very clearly that advertising is more influential than peer \npressure in enticing our children to try smoking, and it estimated--and \nI recognize these estimates are really all over the board--but it \nestimated that about 700,000 kids a year are affected by advertising. \nBig debate. We have talked about it a lot over the last several weeks. \nIs it advertising? Is it peer pressure? How do you control peer \npressure at that very tricky age of walking through adolescence? They \nare inextricably tied together. If you have very effective advertising \nthat makes smoking look cool and makes you part of a group and makes \nyou feel good at 12 years of age, then peer pressure builds. If \nsomebody asks is it peer pressure or advertising, it is very confusing.\n  In our business, in the political business, in public service, we \nknow the effects of marketing. We know that kids are targeted, and we \nknow that builds and establishes peer pressure which does affect \nsomebody at that age, in adolescence, when they are reaching out for \nidentity and for security and for acceptance. Therefore, either dealing \ndirectly with the industry or indirectly, we have to have the industry \nagree not to target kids. Our society simply must stop glamorizing \nsmoking in the way that it does today, which increases the peer \npressure. This applies to television; it applies to movies; it applies \nto 30-second spots; it applies to billboards. We have to stop that \nmarketing directly to children, and I believe the industry has to take \nthe lead in that regard.\n  Secondly, to have a truly comprehensive program, we do have to have a \nstrong public health initiative, including tobacco-related research, \nincluding tobacco-related treatment, and including tobacco-related \nsurveillance. It is fascinating in terms of how we would use certain \nmoneys, because a number of people want to use certain moneys for \nprograms totally unrelated to public health initiatives, totally \nunrelated to research.\n\n  If we just step back and imagine what could be done if moneys were \nspent effectively and if there were appropriate moneys available for \nresearch, we might--we just might--in 5 years, in 10 years, maybe 3 \nyears, eliminate the problem. For example, if we knew where in the \nbrain addiction to nicotine actually occurs--and let me say that there \nare ways to detect that through PET scanning, positron-emission \ntomography, today--we know roughly in the brain where the addictive \ncenter to nicotine actually occurs.\n  With the rapid advances made in science, with the appropriate focus \nand the appropriate resources, it is not far-fetched that we will \nidentify not only the location, where we have taken the first steps, \nbut the actual receptors, and design a drug, a chemical, a hormone to \ngo to that particular site and turn off the addictive potential, the \naddictive connections that cause that 8-year-old or that 10-year-old \nwho starts to smoke to smoke forever out of their control.\n  That one little bit of research could solve this whole problem. We \ncan't give any statistic probability that that research will result in \nthat sort of effect, but the potential is there. It takes that emphasis \non that particular dimension, moving there and saying we do need to put \nthe appropriate funds there, that some effort in this comprehensive \napproach must be directed to research. A strong commitment to basic \nscience and behavioral research is critical.\n  Such focused research made possible by this bill might even uncover a \npill. I can almost see a day where people will smoke for 6 months or \nsmoke for a year. If we can kill that addictive potential, that 6 \nmonths to a year might not have the same impact on one's coronary \narteries in the development of atherosclerotic plaques--hardening of \nthe arteries--which cause heart attacks and ultimately death.\n  Will we get there? We don't know unless we focus research in that \narea, and right now we do not have sufficient research there. We do \nneed to look at certain behavioral research: How can we stop people \nfrom smoking who are addicted to smoking? We just don't know very much \nabout that.\n  Later today, I think we will be talking a lot about drugs, other \ndrugs--not just nicotine, not just cigarettes--and the importance of \ndeveloping a more comprehensive policy. I welcome that opportunity, \nagain, because I have youngsters. I have three boys, who are going \nthrough this period of adolescence, who are going to be tempted and \nexposed to all of the seductive advertising, peer pressure, wanting to \nbe accepted, that we have all gone through and most of our children go \nthrough.\n  A comprehensive approach: The research, the scientific research, \nsmoking cessation programs, behavioral research, the addictive \npotential, the advertising that I spoke to.\n  The third component is that of access. It is too easy today. We held \nhearings in our Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which I \nchair, in the Labor Committee and had some really powerful, powerful \ntestimony come forward by the users, by those\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nyoung adolescents who have started to smoke. We heard chilling \ntestimony about how easy it was to purchase tobacco products.\n  We can do a great job in a small community. If there are 12 places \nwhere one can buy tobacco, we can have 5 of those really enforce the \naccess laws. Just imagine 12 convenient stores in a community. You can \nhave five that really stick to the law. You can have another five that \ndo pretty well. But if there is just one in that community that \ncontinues to sell cigarettes, for whatever reason, the access programs \ndon't work at all. We need to have more effective access.\n  Nickita from Baltimore, who is now 18 years old, started smoking when \nshe was 14 years of age. She testified that she would normally get her \ncigarettes from the store. She testified that she never had a problem \nbuying cigarettes in the store. In fact, ``People in my community, as \nyoung as 9 years old, go to the store and get cigarettes. They simply \ndo not ask for IDs,'' she said.\n  The lesson I learned from this testimony is that we must enforce \nyouth access laws. We must make it impossible for children to buy \ncigarettes in any neighborhood in this country. It is really shameful \nthat in America in 1998 a teenager can purchase tobacco in any \nneighborhood in the United States of America.\n  There are three elements--access, advertising, public health and \nbasic science initiatives. In this whole arena of access, price is an \nissue. I voted against the tax of $1.50 that was proposed on this floor \n2 weeks ago very simply because price addresses one aspect of the three \naspects that I think are important to decrease youth smoking. Price \ndoes affect purchasing. While it is one of the levels, one of the \nfactors, it is not the only factor.\n  Consumption, though, had been decreasing in the 1970s. However, \nbetween 1980 and 1993, the downward trend really accelerated, with \nconsumption falling by 3 percent a year at the same time that the \ninflation-adjusted price of cigarettes increased by 80 percent.\n  In addition, in the early 1990s, we saw price cuts, and consumption \nleveled off with only modest decreases in the price until 1996. Then in \n1997, prices rose by 2.3 percent, and consumption fell again by 3 \npercent.\n  Expert testimony provided in hearings before us, based on data from \nboth this country and others, clearly demonstrates that the price of \ncigarettes does affect consumption. But price alone simply will not \nsolve the problem; that a comprehensive approach is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I think the bill on the floor is a good start in \naddressing, in a comprehensive way, this issue of decreasing youth \nsmoking. It also addresses an issue that was ignored by the June 20 \nsettlement, an issue that I mentioned--that of the agricultural \ncommunity and that of tobacco farmers.\n  We have two competing amendments or proposals right now that are \nbeing considered. I am very hopeful that an agreement can be reached \nbetween those two. They have very different concepts. On the other \nhand, both have as their goal to do what is in the best interest of \nthose hard-working men and women who are in the farming community, who, \nthrough no fault of their own, we have this targeting of the youth by \nthe industry, who, through no fault of their own, affect this idea of \neasy access. They are literally getting up every morning, going out, \nworking hard in the fields to produce a legal product. I am very \npleased that this group is being addressed. I look forward to having \nsome resolution of the two competing groups.\n  Mr. President, I will wrap up my comments shortly because other \npeople are on the floor. I think this bill is not perfect yet. I think \nwe need to look very closely at how we have designated whatever funds \nare generated by this particular bill and to look at what programs they \ncreate.\n  The version of the bill on the floor now, unlike the original \nCommerce version of the bill, is much, much better in that most of the \nhuge bureaucracies that came out of the Commerce Committee bill have \nbeen eliminated, have been reduced. I think there are still a number of \nthose programs that we need to go back and address.\n  Some people have come to the floor and have basically said that the \nbill on the floor is merely an attempt to destroy an industry that is \nproducing a legal product by raising the price too much. I think this \nis a legitimate concern. We have had a countless number of financial \nexperts present data; some have had a vested interest, some have not. A \nnumber of them have come before the several committees who have held \nhearings on this jurisdiction, and it really seems nobody can answer \nthe question of the appropriate price and what a price increase of 50 \ncents or 70 cents or $1 or $1.50 will do on the industry itself.\n  We do know one thing; and that is that the industry at one time \nagreed, back in June, to a $368.5 billion exchange for some assurances \nthat they would have some predictability in future lawsuits. Now that \nhas been radically changed at the end of 2 weeks ago. We need to all \nget together to see what that next step should be, what further \namendments need to be applied. Again, personally, I believe that the \nindustry has to be at the table, has to agree not to target the youth \ntoday.\n  Black market--something that is very, very real. If the price is \nraised too high, at least based on the testimony that has come before \nour committees, a black market would most certainly occur, and then we \nwould ultimately end up destroying exactly what we are trying to \nachieve--that is a reduction in youth smoking.\n  Mr. President, I guess in closing my remarks I just want to emphasize \nhow effective and responsible we can be if we have a comprehensive \nsettlement. And that is what it is going to take --public health \ninitiatives, appropriate research, addressing the issue of access, and \naddressing the issue of advertising. We must have an industry that does \nnot market to kids. We have to have the cooperation of the industry.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just make one final comment that is on the Food \nand Drug Administration. I have been very active in working to see that \nthe Food and Drug Administration is the agency that would oversee \nwhatever regulation we pass on the floor of the U.S. Senate and through \nthe U.S. Congress. The approach was to set up a separate chapter within \nthe Food and Drug Administration rather than try to regulate tobacco or \ncigarettes through a three or four sentence clause that is existing in \nthe device aspects of the Food and Drug Administration legislation \ntoday.\n  We did this for a number of reasons. I have outlined those reasons on \nthe floor today. I am very pleased where we stand with that today, in \nterms of setting up a new chapter that recognizes that tobacco really \nis a unique product. It is not a device to be regulated like a \npacemaker or like an artificial heart device or like a laser. And that \nis where an attempt was made by the administration to regulate tobacco.\n  Are there parts of that that might be improved? I think we can \nconsider that as we go through the amendment process. I still have some \nconcerns with some parts of the Commerce bill. I look forward to seeing \nthem modified.\n  I think as a heart surgeon, as a lung surgeon, I have a real \nobligation to point out that smoking does kill people-- there is no \nquestion--No. 2, that tobacco is a legal product in this country--and I \nthink it should stay a legal product in this country where adults who \nhave the maturity, have the education to make choices for themselves \nshould have that opportunity--but, thirdly, I feel very strongly that \nwe need to address youth smoking and do our very best as a nation for \nour children and for that next generation through a comprehensive \nstrategy to work to reduce youth smoking.\n  Mr. President, we have two colleagues on the floor, and I would \nsimply ask unanimous consent if they could limit their comments or let \nme inquire in terms of, from each of them, how long they would require? \nI would like to have some limitation because we want to get to other \namendments early this morning.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I would be happy to limit my remarks \nto no more than 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The same.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will yield 30 minutes to both of my colleagues on the \nfloor. At that time, I reserve coming back and regaining the floor at \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tobacco \nbill. And I wish to address the massive tax increase that is in this \nbill--tax increases that are targeted against the lowest income \nindividuals in America: hard-working citizens who earn primarily less \nthan $30,000 a year. It is a massive tax increase that is going to be \nused to expand the Federal Government, just when the American people \ncontinue to make it clear that they are tired of Government imposing \nits decisions on our daily lives.\n  Just last week there was an announcement of a $39 billion surplus in \n1998 and a $54 billion surplus in 1999. Congress should be debating how \nto return this money to the taxpayers. We should not be debating how to \nsiphon more out of the pockets of working Americans.\n  It is also possible to discuss the inevitable black market that would \nresult from the policies in this bill, even though my colleagues and \nthe administration continue to ignore this threat to American \nneighborhoods of creating a black market with the high taxes in this \nbill. I will also discuss the effect of a price increase on teenage \nsmoking rates.\n  Mr. President, along with my colleagues, I am truly concerned about \nteen smoking. However, I do not believe that teen smoking is the focus \nof this legislation. Under the guise of reducing teen smoking, \nproponents of this bill are willing to increase taxes on hard-working \nAmericans by well over $800 billion. That is well over three-quarters \nof a trillion dollars.\n  Under the guise of reducing teen smoking, proponents of this bill \nsupport a massive increase in the size of the Federal Government--17 \nnew boards and commissions, which is a modest estimate. And then in \nresponse to the identification of those boards and commissions, some in \nsupport of this bill have decided to say they would take out those \nboards and commissions and just leave authority for agencies to create \nwithin themselves the capacity to do what the boards and commissions \nwere designed to do. Instead of having boards and commissions that are \naccountable and identifiable, you have stealth boards and commissions \nthat are hidden in the agencies. I don't think making them \nindistinguishable is a way to say that government isn't growing.\n\n  Proponents of this bill claim it is necessary to curb teen smoking. \nWhat this bill is necessary for is to feed the tax-and-spend habit of \nindividuals in Washington.\n  Although Congress has the authority, we do not even make it illegal \nfor minors to possess or use tobacco in the District of Columbia in \nthis bill. We only have rules regarding the point of sale. Even then, \nwe only make retailers responsible for the transaction. There is no \ndisincentive for teenagers to try and purchase cigarettes in this bill. \nTwo percent of retail cigarette sales are made to minors. Adults \npurchase 98 percent of all cigarettes sold in retail stores. Under this \nbill, we are creating a massive tax increase on 98 percent of smokers \nin order to try and discourage 2 percent of all the retail sales. There \nis sound evidence that the 2 percent will not be discouraged. In \nWashington, taxes and spending are the only things more addictive than \nnicotine.\n  Preliminary reports estimated this legislation would increase taxes \n$868 billion. We now know that this legislation would raise taxes $885 \nbillion and create new government programs with funding locked in for \n25 years. It creates a huge government regulatory scheme the likes of \nwhich we have not seen since the Clinton proposal to perpetrate a \nnational health care system from the Federal Government.\n  This bill is a tax bill, pure and simple. It is a tax bill on \nAmericans who are already overburdened with taxes. Americans today are \nworking longer and harder than ever before to pay their taxes. Tax \nFreedom Day this year was less than a month ago, on May the 10th. It \nwas a record year. Americans worked longer into the year this year to \npay their taxes than ever before. The hard work of the American people, \nlet me say again, the hard work of the American people allowed the \nPresident just last week to announce a $39 billion projected surplus in \n1998 and a $54 billion surplus projected for 1999. Yet here we are a \nweek later continuing to talk not about how to return the surplus to \nthe people, but how to siphon more out of their pockets. As currently \ndrafted, the proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for \nWashington to raise taxes and spend more money.\n  In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress passed 13 major tax \nincreases. In fact, last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first \nmeaningful tax cut since 1981. As currently drafted, the tobacco bill \nerases that relief. We must stop that from happening. We must not undo \nthe modest gains we gave to the American people just last year. We \ncertainly cannot relieve them by imposing another $885 billion in taxes \non them. To paraphrase President Reagan, the whole controversy comes \ndown to this: Are you entitled to the fruits of your own labor or does \ngovernment have some presumptive right to tax and tax and tax? Who will \npay the $800-plus billion in taxes contained in this proposed \nlegislation?\n  The tobacco legislation is a massive tax increase that would be \nlevied against those least capable of paying. About 60 percent of the \ntax increase would fall on families earning $30,000 a year or less. \nThat is a shocking figure. What it basically says is these families \nwith less than $30,000, struggling to put clothing on the backs of \ntheir children, food on the table, to pay the rent, to have the money \nfor transportation, to keep the car repaired, occasionally scraping \ntogether enough for a modest day off or a vacation, would suddenly be \nsubject to a massive new tax, 60 percent of which would fall on them. \nSome households would see their taxes increase by more than $1,000. \nMoreover, this new tax would be levied on money that has already been \nsubject to the income tax. If you are buying cigarettes and you have an \nadditional $1.10 to pay, it is a tax on money you have already paid tax \non. Households earning less than $50,000 would pay seven times as much \nin new tobacco taxes than households earning $75,000 or more.\n\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, tobacco taxes are \nperhaps the most regressive taxes currently levied. In the United \nStates of America where, we already have the highest taxes in history, \nwe are now projecting a massive tax increase on individuals least \ncapable of paying. While those earning less than $10,000 make up only \n10 percent of the population, 32 percent of those people smoke. The \ncurrent tobacco tax represents 5 percent of the smokers' income in this \ncategory. Those making between $10,000 and $20,000 a year make up 18 \npercent of the population. However, 30 percent smoke. The current \ntobacco tax makes up 2 percent of a smokers income in this category. \nTherefore, this bill amounts to a tax increase on 31 percent of \nAmericans who earn under $20,000 a year. Households earning less than \n$10,000 a year would feel the bite of this tax increase most of all. \nThese households, it is estimated, would see their Federal taxes rise \n35.1 percent.\n  In most areas of the country, someone earning $10,000 a year is well \nbelow the poverty line. We spend much of our time in this body trying \nto find solutions for those in this income bracket--we have tax \ncredits, welfare programs, educational grants, job-training programs. \nThey cost billions of dollars a year. We try to lift people out of \ntheir poverty, out of that income bracket. However, today, Members of \nthis body are enthusiastically saddling them with a huge tax burden of \nover $800 billion focused on those least capable of paying. Washington \npoliticians and bureaucrats are saying they know better how to spend \nthe resources of the American people.\n  Let me share the impact this tax increase will have on the \nconstituents of the people in Missouri. Using data provided by the \nCenters for Disease Control, it is clear the tobacco legislation would \nbe an annual $382 million tax on people in Missouri. Of that amount, \n$227 million would be paid by households earning $30,000 or less. This \nis a conservative estimate. This assumes that each smoker in Missouri \nsmokes only one pack a day. For someone who smokes two packs daily, the \n$1.10 per pack tax increase contained in the tobacco legislation would \namount to a tax increase of $803 annually.\n  Let's look at how this will impact other States. Arizona, 22.9 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\nthe adults smoke; $227.3 million tax increase on Arizona, $164.7 \nmillion on those with incomes of $30,000 or less. In Texas, 23.7 \npercent of adults smoke; $1.2 billion tax increase on Texas, $1.2 \nbillion tax increase on the people of Texas, with three quarters of a \nbillion being levied against those who earn $30,000 or less.\n  This bill contains massive tax increases that are going to be used to \nexpand the Federal Government just when the American people continue to \nmake it clear that they need relief. Some people ask, where is all this \nmoney coming from when we talk about our surpluses? I can tell you \nwhere the money comes from--it comes from the hard work, the sacrifice, \nthe ingenuity, the efforts of Americans. It is not our money. It is \ntheir money. It is not Washington's. We should be discussing how to \nleave the money where it belongs. Instead, we are discussing how to \ntake more money.\n  I have an amendment that I plan on introducing later in this debate \nthat will accomplish the goal of leaving money in the pockets of the \ntaxpayers. It will give much-needed tax relief to Americans in a way \nwhich will provide the greatest relief to those who will be hardest hit \nunder the bill. I believe, as many do in this body, that if this bill \nis allowed to increase taxes, that revenue should be used to relieve \nmarried couples of what might possibly be the most indefensible and \nimmoral tax of our Tax Code. This is a perfect example of Washington's \nvalues being imposed on America instead of America's values being \nimposed on Washington. Americans value marriage; Washington taxes \nmarriage.\n\n  The marriage penalty tax creates a situation in which 21 million \ncouples pay $29 billion more than they would have paid had they been \nsingle. The marriage penalty, on the average, is about $1,400 per \nfamily. This is grossly unfair and is an assault on the values of the \nAmerican people. Consider a typical couple in which each person earns \nan annual income of $35,000. Under current law, if the couple were to \nwed in 1998, they would pay $10,595 in Federal income taxes, assuming \nthey were childless and they take the standard deduction. If, instead, \nthey chose to remain single, their combined tax bill would amount to \n$9,117. In other words, they would pay $1,478, a 16-percent penalty for \nbeing married.\n  As you might expect, people often modify their behavior to avoid \npaying taxes. In fact, it is one of the assumptions of the tobacco \nlegislation that people would modify their behavior--quit smoking--if \nwe raise taxes on cigarettes. Does the Tax Code really influence moral \ndecisions and prevent couples from getting married? Tragically, yes. \nSome couples simply cannot afford to bear the extra burden of the \nmarriage penalty. Just ask Sharon Mallory and Darryl Pierce of \nConnersville, IN. They were planning to get married when they learned \nthat their annual tax liability would balloon $3,700 as a result. The \nmarriage penalty led them to rethink their decision to get married.\n  A marriage penalty exists today because Congress legislated ill-\nadvised changes to the Tax Code in the 1960s. This is an example of \nWashington's values being imposed on America instead of America's \nvalues being imposed on Washington.\n  Over the next 5 years, the Federal Government is expected to collect \n$9.3 trillion in taxes from hard-working Americans. Completely \neliminating the marriage penalty would reduce that total by only $150 \nbillion, or only 1.6 percent.\n  Now that taxpayers have provided the Federal Government with a \nsurplus that may be as much as $60 billion this year alone, Congress \nhas no excuse for withholding tax relief from American families.\n  The power to tax is the power to destroy. The average dual-income \nhousehold spends a far larger share of its income on taxes than it does \non food, shelter, clothing, and transportation combined.\n  With taxes at these levels, no wonder families are finding it \nnecessary to send both spouses into the workplace. One of the ways in \nwhich the marriage penalty manifests itself is that the standard \ndeduction for a married couple is less than that for two singles. That \nmeans if you are married and you file a joint return, the standard \ndeduction is not double what it was when you were single. Again, let me \nrepeat this staggering fact. Last year, 21 million married couples \ncollectively paid a $29 billion tax. They paid $29 billion more than \nthey would have paid had they been single.\n  I will offer an amendment that will substantially reduce the marriage \npenalty. It will do so by making the standard deduction for married \ncouples twice what the standard deduction is for single people.\n  Members of this body have been arguing that there is no tax in this \nbill, only an increase in tobacco prices to deter smoking. In fact, the \nFinance Committee, in its mark, at least tried to level with the \nAmerican people by reporting out a bill that called it a tax. Webster's \nDictionary defines a tax as a ``compulsory payment, usually a \npercentage, levied on income, property values, sales prices, etc., for \nthe support of government.''\n  In this bill we have a compulsory payment. The bill then requires \nthat the cost of these payments be passed on in the form of price \nincreases to consumers. It even penalizes companies if they fail to do \nso. These payments are then used to fund massive programs for Federal \nand State governments.\n  Well, if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and sounds like a \nduck, it is a duck. So if it ``walks'' like a tax and acts like a tax, \nit is probably a tax. This is a tax and in law provides that those \npayments--taxes--are to be passed through to consumers--under a penalty \nif it is not done.\n\n  It has been said that industry is the group that is convincing people \nthat this is a tax bill. But we all know that industry can't make it a \ntax bill, and Senators can't say it is not a tax bill if it is a tax \nbill. It is a tax bill. It requires consumers to spend additional sums \nof money and to send them to Washington so that government programs can \nbe extended.\n  Those who support this bill would like for the American people to \nbelieve that this is tough on tobacco. The American people are \nbeginning to find out that tobacco companies won't bear the costs of \nthese payments. Consumers will. This bill requires that consumers will \nbe those who are required to put up the money--the $800 billion-plus \nthat comes in the mandatory payments, the taxes that are occasioned by \nthis bill.\n  What will be the impact on tobacco companies? In September of 1997, \nthe Federal Trade Commission issued a report entitled ``Competition and \nthe Financial Impact of the Proposed Tobacco Industry Settlement.'' The \nreport was done at the request of the Congressional Task Force on \nTobacco and Health. This report analyzed the economic impact of the \nproposed settlement on cigarette prices, industry profits, and \nGovernment revenues.\n  This tobacco legislation was built upon the proposed settlement, but \nit is not exactly the same. But this report was based upon the annual \npayment, look-back provisions, and tax deductibility of the payments \nmade by the tobacco companies.\n  There are several important conclusions in this report:\n  First: ``The major cigarette manufacturers may profit from the \nproposed settlement by increasing the price of cigarettes substantially \nabove the amount of the . . . payments that are to be paid to the \npublic sector.''\n  It could be profitable for the tobacco companies. This bill that is \nso hard on the tobacco companies may result in increased profits for \nthe very tobacco companies we are supposed to be hurting.\n  Second, the report concludes: ``Even assuming that prices increase by \nno more than the annual payments, the major cigarette firms may profit \nsubstantially . . . through limitations on liability and reductions in \nadvertising and litigation costs.''\n  Well, that is a very serious suggestion. And that comes from the \nFederal Trade Commission of the United States.\n  Again, the actual elements of this bill that are supposed to show \nthat Congress is ``tough on tobacco'' may, according to the Federal \nTrade Commission, actually enable tobacco companies to profit \nsubstantially by reducing litigation costs and by reducing the costs of \nadvertising.\n  The report then mentions the affect of price increases on smokers. It \nsays:\n\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\n\n       The overall demand by adults for cigarettes is inelastic, \n     or relatively insensitive to changes in price. Most adult \n     consumers will continue to smoke notwithstanding a \n     significant increase in price.\n       As a result, an industry-wide price increase would be \n     profitable for the companies, even though some smokers would \n     react to the higher prices by smoking less or quitting \n     altogether.\n\n  Now, the evidence is not clear that raising prices reduces teen \nsmoking rates. Mr. President, this bill is being considered on the \nSenate floor. It is being considered and being sold to the American \npeople as the only way to reduce youth smoking. They are being told \nthat we can justify an $800 billion tax increase that is necessary to \nget rid of the disease of addiction. However, after looking at the \nevidence, there is no reason to believe that such a tax increase is the \nanswer to eliminating teen smoking.\n  Mr. President, I inquire as to the time remaining in my opportunity \nto speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Food and Drug Administration regulations, which were designed to \ncurtail teen smoking and which were suggested by a Cabinet Secretary \nwho helped promote these regulations, did not contain price increases. \nThe most striking evidence that significant price increases are not \nnecessary to reduce smoking is a very recent attempt by this \nadministration to address the youth smoking issue. In 1996, regulations \npromulgated by the FDA were touted as being historic. It was estimated \nto reduce youth smoking by 50 percent over 7 years, and they didn't \ninclude price increases.\n  The important aspect of these regulations is that they contain no \nprice increase on smokers in the general population. As you know, this \nlegislation is raising the prices on 100 percent of the smokers to try \nto discourage the utilization of cigarettes by 2 percent of those who \npurchase. There was no discussion in the regulations of a huge price \nincrease--a massive tax increase. And about this regulation, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, stated:\n\n       This is the most important public health initiative in a \n     generation. It ranks with everything from polio to \n     penicillin. I mean, this is huge in terms of its impact. Our \n     goal is very straightforward: to reduce the amount of teenage \n     smoking in the United States by half over the next 7 years.\n\n  It is a laudable objective, and apparently it is believed to be \nattainable by the Secretary of Health and Human Services without a \nmassive tax increase or price increase.\n  David Kessler, one of the strongest proponents of this bill, was the \nDirector of the Food and Drug Administration when these regulations \nwere promulgated. He stated:\n\n       Don't let the simplicity of these proposals fool you. If \n     all elements of the anti-smoking package come into play \n     together, change could be felt within a single generation, \n     and we could see nicotine addiction go the way of smallpox \n     and polio. without a price increase.\n\n  These statements were made about regulations that contained \nabsolutely no price increase--no massive tax on the working people of \nAmerica; no massive taking by the government of over three-quarters of \na trillion dollars; no extension of 17 new boards, commissions, and \nagencies for the government.\n  Also, remember that these regulations were supposed to reduce youth \nsmoking by 50 percent over 7 years, while it has been claimed, that \nthis bill--containing massive tax increases--will reduce teen smoking \nby 60 percent over 10 years.\n  Dr. Kessler was widely cited as a supporter of the amendment offered \non this floor last week that would have increased the tax on cigarettes \nby $1.50 rather than the $1.10 already contained in the bill as \nnecessary to reduce teen smoking, which is substantial.\n  Yet, when those regulations were enacted he never complained that \nthis regulation would not have been effective in reducing teen smoking \nbecause it did not contain such a massive tax increase.\n  About these regulations, President Clinton stated:\n\n       That's why a year ago I worked with the FDA, and . . . a \n     nationwide effort to protect our children from the dangers of \n     tobacco by reducing access to tobacco products, by preventing \n     companies from advertising to our children. The purpose of \n     the FDA rule was to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent within \n     7 years.\n\n  There was no complaint by the President that these regulations were \ninsufficient because they did not contain a price increase.\n  What has changed in just 2 short years?\n  Policymakers in Washington have found a cash cow to pay for their pet \nprograms that the President said he wanted, but which he would find \nincapable of moving through the ordinary budget process.\n\n  The evidence as to whether price increases reduce youth smoking is \ntentative--at best.\n  The second issue I want to address concerning the need to increase \ntaxes on the American people by $868 billion is whether price increases \nactually reduce teen smoking.\n  My colleagues have been arguing that the studies show conclusively \nthat price increases reduce youth smoking.\n  However, that simply is not the case.\n  At best, the studies are inconclusive. At worst, they show little \ncorrelation between price increase and a reduction in youth smoking.\n  The debate on this floor has assumed that for every 10 percent \nincrease in price reduces youth smoking by 7 percent.\n  Frankly, I think the average citizen knows that young people who are \nwilling to pay $150 a pair for sneakers are probably not very price \nsensitive when it comes to other factors that relate to status and the \nlike and making a statement, which smoking frequently is for young \npeople.\n  The debate on this floor has assumed--a dangerous assumption, \nreckless, and irresponsible intellectually--that for every 10-percent \nincrease in price you get a 7-percent reduction in youth smoking.\n  Studies conducted by economists at Cornell University and the \nUniversity of Maryland, and funded by the National Cancer Institute, \nquestion the connection between youth smoking, prices, and tax rates.\n\n\n                           The Cornell Study\n\n  After following 13,000 kids for 4 years, Dr. Philip DeCicca of \nCornell University, in a National Cancer Institute funded study--a \npublic health study--found ``Little evidence that taxes reduce smoking \nonset between 8th and 12th grade.''\n  The economists that conducted this study presented their results \nbetween the relationship between higher tobacco taxes and youth smoking \nto the American Economics Association annual meeting in January 1998. \nThis is not a dated study.\n  The study concluded that higher taxes have little effect on whether \nyoung people start to smoke.\n  They concluded that ``[T]axes are not as salient to youth smoking \ndecisions as are individual characteristics and family background.''\n  ``[W]e find little evidence that taxes reduce smoking onset between \n8th and 12th grades,'' and estimated that a $1.50 tax increase would \ndecrease the rate of smoking onset by only about 2 percentage points--\nfrom 21.6% of 12th graders who start smoking currently to 19.6% of 12th \ngraders.\n  ``Our data allow us to directly examine the impact of changes in tax \nrates on youth smoking behavior, and our preliminary results indicate \nthis impact is small or nonexistent.''\n  Here is the best data we have. The most recent studies indicate that \na massive increase of three-quarters of a trillion dollars plus on the \ntaxes of the American people will have little impact or a nonexistent \nimpact in reducing youth smoking.\n  In conclusion, the economists stated that the study ``raises doubt \nabout the claim that tax or price increases can substantially reduce \nyouth smoking.''\n\n\n                             maryland study\n\n  Economists at the University of Maryland and the University of \nChicago conducted a similar study that analyzed data concerning more \nthan 250,000 high school seniors for the period 1977-1992--the largest \nsuch sample ever used for a study on this subject.\n  They found that the relationship between price and youth consumption \nis ``substantially smaller'' than suggested by previous studies.\n  In addition, real world experience confirms the uncertain \nrelationship between higher tobacco taxes, prices and youth smoking.\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\n                               california\n\n  In 1989, California increased its cigarette excise tax by 25 cents \nper pack, but there is no evidence that youth smoking declined. This \nwas an 11 percent increase. Therefore, under the analysis that \nelasticity of teenage smokers is .07, there should have been a decrease \nof at least 7 percent.\n  We are operating under the assumption that 25 cents a pack would have \nresulted in a 16-percent or more decrease in the number of youth \nsmokers.\n  The truth of the matter is there was an 11-percent increase. \nTherefore, under the analysis that the elasticity of smokers is .07, \nthere should have been a decrease of substantial proportions.\n  However, as of 1994, researchers were ``unable to identify a decline \nin prevalence [among 16 to 18 year olds] associated with the imposition \nof the excise tax.''\n\n\n                                 canada\n\n  The most commonly cited real world situation is our neighbor to the \nNorth--Canada.\n  In Canada, the federal government increased cigarette taxes in \nseveral stages in the late 1980s and early 1990s--from $10.75 per 1,000 \ncigarettes to $24.34 in 1986, then to $38.77 in 1989, and to $62.90 in \n1991.\n  Although it has been stated on this floor, by proponents of this \nlegislation, that smoking decreased during that period, they fail to \ntalk about the years 1991 to 1994 when the tax rates were the highest \nin that nation's history.\n  During that period, smoking rates among 15-19-year-olds rose from 21 \nto 27 percent. That is a 25-percent increase.\n  If the argument that rising prices will reduce teen smoking, it \nstands to reason that youth smoking should increase as prices fall. \nHowever, a year and a half after reducing--significantly--tobacco taxes \nin Canada, according to the ``Survey on Smoking in Canada,'' teen \nsmoking ``remained stable.''\n  The fact that is ignored by those who argue teen smoking declined in \nCanada due to the significant tax increases is that youth smoking \ndeclined in the United States by 30 percent during the same period--\n1977 to 1990--without a price increase.\n\n\n                                  u.k.\n\n  Between 1988 and 1996 the per pack price of cigarettes increased by \n26 percent. Although cigarette volumes fell by 17 percent, the \npercentage of weekly smokers aged 11-16 went from 8 percent in 1988 to \n13 percent in 1996.\n\n\n                              common sense\n\n  Common sense also suggests that youth are less responsive to tax and \nprice increases. In an era of $15 compact discs, $100 video games, and \n$150 sneakers, is it realistic to believe that a few extra dollars on \ncigarettes a month will cause youth to stop experimenting with smoking \nor not to start in the first place? Young people may have less \n``disposable income'' than adults, but their spending is almost \nentirely discretionary.\n  The CDC has compiled data on brand-preference that supports the \nconclusion that young people are not particularly price sensitive.\n  The ``price value'' or discount, segment of the cigarette market \ncomprised 39 percent of the overall cigarette market in 1993. Yet, \naccording to the CDC, less than 14 percent of adolescent smokers \npurchased generic or other ``value-priced'' brands--just one-third the \npercentage.\n  The point was echoed by the government's lawyer defending the FDA \ntobacco rule, who told the U.S. District Court, ``[P]rice, apparently \nhas very little meaning to children and smoking, and therefore, they \ndon't smoke generic cigarettes, they go for those three big advertised \nbrands.''\n  In Canada, in Great Britain, the Cornell study, Maryland University, \nthe Chicago study, the situation in California, we don't have a clear \nunderstanding that a rise or an increase in taxes would in fact result \nin a decrease in youth smoking.\n  It is with that in mind that I feel we should reject this bill as a \nmassive tax increase, and if there is a massive tax increase in this \nbill, that tax increase should be sent back to those who are most hurt \nby it--low-income individuals--by eliminating a marriage penalty by \nraising the standard deduction for married couples to exactly double \nthat enjoyed by single taxpayers.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2438\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the President. I am happy to stand this morning \nin support of the pending amendment before the U.S. Senate to this \ntobacco legislation. It is an amendment offered by Senator DeWine, \nRepublican of Ohio, and myself, a bipartisan effort to make this \nimportant bill more effective.\n  I would like to pause for a moment before addressing the amendment \nand speak to the historical significance of this debate.\n  About 11 years ago I was involved in a struggle as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives to pass one of the first tobacco-controlled \nbills ever considered by the House of Representatives. In comparison to \nthis bill, ours was a very modest measure. We were setting out to \nachieve something which on its face appeared very simple, but turned \nout to be politically very difficult. What we wanted to achieve 11 \nyears ago was to ban smoking on airplanes. You would have thought that \nwe were proposing a second American revolution. The tobacco lobby \norganized its efforts, found all of its friends, both Democrat and \nRepublican, and marshaled forces to beat our effort.\n  They predicted that what we were setting out to do would create chaos \nin public transportation; it was totally unnecessary; it discriminated \nagainst the rights of smokers, and on and on and on.\n  Well, Mr. President, it was our good fortune in the House of \nRepresentatives to have a number of Members of Congress, both Democrats \nand Republicans, who, for the first time in modern memory, rejected \nthese pleas from the tobacco lobby and enacted legislation a little \nover 10 years ago that banned smoking on airplane flights of 2 hours or \nless. It was a breakthrough. It was the first time the tobacco lobby \nlost. Those who joined me in that effort stuck their necks out \npolitically. It wasn't considered to be very smart politics to oppose \ntobacco. This, in fact, was the largest, most powerful, most well \nfunded lobby in Washington. Fortunately for us, Senator Frank \nLautenberg of New Jersey and his friends in the Senate joined us in the \nbattle and together we successfully achieved our goal. Today, virtually \nall domestic airline flights--in fact, I think all of them--are smoke \nfree. It is now becoming a trend worldwide.\n  That battle and that victory, I think, set the stage for where we are \ntoday, albeit a small victory in comparison to our goal in this debate. \nBut it would have been unimaginable 10 or 11 years ago to think that \ntoday in the Senate we are debating a bill involving tobacco and health \nof the magnitude of the McCain bill which comes before us. John McCain \nis our Republican colleague from the State of Arizona. I admire his \ngrit and determination in bringing this bill to the floor despite a lot \nof opposition, primarily but not exclusively, from his own side of the \naisle.\n  When you think in terms of what we are setting out to achieve, it is \nsubstantial. It is revolutionary. It is long overdue. Our goals are \nsimple: reduce teen smoking, invest in public health research and \nprograms to help smokers quit, and protect tobacco farmers and their \ncommunities.\n  The focus on children is a good one and an important one because \ntobacco companies have needed these children desperately. Each year, \nthey have to recruit millions of children to replace those who are \nbreaking the habit and those who have passed away. They set out their \nnet and stretch it out for millions and bring in thousands, but they \nkeep replenishing the ranks; 89 percent of all people who ever tried a \ncigarette tried by the age of 18. Of people who have ever smoked daily, \n71 percent were smoking daily by age 18. Virtually no one starts \nsmoking during adulthood. It is a childish decision. It becomes a \nchildish habit, and it condemns those who fall into the lure of this \nnicotine addiction to the likelihood of a shortened life and more \nexposure to disease.\n  This McCain bill not only sets out to reduce the number of teen \nsmokers, but it also sets out to invest more in medical research. When \nI heard my colleague from Missouri decrying this bill\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\nand talking about this waste of tax dollars being brought into our \nTreasury, I paused and thought that we could argue--and I will during \nthe course of my remarks--that raising the price of the product is \ngoing to discourage children from using it as well as others, but also \nthe money that is coming in as a part of this bill is going to be \ninvested back in America.\n  I would stand by the results of a national referendum on the \nfollowing question: Should we increase the Federal tax on a package of \ncigarettes, and then take a substantial portion of the money raised and \nput it in medical research--send it to the National Institutes of \nHealth for research to find cures for cancer, heart disease, AIDS, \njuvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's, and the myriad of medical problems that \nwe face in this country? I will bet the results would be overwhelmingly \npositive because Americans believe in this investment. Americans \nbelieve that this bill, in providing money for medical research \ninvestment, is money well spent.\n  Smoking cessation programs are part of it, too. I think that is \nsensible. My father, who was a lifelong smoker, was a victim of lung \ncancer and died in his early 50s. I saw, even after his diagnosis, the \nsituation that he faced, the craving that he had for this deadly \ncigarette that had caused him so many health problems. I have always \nhad a sensitivity and a sympathy for smokers who are trying to quit. \nFor some, they can just literally walk away from it, decide in a minute \nthat tomorrow they will never smoke another cigarette. But for others \nit is virtually a lifelong struggle.\n\n  The McCain bill puts money into smoking cessation programs so that \nsmokers nationwide will have the means to turn to, to reduce their \naddiction to nicotine. My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, \nspoke earlier about the need for medical research in this area, for \nbreakthroughs to stop this addiction. I fully support him, and I think \nit should be part of this effort. We are hopeful these breakthroughs \nwill make it easier for people to stop this addiction to nicotine. That \nis part of this bill.\n  Another provision of the bill protects tobacco farmers and their \nfamilies. I have never had any crusade against the tobacco farmers. I \nunderstand the devastation in health that their crop can cause, but I \nhave always felt they deserve a chance to find another livelihood. This \nbill gives them that chance. That is why I support it.\n  Let me speak to the amendment before us, the Durbin and DeWine \namendment. It is a look-back provision.\n  Now, we could give all the speeches we want to give on the floor of \nthe Senate and in the Chamber of the House decrying teen addiction to \ntobacco products, addiction to nicotine. We can pass all the bills we \nwant saying that as a Nation we are going to come to grips with this, \nand I am afraid we will not achieve our goal unless we are very serious \nand very specific. In fact, in every State in the Nation it is against \nthe law for minors under the age of 18 to purchase tobacco products, \nand yet clearly they do on a daily and overwhelming basis. So the mere \nenactment of a law has not achieved our goal.\n  Why is the McCain bill any different? It is different because one \nimportant facet of this bill is included. It is the so-called look-back \nprovision. The look-back provision is accountability; it is honesty. It \nsays that as the years go by we will measure the number of teen smokers \nin America, and if that percentage does not come down, the tobacco \ncompanies and tobacco industry will be held accountable in terms of \nfees that need to be paid as they miss these targets.\n  That accountability brings reality to this debate. We can have the \nhighest flying speeches, the most voluminous rhetoric, and yet we will \nnot achieve our goal unless we are specific. Is this a matter that \nshould concern us? Consider this chart for a minute. It is a troubling \ncommentary on what is happening in America.\n  This chart shows the percentage of high school students who currently \nsmoke cigarettes. Look at from 1991 to 1997. In every grade, 9th, 10th, \n11th and 12th, across America, there has been an increase in the \npercentage of students who are smoking. In fact, the increase over the \nsix years has been 30 percent. While we have given all these speeches, \nwhile we have talked about this problem, while the President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and so many \nothers have addressed it, we have, in fact, seen the children of \nAmerica ignoring it. They have taken up this habit, and as they take it \nup more and more kids are vulnerable.\n  For those who do not think this is a real American family issue, I \npose one question which I always pose in this debate: Have you ever met \na mother or father who came to you at work one morning and with great \npride and a smile on their face said, ``We have great news at home. Our \ndaughter came home last night and she started smoking.'' I have never \nheard that. In fact, just the opposite is true. Parents who suspect \ntheir kids have started smoking are worried. They understand the \ndanger. They understand the addiction. And they understand better than \nmost why this debate is so critically important.\n  Some argument is made as to whether or not the increase in the price \nof tobacco products will reduce usage by children. The Senator from \nMissouri, who spoke before me, talked about all sorts of surveys that \ncame to an opposite conclusion. I would point to two that confirm the \nbelief in this bill that if you raise the price of the product, \nchildren are less likely to use it.\n  In Canada, just to the north, when they imposed a substantial \nincrease in the Federal tax on tobacco products, they had a 60-percent \nreduction in children who were smoking. Kids are price sensitive; they \ndon't have all the money in the world, and when the price of the \nproduct goes up too high, they stop using it or reduce their usage. \nCanada is a perfect example.\n  On the academic front, at the University of Illinois, Dr. Frank \nChaloupka has performed a study in which he has surveyed cigarette \nprices and whether or not they have any impact on the percentage of \nyouth smoking. He says:\n\n       Based on this research, I estimate that a $1.50 increase in \n     the federal cigarette tax, implemented over three years and \n     maintained in real, inflation adjusted terms, will cut the \n     prevalence of youth smoking in half.\n\n  The bill sticks to $1.10, and the percentage decrease may not be as \nhigh or as dramatic, but clearly it will be a decrease. Increasing the \ncost of the product reduces its usage.\n  I find it interesting that my colleague from Missouri talked about \nthe so-called cash cow that this $1.10 creates, the billions of dollars \nbrought into the Federal Treasury because of this increase in the \nFederal tobacco tax. I think this is money that is going to be raised \nfor good purposes, to reduce teen smoking, to invest in medical \nresearch, to invest in smoking cessation, and to help tobacco farmers \nin transition.\n  It is interesting that so many of the critics of this bill, who argue \nwe need no tax whatsoever, are anxious to spend the proceeds from that \ntax. Reference is made to the marriage penalty, an interesting tax \nchallenge which we should take up at some point. But the people who are \nopposed to this bill want to take the proceeds from the bill and spend \nthem on correcting this tax anomaly, the so-called marriage tax \npenalty. They cannot have it both ways. You cannot decry this bill as a \nso-called cash cow, raising taxes that are unnecessary, and then make \nall sorts of proposals on how to spend it, and certainly proposals \nwhich have little or no relevance to the question of whether or not we \nare addressing the scourge of smoking addiction in this country.\n  Let me also speak for a moment to the Food and Drug Administration. \nIt is true that Dr. David Kessler, who is a friend and someone I worked \nwith for many years, showed extraordinary courage, with President \nClinton and Vice President Gore, in an initiative to reduce smoking in \nAmerica. They took a lot of heat for it, because they took on the \ntobacco industry and they suggested they were going to get serious \nabout it. They were going to try to view nicotine as the drug that it \nis. They were going to try to hold accountable retailers who were \nselling to children. And they were going to establish standards across \nAmerica--for example, asking for identification for the purchase of \ntobacco products. When they proposed this, their critics went wild: \n``Oh, it is overreaching by the\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\nFederal Government. It is just entirely too much.'' Yet they were on \nthe right track, a track which we follow today.\n  Let me try to zero in specifically on the Durbin-DeWine amendment. \nThe fact that this amendment is being debated today has a lot to do \nwith 40 State attorneys general who filed lawsuits against the tobacco \ncompanies, seeking to recover, for their States and taxpayers, money \nthat was spent because of tobacco products. Last year, as a result of \nthe aggregate effort of these attorneys general, a general agreement, \nor settlement, was reached. Part of that agreement included these so-\ncalled look-back provisions. The agreement said that the tobacco \nindustry was willing to be held accountable to reduce the percentage of \nyoung people smoking. If they did not reach the goals, they would be \npenalized. So the idea of a look-back provision is not something being \nfoisted on the industry or something brand new on Capitol Hill; this is \nan idea that was endorsed by the tobacco companies as part of their \nagreement with the State attorneys general.\n  The difference, of course, in the DeWine-Durbin approach, is that we \ntake this from an industry assessment, from an industry fee, and say \nlet's look, instead, to the specific tobacco companies. Senator McCain \nof Arizona, in his bill, says we should do that for roughly a third of \nthe penalties involved. Senator DeWine and I think it should be a \nlarger percentage. Let me explain to you why we think it should be \nlarger.\n\n  Consider this for a moment. Some of my critics come to the floor and \nsay it is impossible for us to measure how many children smoke how many \nbrands of cigarettes. In fact, my friend, the Senator from Texas, says \nit doesn't pass the laugh test, to think that we would be able to \nmeasure how many underage kids are smoking Camels or Marlboros or Kools \nor Virginia Slims.\n  Let me suggest to him and others who criticize this amendment, the \ntobacco companies have extraordinary resources and ability to measure \nthe use of their product. If you challenged Philip Morris to tell you \nhow many left-handed Latvians smoke Marlboros, I bet they could come up \nwith the number. If you challenged R.J. Reynolds to come up with how \nmany tongue-tied Texans use Camels, I'll bet they could come up with \nthe number. Because they market these products and these brands on a \nvery specific basis. They want to know not only how many they are \nselling, but to whom they are selling them because they have billions \nof dollars of advertising that they are going to focus in, to try to \nwin over new groups.\n  So the suggestion that we cannot measure the number of young people \nusing certain brands of cigarettes just defies common sense. The \nindustry has this ability. It has this knowledge. It is a sampling \ntechnique that is used by businesses across America, and it can be \napplied here. Senator DeWine and I seek to apply this standard in this \nsituation. We believe--and I hope my colleagues will join us in the \nbelief--that it is eminently fair for us to hold each tobacco company \naccountable.\n  Let us assume, for example, that R.J. Reynolds takes this bill very \nseriously and says they are going to stop marketing their product to \nchildren, that they are no longer going to be selling Camel cigarettes \nto kids. They tell their retailers: ``Don't let that pack go over the \ncounter. Don't sell it to a child. We are very serious about it. Or we \nmay cut off your access to our product.'' They say to the people who \nare doing the advertising and marketing: ``Get honest about this. Make \nsure that we don't advertise around schools. Make sure that we don't \nhave all these promotions with Camel hats and shirts and all the rest \nof it.''\n  And let's say they are successful. Should that conduct on their part, \nthat positive conduct, be rewarded? Of course it should. In contrast, \nif Marlboro and Philip Morris, for example, decide they don't care, \nthey just go on selling as usual, and in fact you see kids, more and \nmore kids, turning to their brand, should they be held accountable for \nthat decision? Why, of course they should. Company-by-company \naccountability makes sense. It says to the tobacco industry: This is \nnot just an industry problem, this is a company challenge. Get serious \nabout it.\n  I was somewhat amused that the Richmond, VA, Times-Dispatch yesterday \ncame out with a story from the Philip Morris company. For someone who \nhas been battling this issue for a long time, it is hard to imagine, \nbut Geoffrey Bible, chairman of the Nation's largest tobacco company, \ntold employees in New York that he has recently appointed a senior \nexecutive to ``design more actions'' to back up the company's long-held \nclaim that it does not try to appeal to youngsters.\n  What a great epiphany it must have been in Richmond, VA, for Philip \nMorris to finally realize we are talking about them, we are talking \nabout their marketing and advertising techniques, and we are talking \nabout the possibility, if they do not get serious and start reducing \nsales to youth, that in fact they are going to have to pay for it.\n  The Durbin-DeWine amendment says that payment should be directed at \nthe companies based on their conduct. If they are positive and reduce \nsales to children, they will be rewarded. If they ignore this bill and \nthey ignore these goals and end up selling more to children, they \nshould pay a price for it. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  I want to salute, incidentally, the State attorneys general who \nstarted this ball rolling. Some have been critical of them. I have not. \nWe would not be here today without their initiative and without the \nprogress that they made. Particularly, I would like to salute Attorney \nGeneral Skip Humphrey of Minnesota. He hung in there for a long time, \nand, literally before the jury retired to consider a verdict, he \nsettled the case for over $6 billion for the taxpayers of Minnesota. \nThat is great news for those taxpayers and Attorney General Humphrey. \nBut equally important, during the course of his lawsuit he managed to \ndraw out even more documents from the tobacco industry. It seems that \nthe more and more documentation we bring out, the more obvious it is \nthat these tobacco executives have been lying to us for decades. They \nhave, in fact, been targeting kids.\n  We have so many examples. I can't read them all to you here, but from \na 1981 memo, a Philip Morris researcher said:\n\n       Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer.\n\n  A 1973 Brown & Williamson memo said:\n\n       Kool has shown little or no growth in share of users in the \n     26-plus age group. Growth is from 16 to 25 year olds. . ..\n\n  Remember, at the time, it was illegal to sell their product to 16-\nyear-olds in some States, and, yet, they were making it very clear it \nwas part of their marketing strategy. The list just goes on and on of \nthese companies that made conscious marketing decisions to sell to \nchildren. They knew they had to recruit these kids. If the kids turned \n18, it was unlikely they would become smokers. All of these documents \nand evidence have really made the case.\n  Our look-back amendment says we are going to take this very seriously \non a company-by-company basis. Let me address for a moment some of the \ncriticisms that have been leveled against this amendment.\n  First, if you support the McCain bill, which has a company-specific \npayment in it, then you must necessarily reject the argument that you \ncannot assess on a company-specific basis. McCain assumes that, I \nassume it, common sense dictates that, in fact, the companies market \ntheir brands to specific groups and can measure the success of their \nmarketing and sales. The Durbin-DeWine amendment takes the McCain \npremise of the fee assessed on a company-wide basis and expands it. So \nfor supporters of the McCain bill, the Durbin-DeWine amendment is \nconsistent with the methodology that is used.\n  Second, this will not lead to price increases. The Durbin-DeWine \namendment is just the opposite. Some are arguing the look-back \nprovision means the cost of the tobacco product is going to go up. \nWell, not necessarily. If, for example, in the case that I used, R.J. \nReynolds is doing a good job and they are not assessed a surcharge, but \nPhilip Morris is doing a bad job and they are assessed, then Philip \nMorris is going to have to find a way to absorb that payment in their \ncost on the bottom line, because to raise the price of their products \nputs them at a competitive disadvantage with the people at R.J. \nReynolds.\n  The Durbin-DeWine amendment is specific in saying any payment that is\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\nassessed is going to be absorbed by the company in their bottom line. \nLet me give you an example of the breadth of this payment.\n  If a company misses the target by 20 percent--in other words, we are \nsaying we are going to reduce teen smoking by so much percent--15 \npercent, 20 percent, 30 percent--and it turns out they miss it by 20 \npercent, by a large margin, under our amendment their payment would add \nup to about 29 cents a pack. It sounds like a lot of money. It is, but \ndon't forget for a moment that the tobacco companies' profit on each \npackage of cigarettes is 40 cents. So our amendment is not going to \ndrive them out of business. It simply is going to tell them their \nprofits are on the line unless they stop selling to children.\n  Some have argued that our surcharge is too high and will increase \ncosts to $7 billion instead of the underlying bill's $4 billion. That \nis not accurate, either. The underlying bill is kept at $4 billion in \nindustry-wide payments, but it also has company-specific payments as \nwell. The Durbin-DeWine amendment draws a line and puts an absolute cap \nat $7 billion in total.\n  The two approaches--the bill and our amendment--have similar \naggregates if the companies miss by large amounts.\n  Third, it has been said that this amendment is punitive--punitive. \nOur approach is not punitive. It reduces the industry-wide payment that \napplies to companies that, in fact, reduce their youth smoking while \nother companies fail to do so. It increases the surcharges on companies \nthat continue to market or sell to kids. That is not punishment, that \nis accountability.\n  And fourth, as a sign we are not punitive, we have capped the amount \nthat can be charged. It has been pointed out that we require payments \nof as much as $240 million per percentage point, but keep in mind, too, \nthat the underlying bill also has provisions in there for payments by \npercentage point. The lifetime social cost of hooking each youth smoker \nis $400 million. We are still charging companies less than the social \ncost of their continued sales to youth.\n  I will conclude my time that has been allotted under the unanimous \nconsent agreement by showing on this chart what happens under the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment as opposed to the McCain bill.\n  If companies miss by 5 percent, the amount they are charged is $240 \nmillion under our amendment, and it is $190 million in the underlying \nbill. At 10 percent, you can see the numbers, and 20 percent as well.\n  The Durbin-DeWine amendment sets out to achieve several goals on \nwhich I hope all Senators, regardless of party, will agree. We reduce \nthe number of youth smokers by 450,000 over the McCain bill. We reduce \nthe number of premature deaths by 150,000 with this amendment. We \nreduce by $2.8 billion the lifetime social costs that are attached to \nsmoking addiction, diseases, and death. And we have the same target in \nreduction as the original proposed settlement with the States attorneys \ngeneral.\n  I hope those who have listened to this debate will understand what we \nare about here. This look-back amendment is more than just a technical \napproach. It is, in fact, an approach which requires honesty and \naccountability. The tobacco companies hate this amendment like the \ndevil hates holy water, because this amendment holds them accountable \nand says, ``We don't want to hear anymore verbiage from you about \nreducing teen smoking. We want to put it in writing. We want to put it \non the line. We want you to be held accountable, and you will be held \naccountable. And if the Durbin-DeWine amendment is adopted and you \ncontinue to push your product on children and this addiction rate among \nour kids continues to grow, you will pay through the nose.''\n  That is hard talk, I know. This is a hard subject. We are talking \nabout the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today. That is \nwhy this historic debate is so important, and that is why no other \npolitical diversion that has been raised on the floor should be taken \nseriously. Let us get about the people's business. Let us do something \nto give our kids a chance to be spared the scourge of addiction to \nnicotine and tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, the single most important step this \nCongress can take to protect our youngsters from the tobacco companies \nthat prey on them is to hold each of those companies individually \naccountable. And that is what the look-back legislation does that is \nnow before the Senate.\n  I would like to spend just a few minutes talking about why this is \nsuch a critically important amendment in terms of protecting our \nchildren.\n  History shows, and shows very clearly, that each time the Congress \ntried to rein in the tobacco companies in the past, the tobacco \ncompanies would use their enormous marketing, entrepreneurial and \npublic relations skills to get around those efforts. So this amendment \noffered by our colleagues, Senators Durbin, DeWine, myself, and others, \nprovides an opportunity to literally reverse the course of history.\n  Previous efforts were always evaded by the tobacco companies. They \nwere able to get around efforts to restrict electronic advertising; \nthey were able to get around the early warning labels that were passed \nby the Congress. When our colleague on the other side of the Congress, \nthe late Mike Synar, passed legislation to ensure that the States would \ntake strong action to enforce the antisales laws to minors, the tobacco \ncompanies got around that. And the reason is that past policies never \nprovided a way to hold each individual company accountable.\n  So that is why this legislation is so very important. I would submit \nto my colleagues--I argued this in the Senate Commerce Committee when, \nas the Presiding Officer knows because I offered a similar proposal \nthere as well--that this is really the key, if you want to see tobacco \ncompanies clean up their act and do what they have long said they would \ndo, and that is, stop targeting the youngsters of our country.\n  If you really do not want to change business as usual, vote against \nthis amendment. If you think that tobacco companies will do it on their \nown, then you ought to oppose this amendment. But if you want to change \nthe course of history and make sure that we have the tools to hold the \ncompanies accountable when they again, as they have done throughout \nhistory, look for ways to get around this legislation, if you really \nwant to get the job done right, then vote for this amendment offered by \nour colleague from Illinois.\n  The tobacco companies have spent vast sums in recent months arguing \nthat this sort of legislation really isn't needed, that they would take \nstrong action on their own and that they have cleaned up their act from \nyears past. In the Senate Commerce Committee, we heard that argument. \nAs the Presiding Officer knows, we heard from all the CEOs at that \ntime. Given the fact that many of the documents and the accounts of \npast industry misdeeds were pretty old, a number of us were inclined to \nsay it is a new day. Let us see if the tobacco companies are going to \nbe better corporate citizens. Let's see if they have cleaned up their \nact.\n  As we prepared for those Commerce Committee hearings, Mr. President, \nI learned that the Brown & Williamson Company was again engaging in \nconduct that did not really reflect what they and other companies were \nsaying in the ads that they were running at that time about how it is a \nnew day and they have cleaned up their act.\n  A brief bit of history for the Senate I think would be revealing.\n  I participated, as a Member of the other body, in the hearings in \n1994 where the tobacco executives then under oath, told me that \nnicotine isn't addictive. Of course, they contradicted every Surgeon \nGeneral for decades. But there was actually a revelation at that \nhearing that perhaps was equally remarkable. At that hearing, it was \nbrought to light that the Brown & Williamson Company was genetically\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\naltering tobacco plants to give it an added punch as a way to attract \nsmokers--shocking evidence. And when brought to light, the Brown & \nWilliamson Company pledged to the committee, to the country, that they \nwouldn't engage in that kind of conduct again.\n\n  As we prepared for our hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee, we \nbegan to hear about news reports that the Brown & Williamson Company \nwas using genetically altered tobacco, known as Y-1, in cigarettes and \nselling them both here and abroad. So when the executives came before \nthe Senate Commerce Committee I asked them about this. In their words, \nthe CEO of the Brown & Williamson Company said, ``We are working off a \nsmall stockpile of genetically-altered tobacco, and in fact that is \nbeing included in cigarettes in our country and around the world.''\n  As many in the Senate know, there is now a criminal inquiry underway. \nThere have already been those who have pleaded guilty in connection \nwith this matter. The Justice Department continues its investigation.\n  The reason I bring this up is this is a concrete, tangible reason why \nwe need the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois. The Senator \nfrom Illinois, our colleague, Senator Durbin, gives us a chance to \nreign in a company that engages in that kind of rogue action, action \nthat is detrimental to the health of the American people, and action \nthat, in fact, as recently as 4 years ago said they would never engage \nin again.\n  It is one thing to talk about conduct that is 20 or 30 years old; it \nis another thing to talk about conduct that stems from the 1950s. But \nit is quite another to see a company that makes a pledge to the \nAmerican people that they will stop engaging in a health practice which \nis obviously detrimental to children and to our citizens, and then \nstart it again, even while the hot light of the Congress is examining \ntheir conduct in considering legislation.\n  These companies are not going to change on their own, Mr. President. \nWe are going to have to hold them accountable through legislation. That \nis why this amendment is so very important. I will tell my colleagues \nthat I believe this amendment, in connection with the accountability \nrequirements that the President knows we set up in the course of our \nCommerce Committee deliberations, is the single most important tool for \nreversing history and making sure that after this bill is passed and \nthe tobacco companies try to get around it, that we will have some \nstrong tools to rein them in.\n  I know we want to move to a vote on this, but I simply wanted to take \na few minutes of the Senate's time to say that I think this is a \ncritically important amendment. It is critically important for each \nSenator who really is serious about changing business as usual with \nrespect to tobacco policy. The single most important concept the \ntobacco companies fear is accountability. They have not been faced with \ncompany specific accountability when we have passed previous \nlegislation--warning labels, advertising restrictions, or the Synar \namendment. They never had to face an amendment like this that would \nsay, look, we are actually going to require you to produce results.\n  I hope our colleagues will, as reflected by the bipartisan authorship \nof this amendment--our colleagues, Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine--\nwill pass this legislation. It is critically important for the \nyoungsters of this country. It is the one part of this bill that will \nmake sure that the job actually gets done in protecting youngsters, and \nnot allow another piece of legislation, once again, to be evaded by the \ntobacco companies' genius, their marketing skills, and the vast sums \nthat they will continue to spend with respect to marketing their \nproducts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \ncontinued, persistent, passionate commitment to trying to pass this \nlegislation.\n  The Senator was referring to the extraordinary sums of money that the \ntobacco industry spends. Let me remind our fellow Americans that amount \nof money is $6.5 billion per year, $16.5 million per day, $700,000 \nevery hour to get people to smoke. What is most astonishing about this \neffort to get people to smoke is the degree to which it has been \ntargeted at young people, targeted at children.\n\n  It is an extraordinary story. Nine out of 10 kids who smoke use one \nof the three most advertised brands, and yet less than 30 percent of \nadults use those most advertised brands. A study of 6-year-olds showed \nthat just as many 6-year-olds--91 percent of all the 6-year-olds in \nthis country--could identify Joe Camel just as they could identify \nMickey Mouse. That is an absolutely extraordinary statement.\n  Now, there is a reverse side of how extraordinary these statistics \nreally are, because for every American who smokes there is an American \nor two who are trying not to smoke. All of them will tell you--or \nalmost all, 86 percent to 90 percent of them--they started smoking when \nthey were teenagers. Most of them--again, many, many, analyses and \npolls have been done of this--most of those people who started smoking \nas teenagers will tell us if they could quit today, they would quit \ntoday and never start again. If they had the choice to make again, they \nwouldn't choose to smoke. But they smoke because they are addicted. \nThey are hooked.\n  The truth is, in the United States of America we have more people \nspending more money to try to get unhooked on an annual basis than we \nspend on day care. That is most extraordinary. I found it hard to \nbelieve when I heard that. In Massachusetts alone, our citizens are \nspending $1.3 billion a year on nicotine patches, on different kinds of \ngums, on therapy, on hypnosis, on all of the things that people go \nthrough to try to stop. We are spending $1.3 billion a year in \nMassachusetts alone. Extrapolate that out across the country--it is \nmillions of dollars more than the Federal Government commits to day \ncare for our children. The reason this happens is because people get \nhooked at the early stages.\n  Now, I want to share with my colleagues something about getting \nhooked in the early stages. We continue to hear colleagues come to the \nfloor and say, gosh, this is going to raise money in the expense of \ncigarettes, and that is not a good thing. But they never address the \namount of money that Americans are spending because of people who \nsmoke. They never address the tax that cigarettes ``whack'' every \nAmerican, even those who don't smoke. Every single household in America \nis spending an unwanted, unrequested, undesired 1,300 plus dollars --\n1,370 or so dollars. Every household in America spends that, whether \nthey want to or not, on the cost of the other Americans who smoke and \nthen get sick.\n  Let me share a story about some Americans who smoke and get sick, a \ncommentary in USA Today by Victor Crawford. The title is ``Tobacco was \nDad's Life; It Also Took his Life.'' I read from the article:\n\n       My father never had a chance. When he was growing up in the \n     1940s, almost everyone smoked cigarettes. He said it was the \n     thing to do. It was not until 1964 that the U.S. Surgeon \n     General declared smoking was harmful. But by then, my father \n     had been addicted for almost 20 years. His addiction finally \n     killed him last March, one month before his 64th birthday.\n       When my father was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1991, \n     some thought he had it coming to him. You see, my father was \n     a Maryland State senator turned tobacco lobbyist. He was the \n     first to dismiss the antismoking people as ``health Nazis'' \n     but spent the last years of his life trying to undo the \n     damage he had done. He admitted he had lied, and he \n     apologized for claiming, ``There is no evidence that smoking \n     causes cancer.'' Unfortunately, tobacco lobbyists understand \n     this simple logic all too well. Like my father, most smokers \n     today start when they are about 13 years old. And since about \n     90 percent of all new smokers are 18 and under, the industry \n     needs to keep hooking kids to stay in business.\n\n  I will skip through a little bit, turning to the end:\n\n       My father said, ``Some of the smartest people in America \n     work at just one thing: trying to figure out how to get young \n     people to smoke. As tobacco kills off people like me, they \n     need replacements.'' My father didn't live to see his \n     daughter graduate from college; he won't meet my future wife, \n     nor will he walk my sister down the aisle at her upcoming \n     wedding; he will never know his grandchildren, and they will \n     never meet their grandfather--all because when he was 13, \n     smoking was the thing to do. Let's give today's kids a \n     fighting chance.\n\n  Mr. President, that is why we are here in the U.S. Senate. We have \nbeen tied up for more than a week now trying to give kids a fighting \nchance.\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\n There is only one reason this bill is on the floor of the Senate: \nbecause every expert in America, including the tobacco companies, tells \nus that if you raise the price of cigarettes, you will reduce the \nnumber of young people who smoke. And if we reduce the number of young \npeople who smoke now, we will reduce the 420,000 Americans who die \nevery year as a result of a smoking-related disease, such as cancer of \nthe pancreas, cancer of the larynx, cancer of the throat--one cancer or \nanother--and heart disease and liver disease.\n  The Presiding Officer understands better than anybody, as a \npracticing physician and one who has been a key architect in helping to \nget this bill in a position to pass it, that this bill is about \nstopping kids from smoking and reducing the costs to America, the costs \nto families, the unwanted, unrequested costs of smoking. Families who \nresult with a disease that comes from smoking wind up paying tens of \nthousands of dollars more in health insurance. But the impact for those \npeople who don't have insurance, or adequate insurance, is to raise the \ninsurance costs for everybody in America, raise the costs of all of our \nhospitals, raise the costs for families who can ill afford it.\n  Mr. President, this is the first opportunity the U.S. Senate has had \nto address an extraordinary history. I want to share that history with \nmy colleagues. It is now known that the tobacco industry helped to \ncreate this mess by targeting young people, by creating replacement \nsmokers. Many of my colleagues may not have had an opportunity to focus \nprecisely on the degree to which that has been true and the degree to \nwhich, therefore, this effort to try to raise the price of cigarettes \nand create a series of efforts to prevent young people from smoking \nthrough cessation programs, counteradvertising, and other efforts, is \nso important.\n  In 1975, the R.J. Reynolds company, in a memorandum, wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       To ensure increased and longer-term growth for Camel \n     filter, the brand must increase its share penetration among \n     the 14-24 age group, which have a new set of more liberal \n     values and which represent tomorrow's cigarette business.\n\n  That is the R.J. Reynolds company talking about targeting the 14- to \n24-year-old age group because they are ``tomorrow's cigarette \nbusiness.''\n\n       They represent tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14-24 \n     age group matures, they will account for a key share of the \n     total cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years.\n\n  That is an R.J. Reynolds tobacco company executive, a vice president \nfor marketing, C.A. Tucker, on September 30, 1974.\n  Let me read what Mr. C.A. Tucker also said:\n\n       This suggests slow market share erosion for us in the years \n     to come unless the situation is corrected . . . Our strategy \n     becomes clear for our established brands: 1. Direct \n     advertising appeal to the younger smokers.\n\n  Let me read what Dianne Burrows, a researcher, wrote in a memo for \nR.J. Reynolds in 1984:\n\n       If younger adults turn away from smoking, the industry must \n     decline, just as the population which does not give birth \n     will eventually dwindle.\n\n  In the same memo, it says:\n\n       Younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the \n     growth and decline of every major brand and company over the \n     last 50 years. They will continue to be just as important to \n     brands/companies in the future for two simple reasons: the \n     renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-old \n     smokers. No more than 5 percent of smokers start after the \n     age of 24.\n\n  That is an R.J. Reynolds research memorandum, telling us that people \ndon't start smoking after age 24. They targeted young people and got \nthem hooked with a narcotic killer substance.\n\n       Brands/companies which fail to attract their fair share of \n     younger adult smokers face an uphill battle.\n       Younger adult smokers are the only source of replacement \n     smokers.\n\n  So kill them off and replace them. Kill them off and replace them. \nThat is the way it has been.\n  This is a Brown & Williamson memo from consultants recommending that \nthe company consider Coca-Cola or other sweet-flavored cigarettes. The \n1972 memo says:\n\n       It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. \n     Honey might be considered.\n\n  They were talking about a way to try to sweeten cigarettes and get \nmore young people hooked.\n  Another Brown & Williamson memo said:\n\n       Kool has shown little or no growth in share of users in the \n     26 [plus] age group . . . Growth is from 16-25 year olds. At \n     the present rate, a smoker in the 16-24 year age group will \n     soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any \n     other broad age category.\n\n  Let me share a Philip Morris document with you. We are going to \nspread this around. We have had some from R.J. Reynolds and Brown & \nWilliamson. This is from a report sent from researcher Myron E. Johnson \nto Robert B. Seligman, then vice president of research and development, \nin 1981:\n\n       We will no longer be able to rely on a rapidly increasing \n     pool of teenagers from which to replace smokers through lost \n     normal attrition . . . Because of our high share of the \n     market among the youngest smokers, Philip Morris will suffer \n     more than the other companies from the decline in the number \n     of teenage smokers.\n\n  So here you have Philip Morris, particularly, concerned about the \nloss between different companies, targeting teenagers.\n  This from the same report of Philip Morris:\n\n       Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer . \n     . . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly \n     important to Philip Morris . . . the share index is highest \n     in the youngest group for all Marlboro and Virginia Slims \n     packings.\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own \n     data, which includes younger teenagers, shows even higher \n     Marlboro market penetration among 15-17 year olds.\n\n  This is from a different document, Mr. President. This is a Philip \nMorris internal document in 1987. This came from the Minnesota case. \nThis was an exhibit in the Minnesota trial. This may explain one of the \nreasons that Minnesota finally reached a settlement.\n\n       You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey \n     Harris of MIT calculated . . . the 1982-1983 round of price \n     increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and \n     prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. Those \n     teenagers are now 18-21 years old, and since about 70 percent \n     of 18-20 year-olds and 35 percent of older smokers smoke a PM \n     brand, this means that 700,000 of those adult quitters had \n     been PM smokers and 420,000 of the non-starters would have \n     been PM smokers. Thus, if Harris is right, we were hit \n     disproportionately hard.\n\n  Here is the kicker: ``We don't need this to happen again.''\n  In other words, we don't need to lose these smokers again. We have to \nfind a way to penetrate--that, and the young people. But the most \nimportant thing is they found that their price increase caused 2 \nmillion adults to quit, and it prevented 600,000 teenagers from \nstarting to smoke.\n  That is a cigarette industry document. For those Senators who keep \ncoming to the floor saying, ``Why are we raising this price?'' all they \nhave to do is read the cigarette companies that they are inadvertently, \nor otherwise, protecting on the floor by not voting for this \nlegislation, because the cigarette companies themselves will tell you, \nraise the price and they lose business. That is precisely why people \nagreed on a volume adjustment in the process of arriving at how much \nmoney is going to be gained over the course of the life of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me read from a different Philip Morris memo.\n\n       The teenage years are also important because those are the \n     years during which most smokers begin to smoke, the years in \n     which initial brand selections are made, and the period in \n     the life cycle in which conformity to peer group norms is \n     greatest.\n\n  Mr. President, here we have an admission by Philip Morris of what \neverybody has known--that they are actually targeting the peer group \nwhich they know to be the most susceptible to exactly the kind of \nadvertising that they geared up.\n\n       The teenage years are also important because those are the \n     years during which most smokers begin to smoke . . . the \n     period in the life cycle in which conformity to peer group \n     norms is the greatest.\n\n  That is extraordinary.\n  So the cigarette companies willfully played on the time period of \ngreatest peer group pressure and played to the peer group pressure. So \nit is today that we can hear from people who are in wheelchairs who \nhave lung transplants like Pam Lafland, who I quoted a few days ago, \nwho tells a story today of her\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nstarting, as just that kind of peer group pressure person who responded \nto the notion, ``Oh, boy. If I smoke a cigarette, I am going to look \nolder.'' Today she looks a lot older. Today she is trying to take care \nof her kids out of a wheelchair.\n  Mr. President, that is what this is all about. Let me read from a \ndifferent R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. marketing report on the future of \nWinston. This is 1990--15 years ago already of reports that we are \nlooking at.\n\n       Winston, of course, faces one unique challenge . . . . It's \n     what we have been calling the `doomsday scenario'.\n\n  Get this, the ``doomsday scenario.''\n\n       . . . an acute deficiency of young adult smokers, \n     apparently implying Marlboro's final domination and our utter \n     demise within a generation.''\n\n  The ``doomsday scenario''--that they are not going to get enough \nyoung people hooked on Marlboros, and down they go.\n  Here is a 1969 draft report from the Philip Morris board of \ndirectors:\n\n       Smoking a cigarette for the beginner is a symbolic act . . \n     . . `I am no longer my mother's child, I am tough, I am an \n     adventurer, I'm not square' . . . . As the force . . .\n\n  This is really.\n\n       * * * As the force from the psychological symbolism \n     subsides, the pharmacological effect takes over to sustain \n     the habit * * *\n\n  Mr. President, that is one of the most remarkable admissions from a \ncompany that we have had in this entire debate. I want to rephrase it.\n  What they are saying is that after they have abused a young person's \nsusceptibility to peer pressure, after they have exploited this young \nperson's availability to get them into smoking, they acknowledged in \n1969 that once the psychological symbolism is gone, it is the \npharmacological effect that sustains the habit. In other words, they \nare hooked. They are addicted. They got to have it.\n  Here is a Lorillard executive in 1978:\n  ``The base of our business is the high-school student.''\n  Mr. President, there are pages and pages of the thoughts of the \ncigarette companies regarding their availability to cigarettes, all of \nwhich are the most profound fundamental documentation and for which the \nU.S. Senate must pass this legislation in the next days. There is no \nroom for excuses in the face of the cigarette companies' own \nacknowledgments of what they have done to target generation after \ngeneration of Americans in order to get them hooked on a substance that \nis a drug, that is addictive and a killer substance which winds up \ncosting Americans increasing amounts of money. costing Americans \nincreasing amounts of money.\n\n  Mr. President, we have that opportunity here. We have the opportunity \nto do precisely what the cigarette companies themselves have now agreed \nto do. They settled of their own accord with a number of different \nStates. And in their settlements with those States, they agreed to pay \namounts of money, they agreed to curb advertising, they agreed to \nengage in cessation programs, and they agreed to raise the price of \ncigarettes--all of the things that we are seeking to do here in this \nlegislation. There is no excuse for a U.S. Senator coming to the floor \nand suggesting that we shouldn't do at a national level in the U.S. \nSenate what the cigarette companies themselves have agreed to do in \nsettlements with the States--no excuse. The States themselves have \narrived at settlements. If you extrapolate the amount of money that \nthey are paying in those settlements, it is more than the U.S. Senate \nhas agreed in its denial of a $1.50 increase and more than it has \nagreed to raise in total in this legislation.\n  So this is not a matter of economic survival for those companies. \nThis is a question of whether or not we are going to engage in an \neffort to reduce the access of our young people to cigarettes. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  I have heard some people complain, ``Well, you know, it is one thing \nto raise the money but we ought to do the right thing with the money.'' \nThen they start coming and diverting the money to a whole lot of things \nthat have nothing to do with stopping kids from smoking.\n  It is going to take more than just a price increase to be successful \nin our goals. We need to guarantee that kids who are particularly \nvulnerable--kids who have difficult situations at home or kids who may \nleave school at 2 o'clock in the afternoon for whom there is no adult \nsupervision between the hours of 2 o'clock and 6 or 7 in the evening--\nare not going to be left to their own devices in order to go out in the \nstreets and meet a drug dealer, or subject themselves to the various \npeer pressures and wind up with smoking as a new habit.\n  Mr. President, we have the opportunity here to be able to make a \ndifference in the availability of kids to that kind of free time. We \nhave the opportunity to be able to provide cessation programs, which \nhave been proven to work. California, Arizona, my own State of \nMassachusetts, have exemplary programs which are reducing the level of \nteenagers who are smoking, and they do it through various kinds of \neducation--outreach, peer groups--different kinds of educational \nefforts within the classrooms and within the schools. But we need to \ntrain people in that. We need to train teenagers. You need the adequate \ndevelopment of teachers to be able to conduct that kind of pedagogy \nwith which they may not be familiar. And you need to have an adequate \nsupply of materials. You need to be able to help organize it \nadministratively.\n  I think this bill is structured in a way that tries to afford the \nmaximum opportunity to States and local communities to be able to \ndecide how to do that. This is not some big Federal mandate. This is \nleft largely for the States to be able to decide what works for them \nbest and how they will organize their efforts. We have simply tried to \noutline those areas that by most expert judgments there is the greatest \nchance of really having an impact on children and making a difference \nin their lives.\n  So those outlines have been laid out as a menu, if you will, from \nwhich one could choose at the State level. It is not insignificant that \nthe Governors, both Republican and Democrat alike, have signed off on \nthat concept. If they are content that they can exercise their judgment \nadequately and that this gives them an opportunity to be able to \ncontinue the things that they have started, I think that ought to \nsatisfy the judgment of those who often make a career out of fending \nfor the right of States to make those decisions and a career out of \nopposing the Federal Government's heavy hand into something. This bill \nspecifically, I think, appeals to both of those best options. I hope my \ncolleagues will recognize that upon close analysis.\n  Mr. President, I simply wanted to refocus the Senate on the critical \ncomponent of what brings us here. I think we have, hopefully, finally \narrived at an assessment that there is only one reason for raising the \nprice of cigarettes. That reason did not initiate itself in the Senate. \nIt came from the tobacco companies themselves, from economists, from \nexperts. It came from health experts, and it came from many focus \ngroups and analyses, all of which have arrived at the conclusion that \nprice is important.\n  Now, I thought, frankly, that Adam Smith and others had arrived at \nthat conclusion a long, long time ago. I think most people in the \nmarketplace have always known that most commodities are price \nsensitive, and the marketplace is price sensitive. Indeed, the tobacco \ncompanies have underscored that in their own memoranda which say they \nlost smokers as a result of their earlier price increases. What \nhappened before will happen again. The question is whether we are going \nto maximize our effort in order to guarantee that kids get a lot more \nthan just the price increase, that they get the kinds of guidance and \nthe kinds of personal counseling and the kinds of personal education \nthat will make a difference in the peer pressure, symbolic side of the \nchoice that so many have made. And this ultimately will benefit every \nsingle American. If we are going to talk about the cost, let us talk \nabout the cost to all of America of smoking--the cost through all of \nour hospitals, our pulmonary wards, through emphysema, the length of \nextraordinary care and its cost for those who have terminal illnesses \nas a consequence of smoking and the consequences to all other Americans \nwho choose not to smoke but because of secondary smoke.\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. KERRY. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nunder the current status quo, that Members be recognized for the \npurpose of debate only, until 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there objection? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to give a long speech this \nafternoon. We are working to develop a compromise to provide some \ncushion to basically blue-collar Americans who are going to bear the \nbrunt of this massive tax increase that is before the Senate. I am \nhoping that we can reach an agreement, and that we will move forward in \nan orderly way. Let me say to my colleagues that I am determined to see \nthat we do not allow the Senate to engage in one of the greatest bait-\nand-switch legislative activities in history.\n  Our dear colleague from Massachusetts has in passionate terms \nindicted the tobacco industry. If this is a trial of the tobacco \nindustry, I vote guilty. If this is a lynching, I say hang them. But I \nwant to remind my colleagues of one unhappy fact. And facts are \nstubborn things. The cold reality of the bill we have before us, all \n753 pages of it, is that we can damn the tobacco companies all we want, \nand I join in that chorus. As to where conspiracies have been \ncommitted, we have a Justice Department which is largely unemployed in \nany other activity, let them investigate and prosecute. But I want to \nbe sure everybody understands that nobody is talking about penalizing \nthe tobacco companies.\n  What we hear day after day after day is a steady drumbeat of \ndenouncing the tobacco companies while we have 753 pages in this bill \nthat raise taxes on blue-collar America. In fact, we have a bill before \nus that not only does not tax tobacco companies but has the \nextraordinary provision that makes it illegal for them not to pass the \ntax through to the consumer. So tobacco companies are held harmless.\n  What we have here is a giant bait and switch. The bait is tobacco \ncompanies. Try them. Convict them. Hang them. But the switch is to \nimpose $700 billion of taxes primarily on blue-collar Americans; 59.1 \npercent of this tax will be paid for by Americans who make less than \n$30,000 a year. In my State, 3.1 million people smoke. As you listen to \nall of this ringing debate, we are talking about these victims. The 3.1 \nmillion Texans that the tobacco companies have conspired to addict to \nnicotine are going to have taxes imposed on them under this bill. A \nblue-collar family, a husband who is a truck driver and a wife who is a \nwaitress, will end up paying $2,030 of new Federal taxes if they smoke \none pack of cigarettes each a day. So we are damning the tobacco \ncompanies but we are impoverishing the victims of the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  As my 85-year-old mother, who speaks with the wisdom that comes from \nbeing 85 years old, has said to me, ``I'm a little bit confused; you \ntell me that this guy Joe Camel makes me smoke and that I am a victim, \nbut you turn around and tax me.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I listened to the Senator speak for over an hour. All I \nwant to do is make my point, and when I get to the end of it, I will \nyield.\n  So with the wisdom that comes from being 85 years of age, my mother, \nwho has no formal education, has listened to this debate. She has \nlistened to this vilification of the tobacco industry--and justifiable \nvilification I might add. Yet she has figured out that nobody is taxing \ntobacco companies, they are taxing her. She is the victim. The \nGovernment is here to help my mother. And how are we going to help her? \nHaving been addicted to smoking for 65 years, and despite her baby \nson's efforts for 55 of those 65 to get her to stop smoking she is \naddicted, and she is not going to quit smoking. She has concluded that \nwe are talking about how bad tobacco companies are for having gotten \nher addicted to smoking, but we are taxing her. The cold, persistent, \nunhappy fact is that 59.1 percent of these taxes will be paid by \nworking blue-collar Americans who make less than $30,000 a year; 75 \npercent of the taxes will be paid by people and families that make less \nthan $50,000 a year.\n  If this is not a classic case of bait and switch, I never heard one. \nAll of the rhetoric is about keeping teenagers from smoking. I would \nlove to do that. I would like to get people who are not teenagers to \nalso stop smoking. I would love to do that. But why we have to give \n$700 billion to the Government to do that, I don't understand. I am \nstruggling, opposing this organized effort and all of these people who \nare outside with their buttons on saying ``Give me your money.''\n  Secretary Shalala has said that the price increases will reduce \nsmoking by 50 percent among teenagers. This bill sets a target of \nreducing smoking by 60 percent, so they are going to take $700 billion \nand all they claim they are going to be able to do with it is reduce \nsmoking another 10 percent. Though it is interesting, when USA Today \nasked the American people in a poll if they believed this bill would \nstop people from smoking, 70 percent said no.\n  Here is my point: If we want to raise taxes to discourage smoking, \nthat is one thing. But why do we have to keep the $700 billion? Why do \nwe have to raise the level of Federal taxes on Americans making less \nthan $10,000 a year by 41.2 percent? If the objective is to make \ncigarettes more expensive and discourage smoking, why do we have to \nimpoverish blue-collar America in the process?\n  What I am saying is, if we believe that raising prices will \ndiscourage smoking, let's raise prices. But let's take at least part of \nthe money that comes to the Government, and instead of paying tobacco \nfarmers $21,000 an acre and letting them go on growing tobacco; instead \nof paying plaintiffs' attorneys $100,000 an hour for filing these \nsuits; instead of setting up programs where every major Democratic \ncontributor will have his charity or his interest funded by this \nprogram, why don't we raise the price of cigarettes, discourage \nsmoking, and take the money and give tax cuts to blue-collar America so \nwe are discouraging them from smoking, but we are not pounding them \ninto poverty?\n  Maybe you can be self-righteous enough that you are not worried about \na blue-collar couple in Texas paying $2,030 of additional Federal taxes \nif they smoke one pack of cigarettes a day. Maybe you are not worried \nabout what that is going to do to their ability to pay their rent, to \npay their groceries, to have any chance of saving money to send their \nchild to college. But I am worried about it. I am not in any way made \nto feel better by damning the tobacco companies while writing a bill \nthat protects them from paying this tax; a bill that mandates they pass \nthe tax through to the consumer, which basically is blue-collar \nAmerica.\n  I have an amendment that is very simple. It says: Raise the price of \ncigarettes, discourage smoking, but instead of letting the Government \nhave this money, what one office seeker in my State has called \n``winning the lottery'', instead of setting up a program that gives not \nthousands, not millions, but untold billions to everything from \ncommunity action to international smoking cessation--it is obvious that \npeople long since ran out of ideas as to how to spend the money--\ninstead of engaging in this feeding frenzy, which will bloat Government \nforever, why don't we take some of the money and give it back to \nmoderate-income people. So we raise the price of cigarettes, we \ndiscourage them from smoking, but we don't impoverish them?\n  I have picked probably the worst feature of the current Tax Code to \ntry to fix as a part of this process. What I have done is targeted a \npart of the Tax Code where it is the policy of the Federal Government \nto discourage people who fall in love from getting married. I happen to \nbelieve the family is the strongest institution for human happiness and \nprogress that has ever been developed. I don't understand a tax policy \nthat says if you have a waitress and a truck driver who meet and fall \nin\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nlove and get married, we are going to make them pay more taxes for \nbeing married than if they were single or lived in sin. Or if a CPA and \na lawyer, working all the way up and down the income structure, fall in \nlove, get married and have a whole bunch of children who can pay Social \nSecurity taxes in the future and solve America's problems in the \nfuture, we tax them an average of $1,400 a couple because they got \nmarried. As my colleagues have heard me say on many occasions, my wife \nis worth $1,400, and I would be willing to pay it, but I think she \nought to get the money and not the Government.\n  So what my amendment does is take roughly a third of this money in \nthe first 5 years, and then half of it in the second 5 years, letting \nthem spend two-thirds of this money, more money than you would possibly \nspend efficiently if your life depended on it. People who would have \nbeen happy with thousands now will be given billions. Tobacco farmers \nwill, in 6 months, take a quota for growing tobacco they could buy \ntoday for $3,500, and we are going to pay them over $21,000 for it in \nthis bill. I personally don't know why these quota prices have not \nexploded, given this bill is out there. Maybe they figured out this \nbill is not necessarily going to become law. Rather than do all of \nthose things, I am saying, let's raise the price of cigarettes so we \ntry to discourage people from smoking--which is God's work; I am for \nthat --but take a third of the money and instead of letting Government \nspend it, let's eliminate this marriage penalty for couples who make \nless than $50,000 a year so that while the price of cigarettes goes up, \nwe don't impoverish people.\n  That is basically what my amendment does. I hope my colleagues are \ngoing to support it. Our Democrat colleagues do not really want to give \nthis money back. They don't like giving money back. They like spending \nit. And they think anybody who works is rich and they ought to be \ngiving more than they are giving.\n  But their idea is: Take my amendment and water it down to almost \nnothing, and then get all their people to vote against my amendment. \nThen get them to come back and vote for their figleaf, amendment. Then \nthey can all go home and say, ``Repeal the marriage penalty? I was for \nrepealing the marriage penalty; it is just I didn't want to do it the \nway that Republicans wanted to do it. But I am with the family. I'm \nwith the blue-collar worker. I represent the blue-collar worker.''\n  I am hopeful we can reach an agreement that will guarantee that I \nwill get 51 votes for my amendment. If anybody wants to watch the \ndebate, once it goes over 51 votes, I predict that at least 20 or 25 \npercent of our colleagues who have not voted for it will immediately \nrush and vote for it once it is adopted. We might watch that at the \nconclusion of this vote.\n  In any case, the point that I want to reiterate, because it gets lost \nin this whole process, is a simple point: Everything that is being said \nabout the tobacco companies I agree with. If we are here to indict \nthem, they are indicted. If we are here to convict them, they are \nconvicted. If we are here to hang them, let the hanging begin. But \ndespite all that rhetoric, which is interesting and appealing and it \nmakes us feel good, in the end, 59.1 percent of this tax is being paid \nby American blue-collar workers who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  The tobacco companies, on the other hand, have a provision that even \nif one tobacco company should say, ``Well, I could get a market \nadvantage by not passing this through,'' they have legal protection \nthat makes them pass it through to be sure the blue-collar worker gets \nall of the tax burden and that none of it is absorbed by the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  All I am trying to do is say this: Don't get blue-collar Americans, \nwho are the victims of the effort by tobacco companies to get people to \nstart smoking, confused with tobacco companies. If you want to impose \ntaxes on tobacco companies, have at it. If you want to drive them out \nof business, have at it. But you are not going to do that, because \nbasically there is a rule that every parasite learns. If the organism \nis to survive, you don't kill the creature on which you engage in the \nparasite activity. You bleed the host creature, but not to the last \ndrop of blood.\n  My view is, I care nothing about the tobacco companies and, if you \nwant to destroy them, have at it. But I do care about 3.1 million \nTexans who smoke. Many of them would like to stop. My mother would like \nto quit smoking, but she is not going to quit smoking.\n  All I am saying is, don't get tobacco companies and workers confused. \nAnd I am talking about taxpayers. If the price increase, according to \nSecretary Shalala, is going to cut consumption by 50 percent and the \ntarget of this bill is to cut consumption by 60 percent, then this $700 \nbillion is getting you 10 percent more, supposedly. I just don't see \nhow you can spend that much money.\n  If you look at what is being done, it is clear that much of what is \nbeing funded in this bill has nothing to do with smoking. For example, \nwe mandate that the States spend the money we give back to them on \nmaternal and child care block grants, on funding child care, on \nfederally-funded child welfare, on the Department of Education Dwight \nD. Eisenhower Professional Development Program under title II of the \nElementary and Secondary Act, and it goes on and on and on and on, \nbecause nobody has ever had this much money before to spend.\n  Actually, this is a modest proposal. What I am saying is, give a \nthird of what we take in cigarette taxes back to blue-collar workers so \nwe get the benefits of the higher price of cigarettes but we don't \nimpoverish blue-collar America by making it fund the largest growth in \nGovernment that we have seen since the mid-1960s.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. One way or the \nother, I hope to see it adopted. I want to get a vote on it. I want \nAmerica to know who is for it and who is against it. That is the \nessence of democracy--accountability. I think this is an issue on which \nwe need some accountability.\n\n  Quite frankly, I think my amendment improves this bill. We ought to \nbe giving about 75 or 80 percent of the money back in tax cuts. We need \nto have an effective but reasonable program for antismoking, and we \nneed to throw out about 745 pages of this 753-page bill so that it is \nreally about smoking and not about the largest money grab that has \noccurred in Congress in my period of service.\n  This amendment is a first step in the right direction. I hope it is \nnot the last step. I understand there are others who are going to be \noffering provisions related to tax breaks for health care and other \nitems, but this is a logical place to start, and it is where I want to \nstart.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was entertained listening to my friend \nfrom Texas, who makes some pretty broad statements about who is for \nwhat and who supports what. I think I heard him just say Democrats \ndon't really want to give the money back but the Republicans do. Maybe \nhe wishes that were the fact, and sometimes the wish is the father to \nthe fact, but not in this case.\n  As far as I know, Democrats are wholeheartedly in favor of a fairness \nthat has escaped every single proposal that the Senator from Texas has \never brought to the floor with respect to taxes. There isn't one tax \nproposal that has passed the U.S. Senate in the 14 years I have been \nhere that wasn't proposed on the Republican side of the aisle that \nwasn't made fairer by the efforts of Democrats on this side of the \naisle. There isn't one tax proposal that the Senator from Texas and \nothers have brought to the floor--not one--that wasn't geared to the \nupper-income level of people in this country, and usually at the \nexpense of the low-income level of people.\n  My friend from Texas may wish it were otherwise, but the fact is that \nthe distinction is not whether or not we want to give money back, the \ndistinction is whom we want to give it back to and whom they want to \ngive it to in the first place.\n  Every single tax bill I have ever seen worked on here, whether it was \nthe capital gains distribution, or how it came in, or the depreciation \nallowances, or just on the income tax, or on efforts to roll back some \nof the impact of the payroll tax--in every single instance, we, I \nthink, have been able to improve the distribution. Let me give a \nclassic example.\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\n  In the agreement we reached last year, with much ballyhoo, on the \nbudget, which brought us to the point of a balanced budget and on the \navailable money for individuals earning $40,000 or less, under the \nproposal that the Senator from Texas supported and our friends on the \nother side of the aisle supported, a single-parent mother would have \ngotten zero income back, zero tax rebate, at $40,000 or less of income. \nAnd it was only when we refused to pass that legislation without \nchanging it that she got something. In the end, we passed legislation \nwhich provided that single parent with an income of $40,000 with $1,000 \nof tax benefit rebate.\n  The distinction here is who gets what, and that will be the \ndistinction in an alternative we will offer, if we have to, with \nrespect to the marriage penalty, because we understand, just as well as \nthe Senator from Texas, that the marriage penalty is unfair, the \nmarriage penalty is an aberration in the context of the Tax Code, and \nhas a negative impact on an institution that we respect equally with \nthe Republican Party.\n  So we will offer, I think, in fact a fairer and better structuring of \nan elimination of the marriage penalty, and we will give the Senate \nanother opportunity to vote on fairness. You can vote for Senator \nGramm's proposal, which will benefit not as many people at a lower \nincome level as ours; and we will let others be the judge as to whether \nours is, in fact, a fig leaf or yet another Democrat effort to make the \nTax Code fairer and to protect people in the institution of marriage. I \nknow where my vote will go. I know what I will be comfortable with \nbased on that judgment.\n  So, Mr. President, the real issue here is, What is the distribution? \nThe Senator from Texas stood there and said, ``All I want is one-third, \njust one-third. And then they'll have plenty of money to spend on all \nthe other programs that they want.'' Well, analyze that and you find \nthat is not true either. Because the Senator from Texas cannot control \nwhat other amendment may come that may try to grab additional revenue.\n  So the first grab may be the marriage penalty, but then you may \nhave--you will have an additional amount of money for drugs; you will \nhave an additional amount of money here or there; and unless the \nSenator from Texas is prepared to say he and his colleagues will stop \ntrying to raid the effort to stop children from smoking, we would be \nhard pressed to say that it is only one-third of the money.\n  But there is another reason that one is hard pressed to say that it \nis only one-third of the money. Because, once again, the Senator from \nTexas has only told you part of the story. Here is the part of the \nstory the Senator from Texas did not want to tell you. It is right \nhere. The one-third of the distribution of the Senator's money on his \napproach to dealing with the marriage penalty, yes, it is about one-\nthird in the first year--in the first 5 years. But in the second 5 \nyears, it jumps up to $82 billion, which is 53 percent; in the next 5 \nyears, because we are talking about a bill that works over 25 years--\nthey are always coming to the floor and telling you it is a $700 \nbillion bill or a $600 billion bill or a $500 billion bill, so when it \nis convenient for them, they talk about the numbers in the context of \n25 years; but when it is inconvenient for them and it tells another \nside of the story, they try to limit it to just 5 years. Let us put it \nin the same context as the 25 years they are talking about.\n  In that 25-year context, Mr. President, here is the effect: The first \n5 years, it is the one-third the Senator talked about. In the next 5 \nyears, it is 53 percent. Wow. In the third 5 years, it is 80 percent of \nthe amount of money available under this legislation. And in the last \ntwo sets of 5 years, it is 77 percent and 73 percent.\n  So the Senator is really talking about gutting--gutting--the effort \nto stop kids from smoking. And every time he comes to the floor he \ntalks about all the things this bill does that is Government. Well, by \ngosh, a cessation program involves somebody organizing people to help \npeople not to smoke. And since schools are where most of our children \nreside for the better part of a day or a good part of a day, and the \nbetter part of a year, it makes sense to involve our schools in \ncessation programs. To do that, you have to spend a little money and \norganize it.\n  State block grants--that has been something that I always thought the \nRepublicans were for; they want block grants. They want to give the \nmoney to the Governors. ``Let the States have a decision as to what \nthey want to do.'' As to education and prevention, smoking prevention, \ncounteradvertising, those are important aspects. Enforcement, there is \n$500 to $600 million a year for enforcement.\n\n  We hear people coming to the floor and saying in one breath, they do \nnot want to have this bill passed because it will increase smuggling; \nin the next breath they do not want to acknowledge the very Government \nthey are criticizing that is spending money for antismuggling \nenforcement efforts.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to me that on close analysis we will be \nable to make a strong judgment as to whether or not there is a fairness \nin the marriage penalty approach of the Senator from Texas, or whether \nit is just an effort to try to kill this bill.\n  I am for getting rid of the marriage penalty, and I will vote to find \na way to do that. But it makes sense, it seems to me, to recognize that \neven if we pass getting rid of the marriage penalty on this bill, that \nis not going to stop one kid from smoking; that is not going to do one \nthing for additional research into why people get addicted; it is not \ngoing to do one thing for counteradvertising to stop kids from smoking.\n  So we can go home and feel good because we took the tobacco bill, \nwhich is geared to try to stop kids from smoking, for which the Senator \nhas agreed the price increase is targeted, and you turn out passing the \nmarriage penalty. If you take too much of it, you begin to strip away \nat the ability to accomplish the purpose of the bill.\n  I am prepared, as I know other Democrats are, to vote for a \nlegitimate amount of money so that we can parcel the appropriate \nproportion of these revenues to the job of reducing the number of kids \nwho smoke. But I think there is a place where common sense says you \nhave to stop if it goes too far in stripping us from the fundamental \npurpose of this bill itself.\n  I also point out that there are other areas that will want to compete \nfor some of this funding. I think it is important for Senators to think \nabout the overall amount of money that would be available for those \npurposes.\n  The final comment I make is the Senator from Texas spent a lot of \ntime saying how this bill is misdirected. He is crying for the poor \npeople who are going to pay for an additional cost of a pack of \ncigarettes. He says how misdirected this bill is because it comes down \non the victims, and not on the tobacco companies. But then he says he \nis willing to raise the price.\n  You cannot have it both ways, Mr. President. You just cannot have it \nboth ways. There is no way to focus a tax on the tobacco companies, \nwhatever you call it. I heard him the other day call it a ``windfall \nprofits tax.'' No matter what you call it, if you tax them, you tell me \na company in the United States of America which winds up with \nadditional costs of manufacturing a product that does not, unless they \njust eat them--and nobody expects the tobacco companies to do that--\nthat does not pass it off in the cost of doing business. The cost of \nthe product will rise.\n  But by doing this in the way that this bill seeks to do it, by \nsetting a fee that is levied at the level of manufacturing, you \nactually have a far more effective way of constraining the smuggling \nof, of creating accountability in the system; and ultimately you wind \nup doing the very same thing that would happen under any other \ncircumstances, which is the tobacco companies are going to pass it on \nto the consumer.\n  In the end, there is a benefit from raising the price. The benefit \noutweighs whatever crocodile tears we are hearing shed for those who \nare going to pay the additional cost of the cigarette. First of all, it \nis voluntary. Nobody forces them. They buy it. Secondly, it is a \nsmaller amount in total than the amount that people are paying anyway. \nThen the costs to our society as a whole, which will be reduced by \naccomplishing what the cigarette companies themselves have said will \noccur, which is if you raise the price,\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nyou will reduce the number of kids who are smoking, you will ultimately \nreduce the numbers of people who are addicted and you will \nsignificantly reduce the costs overall.\n  So America has a choice. You can reduce the costs, reduce the number \nof kids who are addicted, reduce the number of our fellow Americans who \ndie, reduce the overall costs to our hospitals and ultimately wind up \nwith a better and healthier society as a consequence of that, or you \ncan take the alternative route, which is the only alternative to what \nthe Senator is saying, and vote to leave it the way it is and let the \ntobacco companies continue to addict the next generation without making \na legitimate effort. I think the case ought to be very, very clear.\n\n\n                  cosponsorship of amendment No. 2446\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, today represents the ninth anniversary \nof the Tiananmen Square massacre. This is the day that commemorates the \nculmination of the crackdown--very bloody crackdown--that occurred 9 \nyears ago in Beijing, China.\n  I think it would be wrong for us not to take note of that on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. I think it is incumbent upon all of us, as \nfreedom-loving Americans, to not forget the lessons that we continue to \nlearn from China.\n  I would like to, in the next few minutes, read an excerpt from a book \nentitled ``Mandate of Heaven: The Legacy of Tiananmen Square,'' by \nOrville Schell. This book recounts, among other things, what occurred \nduring the 2 months leading up to the Tiananmen Square massacre and the \nevents that night. I have taken only a few excerpts from that, but I \nthink it will help us to put into perspective the sacrifices that were \nmade, the tragedy that occurred, and I think the tragedy of American \nforeign policy which today ignores that it was, in fact, Jiang Zemin, \nmayor of Shanghai at the time, who said that there should not be one \nounce of forgiveness shown to those student protesters who dared raise \nthe voice of dissent, who dared to speak for freedom and democracy in \nChina. So I will read from ``Mandate of Heaven: The Legacy of Tiananmen \nSquare'':\n       Although a palpable sense of foreboding hung over the \n     Square, few could bring themselves to believe that the \n     People's Liberation Army might actually harm ``the people.'' \n     Not even under the vindictive Gang of Four had troops opened \n     fire with tens of thousands of demonstrators had \n     spontaneously occupied the Square to mourn the death of Zhou \n     Enlai in 1976. So many ominous-sounding government threats \n     had come to naught since April 15 that most ordinary Chinese \n     were now inclined to view this latest salvo of warnings as \n     more overinflated rhetoric. The triumphs, symbolic and \n     otherwise, of the preceding weeks had given many, especially \n     protesters, an exaggerated sense of their own invincibility.\n       But there were some Chinese who understood that when \n     threatened, the Party would ultimately stop at nothing to \n     preserve its grip on power. They understood the old adage \n     ``When scholars confront soldiers, it is impossible to speak \n     with reason.'' Most of these pessimists were from the older \n     generation of educated Chinese who had learned through bitter \n     experience that the Party rarely allowed such challenges to \n     go unconfronted. ``The Day the Soldiers Enter the City, Then \n     the Blood of the People will Flow,'' declared one banner . . \n     .\n       Around dusk the Flying Tigers began bringing back reports \n     that soldiers equipped with automatic weapons and backed up \n     by armored vehicles were moving toward the city center from \n     several directions at once. In response, the strengthening of \n     barricades reached fever pitch. By the time the first troops \n     neared key intersections on the city's outskirts, an \n     estimated 2 million people were again in the streets. At \n     first, these citizens' brigades continued to rely on the same \n     defensive techniques that they had used two weeks earlier, \n     and by dark, many unarmed units were again bottled up around \n     the city . . .\n       By 10 p.m. the assault from the west was in full swing. As \n     several infantry and armored divisions pushed toward the \n     Military Museum, they soon found their way blocked by a wall \n     of angry citizens and Dare-to-Die squads of workers pledged \n     to defend the students and the Square until death. The \n     juggernaut of military vehicles ground to a halt, allowing \n     government propaganda to cite these instances of hesitation \n     as evidence that the army had exercised a ``high degree of \n     restraint'' while entering the city. Such ``restraint'' did \n     not last long.\n       The next volley of gunfire was aimed over the heads of the \n     resisters. The crowd refused to disperse. Finally, an officer \n     in a jeep was reported to have yelled out through a \n     megaphone, ``Charge, you bunch of cowards! Sweep away this \n     trash!'' A volley of concussion grenades was lobbed into the \n     crowd. Only when steel-helmeted soldiers carrying truncheons \n     and riot shields were ordered to charge did those resisting \n     give way.\n       It was around 11 p.m. before advancing troops approached \n     Muxidi Bridge near the state guesthouse. By then the order to \n     ``go ahead at any cost'' and to shoot at anyone obstructing \n     the soldiers' path had been given. Before soldiers had even \n     arrived at the giant barricade constructed out of articulated \n     city buses, large earthmoving trucks, commandeered minivans, \n     and tons of urban detritus, the first wounded were being \n     rushed on bicycle carts to hospitals. As troops approached \n     the bridge, someone torched the fuel tank of a bus, turning \n     the barricade into a raging wall of fire. The column had no \n     choice but to halt. With Gallic flair, Pierre Hurel, a French \n     journalist writing for Paris Match, described the scene:\n       ``In front of the flaming barricade, facing the soldiers \n     alone, four students with their feet planted wide apart make \n     the heavy air snap with the sound of the waving scarlet \n     banners. In an unbelievable gesture of defiance, they are \n     naked martyrs before a sea of soldiers in brown combat \n     helmets and tense with anger. The silk of their university \n     banners gleams in the fire's light, and behind them a crowd, \n     waiting for the worst, applauds. it is 11:30 p.m. and for the \n     first time tonight, the soldiers have had to pull back.''\n       As the convey began pushing forward again a short while \n     later, a noise resembling the sound of popcorn popping was \n     suddenly heard over the dim of the crowd. Out of the smoky \n     darkness, troops armed with AK-47s charged the barricades, \n     shooting as they advanced.\n       ``Soldiers were shooting indiscriminately; there were \n     bullets flying everywhere; dead bodies and injured people \n     were lying in the streets,'' reported one anonymous foreign \n     journalist cited in a subsequent Amnesty International \n     report. ``Crowds of residents from the neighboring lanes had \n     left their houses and stood unprotected in the streets. They \n     did not try to hide because they did not seem to realize what \n     was going on. They were in a state of shock and disbelief.''\n       All along the Avenue of Eternal Peace, equally ferocious \n     battles broke out as citizens stood their ground with an \n     almost religious fanaticism before advancing troops. \n     Bystanders who ran into surrounding alleyways for safety were \n     chased down and sprayed with automatic-weapons fire. Those \n     who tried to rescue the wounded were shot in cold blood. The \n     slaughter was so merciless that rumors began circulating that \n     the soldiers had been administered some kind of drug as a \n     stimulant.\n       By 1 a.m. soldiers had neared the intersection where Xidan \n     crosses the Avenue of Eternal Peace and began lobbying tear-\n     gas canisters into the crowds. Moments later several buses \n     serving as barricades burst into flames. Then another order \n     to fire was given. ``Several lines of students and residents \n     instantly fell,'' claimed one BASF eyewitness. ``Dozens were \n     killed, and several hundred were wounded.''\n       Yang Jianli, a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics from the \n     University of California at Berkeley who was back in China on \n     a visit, watched in horror as these shock troops advanced, \n     firing their automatic weapons as if they were assaulting a \n     heavily armed enemy position. ``Tanks and truckloads of \n     soldiers armed with machine guns were rolling in, one after \n     another, toward the Square,'' he remembered. ``At the \n     intersection we heard perhaps a thousand people shouting, \n     `Down with Fascism!' . . . [Then] flashes spouted from the \n     muzzles of soldiers' rifles. We ran back a bit and threw \n     ourselves on the pavement. `Did they really fire?' I asked H. \n     `I still can't believe it!' Some people continued to stand \n     up, saying nonchalantly, `Don't be frightened, they're only \n     using rubber bullets.' But before they had finished speaking \n     I heard someone scream, `Look out! There's a cart coming \n     through!' Two men with gunshot wounds were being carried \n     away. . . . Suddenly, there was more gunfire, and we\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n     dropped to the ground again, my heart jumping from sheer \n     fright.''\n       ``His blue T-shirt was soaked with blood, and his eyes were \n     blood-red,'' recalled Yang of one outraged citizen. . . .\n       ``Troops have been firing indiscriminately and still people \n     would not move back,'' BBC News Chief Correspondent Kate Adie \n     reported in a television broadcast after visiting both the \n     western and eastern reaches of the Avenue of Eternal Peace. \n     ``Indeed, it was hard at the time to grasp that this army was \n     launching into an unarmed civilian population as if charging \n     into battle. . . . There was not one voice on the streets \n     that did not express despair and rage. `Tell the world!' they \n     said to us.''\n\n  Since that 1989 tragedy and this famous photo of a lone student who \nstood defiantly in front of the line of tanks, there has been every \nJune 4th efforts within China, efforts there at Tiananmen, to remind \nthe world of the tragedy that occurred, of those brutal, visible \noppressions, and forcibly removing a voice of freedom that the world \nhas known in generations.\n  I continue from Schell's book as he recounts some of the symbolic \ngestures that have been made since that original June 4th, 1989.\n  He writes:\n  ``Like an uninterred body, June 4th continued to cry out for an \nappropriate and respectable barrier.''\n  There are those, if I might just add, who would like to say we are in \na post-Tiananmen era but somehow that chapter has been closed. The fact \nis the Communist Chinese government in China does not allow that \nchapter to be closed. So Schell refers to it as an uninterred body \nwhich continued to cry out for appropriate and respectable barrier.\n\n       The yearning that many continued to feel for some sort of \n     commemoration could never be fulfilled by parades or crimson \n     stars fashioned out of potted flowers. But since the \n     government stubbornly refused to acknowledge the tragic \n     significance of what had happened, much less allow for a \n     ceremony at which those who had died could be properly \n     remembered, the Square remained charged with unresolved \n     energy and, like a lodestone, kept drawing defiant \n     demonstrators back into its embrace to engage in solitary \n     acts of guerrilla mourning.\n       Such observances were, or course, politically suicidal. As \n     soon as anyone began such a ritual protest, plainclothes \n     policemen materialized as if out of nowhere. Within moments \n     the offenders were surrounded, seized, and dragged away. Only \n     on those rare occasions when foreign journalists had been \n     alerted in advance or happened to be at the Square for other \n     reasons were such fleeting moments of defiance recorded. But \n     then, like shooting stars in the night sky, these usually \n     nameless protesters would disappear.\n\n  He writes:\n\n       On the first anniversary of June 4, a lone figure had \n     walked up to the Monument and nervously fumbled to display a \n     handmade banner; moments later he was seized and taken away. \n     That night [at the university], a young economics student \n     named Li Minqui, who had been active in the outlawed BASF, \n     tried to mark the anniversary by addressing a spontaneous \n     midnight rally on campus where he indignantly referred to \n     China's current leaders as ``wild and savage autocrats'' and \n     called for an elective Government that could supervise the \n     Communist party. Li was not only promptly expelled but \n     arrested, labeled a ``chief instigator of an anti-party \n     conspiracy,'' accused of counterrevolutionary propaganda and \n     incitement,'' and sentenced to 2 years in prison.\n\n  I just think of how many Members of the Senate and how many Members \nof the Congress would be incarcerated if that were the standard. This \none who dared to lift a voice to say we ought to have free elections \nand called the autocrats ``wild and savage\" served 2 years.\n  Schell continues to write:\n\n       On the second anniversary of the massacre, a young woman \n     dressed in funeral white appeared in front of the Monument to \n     observe a moment of silence. ``I came to remember,'' she told \n     a South China Morning Post correspondent before drifting away \n     just as suspicious undercover agents began to close in.\n\n  Incidentally, white being the symbolic color of mourning in China, we \nhave chosen the white color, white ribbons to commemorate in mourning \nthose who lost their lives at Tiananmen Square. So that is what \nhappened on the second anniversary.\n  And then Schell writes:\n\n       In 1992, on the third anniversary of the massacre, a young \n     worker named Wang Wanxing appeared not far from where a new \n     sign warned visitors that it was illegal to lay memorial \n     wreaths in front of the Monument without prior approval. \n     After unfurling a banner calling on Deng to apologize for the \n     crackdown following the protest, he was seized, dragged away \n     and committed to a mental hospital. In a letter to U.N. \n     Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali smuggled out of China \n     a month later Wang asserted that not only was he being held \n     against his will in Shanghai's Ankang Psychiatric Hospital \n     for the criminally insane, but he was being forced to take \n     psychotropic drugs.\n       Computer hackers were also busy that spring waging \n     electronic warfare by introducing rogue viruses into software \n     programs used on government computers. One such virus caused \n     the words ``Remember June 4'' to appear on display terminals \n     while another flashed the slogan ``Bloody June 4'' as soon as \n     computers at certain state enterprises were booted up.\n       Despite increased campus surveillance, on May 28, 1991, \n     [university] students managed to hang cloth streamers out of \n     two dorm windows declaring ``We Will Never Forget June 4.'' \n     Leaflets recalling the events of 1989 also appeared in the \n     student canteen.\n\n  An excerpt from the leaflets said this:\n\n       Those were days that woke the heart and moved the spirit. \n     Then the hue and cry became the sound of suffocation in a \n     pool of blood.\n\n  There are those who would say that to call the world's attention to \nthe tragedy of Tiananmen Square in 1989 is empty moralizing on the part \nof self-righteous Americans who want to impose our views of freedom and \nliberty upon the rest of the world and other cultures. May I say to \nthose who would argue such that liberty and freedom are not American \nvalues, that it is not empty moralizing to point to a young Chinese \nstudent who defied the symbols of oppression and onrushing tanks. And I \nwould say to those who would say don't talk about Tiananmen Square and \ndon't talk about the massacre, we must not forget that these are not \nAmerican values: these are universal human values and human rights. For \nus to sacrifice what this Nation has always stood for on the altar of \nfree trade, on the altar of commercial and corporate profits is \nunconscionable.\n  Jiang Zemin was quoted on the front page of the People's Daily 3 \nweeks after the massacre. This is what he said. He was mayor of \nShanghai at the time, not President of China. But this is what he said:\n\n       Toward these cruel enemies--\n\n  That is that young man standing in front of the tanks--\n\n     there must not be even one percent of forgiveness. If we go \n     easy on them, we shall commit an error of historic \n     proportions.\n\n  That is the man whom the President is going to meet and greet in \nBeijing in a few short weeks, the one who said that toward these cruel \nenemies we dare not show even one percent of forgiveness. And they \ndidn't, true to his word.\n\n  Nine years later, Jiang is President of China and the students whom \nhe called the cruel enemies, many remain imprisoned, those who \nsurvived. And Jiang, true to his word, showed not 1 percent of \nforgiveness. He has never apologized. He has never acknowledged the \ncruel, inhumane, and barbaric response of the Government at Tiananmen \nSquare. The Chinese Government has never investigated, they have never \neven investigated this tragic incident; they have only defended the \ncrackdown and the killing of hundreds of students as an appropriate \nresponse to peaceful dissent.\n  So this man, Jiang Zemin will be the leader greeting our President, \nthis man who declared not 1 percent of forgiveness. And more recently, \nlest you think he may have changed his mind and changed his attitude \nand lest we are under the misimpression that suddenly the Government of \nChina has grown compassionate and that, in the words of President \nClinton, they now are becoming a thriving democracy--lest we think \nthat, President Jiang, when asked by Barbara Walters how he looked back \non the events of 1989, replied, ``It's much ado about nothing.''\n  So on this anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, we all need to \nremind the world we will not forget and we will not allow the \ncourageous sacrifice of those hundreds of students at Tiananmen Square \nto be demeaned, to be disrespected and to be devalued.\n  The Washington Post, in an editorial today entitled ``China: Two \nViews,'' speaks of a view that I would share:\n\n       A strikingly different view from inside China, from someone \n     with pretty fair credentials to judge China's practices, Bao \n     Tong, 65, was Chief of Staff of China's premier and Communist \n     Party chief until he was jailed in 1989.\n\n  Why was he jailed, by the way? He was jailed:\n\n       Because he opposed the crackdown against protesting \n     students in Tiananmen Square.\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\n      Mr. Bao spent 7 years in prison, three of them \n     incommunicado, showing that China has a ways to go when it \n     comes to rule of law. He now lives under house arrest but \n     recently gave an interview to the Post's Steven Mufson and \n     John Pomfret.\n       Mr. Bao challenged the notion that economic strength, in \n     the absence of real democratization, inevitably will make \n     China more benign.\n\n  By the way, let me repeat what he challenged, because it is the very \nthesis espoused by those who say constructive engagement is going to \nbring about change in China. This is the very theory espoused by those \nwho say, ``We will just trade sufficiently, we will increase trade and \ndo enough increased commerce with China, and everything will be \nbetter.'' So he challenged the notion that economic strength in the \nabsence of real democratization inevitably will lead China to be more \nbenign.\n\n       China ``has already gone mad twice in the last 40 years,'' \n     he said, referring to the cultural revolution and the \n     Tiananmen massacre. ``You have to ask yourself a question. \n     What will it do on the international scene? Is it a source of \n     stability or a potential source of instability? When it \n     doesn't have enough power, its attitude will be restrained. \n     But once it develops and becomes strong, what kind of role is \n     it going to play without a complete structural change?''\n\n  That is the question I would pose. For all of the advocates of the \ncurrent administration's policy, I would pose this question raised by \nthis very knowledgeable individual, Mr. Bao, who himself has spent 7 \nyears incarcerated. The question he poses: Once China develops, opens, \nand becomes strong, what kind of role is it going to play without a \ncomplete structural change?\n  What he means by ``complete structural change'' is democratization. \nIt is his argument that economic development in China, the embrace of \nfree markets, and the embrace of market capitalism will not be \nsufficient to make them benign, to make them a partner in world peace, \nand that that will not happen without a structural change--free \nelections, freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion--\nthat until those things become realities in China, then we cannot \nexpect that there are going to be responsible citizens in the \ninternational stage of affairs.\n  The Post editorial concludes:\n\n       Mr. Clinton should meet with dissidents when he visits \n     Beijing later this month. A sit-down with Bao Tong, if the \n     government would release him from house arrest long enough, \n     might be a useful addition to the president's official \n     schedule.\n\n  And I suggest it certainly would.\n  So I want to conclude on this anniversary of an event that should \nnever, never, never be forgotten, by making this plea: Mr. President, \ndelay your trip to China. There are ongoing investigations; there are \nongoing hearings. So, please, we are not talking about isolating China. \nIt could not happen if we wanted it to. We are not talking about \nbreaking off contacts, dialog and communications with China. But we are \nsaying, under the current cloud and with all of the questions about the \nweb of interrelationships between the Chinese Government, the American \nadministration, and corporate America and multinational corporations--\ndelay this trip.\n  Then second, Mr. President, if you must go, if you must go ahead with \nthis planned trip, then I plead with you to express the desire of \nmillions of Americans by not going and not being received at Tiananmen. \nAs this young man took his stand as a symbol of freedom against the \nsymbols of oppression, I ask our President, take one small stand by not \ngoing to Tiananmen Square; not being received, simply saying: Mr. Jiang \nZemin, I will not be received where these students were slain. I will \nnot show disrespect and disdain for the sacrifice that they made by \nbeing received at a State visit on that location. To be received there \nis to demean and devalue the stand those students took.\n  Third, I plead with you, Mr. President, that if you insist on going \nto China, that you should insist on meeting with the families of those \nchampions of democracy who were either slain or remain in prison. I ask \nthat as our President goes, and if he goes, that he should forcefully \ndenounce the repression and the human rights abuses ongoing in China; \nif he goes to Tiananmen Square that his message should be this: Never \nagain. And in the spirit of Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall, let him \nsay, ``This is wrong. Never should it happen again.'' I ask that in \nChina he visit with house church leaders, those who, because of their \nconscience and because of their religious convictions, have not \nregistered with the Communist Chinese Government and, because they have \nnot registered, because they have not signed up and received official \nsanction by the Government, stand in harm's way, stand in jeopardy of \nlosing their freedom.\n  I ask that our President visit with banned journalists, for there are \nno free newspapers. There are no independent journalists. There are no \nexpressions of dissent against the Communist Chinese Government. So, \nMr. President, meet with those journalists who would like to have a \nnewspaper, who would like to be able to write a column, who would like \nto be able to freely express their views of freedom and democracy, but \nare not allowed to because of the current regime. Meet with them. Hear \ntheir story. Take your stand for freedom.\n  And then I ask that before you leave for Beijing, if you must go, \nthat you sign the China sanctions package that has already passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a huge, overwhelming bipartisan majority. \nSome of those provisions have already been added to our State \nDepartment authorization bill which we will be debating, hopefully, \nnext week. Some of those have already been set. But I ask that the \nPresident sign those and, in so doing, express sincerity in wanting to \ndecry the human rights abuses that are going on.\n\n  Let me just conclude. In a Washington Post article, not an editorial \nbut a news article today on the Tiananmen anniversary, the article, a \nMichael Laris report, concludes:\n\n       . . . China has not yet turned irrevocably toward a liberal \n     political approach. [That's an understatement.] It maintains \n     a massive state security apparatus, which monitors the \n     private affairs of anybody it deems a threat to the Communist \n     Party's monopoly on political power. The jails hold more than \n     2,000 political prisoners, including 150 or so arrested after \n     the Tiananmen Square protests. Among the 200,000 other people \n     in labor camps, at least some are political offenders.\n       [I assume yesterday] Early this evening at the Beijing \n     University bulletin board, which was a center of protest \n     information in 1989, a woman read announcements of lectures \n     on the environment and the Asian financial crisis. ``Many of \n     my friends think those students were foolish,'' she [this \n     student] said. ``I think they were very brave. I wish more \n     people now had that much passion. Some people now have the \n     same passion, but they know not to express it in the same \n     way.''\n\n  For those who believe it is all better now in China, listen to the \nwords of this student who says the students in China today have \nlearned, passion for freedom they may have, but if they cherish being \nfree, if they cherish the right to be a student, if they don't want to \nbe incarcerated, they better not express it as these students did 9 \nyears ago today.\n  So to all freedom-loving Americans--not as Republicans and not as \nDemocrats--but to all freedom-loving Americans, we say to those Chinese \nwho love freedom as well: We will not forget what happened June 4, \n1989.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I inquire what is the pending business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now considering the tobacco \nbill. The Senator may speak on any subject he wishes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grams pertaining to the introduction of S. 2130 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I don't know how many days it is that we \nhave been on the tobacco bill now, but it is clear that we are not \nmaking any progress. I am increasingly frustrated by the degree to \nwhich many of our Republican colleagues, in the name of amending the \nbill, have stalled, obfuscated and, in many ways, attempted to defeat \nthe legislation without any real sign of progress, without any real \nsign of coming to closure, without any real effort to find some \nresolution.\n  I have expressed my continued patience, my continued desire to find \nways in which to move this legislation along. I give great credit to \nthe manager of the bill, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator McCain, for his tireless efforts to move both sides along.\n  This has not worked. We have continued to be thwarted in the name of \ncompromise, and in the name of negotiation, and in the name of \nconsultation. Frankly, I don't know what other options there are but to \nfile cloture on the bill. We may not win. I am prepared to acknowledge \nthat unless we get many of our Republican colleagues to join us, we \nwill not win. But I also understand that if we don't move this \nlegislation forward, we will continue to be in a position of having to \nsay no to other bills the majority leader may wish to bring up until we \nresolve this matter. We have said, as late as Tuesday, that we are not \nin a position to move to any other legislation until we finish this \nbill. I don't know how we can say it more clearly than that.\n  We want to finish this legislation so we can move on to other bills. \nThere are a number of other pieces of legislation that ought to be \naddressed, and we recognize that. We are prepared to enter into time \nagreements on amendments. We are prepared to come to some time limit on \nthe bill itself. But we have now virtually wasted the better part of a \nweek waiting for colleagues to offer amendments, waiting for some \nresolution to the Gramm amendment, waiting, procedurally, to find some \nsolution to the impasse that we now are experiencing.\n  So, Mr. President, I really have no choice but to offer a cloture \nmotion, with some frustration, and with the realization that it may \ntake more than one. We may have to file several cloture motions. But, \nbeginning today, I will take whatever action is necessary to expedite \nthe consideration and ultimately the solution and the conclusion to \nthis legislation.\n  We have a lot of people who have invested a good deal of effort into \nthis legislation; three of them are on the floor right now. I thank \nthem for all they have done to bring us to this point. But unless we \ntake it to its final conclusion, all of the thousands of hours spent by \nthe Senators who are on the floor already, invested in time and good-\nfaith efforts to move us to this point, will be for naught. I don't \nwant to see that happen. I don't want to see this necessarily as a \nRepublican versus Democratic debate. But, frankly, it becomes more and \nmore apparent that we are not getting the help--with the one stellar \nexception of my friend and colleague from Arizona--in getting this \nlegislation passed. So we are very hopeful that we can move this \nlegislation and find some way to resolve the matter.\n  I understand that I can't file until 2:15 under a previous agreement. \nI will certainly wait until then.\n  Let me just make sure that our colleagues understand where things \nstand. Right now, we are discussing the motion to recommit offered by \nthe Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, with amendments pending to that \nmotion. The Gramm amendment would cost $52 billion. It would rob the \nbill of any real opportunity to address research in health care, to \naddress the targeted approach that we are attempting to make on \nadvertising and reducing teenage smoking. It would reduce every option \nthat we have available to us to reverse the trend and reduce teenage \nsmoking in this country. Why? Because the Senator from Texas believes \nthat we ought to address the marriage penalty.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Gramm's amendment doesn't address the marriage \npenalty alone. In fact, one could argue that it has little to do with \nthe marriage penalty. It has everything to do with spending the tobacco \nrevenue raised in the health fee. We are presented with an option that \nis a Hobson's choice for many: reduce taxes for those who are under \n$50,000, or reduce teenage smoking, reduce the number of children who \nare dying from smoking. That is the choice. While we debate this \nchoice, 3,000 kids a day choose to smoke for the first time. A large \npercentage of those--some say 40 percent--are people who ultimately \nwill die from the habit at some point in their life. They get cancer \nand ultimately succumb to cancer because they started smoking too \nearly, without knowing the facts, without being able to quit once they \nhad started. That is the issue here.\n  Can we prevent young people from acquiring this terrible habit and \nfrom dying because of it? Can we target advertising and research, and \ncan we find ways in which to ensure that we can turn the trend around \nfor the first time? Or are we going to spend that money for something \nelse? Mr. President, Democrats have come up with an alternative.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the distinguished minority leader yield for one \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield to the \nSenator from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the Senator's frustration, and to a large \ndegree I share it. I wonder if, with the knowledge that the Senator \nfrom Texas and I are continuing negotiations in the next few minutes, \nthe distinguished Democratic leader would agree to withhold that until, \nsay, an extra additional 15 minutes just so I can make one final \nattempt to get an agreement with the Senator from Texas on his \namendment. Then I think we may be able to move forward.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will agree to withholding filing of the motion so long \nas I don't lose my right to file the motion. If that takes retaining \nthe floor, I intend to do so. But I will certainly allow the Senator \nfrom Arizona whatever time he may require to talk to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that is really the essence of this \nargument. Can we stop kids from smoking? Can we turn this around, or \nnot? And can we find a way with which to address the concerns expressed \nto us by many of our colleagues?\n  We believe we can address the marriage penalty for a whole lot less \nthan $52 billion. But our objective is not to gut the bill. Our \nobjective isn't to say we are going to use up all that money because we \ndon't want to spend it on stopping kids from smoking; we don't want to \nspend it on research; we don't want to spend it on tobacco farmers; we \ndon't want to recognize what has already been achieved in the State-by-\nState negotiations on this issue and the tremendous effort put forth by \nattorneys general all over the country in an effort to resolve this at \nthe State level. The Federal Government didn't do that. For whatever \nreason, we didn't go to court. The States did. Now that the States have \nracked up their victories, and now that they are expecting some way to \nresolve this matter, we are saying: We are going to use that money, \ntoo; we are going to take the money that you have already won in court \nfairly and squarely against the tobacco companies, and we are going to \nspend it; we are going to spend it on a tax cut.\n  So this gets interesting as we go on. We are saying we ought to \nrespect the decisions made by the attorneys general, we ought to \nrespect the decisions made by the committees of the Congress, and the \nSenate in particular, in recognition of the fact that we have to find \nnew ways to target those who are most vulnerable to campaigns by \ntobacco companies today to get them to smoke. We think that is worth an \nAmerican investment. We think it is worth an American investment to put \nsome real effort into research on how we cure diseases that have been \nconnected to smoking. We think it is important that we find ways with \nwhich to rid this country of the production of tobacco products and to \nencourage tobacco farmers to find other ways to make a living. That is \nwhat this is about.\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\n  Mr. President, there is no choice. We can continue to talk. We can \ncontinue to find ways with which to obfuscate. But it really comes down \nto this: Do you want to pass a tobacco bill or not? We are getting a \nresounding ``no'' on the other side of the aisle. We are getting an \nabsolute, emphatic ``no,'' exclamation point, ``we don't want a tobacco \nbill.''\n  We have come to a point that we do not have any choice. We must move \nthis legislation forward and use the parliamentary and procedural \nmethods available to any Senator to begin to curtail debate, \nrecognizing that every Senator who still has a germane amendment would \nhave the right to offer an amendment.\n  But having been on this bill now for 2 weeks, and now recognizing the \nmajority leader's frustration and impatience with our slow progress, \nhis desire to move on to other bills, I, frankly, wish that we could do \nthis together. I wish he and I could file this cloture motion. He has \nfiled cloture a lot faster on virtually every other bill that has come \nto the floor than on this one. But I understand the difference in the \ninitial position with regard to where we are on this legislation. So I \nwouldn't expect him necessarily to be enthusiastic about doing it. But \nwe have to move on. We have to find a way with which to address this \nbill in a more consequential and productive way. That, in essence, is \nwhat it is we are attempting to do.\n\n  We have a series of amendments. The Durbin amendment, which, in my \nview, is one of the final and very important pieces of legislation that \nwe want to address on this side, a piece of legislation that would be \ndesigned to strengthen the so-called look-back, or the targets that we \nset out, to reduce teenage smoking--I don't think that is necessarily \nanything anybody ought to have trouble considering, or ultimately \ndebating. We haven't even been able to debate that. We have had to \nwait.\n  Mr. President, I say with all sincerity--I don't see the Senator from \nArizona on the floor. He had asked that I postpone the filing of the \ncloture motion, and I have agreed to do so. But I am prepared to file \nit assuming that there is no other reason for him to ask for additional \ndelay.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at this time I send a cloture motion to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the modified \n     committee substitute for S. 1415, the tobacco legislation.\n         Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Robert Kerrey of \n           Nebraska, Kent Conrad, Harry Reid of Nevada, Paul \n           Wellstone, Richard Durbin, Patty Murray, Richard Bryan, \n           Tom Harkin, Carl Levin, Joe Biden, Joseph Lieberman, \n           John Glenn, Jeff Bingaman, Ron Wyden, and Max Baucus.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I must say that I think it is unfortunate \nthat this process has been adopted by the Democratic leader. I had \nindicated all along that at some point, if it was necessary, I would be \nprepared to consider cloture but not until we had an opportunity to \ndebate and vote on some amendments that clearly are important to \nSenators and until we had time to have debate on this bill in general.\n  There are still some very important amendments pending: The Durbin \namendment, the Gramm amendment, and we have the drug amendments. We \nhave at least two substitutes that would be cut off from being offered: \nThe Hatch substitute, which I know a number of Senators would support, \nand it is something much closer to the original settlement agreement \nthat was entered into than anything else that is pending around here \nnow; plus the Domenici-Gramm substitute.\n  I think most Senators would acknowledge very readily that those two \nSenators are very thoughtful Senators and have given a lot of thought \nto an alternative approach. Yet there is a choice here. The choice is: \nDo you want a bill or not? If you want a bill, this is a good step \ntoward having nothing happen, because this further sours the well. Yes; \nI would like to see things move along on this bill and on to other \nbills and other issues that I know Senators on both sides want to \naddress, but you have to also allow Senators to be able to work through \nthe problems and come to an agreement.\n  If we stay on this bill, we are going to have a vote on the Gramm \nmarriage penalty tax elimination. We will have it this year in some \nother form or another. It seems to me like this is one way to help \naddress some of the concerns about the excessive amount of money that \nis in this bill. It is clearly way beyond what is necessary to fight \nteenage smoking, or even teenage smoking and drug abuse, address some \nof the health care problems, and address the needs of the farmers. It \ngoes way beyond all of that. That is the problem.\n  As I have said in other forums, this has become a problem of greed. \nEverybody who touches this bill adds to it. It grows like Topsy. What \nis our goal here? To have a whole, big, new Federal program outside the \nregular budget process, or to address the problem of smoking, and \nteenage smoking, in this country?\n  I had been working on and had kind of sent word to the Democratic \nleader informally--and I did try to call him, and we were both going \nback and forth to our luncheons--I had a unanimous consent agreement \nhere that I was working on, and was prepared to work with him on, that \nwould set up a process for us to have a vote on Durbin, although I \nthink Durbin is a very bad amendment. It is another jump, more cost, \nanother hit on actually getting something done. That is one of the \nproblems here. I am still trying to figure out, do Senators, and do the \nhealth care community people, and the attorneys general want a bill?\n  Do you want an issue? Do you want to do something about this problem \nor do you want to play games? It is not clear to me because everybody \nkeeps adding to it, adding to it, and it is just going to collapse out \nhere in a great, humongous pile of nothingness.\n  But I was going to suggest we have a vote on Durbin at 5:30 today, \nand that we have a time agreement on the Gramm amendment and a vote on \nit, and a vote on the drug amendment, and that--I assumed at some point \nthe Democratic leadership might have a tax amendment of their own, and \nwe would start going on down the trail. I don't like it when we \nbasically--people say we have to make progress; we have to get this \nbill done. Where is the progress? This week, we can't blame each other \nfor yesterday; we had a funeral for a former Senator. We had to go to \nthat. We have problems with Senators being here on Monday. We have \nproblems with Senators--I won't get into all that.\n  But you cannot make progress until you make progress, until you are \nhere and you have Senators prepared to vote. And that is one of the \nunique features of this creature, the Senate. Things move very slowly, \nthey look like they are not moving at all, and it looks hopeless, and \nthen all of a sudden you get ready to vote. I thought we were close to \ngetting ready to vote.\n  So I think this is not a positive thing to happen, and I will urge \nevery Republican Senator to vote against cloture. If we don't get \ncloture, then what? Then what? I thought at some point next week after \nwe voted on Durbin and Gramm and the drug amendment and Hatch and the \nDomenici-Gramm substitute, maybe a couple other Democrat amendments, at \nthat point we could have sort of a bipartisan effort to see if the \nSenate was ready to go to cloture and get to a vote.\n  This undermines that. I understand why it is being done, but I think \nit is counterproductive, and I hope the Senate would defeat this \noverwhelmingly. I view it as another blow to our chances of actually \naddressing this issue in a responsible way and getting on to other \nimportant issues.\n  I must say I thought that Senator Gramm and Senator McCain and others \nwho were interested in how you deal with the marriage penalty tax were \nvery close to an agreement--maybe not exactly the way Democrats would \nlike it or the White House would like it, but something that would have \nbeen fair for both of us to have and we could\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nmake progress on other things. But c'est la vie, this is it. You filed \na cloture motion. And also, by the way, that cloture would ripen on \nMonday, and I think that is going to be a problem for the leadership \nand a number of Senators, and we will have to discuss when and how that \nvote would occur.\n  I hope all concerned would reconsider their thinking on how we bring \nthis to a point where we could get some votes and make progress. I \nreally believe, I said publicly, that if we had a tax cut provision \nadded and we had a drug provision added, then the prospects for the \nbill would be helped substantially; we might actually get a bill \nthrough the Senate. Without that, we are going to be sitting around \nhere. If you want to sit around and shout to your feet for the rest of \nthis month and all summer long and try to make out this is a totally \npartisan thing, that is OK, too. That is OK. I am relaxed. We can just \nwaffle along here and look pathetic if everybody wants to do that. Or \nwe can decide how we are going to get together and make something \nresponsible happen.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond to a couple points \nmade by the distinguished majority leader. First of all, I only wish I \nhad had his text in front of me when we took up the Coverdell bill, \nwhen we took up a number of other pieces of legislation earlier this \nyear, because I can recall his passionate determination to get time \nagreements, to stack votes, to find a way to come to closure in a \nmatter of a couple of days, a couple of days, and were it not for the \nfact that we had the votes to hold off on cloture, I don't know where \nthat would have gone. We finally came to a resolution on the Coverdell \nlegislation because we were able to come to some agreement on how we \nwould proceed on amendments.\n\n  Now, I am perfectly willing to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \ncloture motion if we can get an agreement on the process and some time \nagreements by which we can have these amendments considered.\n  Now, I don't know why, but I have been told--and I will admit I \nhaven't talked directly to the majority leader--that the Republicans \nare refusing to allow the Democratic tax amendment to either precede or \nimmediately succeed the consideration of the Gramm amendment. They \ndon't want them back to back. I don't know why. And if that is not \naccurate, I hope somebody will tell me.\n  We have offered to have a limited amount of debate on the Gramm \namendment, a limited amount of time on the Democratic amendment, and \nthen let's have two votes back to back. We can do that this afternoon. \nI am prepared to have a vote, I would suggest, at 5 o'clock today. \nLet's have the debate on the Gramm amendment, the debate on the \nDemocratic amendment, and then two votes, and we are out of here on \ntaxes for a while. Then let's go to the drug amendment, let's go to the \nDurbin amendment. We can stack those votes. We can have all four of \nthose votes tonight. But I bet you I won't hear that offer made by the \nother side. For some reason that isn't good enough. It was good enough \nfor the Coverdell bill, but it is not good enough for the tobacco bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I heard through the news media that the Senator was \nproposing a process to have those votes back to back, and, oh, by the \nway, they are going to be king of the hill; that the last one who wins, \nyou know, wins. That's it.\n  I did not have that proposal come to me in any form, and I would not \nagree to that. I am prepared to say we are going to get a vote on \nGramm, and in some logical order, I assume, we have a deal here where \nwe are alternating back and forth--we offer an amendment; you offer an \namendment. And the Democrats could offer an amendment at some point on \ntaxes in the regular order. We could not prevent you from doing that.\n  But that was not the way it came to me. And it did come to me through \nthe media in a way that certainly would not be acceptable.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since I retain the floor, let me just \nrespond to my colleague. First of all, we are not going back to back. \nThe last amendment prior to the Gramm amendment was a Gregg amendment. \nSo instead of going Republican-Democratic, we went Republican-\nRepublican. So that pattern was lost already.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Because he is right, and I think that was a mistake. And I \nobjected to that at the time. I think everybody who was on the floor \nknows that. I did not appreciate the fact that the going back and forth \nwas interrupted. The Senator from Texas knows that, and he has \nindicated, to his credit, that he was not really intending to break up \nthat sequence. We did break up the sequence, but I do not think we \nshould let that block us from proceeding in that way in the future, a \nfair way where we offer our amendment, you offer your amendment, and we \ngo back and forth.\n  But you are right about that. The order was broken, and I certainly \ndid not like it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. While the majority leader is still standing, let me \nretain the floor and ask him the question. Would he agree with me to a \n2- or 3-hour time agreement to be divided equally on the two amendments \nrelating to tax, the Gramm amendment and the Democratic amendment, and \nthat two votes be cast at the end of that time in sequence of his \nchoosing? Would the majority leader agree to that proposal?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would not agree with that at this point. I \nam not saying that at some point we might come to some sort of \nunderstanding of how this would be handled. The first thing is, I \nthink, the Senator from Texas and Senator McCain have got to come to an \nagreement on the content. That is one of the reasons why we can't go on \nprocedure--until you get something that is worked out, hopefully that \neverybody can support, because when we get a vote on the Gramm \namendment, on the marriage penalty tax, it is going to pass \noverwhelmingly. A great majority of the Democrats are not going to be \nable to vote against that. They are going to vote for it. So it is \ngoing to pass.\n  But what I would say is I have a unanimous consent agreement right \nhere that would allow us to set up a process to move forward with \nconsent to get a vote on the Durbin amendment at 5:30, and that \nfollowing disposition of the Gramm amendment Senator Coverdell be \nrecognized to offer a first-degree amendment relative to drugs, there \nbe 2 hours of debate on that--and that there then would be debate on \nthe Coverdell amendment and a vote on that after 2 hours.\n  We have a unanimous consent request here that we would be willing to \noffer, and then we could go back to your amendment, we go to a tax \namendment, if you want to do that.\n  But here is the other side of it. You have to get unanimous consent. \nAnd our people are not going to agree to an arrangement at this time \nwhere you get some vote on a subsequent tax proposal that would be the \nking of the tree. I think when the thing is done, when we get an \nagreement, you are going to vote for the Gramm amendment and that is \nwhat will prevail, and we will move on. But we have to try to come to \nan agreement on that or we are not going to go anywhere. If that is the \nway it is going to be, that is the way it is going to be. I have been \ntrying to help make this thing move from a procedural standpoint, but \nif we want to let it collapse on this line, OK with me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has just made my \npoint probably better than I can. What he has said is that this offer \nto have two amendments, one Republican and one Democrat, both dealing \nwith tax, under a time agreement, is objectionable to them.\n  My point originally was the reason it is objectionable is because \nthey don't want to get this legislation passed. They do not want to see \nclosure to it. That is really what is behind all of this. This is not \nsome concern about a tax amendment. This is concern about ultimately \nmoving this legislation to a point where we can get completion.\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\n The reason the majority leader cannot get unanimous consent is not \nbecause it is not fair. It is because there are colleagues on his side \nwho want to drag this out past the Fourth of July. They want to start \nusing the clock. That is what this is about. You want a blow-by-blow \naccount of the play-by-play action here? It is that. We are simply \nplaying the clock. Because if you play it long enough, we run out of \ntime and then, guess what, we do not pass a tobacco bill.\n  We can play that. We can stay on this bill through June, if we want \nto. But I am telling you, this legislation ought to pass. It is about \nsaving kids' lives. It is about making them healthy. It is about coming \nup with new tobacco policy, and we are prepared to stick to whatever it \ntakes to see that we get that done.\n  I don't understand why that would not be a fair proposal. I am \ndisappointed that our Republican colleagues object to what is a \nreasonable proposal. When I used the reference ``king of the hill,'' I \nwas simply saying you have two proposals, both pending, both being \ndebated, and Republicans and Democrats both roll the dice. Let's see \nwhat the majority of Democrats and Republicans support with regard to \nthe options presented to them.\n  We have an amendment. They have an amendment. Maybe the leader is \nright. Maybe both amendments will pass or both amendments could fail. \nHe thinks there is a majority support for the marriage penalty \namendment. I think he is probably right. The question is, What is the \namendment? The Gramm amendment goes way beyond marriage penalty. It \ngoes way beyond it. Don't anyone be confused about that. This is not a \nmarriage penalty amendment. You can find marriage penalty in it, but it \ngoes beyond that, and he is prepared to spend $52 billion going beyond \nthat.\n  Now I understand he wants to pull it back some, but there is no \nquestion the majority of what the Gramm amendment would eat up would go \nto research, would go to kids, and would go to farmers. We know that. \nSo we will have to wait until another day to have our debate and have a \ngood opportunity to consider competing proposals. But we are prepared \nto do that. We will do it Monday next week, Tuesday, whenever. But we \nwill be here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to point out we could have had a vote \non the Gramm amendment last week. I was perfectly willing to do that, I \nbelieve it was last Thursday. We were ready, I thought, to go to a vote \non Durbin and Gramm last week. As I recall, there was objection to that \nfrom the Democrats. So if you talk about delay or time being consumed, \nit was because we could not get an agreement worked out on Thursday how \nwe could go ahead and vote on the two of them.\n  What I am proposing here, or have been prepared to propose, is we \nhave a vote on the Gramm penalty tax amendment, the Durbin look-back \nprovision, the Coverdell drugs provision, and a Daschle or others \nmarriage penalty provision. That is Republican-Democrat, Republican-\nDemocrat; it is a way to deal with this thing.\n  But let's set that aside. You know, there is concern that has been \nexpressed about the cost of the marriage penalty. How about the \nAmerican people who are paying that tax? A penalty for getting married? \nThey cannot help it, if it is so unfair a tax, that young couples all \nover America are getting hit with this tax just because they got \nmarried? So what we are saying is, ``Oh, well, to eliminate this \nunbelievable tax that is in the Tax Code it costs too much money, so we \nwant to squeeze down what Senator Gramm is proposing to less and less \nand less.'' What we ought to do is eliminate the marriage penalty tax \naltogether. Right away. Flat out. Whatever the cost is.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Let's do it.\n  Mr. LOTT. This is one way to help deal with the problem that this \ntobacco bill costs somebody money. It doesn't come from heaven. \nSomebody is going to pay for this. This is one way, and it is targeted, \nby the way, to couples earning under $50,000, as I understand it, to \nhelp the people at the lower end of the tax structure by getting rid of \nthis tax penalty.\n  You are talking about these other people. Yes, we ought to have a \ncampaign to fight teenage smoking and drug abuse, but we don't need all \nthese hundreds of billions of dollars to do that. This is a way--and \neverybody involved understands it, really--this is a way to help make \nit possible for this legislation to get through the Senate and maybe, \neventually, get to a conclusion.\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts want me to yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not want to interrupt the leader.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator, the majority leader: It \nseems to me I recall a conversation that the minority leader, the \nmajority leader, Senator Gramm and Senator McCain and I had together at \nthe desk right behind Senator Gramm just about 2 days ago, in which we \nhad originally broached to the majority leader the notion that there \nwould be two votes, almost simultaneously. So the majority leader was, \nin fact, aware that was what we sought.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can reclaim my time, I remember that meeting, and I \nwas there for part of it and went to take a phone call. When I was \nlistening to that discussion, it was a discussion about how and when we \nwere going to vote on Durbin and Gramm. Maybe at some subsequent point \nthe discussion turned to, really, some alternative to Gramm. But, you \nknow, this is something that has evolved, as far as I can tell, since \nwe met. We were having that discussion, whenever that was--Tuesday, I \nguess it was.\n  Mr. KERRY. Again, if the leader will yield for a question, isn't it a \nfact, though, the unanimous consent request that the leader is \nproposing, while it ostensibly sets up a Democrat-Republican \nalternative, it is not, in fact, allowing for the Democrat alternative \non the marriage penalty to be voted on at the time that the minority \nleader has requested?\n  Mr. LOTT. There would be one intervening amendment. What is the \nproblem?\n  Mr. KERRY. Would they be the same day? Same time? Could they be this \nafternoon?\n  Mr. LOTT. They could be. I don't see any problem. I would like for us \nto have it in the same day, because it means we would be making \nprogress. I would like us to have the opportunity, on the tax issue and \ntobacco bill, to have more than one vote in a day. Maybe we could get \ntwo or three votes. That would be healthy. I would like to see us make \nprogress on that. I think we could work that out. We don't want a \nseparation of days.\n  I just object to the ``king of the hill'' type approach which goes--\nthat is a throwback to the House. But having it the same day, that \nwould be fine with me. We are not interested in getting a day's or a \nweek's separation. If we are ever going to find a logical way to \nconclude this thing, you have to make progress and have more than one \nor two votes in a day.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, my offer stands. We are \nprepared to negotiate some time agreement, some way with which to deal \nwith these amendments. And if we can do so satisfactorily to both \nsides, I am prepared to ask unanimous consent to revoke the cloture \nmotion for now. I will talk with the majority leader and we will see if \nwe cannot resolve it. Perhaps this discussion, if nothing else, has \nmoved us closer to that point.\n  He did make a point, though, that I think has to be responded to, and \nthat has to do with money which is being allocated here. He said, What \nis wrong with dealing with the marriage penalty? Shouldn't we address \nthe inequity there? Let there be no mistake. We are prepared to address \nthe inequity in the marriage penalty. Our amendment would do that. We \nare simply saying we don't want to do it at the expense of revoking the \ncommitment made to the attorneys general, made to the States, made to \ntobacco farmers, made to children, made to the researchers--made in all \nof those ways that has set up this comprehensive tobacco policy which \nwe hope to address over the course of the next 10 years. We don't have \nto do that. We don't have to destroy that.\n  So there is nothing wrong with dealing with the marriage penalty. But \nto\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\nsay we are going to do it at the expense of everything else is the \nproblem Democrats find with the Gramm amendment. It also begs the \nquestion, what about the cost to Medicare and Medicaid from smoking-\nrelated illnesses? Should that not be addressed? Isn't that an \ninequity? The American taxpayers are paying huge--billions and billions \nof dollars, huge amounts of money to pay for the programs that we have \nset up to deal with health care; Medicare and Medicaid, the two most \nconsequential. More and more billions of dollars are spent every year \ndealing with smoking-related illnesses. Isn't it important for us as a \nNation and this Senate to recognize that and deal with it?\n  What the Gramm amendment says is, ``No, it isn't. No, we are going to \nspend it on a tax cut. We think that is more important than anything \nelse, over and above the commitment to the attorneys general, over and \nabove the commitment to the farmers, over and above the commitment to \nthe children, over and above the commitment to the Medicare and \nMedicaid.'' That is the problem we have. That is why there hasn't been \nan ability to find some common ground. So long as that becomes the only \nway with which to spend resources, we think there is a better way, a \nmore prudent way, a more balanced way, and that is what this debate is \nabout today. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from South Dakota, isn't it the case \nthat the amendment of the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, doesn't \njust deal with the marriage penalty and give benefits to people who are \nhurt by the marriage penalty, his amendment goes way beyond that? It \nactually gives benefits to people who benefit by being married; isn't \nthat the case?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is the case. Those who benefit by being married are \nbenefited even more by the Gramm amendment. The Senator from \nMississippi, the majority leader, was saying how important it was that \nwe not overextend the reach here. His admonition to the Senate was, \n``Let's take a look, let's step back and make sure we are not just \noverreaching.'' Well, if there was a definition of overreaching, I \ndon't know that I could find a better example than the Gramm amendment \nbecause of exactly what the Senator from North Dakota has noted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Isn't it the case that the amendment that we would like \nto offer on our side would actually target those affected by the \nmarriage penalty? So if the rhetoric from the other side is, if you \nwant to deal which those hurt by the marriage penalty, we are prepared \nto do that. The amendment on the other side goes way beyond those hurt \nby the marriage penalty and actually gives benefits to people who are \nbenefited by marriage in the Tax Code.\n  So wouldn't it be the case that what we are prepared to offer will \naddress directly the marriage penalty, and why then is the majority \nleader resistant to the very fair notion that if he says he endorses \nagain going back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, that he \nwould allow the Democrats to decide which amendment is offered on their \nside? Isn't that a fair result?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That seems to me to be a fair result. I don't know if \nthey would stand for us telling them what their Republican amendment is \ngoing to be. But that is, in essence, what they are asking us to \naccept. We will tell you what Democratic amendment we will allow you to \noffer, and if you don't agree, you are the ones holding up progress. We \ncan't accept that. Obviously, we can't accept that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have been in the Senate 12 years. I must say I don't \nrecall a time when the majority leader said to the minority, ``We will \nnot only decide what amendments are offered on our side, but we'll \ndecide what amendments are offered on your side.'' Is this something \nthe Senator from South Dakota has seen before?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Like the Senator from North Dakota, I have been around \nhere a while, too, and this has been a first for me as well. It doesn't \ncome often. To have the quarterbacks all on that side deciding the \namendments to be offered is an interesting set of circumstances.\n  The point the Senator from North Dakota makes is right on the mark. \nWe are giving benefits to, in the name of the marriage penalty, married \npeople who have no tax penalty, who actually benefit from being \nmarried. But the real irony, the real sad aspect of this, Mr. \nPresident, is we are doing it at the expense of those smoking-related \nillnesses in Medicare and Medicaid. We are doing it at the expense of \ntobacco farmers; we are doing it at the expense of children; we are \ndoing it at the expense of research; we are doing it at the expense of \na comprehensive attack on teenage smoking.\n  That is the real irony here, and that is why a lot of us feel very \nmystified by this proposal and by the approach the Republicans are \ninsisting on and troubled by the inequity, not only procedurally but in \nsubstance, with the amendments they are demanding that we consider.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just one brief response to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. If he has been here 12 years, then surely he remembers \nSenator Byrd and Senator Mitchell doing just that. I remember many \noccasions in my time here that they dictated and filled up the tree. I \nlearned the way of doing business around here from them.\n  I might also note, to make every taxpayer punished by the marriage \npenalty even with unmarried people costs $38 billion. If we are serious \nabout really eliminating this penalty, that is the cost. I believe the \nSenator from Texas has a proposal that unfortunately is below that. It \nis less than that. He would like to completely eliminate it.\n  In the interest of trying to come to some accommodation so we can get \na vote and still leave money for legitimate programs, like the teenage \nsmoking cessation program and the Medicaid programs in the States, he \nhas been prepared to negotiate below that level. I am not sure he \nshould have gone down as far as he has.\n  Does the Senator from Texas wish to get into this debate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I just make one comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. He has been waiting.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like to respond to the minority leader, if I may.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me go ahead and yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is happening now is what I feared would happen to \nthis bill. It is starting to get very partisan. A lot of things are \nbeing said which are not necessarily helpful to the process. I hope \nthat we can end this dialog, now that we have all made our points, and \ntry and sit down and move forward or agree to just move on to other \nthings. I don't think it helps anybody for us to start accusing each \nother of bad faith or parliamentary maneuvering. I hope that we can \nmove at least----\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to the Senator from Arizona, I think that is exactly \nwhat is happening. And I do think the well is being poisoned \ntremendously by what has been going on here in the last few minutes. I \nyield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't want to get into a long argument with the minority \nleader, but I have to explain what this is about, in case somebody \ntuned in the middle of all this.\n  For several weeks our Democratic colleagues have stood on the floor \nof the Senate and denounced the tobacco companies, with great \njustification. But they have proposed a bill that imposes taxes \nprincipally on blue-collar Americans, and they have in their bill an \nincredible provision that mandates tobacco companies to pass the tax \nthrough to the consumer.\n  Despite the fact that it sounds like we have come to a lynching of \ntobacco companies, the reality is we have a confiscatory tax on their \nvictims, the people who smoke. As my 85-year-old mother has observed, \n``You are saying to me I have been victimized, and then instead of \ntaxing the tobacco companies, you are taxing me.''\n  The tax in this bill is imposed on very moderate income people: 34 \npercent of it is imposed on those who\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\nmake less than $15,000 a year; 47 percent is imposed on those who make \nless than $22,000 a year; 59.1 percent is imposed on those who make \nless than $30,000 a year.\n  Our colleagues say this is not about money. It is not money they \nwant. It is just coincidental that they get $700 billion from blue-\ncollar workers in higher taxes. What they want is to raise the price of \ncigarettes. My amendment simply says raise the price of cigarettes, but \nrather than impoverishing the victims, the people who have been induced \nto smoke, let's take a portion of the money, in this case roughly a \nthird of it, and let s give it back to moderate-income families by \neliminating the marriage penalty for families that make $50,000 a year \nor less.\n  I basically view this as a rebate of part of this tax. I am trying to \ntake our colleagues at face value as to what they say they want to do. \nThey say their objective is to raise the price of cigarettes not to \npass one of the largest tax increases in American history.\n  When I offered the amendment that would give a third of the money \nback to blue-collar workers, suddenly our colleagues were all up in \narms, and we find ourselves in this situation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not yield. I listened to everybody else talk. I \nsimply want my turn.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question of fact?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not intend to yield until I am through. We hear the \nminority leader say that we can't afford to give a third of the money \nback to blue-collar workers who, if they smoke one pack of cigarettes a \nday, will pay $1,015 of new Federal taxes. People making less than \n$10,000 a year will see their Federal tax burden go up by 41.2 percent \nbecause of this bill. They say we don't have a nickel in this bill that \nwe could give back to blue-collar workers who have been victimized by \nthe very tobacco companies that they denounce. But it is interesting \nthat while they do not have a penny to give back to working people, \nthey have $28 billion to give to tobacco farmers.\n\n  Let me try to set this in perspective. Under a provision in this \nbill, tobacco farmers would be paid $21,351.35 an acre. We would make a \npayment to tobacco farmers of over $21,000 an acre, and then they could \ncontinue to grow tobacco under the same program they grow tobacco under \nnow.\n  I can go out today and buy a quota to grow tobacco for $3,500 an \nacre, but yet we are proposing in this bill to pay $21,351.35 for what \ncan be bought for $3,500 today? Why? Basically because this bill is not \nabout teenage smoking, except for about 10 pages of it. And 743 pages \nof this bill are about the most egregious kind of spending that has \never been observed anywhere in the history of this Government.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will not yield.\n  Mr. FORD. You keep talking about the farmers and misrepresenting it. \nI just want to correct you.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I always stand ready to be corrected.\n  Mr. FORD. You will be.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am simply reading numbers out of the bill. Basically, we \nhave 743 pages of mandated spending on everything from maternal and \nchild care health services, funding child care, mandating funding under \nchild welfare, title IV, section (B), and mandating that the funds in \nthis bill be spent by the States be spent on the Department of \nEducation, Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program, under \ntitle II of the Elementary and Secondary Act.\n  We have in this bill what some estimate is the ratification of a \nsettlement that will pay attorneys $100,000 an hour. Yet we do not have \nenough money to prevent the impoverishment of blue-collar workers who \nhave been victimized by the very tobacco companies that we assail.\n  This bill gives all this money--endless billions--to all these groups \nin the grossest giveaway that I have ever observed in my political \ncareer. Groups that would have been happy with hundreds of dollars, in \nthis bill we give them billions of dollars, because the mentality is, \nas one office seeker called it: ``We won the lottery.'' Well, \nunfortunately, this is a lottery that is paid for with taxes imposed on \nblue-collar workers.\n  What I have proposed to do is to simply take a third of the money so \nthat we still get the full impact of raising the price of cigarettes. \nHowever since our colleagues claim this is not about money, I would \nlike to give part of the money back to blue-collar workers by repealing \nthe marriage penalty on moderate-income families who make below $50,000 \na year so that we do not end up impoverishing the victims of the whole \neffort to induce people not to smoke.\n  Also, let me say that it is not possible to effectively spend the \namount of money that is allocated in this bill. It is not possible to \nspend the billions and billions and billions of dollars in this bill, \nnor is it wise public policy. So I think if you really wanted to have a \nbill and you wanted to raise the price of cigarettes, that you would \nraise the price of cigarettes and you would take the bulk of the money \nand cut taxes on moderate-income people who are going to pay the costs. \nSo you discourage people from smoking but you do not pound them into \nthe ground economically. That is what I am proposing to do.\n  What is this deal about suddenly the Democrats want to cut taxes? \nWhat is all that about? Well, what it is about is, they think that if \nthey can guarantee their Members that they will immediately get the \nvote on a figleaf amendment right after we have the real vote, that \nthey can get every Democrat Member to vote against repealing the \nmarriage penalty.\n  Basically, let me tell you what will happen. I just want to ask \npeople who might watch this vote to watch it happen. When my amendment \nis voted on, because if anything is voted on, this amendment is going \nto be voted on, when we reach 51 votes on my amendment, you are going \nto see about 20 or 30 Members rush down and vote for it right at the \nlast minute. It will pass with 65, 70, 75 votes. But if it only gets 49 \nvotes, none of them will rush down, because what the minority leader is \ntrying to guarantee them is that if they vote against the amendment to \nrepeal the marriage penalty, that they are going to get a vote later \non. Their amendment will be a much smaller tax cut, but when they get \nasked back home, ``Well, weren't you willing to repeal the marriage \npenalty on working families?'' They are going to say, ``Oh, yeah, I was \nfor it. I just wasn't for that provision. I was for another provision, \nbut I wasn't for that provision.''\n\n  So I do not know if anybody is going to be fooled.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. But the issue really boils down to this: You can denounce \nthe tobacco companies all you want to and rejoice in it. I would join \nyou if I thought it would do any good. But I think we are doing it so \nmuch, I am not sure it is achieving its stated objective. In the end, \nyou are not taxing tobacco companies. In the end, you are taxing blue-\ncollar workers in this country, who are going to be brutally punished \nby this tax if they are addicted to cigarettes and they cannot quit \nsmoking.\n  In my State, we have 3.1 million people who smoke cigarettes. If they \nsmoke one pack a day, they are going to pay $1,015 in new Federal taxes \nas a result of this bill. For somebody who is making $10,000 or $20,000 \nor $30,000 a year, that is a brutal, punishing tax.\n  All I am saying is, quite frankly, Americans believe this bill is \nabout the $700 billion. They believe that this has long ago stopped \nbeing about teenage smoking, that this is really more of the old tax \nand spend, getting $700 billion of easy tax money and then spending it. \nIt is easy because people believe that we are taxing tobacco companies. \nWhen they understand that we are taxing the people who smoke, and who \nin many cases are addicted and who can't quit, or at least are going to \ntake time to quit, I do not think they are going to be sympathetic to \nwhat we have done.\n  No one can argue that in the endless billions of dollars of money \nspent in this bill, that we could not give a third of this money back \nto blue-collar workers by repealing the marriage penalty.\n  So my goal is to offer the amendment. I hope it will be adopted. I \nthink it is the right thing to do. I think it would marginally help \nthis bill. But my objective is to see that if, in fact, we raise taxes \non working people, that we raise the tax to change the price of \ncigarettes and therefore encourage people to quit smoking. I do not \nwant to\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\nsimply raise the tax to spend money on endless Government programs, \nmany of which have nothing to do with smoking. And the ones that have \nanything to do with smoking, we have endless redundancy in setting up \ncommunity action programs and international smoking cessation programs \nand the worst kind of duplicative bureaucracy. The net result will be \nto hire tens or hundreds of thousands of people, spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, every penny of which will come out of the wallets \nand purses of blue-collar working Americans.\n  Finally, let me say that someone suggested that if we repeal the \nmarriage penalty, it might help couples where the wife stays at home \nand works in the home. If that is a criticism, please note me down as \nhaving been criticized. I do not have any apologies to make.\n  I think the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the \nwagon in this country pay too much in taxes. I am not happy that we are \ngetting ready to sock them with another $700 billion of taxes. If I \ncan, through my modest involvement, see that they get a third of the \nmoney back, so that we get the impact on smoking without impoverishing \nblue-collar workers, I want to do it. And that is what I am trying to \nachieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, all that the Senator from Texas has said \nsure sounds good when it gets a one-sided airing. But, fortunately, the \nSenate has an ability to look for the truth here. And the truth is that \nthis is not a Democrat bill, this came out of the Commerce Committee \n19-1--19-1--in a bipartisan vote.\n  And the fact is that the Senator from Texas talks about wanting to \ntake only one-third of the money. But he doesn't just take one-third. \nNo, he just doesn't tell the full story. The Senator from Texas is not \nprepared to let the Senate and the American people know what his \namendment really does.\n\n  So we will show you what it really does. It cleverly, in the first 4 \nor 5 years, takes one-third, but then it builds up, and over the course \nof the next 20 years it takes 53 percent over 5 years, 80 percent over \n5 years, 79 percent over another 5 years, and 73 percent over the next \n5 years. So consistently for a period of 20 years it takes more than 50 \npercent, and for 15 of those years more than 75 percent. That is \nextraordinary.\n  He stands here and says to the Members of the Senate, ``All I want \nis''--what? 33 percent, one-third. That is just not the truth. The \ntruth is that this amendment of the Senator from Texas not only goes to \nthe people he talks about, those working Americans who will get so \nbrutally attacked, but he is going to give money back to people who, \nunder the aberrations of the marriage penalty, actually get a bonus. \nFifty-two percent of the people who get married actually get a bonus \nbecause of the way the Tax Code works on the earnings of individuals \nversus joint filings. He gives the bonus recipients back money, too.\n  If we are really concerned about restoring and repairing the notion \nof fairness for people who are hurt by their wage level and the fact \nthat they buy cigarettes, and you will try and fix the marriage penalty \nat the same time, then we believe the Democrat alternative is a better \nalternative. The reason the Republicans don't want to let us have the \nright to vote on it right away is because it is a better alternative \nand they are afraid what they really need is some time in between them \nso that the vote which is hanging out there--the only vote that people \nwill see--the public might get mad and telephone Members and say, why \ndidn't you vote for this, because they won't know there is an \nalternative. That is the game that is going on here.\n  Under the other alternative, the Democrat alternative, because we \nmake an effort not to wind up taking money from kids that we are trying \nto stop smoking, not to take money from a cessation program, not to \ntake money from the counteradvertising, and we regard people who, when \nthey got married got rewarded by getting more money under the Tax \nCode--how can you justify that under these circumstances if this is the \ntradeoff?\n  The fact is that under the amendment the Democrats are prepared to \noffer we give almost double the amount of money that you get under the \namendment from the Senator from Texas. For a couple with a split \nincome, say they are earning $35,000. One is earning $20,000 and the \nother is earning $15,000. Under the Democrat alternative they would get \n$3,000 back; under the Republican alternative they would get back \n$1,650. Similarly, for a couple earning $50,000, if it was split \n$25,000 and $25,000 of income for each partner, in our alternative they \nwould get $5,000 back; under the Gramm alternative they would get the \nsame $1,650 as they would have gotten for the lesser amount.\n  So we ask Americans to look carefully. Here is a legitimate proposal \nto change the penalty of the marriage tax, to fix it for the people who \nare most penalized and to benefit people who are, in fact, most \ninjured. That is the difference between the two. That is what people \nwill have an option of voting on if we are permitted to vote on it in \nsome simultaneous form. Obviously, our hope is we will still be \npermitted to do that.\n\n  Under the amendment from the Senator from Texas, he would, in fact, \naccording to the Centers for Disease Control, he would take money out \nof the cessation and counteradvertising and school-based prevention.\n  Now, he complains this bill is somehow going to throw money at \n``government programs.'' Well, in his State of Texas, there would be \n360,000 less kids who would be eligible to have cessation services made \navailable to them. There would be 3,869,000 kids between the ages of 5 \nand 17 who would not get school-based prevention programs as a result \nof his own proposal to strip that money out of the revenues from the \ntobacco bill. That is what would happen. That is what we are talking \nabout here. We are talking about whether or not there will be cessation \nprograms, whether or not there are going to be counteradvertising \nefforts, all of which have been proven to work.\n  So what you really have out here is a fundamental effort to try to \nkill the bill or stop the bill or just let it go on and on forever. The \nSenator from South Dakota, the minority leader, was absolutely correct. \nThere is a whole world of difference between the way this bill is being \nshepherded versus the way every other piece of legislation that has \ncome to the floor this year, where there have been time agreements, \ncloture motions filed immediately, immediately limited debate, limited \nnumber of amendments--move the legislation. We can tell the difference \nbetween those who would like to pass legislation or work on it, I \nthink, in a way that will move this legislation to some kind of a final \ndisposition.\n  The fact is that there is a world of difference between adequately \ntaking care of those efforts that will have the most impact on a proven \nbasis in helping to prevent kids from smoking versus the kind of \napproach that the Senator from Texas is offering. I would like to vote \nto cut the marriage penalty. I would like to vote to do away with the \nwhole thing. The question is, Are you going to do it here, when the \nchoice is between reducing kids from smoking or not? That is really \nwhat it comes down to when you look at the large amounts of money the \nSenator from Texas is seeking to take.\n  We have offered a compromise. We have offered to sit down with the \nSenator from Texas to try and arrive at a lesser amount of money and \nsee if we can't come to some agreement as to what would be reasonable. \nI think most people on our side of the aisle would welcome the \nopportunity to change some part of the formula of how these moneys are \nspent and certainly envision the capacity to embrace a tax cut in an \nappropriate form and shape and size--in that context. But if there is a \ngenuine effort to do this, then we ought to be able to make that \nhappen. If there is simply an effort to grab so much money that this \nbill goes under of its own weight, it will be very clear whose \nintention was what, and ultimately what the impact was as a result of \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to \nparticipate in this debate regarding the so-called tobacco settlement. \nMy understanding of this bill does not comport with the understanding \nthat has been recently voiced on this floor by the Senator from \nMassachusetts. It appears to me this bill, which is a very \ncomprehensive bill, the dimensions of which are so substantial that \nthey deserve clear inspection--we are talking about a major piece of \nlegislation, a tobacco bill which includes this kind of specificity. We \nare talking about a bill that has 17 new boards and commissions. We are \ntalking about a bill that would add taxes of about $885 billion at the \nmaximum over the course and life of the bill to the budgets of \nAmericans. These aren't costs that go to the tobacco company. These \nwill be additional costs to the people.\n  I question whether or not this kind of bill deserves the full \nexamination and the full discussion of this Senate; that is a serious \nquestion. I have a suspicion that some individuals want to curtail \ndebate on this bill because the bill is finally being seen. There is a \ndawning. The light of day is beginning to shine on this bill. The \nAmerican people are seeing that 98 percent of the people are being \ntaxed, while only 2 percent of the teens smoke. The 98 percent of the \npeople that are being taxed are having their costs go up \nastronomically. Not only are they having their costs go up \nastronomically, they are having their costs go up on an assumption that \nif you raise the cost of cigarettes by 10 percent, you get a 7-percent \ndecrease in the amount of utilization by young people. That is an \nassumption that the studies do not bear out. As a matter of fact, the \nmost recent studies indicate that an increased cost of cigarettes will \nnot curtail young people from smoking. It is simply not the case. At \nbest, the studies are inconclusive. At worse, they show that there is \nlittle correlation between a price increase and reduction in youth \nsmoking.\n\n  Let me give you some statistics about this. The Cornell study was a \nstudy that followed 13,000 children for 4 years. This was not something \nthat was cooked up and done in response to the tobacco industry, or \nsomeone like that. It was done at Cornell University, and it was a \nNational Cancer Institute-funded study, so that the funding for this \nstudy is credible funding. Here is what the study found:\n\n       . . . little evidence that taxes reduce smoking onset \n     between 8th and 12th grade.\n\n  So in that critical exposure period between 8th and 12th grade in \nschool, there is very little evidence that increased taxes would reduce \nthe kind of growth in the numbers of individuals smoking. The \neconomists that conducted this study presented their results on the \nrelationship between higher tobacco taxes and youth smoking to the \nAmerican Economics Association at their annual meeting in January of \n1998. This is a current study. This studied young people and the way \nthey respond in the modern culture. It concluded that higher taxes have \nlittle effect on whether young people start to smoke. Little effect.\n  Here is what the study concluded:\n\n       Taxes are not as salient to youth smoking decisions as are \n     individual characteristics and family background.\n\n  In other words, whether children begin smoking doesn't relate to \ntaxes near as much as it does to family background and characteristics \nof the children.\n  This study, which followed 13,000 young people for 4 years, says:\n\n       We find little evidence that taxes reduce smoking onset \n     between 8th and 12th grades.\n\n  They estimated that a $1.50 tax increase would decrease the smoking \nonset by only about 2 percentage points, from 21.6 percent of the 12th \ngraders to 19.6 percent of the 12th graders.\n  When you suggest that the change in the smoking habits would be that \nsmall--they had to conclude as follows, and I will quote from the \nreport of Cornell University, a report funded by the National Cancer \nInstitute, which put it this way:\n\n       Our data allow us to directly examine the impact of changes \n     in tax rates on youth smoking behavior . . .\n\n  In other words, they said they had enough data to draw conclusions.\n\n       . . . and our preliminary results indicate this impact is \n     small or nonexistent.\n\n  So this massive tax increase--$868 billion to a new estimate of $885 \nbillion--on the American people, over the course of the life of this \nsettlement, is supposed to produce some kind of a reduced incidence of \nyouth smoking. Yet, the very best data from the latest studies, \nsponsored not by the tobacco people, but by the National Cancer \nInstitute--a 4-year study--indicates that the taxes would have a small \nor nonexistent affect.\n  That reveals what this bill is all about. It is about big Government. \nIt is about big taxes. It is about new agencies. It is about an \ninvasion of the taxpayers' pockets. It is striking to note that there \nis $350 million a year in this bill. And with the 50 States, that is $7 \nmillion per State. That is $7 million per State, on an average, that \ngoes overseas to fund studies in foreign countries about how costly \ncigarette smoking is in those cultures.\n  For the life of me, I can't figure out why we want to have Government \nbureaucracy, funded by a tax on the lower income people of the United \nStates of America, to make it possible for Third World countries and \nothers overseas to have studies on how costly smoking is in their \nculture. A number of individuals would prefer that they have it not be \nso costly here. The truth of the matter is that 59.4 percent of all the \nindividuals who will be paying this tax, according to the best \nestimates we have, will be individuals whose income is less than \n$30,000 a year.\n\n  So we have a massive tax bill, three-quarters of a trillion dollars, \nfocused on the lowest income people in America, on the presumption that \nit will curtail smoking among young people. But the best academic \nresearch we have indicates that young people are not sensitive to \nprice. As a matter of fact, the study conducted by Cornell University, \nfunded by the National Cancer Institute, indicated that there is little \nor nonexistent impact by that kind of tax in terms of curtailing \nsmoking by young people. This is a study done by the folks at Cornell \nUniversity, which is a well-respected institution. We would expect that \nthe National Cancer Institute would fund a study that is fairly done. \nIt studied a lot of children, and 4 years is a long period of time. We \nwould not expect this study to have been done in a slipshod manner. It \ndoes come to the conclusion that indicates this isn't a very productive \nway to try to curtail youth smoking. The economists stated the study \nraises doubt about the claim that tax or price increases can \nsubstantially reduce youth smoking.\n  Well, obviously, there are very serious doubts. But there is no doubt \nabout what this bill is about. It is about an $885 billion increase in \nthe taxes to be focused on low-income individuals in the United States.\n  Let me just cite another study. Economists at the University of \nMaryland and the University of Chicago conducted a similar study that \nanalyzed data concerning more than 250,000 high school seniors for the \nperiod from 1977 to 1992. Now, this is a longitudinal study; you get \nfrom 1977 to 1992, so it is a 15-year-long study. This is the largest \nsample ever used for a study on the subject. So you have a quarter of a \nmillion students studied over a 15-year period.\n  Here is what they found. They found the relationship between price \nand youth consumption is ``substantially smaller'' than suggested by \nprevious studies.\n  In addition, not only do we have the Cornell study on this idea that \nyou can reduce smoking by 7 percent with a 10-percent price increase, \nwhich says that it is nonexistent or would have little impact at all, \nbut this other study was done by the University of Maryland and the \nUniversity of Chicago over a 15-year period on a quarter of a million \nstudents. It says there is a substantially smaller than previously \nsuggested link between taxes and smoking.\n  Many of us could just look at the circumstances that we see around us \nand have an idea that price isn't the primary objective or \nconsciousness on the part of young people. When we look at young people \nwearing $140 tennis shoes because they have a certain logo on\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\nthem, I think we can get the idea that there is something in addition \nto price here; there is status and statement, which are very important \nto young people. Price becomes irrelevant in the context of status and \nstatement.\n  Let's get out of the area of studies and look at what happened when \nprice increases have been put into effect. In 1989, California raised \nits cigarette excise tax by 25 cents per pack, but there is no evidence \nthat cigarette smoking declined. Now, this was an 11 percent increase \nof the tax. That is a major increase. If we were to see that kind of \nincrease, we would expect there to be a decline. No evidence of a \ndecline. As of 1994, researchers were ``unable to identify a decline in \nprevalence [among 16- to-18-year-olds] associated with the imposition \nof the excise tax.''\n  In Canada--and this is the most commonly cited arena cited by those \nwho want to have this massive settlement imposed on the American people \nat the cost of more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars to the \npeople. In Canada, our neighbor to the north, the federal government \nincreased cigarette taxes in several stages in the late 1980s and early \n1990s--from $10.75 per thousand cigarettes to $24.34 in 1986 per \nthousand cigarettes, then to $38.77 in 1989 per thousand cigarettes, \nand then to $62.90 in 1991 per thousand cigarettes.\n  So you go from $10 per thousand, or about a penny a cigarette, to 6 \nor 7 cents per cigarette, over the period of time. So you had an \nincrease, at first, of a penny per cigarette, and then an increase of 6 \ncents per cigarette. Although it has been stated on the floor by \nproponents of this legislation that smoking decreased during that \nperiod, they failed to talk about the years 1991 to 1994.\n  Here is what happened. When the tax rates were the highest in that \nnation's history, and when the tax rates were the highest in that \nnation's history during that period, smoking rates among 15- to 19-\nyear-olds rose from 21 to 27 percent. That is a 25-percent increase--\nmore than a 25-percent increase in the number of teens smoking at the \ntime when the cost of cigarettes was at the highest in history. \nFrankly, when the cost of cigarettes in Canada was at the highest in \nhistory, I think it is pretty clear from the testimony of others on \nthis floor that the black market was operating the most aggressively at \nthat time. So we are probably seriously underestimating the fact that \nthe growth was about 25 percent in the number of teens who were \nsmoking.\n  If the argument that rising prices will reduce teen smoking, it \nstands to reason that youth smoking should increase as prices fall. If \nyou are going to say that higher prices cause teens to stop smoking, \nthen lower prices would probably cause teens to start smoking. However, \na year and a half after significantly reducing tobacco taxes in Canada, \naccording to the ``Survey on Smoking in Canada,'' teen smoking \n``remained stable.''\n  What we really have from our experience of observing Canada is that \nteens aren't very much affected by price. That confirms what the study \nindicated at the University of Maryland and Chicago. It confirms what \nthe Cornell study indicated. It confirms what happened in California. \nWhat happens, as a matter of fact, is that teens are not affected very \nmuch by price. The fact that is ignored by those who argue teen smoking \ndeclined in Canada due to the significant tax increases is that youth \nsmoking declined in the United States by 30 percent during the same \nperiod--from 1977 to 1990--without a price increase.\n  There are times when teen rates of smoking haven't gone up in either \nculture. If they were parallel in both cultures as a result of other \nfactors, and taxes went up in one and not in another, it makes it \npretty clear that the tax increase in one was irrelevant to whether or \nnot teens smoked. Here we have a situation where we are imposing a tax \non 98 percent of the cigarette consumers who are adults on the \npresumption that it will change the smoking habits of the 2 percent who \nare teenagers when the studies and the real world information simply do \nnot bear out this as a justification for this kind of massive tax \nincrease.\n  In the United Kingdom, between 1988 and 1996, the per pack price of \ncigarettes was increased by 26 percent. Although cigarette volumes fell \nby 17 percent, the percentage of weekly smokers aged 11 to 16 went from \n8 percent in 1988 to 13 percent in 1996. So it turns out in the United \nKingdom the number of youngsters who were smoking went up, even when \nthe number of people smoking overall went down. It went up from 8 \npercent to 13 percent in spite of the fact there was a 26-percent \nincrease in the price of tobacco.\n  The University of Chicago, and Maryland, Cornell University, a study \nfunded by the National Cancer Institute, the experience in California, \nthe experience in Canada, the experience in Great Britain--these are \nexperiences which indicate to us that this is more a bill about taxes \nthan about increasing the size of government. It is about sending the \nhard-earned dollars of individuals in the United States overseas to \nfund these studies in other countries, to provide a basis for a variety \nof interests in the United States being well funded; but this is not a \nbill which addresses the issue of teen smoking in a responsible way.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has compiled data on brand \npreferences which support the conclusion that young people are not \nparticularly price sensitive. The ``price value'' or discount segment \nof the cigarette market comprised 39 percent of the overall cigarette \nmarket in 1993. Yet, according to the CDC, less than 14 percent of \nadolescent smokers purchase generic or other ``value-priced'' brands. \nOn the average, the people were price sensitive, but when you got to \nteenagers they weren't.\n  This point was echoed by the government's lawyer defending the FDA \ntobacco rule, who told the U.S. district court, ``[P]rice, apparently \nhas very little meaning to children and smoking, and, therefore, they \ndon't smoke generic cigarettes. They go for those three big advertised \nbrands.''\n\n  All of a sudden, we come to this place where we are going to pile on \nthe taxes, pile them on low-income individuals. Those making less than \n$30,000 a year will pay nearly 60 percent of this $885 billion tax \nburden. And we are doing it in the face of the information of these \nuniversity studies that are current, that are recent; in the face of \nthe data from California, and data in Great Britain; and in the face of \nthe Federal Government's lawyer arguing in the U.S. district court in \nthe FDA tobacco case where he said, ``price apparently has very little \nmeaning to children and smoking.'' They aren't affected by price.\n  We have a situation where we have had cloture filed on this bill. \nThere are those who do not want the kind of debate about price and \nabout taxes, about the fact that the price isn't really as significant \nas they would like to portray on teen smoking. And if we slow this bill \ndown enough for people to look at it carefully, they might figure out \nthat this bill isn't what is needed at all. Certainly, most people do \nnot think we need another three-quarters of a trillion dollars in taxes \nfocused on the hard-working, lower-income individuals in America.\n  This is a bill about taxes. It is a bill about money. If you look \ncarefully at this bill, it has everything from foreign aid in it to \nmore of the child care proposals of President Clinton. It is time, if \nwe are going to have taxes increased, that we do something constructive \nwith the tax increase, and we give it back to the people in terms of \nrespecting an institution which America has long understood to be at \nthe core of the potential for a bright future for this country. We are \ntalking about the institution of marriage.\n  I commend Senator Gramm who brought to the floor a proposal which \nwould eliminate the marriage penalty on individuals who are low-income \nindividuals, to say to them that we don't think you should have to pay \nhigher taxes merely because you are going to be married; you are going \nto make the durable, lasting commitments of marriage that are likely to \nbe the basis for strong families that are the foundation and the future \nof America, we don't think you should pay for that in terms of higher \ntaxes.\n  Both Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici have indicated they would \neliminate the marriage penalty for individuals making less than $50,000 \na year with some of the resources generated by this measure. Obviously, \nthere are those who are expecting to spend those resources on more \ngovernment programs and are terrified by the fact that we might think \nabout giving\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\nthe money back to the people. You have to understand this is at a time \nwhen the U.S. Government is in surplus. It is expected--even \nconservative estimates--that there will be a $39 billion surplus this \nyear, nearly $60 billion in surplus next year, and we shouldn't be here \ndebating how to spend more of the taxpayers' money. We should be here \ndebating how to give money back. And Senators Gramm and Domenici, the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico, have come forward \nwith a plan to reduce taxes to the extent that you end the marriage \npenalty and to say to people, we are not going to penalize you for \nhaving the durable, lasting commitments of marriage that become the \nfoundation.\n  Frankly, I am very enchanted by the idea of eliminating the marriage \npenalty, and this will not end the debate on the marriage penalty. I \nwill continue to offer amendments until it is eliminated, whether this \npasses or not. The marriage penalty is a pernicious attack on the \nvalues and principles of America. It is time that we aligned the policy \nof America with the principles of the people of America.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Texas for \ntheir outstanding work, but I think this cloture motion was filed \nbecause people are beginning to understand. The idea is that, well, we \nfiled cloture on some other matters; maybe we should file cloture on \nthis. I think that has been suggested. I don't think that is the case. \nI think the people are beginning to understand this is a massive tax \nincrease. And because it is, I think that cloture is inappropriate at \nthis time. We have a responsibility to debate what we will do with $885 \nbillion in revenue. I think it should be given back to the people who \nhave paid it.\n  With that in mind, I urge Senators to oppose in every respect the \nmotion for cloture, to vote against it. This is a measure which \ndeserves the light of day. It deserves the dawning of day. The American \npeople really ought to have a chance to look carefully at it, \nunderstand it, and to see it clearly. They ought to see it in the \ncontext of what it seeks to do--tax individuals, primarily low-income \nindividuals, at very substantial rates--and the result will be \nsubstantially more Government. The studies indicate that the impact on \nteen smoking as a result of that tax is very likely to be minimal, if \nexistent at all.\n  It is with that in mind that I think we ought to take very seriously \nthe proposals to abolish, to take the tax out of this bill. And if we \ndon't do that, we ought to do what we can to give back the money which \nis collected from the hard-working people of America. The idea that we \nshould somehow proliferate Government in response to this situation is \nan idea which, when exposed to the full light of understanding, will be \nrejected by the American people. Certainly Washington appears to be the \nonly city in the world where a bad decision, the decision to smoke, \nmade by free people, becomes the basis for taxing those free people, \ntaxing them in ways that will make it very difficult for them to \nprovide for their families.\n  My own view is that that is inappropriate. We should reconsider the \nposition that is being offered here, and I believe the kind of tax \nrelief that has been offered by the Senator from Texas and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico is the kind of relief that ought to be considered in \nthe event there are any taxes in this measure.\n  With that in mind, I will do what I can to make sure that we have the \nopportunity to consider a variety of proposals which would extinguish \nand end the marriage penalty in our law, if there are resources being \ncollected from the American people under the guise of a tobacco \nsettlement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I respect the views expressed by the \nSenator from Missouri. He has spoken long and eloquently on this issue \nin the Chamber. I did hear him just say that bad decisions by free \npeople to smoke--bad decisions by free people to smoke--shouldn't be \ntaxed.\n  I am intrigued by that comment, especially since what we are talking \nabout here is free children. I thought that the obligation of my party \nand Government was to care for children, was to keep them out of harm's \nway, and do what we can to lead them into better lives.\n  When the Senator from Missouri said ``bad decisions by free people,'' \nI was really sort of shocked, because the Senator from Missouri should \nunderstand the intent of this legislation. The intent of the \nlegislation is to try to stop companies that have been enticing the \nchildren--my children, all America's children--to take up a habit that \nis going to kill them. So it can be interpreted as a massive tax \nincrease; that is what the latest media reports I see are--$60 million \nworth of attack ads calling it a tax increase. That seems to have been \nsort of accepted by the American people as fact. I guess if you spend \nenough money on an advertising campaign, it may have some significant \neffects.\n  It seems to me that for Americans to believe that this is simply a \nreason to tax them, then there has been a very significant effect.\n  But I think we are all aware that what we are trying to do here is \ncut taxes on the American people. You do that by stopping people from \nsmoking, because right now $50 billion a year in Americans' tax dollars \ngo to treatment of tobacco-related illnesses. And that $50 billion a \nyear, Mr. President, is not a static number, because according to the \nCenters for Disease Control, and other sources, children smoking is \ngoing up in America; therefore, you are going to have more people who \nneed treatment because approximately a third of those children who \nbegin to smoke will die early or need treatment for tobacco-related \nillnesses. So the present $50 billion tax per year that the American \npeople are paying will increase. So I don't know why it is so hard for \nsome people to understand that if we do nothing and the present trend \ncontinues, the tax burden on all Americans--high income, low-income \nAmericans--will go up, not down.\n  I think it is also important to address the issue that seems to be \ntalked about so much by opponents of the legislation, about the burden \nthat this tax--I am beginning to do it myself--that this increase in \nthe cost of a pack of cigarettes will have on low-income Americans.\n  First of all, to state the obvious, as the Senator from Missouri \nsaid, it was a bad decision, and these people do smoke, which is their \nchoice. And I certainly sympathize with those who find it nearly \nimpossible or impossible to stop. It is extremely difficult, because it \nis an extremely addictive substance, but it still is a voluntary act. \nBut also, we find out, and it is very disheartening, that it is the \nchildren of lower-income Americans whose smoking is increasing in \nAmerica. And to somehow feel that low-income or middle-income or high-\nincome Americans would not do whatever is necessary not just for \nthemselves but for their children I think is contradictory to what I \nknow and believe about the American people.\n  Mr. President, we had not the most pleasant exchange that I have \nobserved in this Chamber recently, not the most unpleasant either, by \nthe way, but it wasn't pleasant. Obviously, we have been on the bill \nnow nearly 2 weeks. We know we have the press of other business. We \nknow we have legislation that needs to be addressed--the Department of \nDefense bill, 13 appropriations bills, and others are necessary. There \nis a certain level of frustration that was manifested here. I believe \nwe must come to a point where we should decide to end the debate--\nwhich, as I say, now has been going on for nearly 2 weeks--or move \nforward with the bill. In the event of cloture, as we all know, germane \namendments to the bill would still be in order.\n  I should also like to remind my colleagues of the consequences of \ngoing off the bill. If we do not pass this legislation through the \nSenate and through the House and then in conference and signed by the \nPresident, I think some think the issue will therefore disappear from \nthe American scene. Quite the contrary, Mr. President. The reality is \nthat if the Congress does nothing, then there are 37, and perhaps more, \nattorneys general who are lined up to sue the tobacco companies for the \ninjuries that have been inflicted on the people of their States.\n\n  I think there are several drawbacks to this course of action. One of \nthem, to state the obvious, is that the amount of legal fees that will \ngo, the amount of money that will go in the\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\nform of legal fees, to the plaintiffs' lawyers will be dramatically \nhigher than that envisioned by this bill and, frankly, will be much \nhigher than what I would envision in an amendment that will be passed \nin the Senate which will place further restrictions on attorneys' fees.\n  Second, of course, is that it will be a long, drawn out process. I do \nnot think there is any doubt as to who would prevail. There have been \ntrials in four States, all of which have not gone to a jury because the \ntobacco companies, for obvious reasons, have chosen to settle, the last \nbeing the State of Minnesota--$6.5 billion was the agreement by the \nindustry. And along with that agreement, with that settlement, was an \nagreement by the tobacco companies to do many of the things that have \nbeen attacked on this floor.\n  A massive tax hike? Guess what, the price of cigarettes all over \nAmerica went up 5 cents because of the requirement to settle the \nMinnesota case. I think it is also of some interest that the $6.5 \nbillion that the tobacco industry agreed to is roughly double the \namount that would have been received under the settlement that was an \nagreement entered into between the attorneys general and the tobacco \nindustry. So the cost, if you go on a State-by-State basis, assuming \nthat they all either settle or juries award large settlements, then the \ncost goes up. And the so-called tax, massive tax that is so concerning \nto many of my colleagues, is higher. When you extrapolate it out over \nall 40 States that are in court--and I imagine the other 10 would join \nsooner or later--then that is more money added to the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes than envisioned by this legislation.\n  But let me tell you what bothers me the most about having these cases \ngo to the States--which they will. I would like the Senator from \nMissouri to find me one legal expert in America who does not believe \nthat the day that this legislation leaves the floor of the Senate there \nwill be, in the words of a well-known plaintiff's lawyer, a ``rush to \nthe courthouse,'' not only by the attorneys general but by many of the \nplaintiffs' lawyers in America.\n  But what bothers me the most about this, and the reason I am saddened \na bit to contemplate it, is the fundamental purpose of this legislation \nis to act as soon as possible to stop the children from beginning to \nsmoke. The day the President signed this bill, massive amounts of money \nwould be spent to begin youth smoking cessation programs. Large amounts \nof money would be spent on research, not only to find out what causes \nkids to smoke, but also to find cures for these terrible diseases, the \nlargest causes of death in America--the heart disease, the lung cancer, \nthe emphysema--the terrible ways that people die as a result of the use \nof tobacco. So, all that will be delayed. And the most terrible delay, \nof course, will be the effect that we could have, in a beneficial \nfashion, on children in America.\n  There are some on this floor who have said raising the price of a \npack of cigarettes will not do it, these cessation programs don't do \nit, et cetera. I think they are entitled to their opinions on that \nissue, but I depend upon the opinion of experts. I depend upon the \nopinion of every living Surgeon General since 1973--every living \nSurgeon General in America. Their letter has long ago been made part of \nthe Record. They say that you have to have a comprehensive approach to \nthis problem. I agree with every--literally every--public health group \nin America, whoever they are, you name them--I read the list of them \ninto the Record the other day--who say you have to have a comprehensive \nsettlement if you want to stop kids from smoking. I agree with Dr. \nKoop. I agree with Dr. Kessler. I agree with the eminent people in \nAmerica who have spent their lives, literally, on this issue, who say \ndon't think you can solve it by just a simple tax increase.\n\n  I would also like to say I think the States deserve reimbursement. \nWe, on this side of the aisle, at least, have always advocated a \nsituation where we try to reduce the financial burden on the States. We \nare always pleased and proud when we pass things like no unfunded \nmandates and return money to the States to use however they want, \nsince, after all, it is theirs that they send to Washington, DC. If we \ndo not do this settlement, of course, there will be no money that goes \nback to the States; it will all just come to the Federal coffers, and \nbureaucrats will then decide, or one can make the case that the \nappropriators will decide.\n  So the Senator from Missouri made an eloquent argument that we should \ncontinue debate on this issue and that we should not cut off debate \nbecause the American people need to be better informed. I would say to \nthe Senator from Missouri, who I note is here on the floor, they have \nbeen pretty well informed by somewhere between a $60 million and a $100 \nmillion tobacco advertising campaign by the tobacco companies. They \nhave been pretty well saturated in that area. Most major pieces of \nlegislation--the expansion of NATO, for example--in the 12 years that I \nhave been here, almost every major piece of legislation takes about 2 \nto 3 weeks. And, of course, that is only the largest legislation that \nwe consider.\n  I also think there are many, many organizations out there who are \ninforming the American people. But, again, far more important than \nthat, there are people who are suffering from very terrible diseases as \na result of their use of tobacco, and the sooner we get money into \nresearch and find cures for these terrible diseases, the better off \nthey will be and we will be as a nation. Every single day that we \ndebate this issue and not bring it to some conclusion or the other, \n3,000 children will begin to smoke. We can debate whether this is a \ngood bill or a bad bill and how it should be changed, but there is one \nfact that cannot be changed, and that is what it is doing to the young \npeople of America.\n  So I would argue if, at the end of today, 3,000 more children have \nstarted to smoke and 1,000 of them will die early, maybe we ought to \nspend more time here and get this issue resolved and maybe not go home \nthis weekend. Maybe we should spend this weekend debating this issue, \ntrying to reach some conclusion. Instead, either late tonight or early \ntomorrow morning we will all be gone. The majority leader just talked a \nlittle while ago about how hard it is to get people here on Monday.\n  Perhaps--perhaps--we will go to work maybe on Tuesday. Friday, \nSaturday, Sunday, Monday--4 days; 12,000 young people will begin to \nsmoke while we enjoy our extended weekend.\n  I believe that we should try and keep that in mind. My argument, Mr. \nPresident, in a rather drawn-out fashion, is that there are compelling \nreasons why we should act on this issue either one way or another. \nMaybe in the wisdom of the Senate this is not a good piece of \nlegislation, and we should drop it. But let's go ahead and drop it \nsooner rather than later so that the process will begin in the other 36 \nStates that have sued the Federal Government; the additional 10 that, I \nam sure, will be in line; so that the plaintiffs who have suffered \ninjury and the relatives of those who have suffered deaths because of \ntobacco can begin their trip to the courthouse so that they can receive \nthe compensation they feel they deserve because of what happened to \nthem as a result of years of tobacco--whether they deserve that or not \nis up to a judge and jury--but especially the attorneys general \nawaiting to see what the U.S. Congress does. I hope that we can act in \nas rapid and efficient fashion as possible.\n  I remind my colleagues that I was asked, as chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate and to get it \nthrough my committee. We had a full day of markup, and I am in \ndisagreement with the remarks the Senator from Missouri made the other \nday about discouraging amendments. I, in fact, encouraged amendments, \nand the Senator from Missouri had several which were voted on. They had \nto do with product liability. They didn't have anything to do with \nreduction of taxes. But that was the right of the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  I don't believe he could find any of my colleagues who would argue \nthat there wasn't a full addressing of that legislation during that \nday. At no time did I try to cut off anyone's right to propose an \namendment on a piece of legislation that serious. In fact, if I \nremember, I was somewhat entertained the Senator from Missouri even \nproposed as an amendment a piece of legislation which I and Senator\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\nLieberman have cosponsored, which was his right. But I don't believe \nthat anyone was shorted during that very interesting markup. In fact, \nliterally every Senator on the committee was heard from and, again, in \nmy 12 years on the committee, I have never seen nor been part of such \nan extensive markup as took place on this bill in the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I was asked to bring this bill to the floor, and it was reported out \nof the committee by a 19-to-1 vote. Then the majority leader scheduled \nit for floor debate, which is the responsibility of the majority \nleader.\n  I, along with the Senator from Massachusetts, have tried to manage \nthis bill. But I say to my colleagues, there is no point in us staying \non this bill forever. It is obvious that we won't. For example, today \nwe have not had a single amendment voted on, and we seem to be hung up \nin some kind of parliamentary maneuvering which some observers might \nsay is a reason to impede the progress of the bill, because we all know \nwe don't stay on any piece of legislation forever.\n  I hope we can work out our differences. There are pending amendments. \nThere is a very important drug amendment we would have liked to have \nbrought up today. I don't know if we will. It is nearly 4 o'clock now. \nBut I believe it is important that we either move forward and resolve \nthe issue, or we go on to other issues that are compelling issues as \nwell. The Department of Defense authorization bill--and I am a member \nof the Armed Services Committee--is waiting to be debated and resolved. \nIt is very important that we address the needs of the men and women in \nthe military and our Nation's security. There are many other pieces of \nlegislation that are awaiting action on the part of the Senate, which \nargues that we proceed with this legislation or move off it.\n\n  I would feel rather badly if we do, but I also point out that, in my \nown very subjective view, I would have done whatever I could to see \nthat this issue was brought to completion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that people want \nto make this a bill about cessation of teen smoking. I want teens not \nto smoke. It puzzles me, though, that they look past the studies: \nCornell University, with 13,000 students showing that price doesn't \nmake much difference at all to them. They look past the University of \nChicago and University of Maryland saying that price is way overrated. \nThey look past the experience of Canada when price was going up \ndramatically, smoking was going up among young people. They look past \nthe United Kingdom where smoking went up among teens when price was \ngoing up, and they talk about teen smoking, and yet they don't make the \npossession of cigarettes by teenagers illegal or inappropriate in the \nbill.\n  This Congress has authority over the District of Columbia. If we \nreally were serious about saying it is wrong for youngsters to have \ncigarettes or to have tobacco or thought it inappropriate, we could \nmake it illegal for them, but this bill doesn't do that.\n  What does this bill do? This bill raises taxes. It creates new \ngovernment programs. It funds the priorities of the Clinton \nadministration. It is an $885 billion tax increase, and who pays the \ntax? The tax gets paid by low-income individuals. Mr. President, 59.4 \npercent of the individuals who will be paying this tax will be \nindividuals who earn less than $30,000 a year.\n  Some have said, ``Well, we should be voting on amendments.'' I agree \nwe should. There was a unanimous consent order proposed today which \nprovided for votes. I agreed to it. I didn't stop it. The majority \nleader proposed it. He proposed to have votes to lay these issues in a \ncontext where they could be dealt with, where they could be voted on, \nwhere they could be disposed of, and those on the other side of the \naisle rejected it.\n  We can't have it both ways. We can't say that this is a bill which is \ngoing to stop people from smoking and we are going to collect $885 \nbillion when they do smoke. If they stop smoking, the money won't be \nthere. What we all know is they are going to keep smoking; that is why \nthe money will be there.\n  We can't say this will help the children of poor families when we are \ngoing to make the poor families pay $1,200, $1,600 a year in taxes and \ntake that off the table of those families and out of their budgets. We \ncan't say we are going to stop teens from smoking when we don't even \ncare enough to make it illegal for teens, where we have jurisdiction, \nto possess cigarettes.\n  This is a tax bill. It is a massive tax bill. It is a massive \ngovernment bill. It promotes government agencies not only in the United \nStates but overseas. There is $350 million each year in this bill to \nsend overseas, so that countries overseas can conduct studies about \nwhat it costs to smoke in other countries, not the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I think this is the kind of priority that no wonder people don't want \nthis bill slowed down enough for the American public to see: Taxing \npeople who make less than $30,000 a year in the United States to fund \nstudies overseas so that they can conduct studies about what it costs \nto have cigarette smoking in other countries. I don't believe that is \nwhat Americans are interested in. That is not going to help young \npeople in the United States.\n  The Senator from Arizona says the States deserve reimbursement. He \nsaid this is hard on the States, and then he sort of bragged about how \nhard this is on tobacco companies. I am not worried about the States or \nthe tobacco companies as much as I am about the people of the United \nStates. They are the ones who deserve reimbursement, if anybody \ndeserves reimbursement.\n  And here we have an elevated taking by the Federal Government, \nanother three-quarters of a trillion dollars over the life of this \nbill--taking from these people instead of giving to them. We come to do \nthis at a time when the Federal Government is looking at a revenue \nsurplus.\n  It just seems to me that we ought to be debating how to give back the \nmoney to the people rather than taking these resources from the people. \nI do not object to amendments. I do not object to a UC which would \nallow further amendments. Very seldom do we have bills here where we \nget it right the first time. I think it is good to have debate on these \nissues. I think it is good that the studies be brought forward. It is \ngood that the people have an opportunity to see exactly what the \ncommunity has been able to decide when it has observed the facts, the \nreality of situations not only here but in other settings.\n  It is with that in mind, I believe it is important to move forward \nwith the amendments, like that of the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from New Mexico which would abolish the marriage penalty, to \nsay to those families, ``We want you to be able to have the kind of \nright to deploy your own resources rather than have Government spend \nthe money. And we don't think we should penalize you because you have \ninvolved yourself in the durable, lasting commitments that form the \nbasis of the family,'' the most important institution in our culture.\n  So it is with that in mind that I have risen to criticize this bill \nand to unmask it. This bill is substantial. It has more pages than the \naverage person probably reads, more pages than the average Senator \nreads. And reading this bill is important. It is in here that you find \nout about the Federal programs that are tucked away, the mandated \nspending for the States. It is in here that you find out about the kind \nof special limitations that were to be provided to the cigarette \ncompanies in terms of their liability. If you care so much about the \nchildren, why limit the amount of money in damages that tobacco \ncompanies would have to pay in? Why provide them with a special \nsanctuary?\n  It is this bill that deserves our consideration. It is in here that \nyou find the massive tax increases and the spending on new and other \nprograms. I believe we ought to add to this that if we are going to \nhave taxes, we will give the taxes back by way of saying, as the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico have said in their \nproposal, the marriage penalty ought to be abolished for individuals \nmaking $50,000 or less. I would abolish it for all individuals. And, \nfrankly, I am going to continue offering amendments about the way to \nspend the money, not to\n\n[[Page S5616]]\n\nspend it through Government but to send this money back to the American \npeople. They earned it. They should have the opportunity to spend it. \nThe idea, ``You send it; we spend it,'' being the slogan of this place \nis a bad idea. It should be, ``You earned it; we returned it.''\n  It is not wasted on me that the cloture motion was filed when the \ndebate on the marriage penalty got going. A lot of people don't want to \nunmask the policy of this country that we penalize people for being \nmarried. A lot of people don't want to debate the issue of whether we \nshould have all these new programs or whether we should give people the \nmoney back that they earned and we took from them merely because they \nwere married.\n  I do not blame people for not wanting to reveal if they are against \nwanting to give the American people their money back, that if the \nAmerican people learn we are taking their money simply because they are \nmarried, that we have the opportunity to give it back but we would \nrather give it back to programs here in Washington or even overseas. \nThat is an embarrassment. It is no wonder individuals want cloture \nfiled and feel we should shut down debate.\n  I do not want to shut down debate, but we should move forward with \ntax relief for the American people, and we should be very reluctant \nabout imposing $885 billion of new taxes in the name of programs for \nwhich it is accordingly suggested that somehow young people will not \nbegin smoking.\n\n  The idea young people start smoking at 3,000 a day--it may be true. \nIf we can believe the studies at the University of Chicago, the \nUniversity of Maryland, Cornell University, if we can believe the \nexperience of California, Canada, the United Kingdom, the kinds of \nthings they have talked about in these taxes here that are involved in \nthis bill will not make a difference.\n  The truth of the matter is, the academic studies of thousands, tens \nof thousands, hundreds of thousands, indicate that to talk about taxes \nmaking a big difference in youth smoking is overstated. And these are \nnot studies by interest groups; these are studies by the National \nCancer Institute; these are studies by the University of Maryland, the \nUniversity of Chicago, Cornell University.\n  So it is time for us to understand this debate is about taxes. It is \na debate about Government--big taxes, big Government; massive taxes, \nmassive Government.\n  We are not even making illegal the possession of cigarettes for \nchildren in the District of Columbia. If we thought that was really \nimportant, we could add that to this bill. No; that has not been done. \nWe just simply make it possible for Government to grow. No wonder \npeople are uncomfortable, especially when there is a proposal that says \nwe could allow families to grow by returning the money to families and \nstop penalizing them just for having the durable commitment, the \nlasting bond that comes when people are married and are now penalized \nfor that in our Tax Code. This would be an opportunity, according to \nthe plan of the Senators from New Mexico and Texas, to alleviate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, the Senator from Missouri \nstates that there are many studies and documents that indicate that \nincreasing the price of a pack of cigarettes will not have an effect on \nkids smoking.\n  Let me refer him to the people who know it best, the absolute \nultimate experts on the cost of a pack of cigarettes in America--the \ntobacco companies. I say to the Senator from Missouri, in the documents \nrevealed by the tobacco companies themselves, a Philip Morris document:\n\n       In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that \n     price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of \n     teenagers. . ..\n\n  I hope that the Senator from Missouri would read from the documents \nthat the tobacco companies themselves had to disclose because of court \norder.\n  Philip Morris: The following quotes are from a Philip Morris 1981 \ndocument based on the company's review of research by the National \nBureau of Economic Research on the impact of price on tobacco use. \nBecause of the quality of the work, the prestige and objectivity of the \nNational Bureau of Economic Research has not changed in 30 years. I \nthink we need to take seriously their statement that, ``If future \nreductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase in Federal excise \ntax is a potent policy to accomplish this goal.''\n\n       In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that \n     price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of \n     teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and \n     balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the \n     federal excise tax on cigarettes.\n\n  Philip Morris, in a quote from a 1987 document: Philip Morris laments \nthe teen smokers that it lost due to price increases.\n\n       You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey \n     Harris of MIT calculated . . . the 1982 and 1983 round of \n     price increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and \n     prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. Those \n     teenagers are now 18 to 21 years old, and 35 percent of older \n     smokers smoke a PM brand. This means that 700,000 of those \n     adult quitters have been PM smokers and 420,000 of the \n     nonsmokers would have been PM smokers.\n\n  A 1982 RJR document, on the tobacco industry's analysis that price \nincreases have a significant impact on youth smoking: This analysis \nactually calculates the number of new smokers lost among kids as young \nas 13 years old, and every other age between 13 and 18, if prices are \nincreased. Philip Morris--the chief financial officer for Philip \nMorris, less than a year ago, told everyone involved in the tobacco \nindustry negotiations that, ``Children are three times more price \nresponsive than adults.''\n  That is the chief financial officer for Philip Morris.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, in its 1998 report, ``Taking Action \nto Reduce Tobacco Use''--the Institute of Medicine and the National \nAcademy of Sciences concluded that ``the single most direct and \nreliable method for reducing consumption is to increase the price of \ntobacco products, thus encouraging the cessation and reducing the \nlevel. . ..''\n  This list goes on and on. I know the Senator from West Virginia was \nhere a second ago and wants to talk.\n  The 1994 Surgeon General's report preventing tobacco use among young \npeople--now, the Surgeon General is fairly well respected--reached the \nconclusion that increases in the real price of cigarettes significantly \nreduce cigarette smoking, and that the young people are at least as \nprice sensitive as adults.\n  The 1998 Surgeon General's report issued within the last month agrees \nwith this conclusion.\n  What is important, though, really, are the tobacco companies \nthemselves. I say if you can believe anybody, maybe you might believe \nthe people who are in the business of enticing kids to smoke.\n  Brown & Williamson:\n\n       The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for \n     starting, their brand preferences as well as the starting \n     behavior of children as young at five years old. The studies \n     examined younger smokers' attitudes toward addiction, \n     containing multiple references as to how very young smokers \n     first believe they cannot become addicted only to later \n     discover to their regret, that they are.\n\n  Brown & Williamson:\n\n       . . . nicotine is addictive. We are then in the business of \n     selling nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the release \n     of stress mechanism.\n\n  RJR consultant:\n\n       Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both \n     habituating and unique in its variety of physiological \n     actions.\n\n  I won't go on except to summarize again from the Philip Morris \ndocument:\n\n       In any event, for whatever reason, it is clear that price \n     has a pronounced effect on the smoking preference of \n     teenagers.\n\n  I imagine there are studies that the Senator from Missouri could \nproduce to which he referred.\n  The people who are the final experts on this are the people who sold \nit to the kids. And they know, and we all know, that it is price \nsensitive as far as kids smoking is concerned. To think otherwise flies \nin the face of the overwhelming body of evidence, not only in the words \nof the tobacco companies, but the Surgeon General of the United States \nof America.\n  We want to call it a tax, call it a tax. Don't say it isn't going to \naffect kids\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\nsmoking, because the overwhelming body of evidence says that it does. \nEverybody is entitled to their opinion but not everybody is entitled to \nthe facts.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, earlier this week, I spoke of a \nresolution on China that I introduced and that we will offer as an \namendment as soon as there is a vehicle to work with, I think probably \nnext week--certainly before the President's visit to China. I wanted to \nbriefly summarize it. Let me just say that I am really pleased to have \nthe support of Senator Lugar, Senator Durbin, Senator Leahy and Senator \nFeingold, and I think there will be very strong bipartisan support for \nthis, what will be an amendment.\n  The focus is on human rights conditions in China and Tibet. Let me \njust say I don't come to the floor in a spirit of bashing our \nPresident. Since our President will be the first head of state of our \ncountry to visit China since the 1989 crackdown where really students--\nI see pages here--young people your age were murdered, gave their \nlives, and for the ``crime'' of just simply calling for the country to \nbe a democracy, I wish the President would not go to Tiananmen Square. \nI think that is a mistake. My worry is that regardless of what \nstatements the President makes about human rights in China--and I hope \nhe will make some powerful statements--the symbolism of visiting that \nvery sacred place where students were murdered will overwhelm \neverything else and will be taken, will be used by the Government or \nwill be interpreted by people in China as reflecting a kind of carte \nblanche support of the Government. I think that would be a mistake.\n  Now, I want to refer to the State Department's China country report \nthis past year on human rights and practices. This is not my report. \nThis is our own State Department report.\n\n       The Government continues to commit widespread and well \n     documented human rights abuses in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms stemming from the authorities' \n     intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or \n     inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms.\n\n  I think the Assistant Secretary of State, John Shattuck, who has \nfocused on human rights, has really done some magnificent work, and I \nthink this State Department report is extremely important.\n  What we are going to call on the President to do in our amendment--\nand we will have a vote on it next week. I think it is terribly \nimportant the Senate go on record before the President's visit, because \nthe President is going to visit China. Whether Senators think he should \nor not, the President is going to visit. I personally think it is not \nunimportant to be having a discussion with the Government there. I am \nnot opposed to a discussion. But the question is what kind of \ndiscussion, what kind of visit, and what does the President say.\n  At the very minimum, we are going to call upon the President to \nsecure from China's leaders a pledge to remove by a certain date the \nnames on the official reentry black list, which now contains the names \nof more than 50 Chinese living in the United States who cannot return \nto China because of their advocacy of democracy and freedom. In other \nwords, there are some people in our country who think the fact that Wei \nJingsheng, who was released from prison, is now in our country, exiled \nin our country is a sign he has his freedom. I doubt any American would \nfeel he or she was free if they were exiled from our country and told, \nif you come back to the United States, you will be immediately \narrested. That hardly represents freedom. So we want to make sure that \nby a certain date the Chinese Government removes these names on this \nofficial reentry blacklist.\n\n  Second of all, that the President--and let me emphasize this. I \nemphasized it this morning--visit family members of the victims of the \n1989 massacre, many of whom still suffer from political harassment, \ndiscrimination, or persecution.\n  I will say in this Chamber: Mr. President, if you are going to visit \nChina, I hope you don't go to Tiananmen Square. I hope you will give \nsome forceful speeches on human rights, but at the very minimum you \ncould convey a very powerful message to the world, to people in China, \nto the Chinese Government, and to these families if you would visit the \nfamily members, or some of the family members of victims of the 1989 \nmassacre, many of whom today suffer from political harassment and \ndiscrimination and persecution. I think that would be a powerful \nmessage. I believe the President should do this.\n  Third of all, I think the President absolutely has to urge Chinese \nleaders to engage in a meaningful dialog with the Dalai Lama, with the \naim of establishing genuine cultural and religious autonomy in Tibet. \nIn the past year, matters have only gotten worse in Tibet. No one is \narguing to the contrary. No one is arguing to the contrary.\n  The President must call upon China to revise its vague, draconian \nsecurity laws, including the provisions on ``endangering state \nsecurity,'' which were added to the criminal code in March of 1997; and \nrelease unconditionally all political, religious, and labor activists \ndetained for their peaceful, nonviolent involvement. In other words, it \nis important to understand, when someone like Wei is released, that \nreleasing some individuals doesn't deal with 2,000 political prisoners \nthat you have in prison. That doesn't deal with all sorts of prisoners \nin forced labor camps. The President has to call upon the Chinese \nGovernment to live up to basic human rights standards--that is where \nour country should be; that is what we should stand for--and review the \nsentences of more than 2,000 who have been convicted of so-called \ncounterrevolutionary crimes with a view toward granting full amnesty.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today because it is the \nanniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square, and I think it is \nreally important that we speak up. I think the Chinese Government would \nlike nothing more than for Americans not to speak up. I think the \nChinese Government would like for the world to forget what happened. We \ncannot. But above and beyond that, I do not want this just to be \ndramatic in the worst way or symbolic. I think what the President can \ndo if he is going to visit China is not go to Tiananmen Square, \ncertainly visit the families of the victims of Tiananmen Square, and \ncertainly give some powerful speeches and statements while in China \nwhich call upon the Chinese Government to release people who are in \nprison for having committed no other crime than to speak out for \ndemocracy and freedom; for the President to say to the Government of \nChina--frankly, we should be saying it to governments all over the \nworld that do this--you cannot persecute people because of their \nreligious practice or because of their political viewpoint. We have to \nbe on the side of human rights throughout the world. I really hope that \nnext week, if not tomorrow--the first opportunity I get I will bring \nthis amendment to the floor --we would get very strong support for this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Nevada is here, and I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank my colleague \nfrom Minnesota for his unfailing courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might speak as if in \nmorning business for a period of time not to exceed 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bryan pertaining to the submission of S.

Mr. President, the Senate debate on this landmark youth \nsmoking reduction bill began more than two weeks ago. The time for \ndebate on this legislation is rapidly drawing to a close. Each of us \nhas had ample opportunity to state our views. The Senate should commit \nto a vote on final passage within a week. We owe it to our children who \nare being entrapped into a life of addiction and premature death by the \ntobacco industry every day.\n  The opponents of this legislation have used every parliamentary tool \nat their disposal to extend the debate and to divert attention to \nunrelated issues. They want to talk about every subject but the impact \nof smoking on the nation's health. However, the real issue cannot be \nobscured by their verbal smokescreen. It is time for us to move from \ntalking to voting.\n  Each day that the opponents delay final Senate passage of this bill, \n3,000 more children begin to smoke. A third of these children will die \nprematurely from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, or other \nsmoking-caused illnesses.\n  Each day that we delay, the price of a pack of cigarettes will \ncontinue to be affordable to the nation's children, and more and more \nof them will take up this deadly habit.\n  Each day that we delay, Big Tobacco will continue to target children \nwith billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that \npromise popularity, excitement, and success for young men and women who \nstart smoking.\n  Each day that we delay, millions of nonsmokers will be exposed to \nsecondhand smoke. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \nsecondhand smoke causes 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths each year in \nthe United States--more than all other regulated hazardous air \npollutants combined. Secondhand smoke is also responsible for as many \nas 60 percent of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young \nchildren.\n  Each day that we delay, tobacco will remain virtually the only \nproduct manufactured for human consumption that is not subject to \nFederal health and safety regulations, despite the fact that it causes \nover 400,000 deaths a year. In fact, Kraft Cheese is more heavily \nregulated than Marlboro cigarettes, although both are manufactured by \nPhilip Morris.\n  With so much at stake for so many of our children, it is truly \nirresponsible for the opponents of this legislation to practice the \npolitics of obstruction. Let the Senate vote.\n  There are two pending amendments before us today--the Gramm amendment \non the marriage penalty and the Durbin-DeWine amendment on the youth \nsmoking reduction lookback. I would like to address each of them in \nturn.\n  The pending amendment by the Senator from Texas seeks to divert $52 \nbillion over the next 5 years away from smoking prevention, away from \nsmoking cessation, away from medical research, and away from \nreimbursing states. He proposes to take 80 percent of all the money \nraised by the cigarette price increase and use it for unrelated tax \ncuts. No funds would be left for programs which are essential to \nreducing youth smoking and to helping current smokers quit.\n  By offering such an amendment, the Senator from Texas shows his true \nintent. It is he who wants to convert this legislation from a youth \nsmoking prevention bill into a piggybank for unrelated projects. \nAlthough he has complained that the tobacco bill is a piggybank that \nDemocrats are using to fund new programs, in fact it is the Gramm \namendment which would hog 80 percent of the money taking resources \nwhich are needed to prevent young Americans from beginning to smoke and \nto help current smokers overcome their addiction. These numbers speak \nfor themselves. This tax cut was not designed to help working \nfamilies--it was intended to destroy the underlying smoking prevention \nlegislation.\n  The criticism of the Gramm amendment has been so strong and so \nwidespread that even the sponsor has agreed to reduce the size of the \nproposed moneygrab. Under his new proposal, he only wants to take one-\nthird of the revenue generated in the first 5 years and one-half of the \nmoney in succeeding years. That would amount to approximately $60 \nbillion over a 10-year period. It would still cripple the \nsmoking prevention and cessation efforts which are essential to \neffectively reducing youth smoking.\n\n  All of the money raised by the cigarette price increase contained in \nthe legislation is currently earmarked for smoking related purposes: 22 \npercent is directed to smoking prevention and cessation, 22 percent is \nto be used for medical research, 16 percent is for transitional \nassistance for tobacco farmers, and 40 percent is to compensate states \nfor the cost of medical treatment of smoking related illnesses. There \nit is, Mr. President.\n  Which of these smoking related initiatives would the Senator from \nTexas eliminate? Does he propose to eliminate all compensation to the \nStates for their tobacco related health costs? After all, it was the \nState lawsuits which provided the genesis for this legislation and \nwhich exposed the most dramatic evidence of industry wrongdoing. That \nwould not be fair. Even if every dollar intended for the States was \ntaken to fund the Gramm amendment, it would not be enough to cover the \ncost.\n  Does he propose to eliminate all transition assistance for tobacco \nfarmers and communities? It would not even cover one-third of the cost \nof the Gramm amendment.\n  All of the remaining dollars are directed to smoking prevention, to \nsmoking cessation, and to medical research. These initiatives are the \nheart of the legislation. If we are serious about stopping children \nfrom smoking and saving lives from tobacco-induced diseases, we have to \nmake these investments. Would the Senator from Texas propose that we \ntake money from these programs and use it to fund an unrelated tax cut \ninstead? How can we in good conscience raise the price of cigarettes \nand then refuse to fund programs which will address the evils of \nsmoking? These programs work. Let me give you a few examples:\n  Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant \nwoman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care \nfor low-birthweight babies. The effect of the Gramm amendment would be \nto reduce funds for these programs, and that makes no sense.\n  The Gramm amendment would take funds intended to assist states and \ncommunities to conduct educational programs on the health dangers of \nsmoking. The tobacco industry spends $5 billion a year--$5 billion--on \nadvertising to encourage young people to smoke. Shouldn't we spend at \nleast one tenth of that amount to counteract the industry's lethal \nmessage?\n  Counteradvertising is a key element of an effective tobacco control \nstrategy. We know that if children are easily swayed by the tobacco \nindustry's marketing campaigns, which promise popularity, excitement, \nand success for those who take up smoking, we can reverse the damage by \ndeglamorizing the use of tobacco among children with \ncounteradvertising.\n  Both Massachusetts and California have demonstrated that paid \ncounteradvertising can cut smoking rates. It helped reduce cigarette \nuse in Massachusetts by 17 percent between 1992 and 1996, or three \ntimes the national average. Smoking by junior high students dropped 8 \npercent, while the rest of the nation has seen an increase. In \nCalifornia, a counteradvertising campaign also reduced smoking rates by \n15 percent over the last 3 years.\n  The Gramm amendment also would take money from law enforcement \nefforts to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, even though \nyoung people currently spend $1 billion a year to buy tobacco products \nillegally.\n  The Gramm amendment will diminish funding for medical research on \ntobacco-related diseases, which kill 400,000 Americans each year and \nincapacitates millions more. Given the\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\ndamage that smoking inflicts on the nation's public health, it make \nlittle sense to divert tobacco revenues to tax cuts when they could be \ndirected to finding a cure for cancer and other tobacco-induced \nillnesses. Since tobacco induced disease costs America $130 billion per \nyear, it certainly is not cost effective to reduce research spending.\n  In essence, the Gramm amendment would destroy much of the public \nhealth benefit this legislation is designed to achieve. It would be a \ntragic mistake.\n  The goal of eliminating the marriage penalty for low and moderate \nincome families is a worthy one. It is shared on both sides of the \naisle. However, it must be accomplished in a way that does not imperil \nour primary goal--preventing youth smoking and helping smokers overcome \ntheir addiction.\n  I anticipate that an alternative amendment will be offered which will \nprovide relief from the marriage penalty without imperiling our smoking \nprevention efforts. It will cost far less than the Gramm amendment, and \nit will do a much better job of targeting tax relief to those most in \nneed.\n\n  That is the difference between preserving a viable youth smoking \nreduction effort and destroying it. That is the difference between \nhelping millions of smokers quit and leaving them at the mercy of their \naddiction. That is the difference between advancing medical research \nthat can cure tobacco induced diseases and indefinitely delaying it.\n  The second issue I want to address is the Durbin-DeWine look-back \namendment. It will assess increased sums for noncompliance with the \nyouth smoking reduction targets. In addition, the emphasis will be \nshifted from industry-wide assessments to company-by-company \nassessments, in order to more effectively deter individual tobacco \ncompanies from marketing their products to children.\n  Big Tobacco knows how to hook children into a lifetime of nicotine \naddiction and smoking-related illnesses--whether appealing through \ncharacters like Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man, through the prominent \nplacement of tobacco advertising, or through a strategic cut in \ncigarette prices. And Big Tobacco also knows how to stop appealing to \nchildren.\n  The purpose of the look-back is to give tobacco companies an \noverwhelming financial incentive to turn their focus away from the \nyouth market. Our goal is to influence every business decision by \ntaking the profit away from addicting teenagers.\n  The Durbin-DeWine amendment will accomplish that goal much more \neffectively than the current look-back provisions in the manager's \namendment. It will substantially increase the total amount of the \nsurcharges which companies must pay if youth smoking levels do not \ndecline in accordance with the reduction targets. It also shifts the \npayment obligations from a predominately industrywide system to a \npredominately company-specific system. This will dramatically increase \nthe deterrent influence of the look-back on company policy.\n  The current McCain provision provides for a maximum industrywide \npenalty of $4 billion, or about 20 cents a pack. The company-specific \nportion is extremely small, amounting to only a few pennies per pack. \nThe Durbin-DeWine amendment provides for substantial company-specific \npenalties, which in the aggregate could reach $5 billion per year if \ncompanies continue to flaunt the law and blatantly target children. The \namendment also provides for an industrywide surcharge of up to $2 \nbillion a year.\n  Through this important amendment we are speaking to the tobacco \ncompanies in the only language they understand--money. If they continue \nto target children, these companies will pay a financial price far in \nexcess of the profits raised from addicting children.\n  But if they are willing to cooperate in efforts to prevent teenage \nsmoking, the companies may never have to pay a dollar of look-back \nsurcharges. A strong, company-specific look-back, such as the one we \nare proposing, will give the tobacco companies a powerful financial \nincentive to use their skill in market manipulation to further, rather \nthan undermine, the public interest in reducing youth smoking.\n  Each tobacco company must be held accountable for its actions on \nteenage smoking. The stakes involved are nothing less than the health \nof the Nation's children. For each percentage point that the tobacco \nindustry misses the target, 55,000 children will begin to smoke. One-\nthird of these children will die prematurely from smoking-induced \ndiseases.\n  This bipartisan amendment deserves the support of the full Senate, \nand I urge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  These two issues--the marriage penalty and the look-back--should be \nresolved quickly. Once they are decided, there is little excuse for \nfurther delay. The remaining amendments can be considered in a few days \nif we move conscientiously forward. There is no valid reason why the \nSenate cannot vote on final passage by the middle of next week. If we \ndo not, the American people will know why. A small group of willful \ndefenders of the tobacco industry will have succeeded in obstructing \nthe work of the Senate on this vital issue of public health. On an \nissue of this importance, which is literally a matter of life and \ndeath, our constituents will not tolerate such obstruction. Now is the \ntime for the Senate to act.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I want to just take a couple minutes to \nexpress my respects for Senator Barry Goldwater. I was unable to attend \nthe services yesterday with Senators. I was just getting over a very \nbad chest cold, and I decided that I would try to recoup a little here. \nI wish I could have been there.\n  Senator Goldwater was obviously an unflinching patriot whose life, in \nmany ways, mirrored the American experience. He was rugged, \nindependent, and unarguably his own man.\n  I am deeply saddened by his passing. When I first arrived as a \nfreshman Senator, Senator Goldwater offered me encouragement, and when \nI became budget chairman, provided inspiration when I first tackled the \ntough budget issues we faced in the early 1980s.\n  He was a dedicated American and Senator, always willing to fight the \ntough battles. I was better for his fine support and his wise counsel.\n  ``Barry Goldwater cared deeply about America. He believed that our \nNation must always remain strong and that Government should stay off \nthe backs of our people and not stifle their innovative spirit. As an \nAmerican, he never shied away from honestly stating his beliefs; and as \na politician, he led by example, not by polls.\n  He will be greatly missed. And Nancy and I send our sympathies and \nprayers to his family.\n  U.S. Senator Barry Morris Goldwater, born in Phoenix AZ., Jan. 1, \n1909, was elected to the Senate from Arizona in 1952, and later was \ndefeated in his bid for the Presidency in 1964 by Lyndon Johnson. \nSenator Goldwater served in the Senate until retirement in 1987.\n  I served with Senator Goldwater. He took me under his wing when I \nfirst arrived in the Senate, and he was a good counsel.\n  The first year I was the chairman of the Budget Committee was 1981.\n  After the Senate finished the budget bill Senator Goldwater sent me a \nletter that I would like to have printed in the Record.\n  He would dictate these notes himself and they sound just like him.\n  He was an inspiration to us all and a very, very fine man. He will be \nmissed.\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter that I cherish \nfrom Senator Goldwater after my first appearance on the floor managing \nthe budget bill be printed in the Record.\n  In his own manner, he would go back to the office frequently and \ndictate a brief letter. This is one of those, which he gave to me in \n1981, as I started down this long process trying to balance the U.S. \nbudget. He gave me a little encouragement and enthusiasm. I thought it \nmight be good to just show what kind of person he was to younger \nSenators like myself back in 1981, along with all the things I wanted \nto say.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 3, 1981.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete: When your class came into the Senate something \n     inside of me said, this could be the best that every came \n     along since you've been here. As I watched all of you develop \n     through the years, nothing has happened to change that \n     original opinion.\n       Your handling of the budget bill was done in a superb \n     manner, probably as well done as any I have ever listened to \n     and that includes some real old pros. You did a wonderful job \n     with it Pete. I am proud of you and I am going to watch your \n     future with a great deal of interest. You are going to go a \n     long way.\n           With pride and best wishes,\n     Barry Goldwater.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5619-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5620-S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know where the bill before the \nSenate goes next, but obviously I have joined with Senator Gramm in \ntrying to make a statement about this bill. In the process of trying to \ndo that, there are many ways to make statements and there are many ways \nto talk about what is in a bill, what is out of it, what is not in the \nbill, to argue about what its value is, what its ultimate goal is, and \nwhat it might achieve.\n  There is another way, and that is to offer an amendment or \namendments. There are a lot of amendments pending. As I indicated, I \ndon't know how many of them are serious. I have five or six myself that \nI think are serious that in due course I will offer. I would like to \ndiscuss, from the standpoint of those who are wondering about the \nGramm-Domenici amendment to cut taxes on a very deserving group of \nAmericans, what it is all about.\n  When you raise taxes on anybody in the United States, you have to ask \nyourself a very fundamental question of what you ought to do with the \ntaxes you raise. Now, if America were undertaxed and we were taxing \nAmericans--be it a cigarette tax that at $1.10 a pack would yield over \ntime $750 to $800 billion, or whether it is an income tax or sales \ntax--you have to ask yourself, if America is being taxed too much \nalready, shouldn't something very high on the list of considerations \nfor what to do with the increased revenue be a consideration of \nlowering the taxes on Americans?\n  Obviously, there have been some arguments already, and there will be \nmore about the amendment which we offered which, hopefully, will be \nmodified, that says let's give back some of the taxes we pick up here \nto Americans who are suffering the penalty of a Tax Code that punishes \npeople for being married and earning a living by both spouses working. \nFor they, in most cases, pay more in taxes than if they both had the \nidentical jobs, at the same annual earnings, and were not married and \nfiling separate returns--one of the most onerous, ill-conceived uses of \nthe Tax Code.\n  How in the world can we run around, as policymakers, and say we favor \nthe family and then add a burden of taxation to spouses, who are part \nof a family, by taxing them more because they are married and working \nthan if they were single and working? That has to be an absolutely \nabsurd policy in light of the problems we have in this country that are \nfamily oriented, and many of them have to do with income of families.\n  Secondly, it is obvious that every cent of a cigarette tax that we \nall of a sudden came up with and has been debated on the floor as a tax \nthat should be $1.10, maybe $1.50, maybe 75 cents, and then for \nsomebody to come to the floor and assume that whatever the level is, \nevery penny of it ought to be spent for new programs--now, that isn't \nthe way it is said; it is said, new programs to do some great things.\n  Well, I think everything the Government tries to do and spends money \non ought to be things we really believe are important things, important \naspects, important events, important projects. Now we are reinventing a \nbunch of new ones, and then we are saying to the States: You spend your \nmoney in very specific ways.\n  I don't care who agreed to the ways that we are going to send this \nmoney back to the States to be spent, it seems to me the question has \nto be asked first, How much is needed to direct a program that has a \nprobability of success in terms of making our young people alter their \nsmoking habits and quit smoking? And nobody can say that you need a \nhuge portion of this tax bill to run advertisements on that, to have \nprograms in our schools or wherever to try to inhibit that. That can't \ncome close to spending the amount of money that is in this bill.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is my first speech in a couple of \ndays. I am sorry. I will yield soon. In fact, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, the point is that nobody can stand up on this floor \nand say we knew when we started talking about cigarette taxes and how \nmuch it would yield precisely how much ought to be spent for some \nAmerican programs that would help alleviate the smoking problem, or \neven research more into the cause of cancer and try to cure it. Nobody \nknows what is the right number, but everybody knows that as much money \nas this bill will raise is not needed for that.\n  Anybody in their right mind would look at how much is coming in and \nhow much you need to do precisely the kind of things that people say \nthis bill ought to do, and it is not close to the amount of money that \nis coming in. So that leads you to a conclusion, in my humble opinion, \nthat you ought to give some of this money back to the taxpayers of the \ncountry.\n  I cannot believe we are so unconcerned about the taxpayers of this \ncountry that we would sort of block off this $700 billion in new \nrevenues--if that is what it is over 25 years--and say, look, the \nAmerican people and their tax-paying requirements have nothing to do \nwith this new tax imposed on them. Why not? Why do we say that? We are \nadding to the tax ``take,'' and we give no benefit to the American \npeople for these new taxes we are going to raise.\n  Back to my argument. One way to try to send a message and distinguish \nbetween various approaches, which I choose to call tax and spend it \nall, or another group who would say tax and give some of it back to the \nAmerican people who already feel, in many instances--and they are \nright--that they are paying too much in taxes.\n  Now, that is why the Gramm-Domenici amendment is important. I have \nalready stated its precise purpose is to try to ameliorate the negative \ntax treatment on married couples, both of whom work, from a Tax Code \nwhich penalizes that versus the same two people making the same amount \nof money, but not married, and are part of a family--they pay less.\n  So the purpose is good, but the message is completely different. The \nmessage is, when you have this much new revenue, shouldn't you give \nsome of it back to the taxpayers of America? Nobody is going to be able \nto come to this floor, with our ability to proliferate in producing \ncharts, and tell the American people with any credibility that every \nsingle dollar coming in on this tax has a nice precise niche that it \nshould be spent for, all of which is aimed at helping to try to get \nkids to stop smoking cigarettes. Or I am willing to add one--doing \nresearch and trying to prevent the diseases that come from smoking. \nTake the two together and you could not produce a credible chart \nshowing how every penny in this bill must be spent for that or you are \nnot doing your job.\n\n  So I believe that, sooner or later, we deserve an opportunity to have \nan up-or-down vote on the proposition that I have just described here \ntoday. It is very simple. One, do you think you should change the Tax \nCode as it pertains to the marriage tax penalty and\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\nhelp families and married couples out who are being penalized because \nof this Tax Code? And, two, do you think that, with this large new tax \nbeing imposed, you ought to give about a third of it back to the \ntaxpayers of this country? We want the public to just focus, very \nsimply, on those two issues.\n  This bill will permit us to do both. I have no doubt, Mr. President, \nthat what is left over is more than adequate. In fact, I am not sure I \nwould vote to spend all of the money that is left over for the program \ndescribed in this bill. Nonetheless, that is not at issue with \nreference to the Gramm-Domenici amendment.\n  The issue is a simple proposition: Do you think the marriage tax \npenalty ought to be fixed? Secondly, do you think when you have this \nhuge new tax increase, you ought to give some of it back to the \nAmerican people? We want to vote on that. That is a way of \ndistinguishing between the feelings of various Senators about a new tax \nbill that is essentially, in its current form, tax and spend versus \nanother approach that says tax--which may be helpful, we are not sure--\nand give some of it back to the American people. Under that is the very \ninteresting proposition that there probably is no fairer thing to do \nwith better, positive American policy than to fix the marriage tax \npenalty while you are at it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am interested to hear these comments by \nSenator Domenici. Just a short time ago--a month ago--Senator Coverdell \nproposed an amendment on the budget resolution that would have repealed \nthe marriage penalty or marriage tax, and a budget point of order was \nlodged against it. The Senator from New Mexico, apparently, for reasons \nthat are not clear, voted against waiving the Budget Act. Now the \nSenator from New Mexico will say that he didn't want to waive the \nBudget Act. The fact is that if the Budget Act had been waived, the \nmarriage penalty would have been repealed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. That is a fact. That is what the vote was on the \nbudget resolution. It was not carried by a vote. It was rejected 38-62; \n38 Republicans felt strongly that the marriage tax should be repealed. \nThose who voted against it were Senators Bond, Chafee, Coats, Cochran, \nCollins, D'Amato, DeWine, Domenici, Gorton, Grassley, Hagel, Jeffords, \nLugar, Mack, Snowe, Specter, and Stevens.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter sent to Senator Lott and Senator \nDaschle. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: As the Senate continues to \n     consider tobacco legislation, the nation's Governors want to \n     make clear that we will oppose any amendments that would \n     effectively reduce the $196.5 billion in tobacco settlement \n     funds dedicated to states and territories to settle state \n     lawsuits. Naturally, the federal government is free to \n     prioritize how it will use those tobacco revenues generated \n     by S. 1415 not reserved for the states and territories--a \n     total that will exceed $300 billion over twenty-five years. \n     These federally prioritized uses of tobacco revenues, \n     however, must not cut into the state settlement pool.\n       If national tobacco legislation is intended to settle the \n     state and territories' lawsuits against the tobacco industry, \n     they must receive a portion of the new tobacco revenues \n     sufficient to resolve their claims. S. 1415 dedicates $196.5 \n     billion to the states and territories over twenty-five years, \n     a total consistent with the level negotiated by the state \n     attorneys general with the tobacco industry in the original \n     June 20, 1997, agreement. Preserving this state settlement \n     pool, free from federal recoupment efforts, is one of the \n     Governors' highest priorities related to S. 1415.\n       Reducing the size of the state tobacco settlement pool will \n     significantly jeopardize all states and territories, \n     including those that have individually settled their own \n     lawsuits. Such a decision would force the Governors to \n     reconsider our position on the state financing section of the \n     overall bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor George V.

King, Jr., State of Maine.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico clearly feels \nthat the money needs to go to the Federal Government. I feel, and I \nthink conservative Republicans feel, it should go back to the States \nwho incurred the expenses. If the Senator from New Mexico doesn't want \nthe money to go to the States, then he will continue to see two things \nhappen--the money never coming to the Federal Government because the \nStates will continue their lawsuits and the settlements--at least in \nthe last four States--of as much as $6.5 billion, as in the case of \nMinnesota; and none of that money will go to the Federal Government. \nNot a penny. The fact is that the money will go back to the States to \nrepay the huge tax bill they are paying now; $50 billion in citizens' \ntax dollars are going to pay, in the case of Medicare and Medicaid \nexpenses, for tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Now, there are some who want this to come to the Federal Government \nso that the appropriators and the Budget Committee can assign the funds \nto wherever they want. I want a significant amount of that money to go \nto the States. They are the ones who have been paying a big part of the \nbill. If the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Texas want to \nkill this bill, then there will be 37 States that go to court, \nbeginning the day after this legislation dies, and they will fight this \nout in court. They seem to win every time. They don't even go to a jury \ntrial, Mr. President.\n  The tobacco companies settle, and guess what they do? They agree to \nsmoking cessation programs and they agree to all the huge bureaucracies \nthat have been pointed out. They go to reimburse Medicaid expenses. \nThey pay for antitobacco advertising because the States that get the \nmoney believe that in order to stop kids from smoking, you don't just \nraise a tax--although that is important. You don't just raise revenue, \nbut you have to do other things as well.\n  So I hope my colleagues will pay attention to the letter from the 36 \nGovernors--I am sure the other 14 will be joining--as to how they feel \nabout legislation that doesn't repay them for the expenses that they \nincurred as a result of tobacco-related illnesses.\n  I see that my colleague from Massachusetts wants to speak as well. \nLet's dispense with this myth about this being a ``big tax bill.'' What \nit is is a much smaller tax bill than the tax bill that the American \npeople are already paying in the form of Medicare and Medicaid expenses \nin order to pay for tobacco-related illnesses. And with children \nsmoking going up, guess what, Mr. President? That tax bill goes up. It \nwill get bigger and bigger. So if you want to worry about big tax \nbills, there is a huge tax bill we are paying right now. We will be \npaying a much larger tax bill if this trend of kids smoking continues \nto grow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be very brief. I know the Senator from Oklahoma \nwants to speak momentarily. How long does he think he will go?\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I was going to speak for a few minutes. I feel that I \nwould like to respond to a couple of comments made by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be brief. I wanted to say for the \nRecord, so that the Record is absolutely clear here, the Senator from \nNew Mexico said that we are going to get a vote and we ought to be able \nto get a vote in order to properly allow the American people to receive \nback some of the money that is in this bill that he has charged is \nsomehow being very badly spent.\n  I think it is important to understand that, No. 1, the division of \nthe money, the revenues, that come in from this bill, was not arrived \nat in some sort of hasty or unthought-out way. It is not representative \nof a casual wish list. This is a reflection of what the Governors and \nthe settlements originally arrived at as a notion of those concerns \nthat ought to be addressed through any tobacco legislation.\n  Second, they are a reflection of the Commerce Committee that voted 19 \nto 1 to send this legislation to the floor with a framework that \narticulated the broad outlines of how money would be spent and, \nfinally, through a fairly arduous negotiation process which measured \nvery carefully the needs.\n  The Senator said he would challenge anybody to come to the floor and \nsuggest they could defend that every penny in here is being spent as \nwisely as possible. That is not a hard challenge to fail on. I am not \ngoing to try to do that, nor would anybody.\n  Can we find some money here appropriately to try to address the \nquestion of the tax cut? We said yes. That is not the debate here. This \nis not the choice that he presented to the Senate, a choice either \nbetween those who want to give something back to people who want to pay \na marriage penalty and those who do not. That is not the choice; it is \na choice between two different approaches to doing that. We believe \nthat we have the right to have an opportunity to have ours also voted \non, that they ought to be voted on at the same time. That is what the \ndivision is over here.\n  I think it is important to reflect on the fact that 40 percent of \nthese funds go back to the States in the most direct way, a reflection, \nI think, of the need of the Governors to be given the opportunity to \nmake decisions about how they can best deliver back their portion of \nthe Medicaid expenses, which is what we are refunding.\n  In addition to that, money is not just spent in a supercilious way, \nthe way the Senator suggested on a whole lot of Government programs \nthat do not already have a track record of accomplishment. Public \nhealth, NIH--I might say it was the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, \na Republican, together with Senator Frist, who fought very hard for the \nnotion that there ought to be adequate research funds here. NIH and \nresearch are 22 percent of these funds.\n  In addition to that, farmers--I think both sides are competing over \nhow to better take care of the farmers. That reflects some 16 percent \nof the expenditures, leaving you with only 22 percent that goes to \npublic health--22 percent--that is then divided among \ncounteradvertising, cessation programs, and other kinds of efforts to \ntry to reduce teenage smoking.\n  The Senator from Missouri was on the floor a little earlier, and he \nwas trying to suggest that there are alternative studies and the \nCanadian experience that somehow suggests an outcome different from \nwhat we get by raising the price here.\n  I simply say for the record--very quickly, because I don't want to \ntie the Senate up now--that I know we want to have a vote, that the \nmethodology of the Cornell study that he referred to was very \nspecifically found flawed, and it was found flawed both in the number \nof people that they examined and the manner that they examined them. \nWhen that flaw was corrected for the appropriate acknowledgment of that \nflaw, in fact, the Cornell study came out consistent with almost all \nother studies with respect to the impact of price on smoking.\n  It is interesting to me that those who want to come to the floor and \ncriticize the relationship of price to discouraging kids from smoking \ncompletely choose to ignore all of the memoranda of the tobacco \ncompanies themselves, that for 20 years have said they know they lose \nsmokers when the price goes up. Their own memoranda say it. You can't \nhave it both ways, it seems to me. The fact is, there is a correlation.\n  On the Canadian experience, the Canadians specifically, as they saw \nan increase in their price, there was a decrease in the amount of \nsmoking, and there was an equilibration ultimately between their prices \nand ours.\n  The Canadian experience, in fact, documents that the pattern of youth \nsmoking in Canada confirmed the sensitivity of youth to price changes. \nIn 1981, Canada had a youth smoking rate that was about 50 percent \nhigher than that in the United States. Over the next decade, they \nraised their prices by over 100 percent and teen smoking fell by almost \none-half.\n  Mr. President, we need to deal with the facts here. I hope that the \nSenate will do so as we vote over the course of the next days.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2438\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in an effort to move things forward, I move \nto table the Durbin amendment No. 2438, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Mississippi to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 29, nays 66, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 149 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--29\n\n     Allard\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n      \n     Lott\n      \n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Biden\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Specter\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2438) was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since the last amendment was not tabled, I \nask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated; that the \namendment be agreed to; and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, all without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2438) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2451 to Amendment No. 2437\n\n       (Purpose: To stop illegal drugs from entering the United \n     States, to provide additional\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\n     resources to combat illegal drugs, and to establish \n     disincentives for teenagers to use illegal drugs.)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk in the \nsecond degree, which is the so-called Coverdell-Craig drug amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for Mr. Coverdell, \n     for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2451 to amendment No. 2437.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I only do so to note to \nmy colleagues that this is the third Republican amendment now in a row. \nAnd I am hopeful we can continue to alternate back and forth, but I \nwill not object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thought we just voted on the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Was there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, pending now is the \ndrug amendment. I hope Senators will begin to debate this very \nimportant amendment. I know that there are very strong feelings on this \namendment also. However, no further votes will occur tonight. I expect \nthe debate on the amendment to continue through tomorrow's session.\n  The minority leader filed a cloture motion on the committee amendment \nearlier today. That cloture vote will occur on Tuesday, at a time to be \ndetermined after discussion between the two of us and after \nconsultation with others in terms of schedule. So there will be no \nvotes in Friday's session of the Senate.\n  However, Senator Daschle and I are looking at bills that are \nrelatively noncontroversial or noncontroversial that we may be able to \ntake up tomorrow during the day. And the vote would be scheduled in the \ngroup on Tuesday morning when we vote, at a time we will notify the \nMembers later on on Tuesday.\n  Now, again, I hope we can reach agreement tomorrow to provide for a \nvote on this amendment, hopefully prior to the cloture vote; but all \nSenators will be notified about the voting schedule. I urge the \nSenators who have been working on the marriage penalty tax to continue \nto work to get an agreement on that amendment so that we can have a \nvote on it. We will try to see if we can reach agreement perhaps to \nconsider another bill on Monday. But we will continue on amendments to \nthe tobacco bill beginning after the cloture vote is defeated on \nTuesday morning.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Does the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader noted that tentatively the vote, the \ncloture vote, is scheduled for Tuesday. There are only two ways that \ncould occur. One would be for us to seek unanimous consent for the vote \nto be postponed until Tuesday; or, secondly, that we are not in session \non Monday, which would then make Tuesday the next business day when the \ncloture vote would ripen.\n\n  I am hopeful that the majority leader and I can find a way with which \nto resolve the schedule that will accommodate both sides. So I hope \nthat perhaps we might tentatively announce that the vote will be held \non Tuesday, but certainly if we are in session, I am not prepared at \nthis point to agree to a unanimous consent request that would move it \nto Tuesday until we have been able to talk through the balance of the \nschedule.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond. I thought that Senator \nDaschle and I had talked about it and had an agreement that we would do \nit on Tuesday morning. I realize we have to get consent to do that. The \nalternative is, as he said, that we not be in session on Monday, which \nis, I guess, a possibility, but it is pretty hard to complain about not \nmaking progress when we are not in session working on something.\n  The other alternative is to come in at an early hour; and \napproximately an hour after that time, the vote occurs then, which \nmeans that the vote could be at 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, Monday afternoon, \nwhich, for Senators coming from California and Utah and Washington \nState, that presents a real problem because their planes do not get \nhere until about 4:30.\n  So I was hoping we could take that time Monday to make some progress \non some other issue or have debate on this issue and have the vote that \neverybody will be here for at 9:30. But it would be fine with me that \nwe have it earlier in the afternoon. But I just assume that both sides \nwill have problems with that. We will talk about it further, and we \nwill hotline the Members on exactly what time they can expect that \ncloture vote to occur.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would ask the majority leader if he intends to \nbring up the highway corrections bill, because if he does, I have an \namendment I would like to offer. It is a very simple amendment, very \ndirect amendment. And I cannot do that unless it is brought up.\n  Mr. LOTT. We would not bring it up without Members being on notice \nwho have an interest in it. That technical corrections bill does need \nto be done. I believe it is supported on both sides of the aisle and by \nthe administration. We need to get that done, and we would need to do \nit by unanimous consent. But if the Senator has reservations, he will \nbe notified about it. But we will get it done, and we would want to do \nit without a modification.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May I say to the majority leader, I also am very \nanxious to get it done, but in the spirit of being able to offer \namendments. And unless I am able to offer an amendment, I would have to \nobject to----\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to the Senator, it is important we get these \ntechnical corrections done, because some legitimate, honest mistakes \nwere made and several important projects could be affected. And we need \nto do it as soon as we can. But unless we can get unanimous consent, it \nwill not be done. It has already passed the House. So we will have to \nfind a way--I am working with Senators on our side, too, as I know \nSenators are working over there, to clear up concerns.\n  There are other ways to address those concerns. And we are trying to \nget that worked out. We need to get it done. We need to do it by \nunanimous consent. And I, in fact, have met with one Senator this \nafternoon and discussed how to address a legitimate concern he has. So \nwe will work with the chairman.\n  Did the chairman want to respond to this at all?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No. What I have been trying to do is narrow down the \nproblems that have come up. And I had down on the list to see the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. As you said, we want to get \nthis thing done. I think we can get it done and take care of problems \nby explaining them or getting to them in some fashion. So I look \nforward to meeting with the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now yield the floor so the manager of the \nbill can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just briefly, I would like to congratulate \nthe Senator from Illinois on the significant vote. In fact, a number of \nSenators experienced an epiphany late in the vote because of his \npersuasive powers. So I congratulate the Senator on his vote.\n  I just want to make it clear, Mr. President, we intend to move \nforward. We will have a vote on the Gramm amendment. We may have a \nDaschle amendment. I happen to think it is fair that we go back to what \nwe originally started doing--one amendment on either side. I think that \nis the fair way that most legislation has been conducted on the floor \nsince I have been here.\n  We intend to move forward. We intend to reach a conclusion. I hope \nthat\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\nboth the majority leader and Democratic leader will consider trying to \nbring this to closure next week. We have had now 2 weeks of extensive \ndebate and amending on the issues.\n  It seems to me outstanding are the tax issues that Senator Gramm and \nSenator Daschle may have; the issue of attorneys' fees is going to come \nback up, I believe; and, of course, then there is the agricultural \nissue outstanding. But aside from that, Mr. President, I do not think \nthere is a lot of new ground to be plowed. I think we need to move \nforward. I believe we will move forward. And I am still confident--I am \nstill confident--that we will bring this issue to conclusion sooner \nrather than later, to coin a phrase.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment before \nus, the amendment that has been offered by myself, Senator Craig from \nIdaho, and Senator Abraham from Michigan.\n  I will take just a few minutes to frame in general terms the purpose \nof this amendment. And then my colleague from Idaho will address the \namendment and outline its details.\n  My good friend from Idaho will not be here tomorrow so he will be \nmaking a major presentation this evening, and then tomorrow I will \nreturn to elaborate further on the amendment.\n  Let me first try to put it in focus. We are talking about teenage \naddiction, and have been for the last several months, specifically on \nthe floor, over 2 weeks. I have been struck by the fact that a major \npiece of legislation would be brought to the floor of the Senate, \nproposed by the administration, to deal with teenage problems, and \naddiction specifically, and be totally silent on the issue of drug \naddiction.\n  The majority of drug abuse among teenagers--the majority--is by \nsmoking, smoking marijuana, which is a more lethal and damaging drug \nthan tobacco. Yet, this legislation was silent on the issue.\n  The amendment is designed to end the silence. Teenage drug abuse is \nthe No. 1 teenage problem--No. 1 by any measurement, teenagers, their \nparents, or empirical evidence. For us to have dealt with this issue \nand to have remained silent would have been unconscionable.\n  If I can for a second outline the scope of the problem. In 1979, 14.1 \npercent, or 3.3 million teenagers age 12 to 17 were involved with \nconsistent drug abuse.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator for a clarification on his amendment, \nwhich I had a chance to read.\n  The Senator was kind enough to support my amendment to vote against \nthe motion to table and yet there is language in his amendment which \nsuggests that my amendment is made null and void by your new amendment.\n  Is that the Senator's intention?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No, it is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to clarify that. So the Senator still supports \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is not my intention, to obviate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is not your intention.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me continue, for the Nation to step forward with \nthe powerful will to drive down teenage drug abuse by two-thirds--two-\nthirds--for those people who think this is a problem for which nothing \ncan be done, I remind everyone listening that when the Nation decides \nto commit itself to resolving this drug epidemic, it can make headway. \nFor example, in 1979, 14.1 percent were using it. By 1992, it had been \ndriven down to 5.3 percent--2 million less youngsters were using drugs. \nBut then something went wrong, something has gone badly wrong.\n  Since 1992, drug abuse by this same class of teenagers has increased \n135 percent. I repeat, 135 percent. What does that mean? That means \nthat drug abuse has more than doubled since 1992. Drug abuse is now \naffecting 2 million teenagers. It has increased by over a million. This \nis a devastating indictment on contemporary drug policy in the United \nStates.\n  The Nation's will must be rejuvenated. This amendment will do that. \nWhen this administration took office, we quit talking and hearing about \ndrugs. The drug czar's office was collapsed. Gratefully, it has now \nbeen reopened. It was collapsed. The Coast Guard was diminished. \nInterdiction was cut in half. The country was flooded by drugs. The \nprice of these illicit drugs dropped by 50 to 80 percent, so they \nbecame accessible at every corner and to any school in the Nation. If \nyou don't believe that, just go to the school and ask the students. \nThey can tell you the designer names of the drugs. They can tell you \nexactly how long it takes, and it is usually no longer than 30 minutes.\n\n  So we should not be shocked that drug abuse is skyrocketing and is a \nnew epidemic among teenagers. It is even made more sad by the fact that \nin the 1960s and the 1970s, the last drug epidemic we suffered, higher-\naged teenagers, 15 to 20, were involved in the drug crisis. Now the \ntarget is age 8 to 14.\n  We have been asking the President repeatedly to set forth the goals \nof his administration during his administration to arrest this \nepidemic. The response is that they will lower drug use among teenagers \nback to the level at which they took office, 10 years from now, in the \nyear 2007, 2\\1/2\\ Presidencies away. Our goal is to get it back to \nwhere it was when they took office. This is unacceptable. We cannot \nwait 10 years.\n  So this amendment is a bold interdiction. It focuses on interdiction. \nIt improves the antinarcotic struggle by Customs, by DOD, Department of \nDefense, by DEA, by the FBI, by the Coast Guard. It dramatically \nincreases the funding of the interdiction budget. It stiffens penalties \nand it creates a communication program to communicate to parents and \nstudents about the dangers of the drug epidemic in which they live \ntoday.\n  It is our intention, myself and my coauthors, that whatever passes \nthe Senate, will have an antidrug component. It will not be silent on \nthe Nation's No. 1 problem for teenagers. That is unacceptable. It will \nbe an expression to reignite the Nation around the will to confront \nthis epidemic and these narcotic mafia who are the most serious and \ndangerous the Nation has ever--I repeat, ever--confronted.\n  I applaud the efforts of my colleagues who have joined me in this \neffort. We are going to have a vigorous debate about it.\n  I yield the floor at this time in deference to others who wish to \nspeak.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be brief tonight. I will speak at \ngreater length about this amendment tomorrow. I want to thank my \ncolleagues. I am pleased to join Senators Coverdell and Craig on this \namendment.\n  Tomorrow I will be citing some statistics, Mr. President, that reveal \nthe extent to which the young people of this country confront an ever \nincreasing and alarming rate of drug usage.\n  We obviously are attempting, in the context of this tobacco bill, to \naddress one of the problems and challenges facing young people, but I \nthink as I talk to at least the families in my State, as high as any \nchallenge or problem that they see confronting their kids, particularly \nchildren starting as early as seventh and eighth grade, is the illicit \nuse of drugs, and, unfortunately, the growing number of individuals who \nare making those drugs available to our young people.\n  Our amendment is designed to begin the process of addressing that in \na far more aggressive fashion than has been the case during the recent \n4, 5, 6 years. We have seen, as I think most of the Members of this \nChamber know, that during the last 5 years, the use of drugs among \nyoung people has gone up after a lengthy period of decline. And it is \nimportant, I think, as we confront the issue of tobacco, that we \nlikewise confront the issue of drugs.\n  I join both of my colleagues in saying that I fervently believe no \nlegislation should leave this Chamber absent provisions that are strong \nand tough antidrug provisions. So I thank my colleagues and I will \nspeak more about it tomorrow. I am glad it is now before the Senate so \nthat we can proceed on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the time has come for the\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\nSenate to begin debate on a portion of the legislation before us that I \nthink, if accepted by this body, will be the most significant thing \nthat we can possibly do.\n  Mr. President, even before the bill before us was brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, the question of tobacco has been, for many months, \none of the major issues of public debate, if not the major issue in \nsome quarters.\n  The Clinton administration, in particular, has crusaded for \nlegislation supposedly aimed at preventing America's teens from taking \nup a deadly habit, arguing that the need for this legislation is so \nstrong that questions of cost and constitutionality, or the ordering of \nsocial priorities, are left by the wayside. Even raising such questions \nis to invite the accusation of being a tool of the big tobacco \ncompanies. How dare you stand in the way of this legislation.\n  Not long ago, Mr. President, I was in Idaho speaking to a group of \nhigh school students. This was just as the tobacco issue was starting \nto break out at the top of most news stories. I asked these kids what \nthe biggest problem facing them and their peers was and what that \nproblem was doing to their lives. When I mentioned tobacco, I'll be \nhonest with you, I was a bit surprised. I was surprised that a lot of \nhands didn't go up because that is what the media had been talking \nabout, what the front pages were telling us. In fact, Mr. President, \nonly a few hands went up. But when I asked about illegal drugs, almost \nevery hand went up. There was hardly a young person in any one of those \nhigh school groups that I spoke to that didn't see drugs as a major \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, you come from a relatively rural State, as do I, and, \nremember, teenage drug abuse is supposed to be a problem of the big \ninner-city schools. But the school I was talking to was a school of 250 \nin rural Idaho. Yet, nearly every hand went up because every one of \nthose students knew someone in their age group who was misusing or was \ninvolved in illegal drugs, and they were concerned about that young \nperson's future. They were concerned about the effect it would have on \ntheir friends' lives. Well, someone might say that these are kids, what \ndo they know? We are the adults; we are the United States Senators, and \nwe are supposed to have a more mature view of the problems that face \nthe citizens of our country. Yes, I would hope that we as adults would \nbe able to make mature and considered judgments on these questions. But \nin sensing that drugs present a bigger threat to them now than does \ntobacco, I think these kids are right. Yes, we should do everything \nreasonable that we can possibly do to discourage young people from \ntaking up smoking.\n\n  I was once a smoker myself, and I know that it is not easy to quit. I \nfought it hard and I fought it for a long time. And I haven't smoked in \n8 years. I am proud of that and so is my family. But if these kids do \nstart smoking, the real danger they will face will be 10 and 20 and 25 \nyears out, before which let us hope they mature, that they have a \nreason to think about their life and their health, and they quit like I \ndid, and they become parents who discourage their children from \nsmoking.\n  Smoking may kill teens later in life, but illegal drugs are killing \nthem today. Whether we are talking about overdoses, car accidents, or \nthe violence associated with the drug trade, illegal drugs present a \nclear and immediate danger to every young person who tries them, to \ntheir families, and to their communities. Talk to the parents of a \nchild they have just lost to an overdose of drugs, and they didn't \nrealize until it was too late that their child was on drugs. No family, \nno socioeconomic family in every strata, or at any level, is immune. \nNot one kid will likely die this year because he or she lit their first \ncigarette. But thousands of Americans will die because they started \nusing drugs this year. Kids who started using drugs today may not get a \nchance to mature out of that habit, as I did and as thousands do.\n  I expect there are very few parents who would not care whether their \nkids decided to start smoking. Most of them care a great deal. However, \nif they were asked whether they would be more concerned about their \nteens starting to smoke or becoming a user of marijuana, crack, or \nheroin, how many parents would say they would take the dope over \ntobacco? Well, we know what they say. We have seen it in the polling. \nLet me tell you, Mr. President, the polling is dramatic. The polling is \nvery clear. The parents of today in the highest of percentages say, Get \nthe drugs away from our kids. It is the No. 2 issue. And way down at \nthe bottom of all of those issues that parents are concerned about, as \nit relates to their kids, is smoking. Yet for the last 2 weeks, this \nSenate has been focused on that issue. Why? Because it is politically \npopular. We are going to bash those big tobacco companies because they \nlied to the American people, and we are going to save teenagers from \nsmoking, and we are going to raise taxes to an all-time high to do it. \nWe are going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet, No. 1, No. \n2, and No. 3, in any poll you take, on the average parent's mind today \nis the kids associated with drugs, the kids associated with gangs, the \nkids being killed in car accidents; and way down at the bottom, but on \nthe list of 10 or 12 items, is smoking.\n  That is one reason I question the administration's priorities \ntonight. In the abstract, I suppose that if drug use continued at the \nsteady decline of the ``just say no'' Reagan and Bush era, if we could \nhonestly say we had the drug dealers on the run, we might start to ask, \nWell, what is the next thing on the list of national priorities that \nthis Congress ought to become involved in? But that is not what we see. \nThe drug policy of the Clinton administration has been by every measure \nexcept theirs a miserable failure. From an early slashing of the \nfunding for the White House antidrug office, to the administration's \neffort to have it both ways on clean needles for addicts, to their \neffort to lower penalties for crack cocaine to equal those of powder, \nto the President's grossly irresponsible ``I wish I had inhaled'' \ncomment on MTV, this administration has sent all the wrong signals. And \nguess what? Those signals have been picked up by the young people of \nthis country, and the predictable results have occurred.\n\n  Two national annual surveys show that drug abuse by our Nation's \nyouth has increased steadily since the Clinton administration came into \noffice.\n  The University of Michigan December 1997 Monitoring the Future Study, \nand the 1997 Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education, and the so-\ncalled PRIDE Survey each offer cause for alarm.\n  The Monitoring the Future Study reveals that illicit drug use among \nAmerica's schoolchildren has constantly increased throughout the \nClinton administration.\n  Mr. President, here comes the figures of alarming proportion.\n  For eighth graders the portion using any illegal drug in the prior 12 \nmonths has increased 71 percent since the year President Clinton was \nfirst elected. And since 1992, it has increased 89 percent amongst 10th \ngraders, and 57 percent amongst 12th graders. That is any illicit drug. \nThe numbers go straight through the roof since President Clinton came \nto office. Reagan, Bush--numbers declining. Everybody laughed at Nancy \nReagan when she said ``Just say no.'' But she stood on a moral pedestal \nalong with George Bush and Ronald Reagan, and they stood as powerful \nleaders and examples. We have a President who chuckled, and said, \n``Well, I wish I had inhaled.'' Sorry, Mr. President. You sent all the \nwrong signals.\n  Marijuana use accounted for much of the overall increase in illicit \ndrug use continuing its strong resurgence amongst eighth graders. Use \nin the prior 12 months has increased 146 percent since 1992.\n  The year President Clinton was first elected to office, amongst 10th \ngraders, the annual prevalence has increased 129 percent amongst 12th \ngraders it has increased 76 percent since 1992.\n  Those ought to be figures that are spread in banner headlines in \nevery major newspaper in this country. And they go unnoticed except in \nour schools, except with school administrators and counselors, and most \nimportantly with parents, who say it is the No. 1 issue facing their \nchildren and them as parents.\n  Of particular concern, according to the survey, is the continuing \nrise in daily marijuana use amongst 10th and 12th graders. More than \none in every 25 of today's high school seniors is a current daily \nmarijuana user, with an 18.4-\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\npercent increase since only last year, while only 1.1 percent of eighth \ngraders used marijuana daily in 1997. That still represents a 50-\npercent increase since 1992.\n  Since President Clinton was first elected, annual LSD use has \nincreased over 52 percent, 68 percent, and 50 percent amongst 8th \ngraders and 10th graders and 12th graders, respectively. More than one \nin 20 seniors in the class of 1997 used cocaine this year, a 12.2-\npercent increase over just last year. That is cocaine. That is the drug \nthat kills. Crack cocaine also continued a gradual upward climb amongst \n10th and 12th graders. In short, since 1992, annual cocaine use is up \n87 percent, 147 percent, and 77 percent amongst 8th, 10th and 12th \ngraders, respectively.\n\n  The longer term gradual rise in the use of amphetamine stimulants \nalso continued within the class of 1997, increasing over 7 percent \nsince last year. Since 1992, annual heroin usage--heroin is on the \nresurgence--has increased by 83 percent, 141 percent, and 92 percent \nfor 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.\n  America, these are our kids, and they are using heroin. This \nadministration doesn't talk about it.\n  The most recent PRIDE Survey shows a continuing and alarming increase \nin drug abuse amongst young kids. Illegal drug use amongst 11- and 14-\nyear-olds has continued on a dangerous upward spiral.\n  According to the president of PRIDE, senior high drug use may have \nstalled, but it is stalled at the highest levels that PRIDE has \nmeasured in 10 years.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for \n30 seconds to a minute so that I might clarify the issue that arose \nabout obviating.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield, but I would not lose any floor \nright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Modification To Amendment No. 2451\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment numbered 2451.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n       At the end of the Durbin amendment, insert the following:\n\n                    TITLE  --DRUG-FREE NEIGHBORHOODS\n\n     SEC.  01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Drug-Free Neighborhoods \n     Act''.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor back to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that modification. \nIt does clarify an important point.\n  Mr. President, according to PRIDE--those are the folks out there on \nthe front line trying to stop kids from using drugs--senior high school \nuse may have stalled, but it has stalled at the highest level PRIDE has \nmeasured in 10 years.\n  Until we see sharp declines in the use at all grade levels there will \nbe no reason to rejoice.\n  With respect to young students, the survey found a full 11 percent of \njunior high students--that is grades 6 through 8--are monthly users of \nillegal drugs. Junior high students reported significant increases in \nmonthly use of marijuana, cocaine, uppers, downers, hallucinogens, and \nheroin especially.\n  Can you imagine that, Mr. President? We are talking about junior high \nkids. Heroin, drug of choice?\n  Annual marijuana use has increased 153 percent since Mr. Clinton \nfirst took office. Cocaine use is up 88 percent.\n  Why aren't we spending weeks on the floor of the Senate debating \nthis, because it is the No. 1 issue amongst parents. The kids know it. \nThey know their friends are being killed by it. They are laughing at \nthe fact that they think we are going to legislate them away from \ntobacco.\n  Hallucinogen use has increased 67 percent since Mr. Clinton took \noffice.\n  Now, in the face of this clear and present danger to our Nation's \nyouth, how can this administration justify their obsession with \ntobacco? That is because there are 100 groups lined up to help them. It \nis a popular political issue. I agree with them on the premise. But I \nthink they missed the point. They missed the point that the young \npeople of America are talking about. They might answer. ``Well, teen \nrates of smoking are also going up.'' That is true. But if we look at \nthe facts on teen tobacco use, also found in the Monitoring of the \nFuture Report that I have been quoting, we see the same pattern as on \ndrug use--a steady decline in the Reagan-Bush years with a steady climb \nsince 1992. In other words, what our President says to America and \nAmerica's youth counts. When he makes light of his flirtation with \nmarijuana, they make light of it, too. That is a great tragedy.\n  Let us ask the question: Instead of hiking increases in teen smoking \nto justify massive, intrusive, expensive legislation that will mostly \ntarget adult smokers, shouldn't the administration admit that teen \nsmoking increase is yet another symptom of their failed drug policy? \nShouldn't they admit that having given kids a wink and a nod on drugs, \nother bad habits would also appear more acceptable? Anybody who has \nraised teenagers knows that.\n  Let's take a concrete example. Recently, an article appeared in the \nNew York Times. ``Young Blacks Link Tobacco Use to Marijuana.'' Strange \nrelationship. I am quoting the New York Times relating to a dramatic \nincrease in tobacco use amongst minority teenagers. According to this \narticle, experts believe that part of the explanation for increased \ntobacco use amongst these teens is because they are already using \nmarijuana. And that tobacco prolongs the effect of marijuana smoking. \nIf so--and I recognize that there are certain complex factors here--\nthis is a case where tobacco use may be directly linked to our failing \ndrug policy.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1998]\n\n               Young Blacks Link Tobacco Use to Marijuana\n\n                            (By Jane Gross)\n\n       Yonkers, April 21.--In the search to explain the spike in \n     smoking among black teen-agers, a range of theories has \n     evolved, from the proliferation of tobacco advertising in \n     minority communities to the stress of adolescence to the \n     identification with entertainment idols who appear with \n     cigarettes dangling from their lips.\n       Teen-agers themselves, and some experts who have studied \n     adolescent smoking, add another, less predictable explanation \n     to the mix of factors: the decision to take up smoking \n     because of a belief that cigarettes prolong the heady rush of \n     marijuana.\n       ``It makes the high go higher,'' said Marquette, a 16-year-\n     old student at Saunders Trades and Technical High School here \n     who, like other students, spoke about her marijuana use on \n     the condition that only her first name be used.\n       At Washington Preparatory High School in South-Central Los \n     Angeles, Tifanni, also 16, said she took up cigarettes two \n     months ago because, ``If the marijuana goes down and you get \n     a cigarette, it will go up again.''\n       Black teen-agers like Marquette and Tifanni are not \n     unusual, according to interviews with dozens of adolescents \n     around the country and various national surveys. These \n     surveys show that blacks begin smoking cigarettes later than \n     white teen-agers, but start using marijuana earlier, a \n     difference experts say they cannot explain.\n       The surveys also show a sharp rise in both cigarette and \n     marijuana use among teen-agers in recent years, evident among \n     all races but most pronounced among blacks. White teen-agers \n     still smoke cigarettes at twice the rate of blacks, but the \n     gap is narrowing, signaling the end of low smoking rates \n     among black youths that had been considered a public health \n     success story.\n       It is not clear how much of the increase in smoking among \n     black teen-agers is due to the use of cigarettes with \n     marijuana, and experts say advertising has been the main \n     factor. But the marijuana-tobacco combination is notable \n     because it is the reverse of the more common progression from \n     cigarette and alcohol use to illegal drugs.\n       Many black teen-agers said in interviews that they were \n     drawn to cigarettes by friends who told them that nicotine \n     would enhance their high from marijuana, which has been lore \n     and practice among drug users of all races for decades. And \n     this is apparently no mere myth. Many scientists who study \n     brain chemistry say the link between cigarettes and marijuana \n     is unproven but likely true.\n       ``African-American youth talk very explicitly about using \n     smoking to maintain a high,'' said Robin Mermelstein, a \n     professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the \n     principal investigator in an ongoing study of why teen-agers \n     smoke for the Federal Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention. ``It's a commonly stated motivator.''\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\n       Dr. Mermelstein said that in focus groups with 1,200 teen-\n     agers around the country, about half the blacks mentioned \n     taking up cigarettes to enhance a marijuana high, but no \n     white teen-agers volunteered that as an explanation for \n     smoking. ``Cigarettes have a totally different functional \n     value for black and white kids,'' she said.\n       Even so, Dr. Mermelstein and others say that does not \n     diminish the greater impact of advertising and other media \n     messages in minority neighborhoods. ``Kids are \n     extraordinarily aware of the entertainment media,'' Dr. \n     Mermelstein said. ``They are very reluctant to see the link \n     between any of these and their behavior. But the influence is \n     undoubtedly there.''\n       Tiffany Faulkner, a 15-year-old at Ida B. Wells High School \n     in Jamaica, Queens, said, ``Tupac smoked and he's my man,'' \n     referring to the slain rap star Tupac Shakur. ``But I didn't \n     smoke because of him,'' she said. ``I have my own head.''\n       Brand loyalty, however, suggests youths are more moved by \n     the advertising than they realize, or are willing to admit. \n     In general, Marlboro and Camel have white characters on \n     billboards and are the brands of choice among white teen-\n     agers, while Kool and Newport use minority images and are \n     favored by African-American teen-agers, as they are by their \n     parents. Outside Brighton High School in Boston, for \n     instance, every black student in a group of smokers chose \n     Newports. ``They're the cool cigarette,'' said Joey Simone, \n     18, a smoker since she was 11.\n       A 16-year-old Chicago girl who tried cigarettes briefly \n     said she is certain advertising is the key. ``When I was \n     little I would see pictures of people standing around with a \n     cigarette and it looked like fun,'' said Coleco Davis at \n     DuSable High School. ``They were all having a good time and \n     it didn't look like it could hurt you.''\n       This wave of new black smokers, drawn to a habit that kills \n     more people each year than all illegal drugs combined, has \n     researchers worried, because once teen-agers have experienced \n     the booster rocket effect of cigarettes prolonging a \n     marijuana high they often find themselves addicted to \n     tobacco.\n       ``Because I was getting high, I needed it,'' said Mary, 16, \n     a student at Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan. ``The \n     cigarettes made me more high. Now it's become a habit. I feel \n     bad because there's nothing I can do to stop.''\n       The crescendo of concern about teen-age smoking is behind \n     pending Federal legislation that would raise the price of \n     cigarettes, control advertising to young people and penalize \n     manufacturers if there is not a gradual reduction in \n     adolescent smoking. That legislation took center stage in \n     Washington just as a new study earlier this month showed a \n     steep rise in the smoking rate among black youths.\n       The nationwide Federal study showed overall smoking rates \n     had increased by one third among high school students between \n     1991 and 1997. Most alarming to experts was the sharp rise \n     among black youths: 22.7 percent in 1997, up from 12.6 \n     percent six years earlier.\n       Charyn Sutton, whose Philadelphia marketing company \n     conducts focus groups for Federal research agencies, said she \n     first heard about the current progression from marijuana to \n     cigarettes--what she calls the ``reverse gateway effect''--\n     during focus groups in 1995 involving black middle school \n     students. Ms. Sutton already knew about blunts, cigars \n     hollowed of tobacco and filled with marijuana. But now the \n     teen-agers told her that a practice familiar to the drug \n     cognoscenti as early as the 1960's and 1970's was popular in \n     the schoolyard of the late 1990's--enhancing the high of a \n     joint with a cigarette.\n       She tested what the teen-agers told her by talking to \n     addicts in recovery, who concurred. And to be sure that the \n     pattern she was seeing in Philadelphia was not a local \n     anomaly, she interviewed young African-Americans across the \n     nation. And, she said, she discovered that they were doing \n     the same thing.\n       The enhancing effect that teen-agers describe is consistent \n     with what is already known about the working of nicotine and \n     THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Both spur production \n     of dopamine, a brain chemical that produces pleasurable \n     sensations, said George Koob, a professor of neuro-\n     pharmacology at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, \n     Calif. ``It makes a lot of sense,'' Dr. Koob said.\n       At the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funds most \n     of the world's research on addiction, Alan I. Lesher, the \n     director, went a step further, saying the anecdotal findings \n     cried out for rigorous investigation. ``This is a reasonable \n     scientific question,'' he said. ``And if enough people report \n     experiencing it, it merits consideration.''\n       Researchers elsewhere have also taken note of strange \n     glitches in substance abuse data comparing blacks and whites. \n     For instance, Denise Kandel, a professor of public health \n     and psychology at Columbia University's College of \n     Physicians and Surgeons, found that while most substance \n     abusers progressed logically from legal to illegal \n     substances, ``the pattern of progression is less regular \n     among blacks and nobody really knows why.''\n       In 1991, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 14.7 percent of students said they had used \n     marijuana in the last 30 days; by 1995, the latest year for \n     which data is available, that rate had jumped to 25.3 \n     percent. Among white youths, the rate increased to 24.6 \n     percent from 15.2. Among Hispanics, it shot up to 27.8 from \n     14.4 and among blacks to 28.8 from 13.5, vaulting them from \n     last place to first in marijuana use by racial group.\n       The C.D.C. cigarette study, which tracks use through 1997, \n     shows a parallel pattern. Among white students, 39.7 percent \n     said they smoked cigarettes, up from 30.9 percent six years \n     ago. Among Hispanic students, more than one third now say \n     they smoke, up from roughly a quarter. Among black youths, \n     22.7 percent list themselves as smokers, compared with the \n     12.6 who said they smoked in 1991. Worst of all were the \n     smoking rates for black males, which doubled in the course of \n     the study, to 28.2 from 14.1.\n       The progression from marijuana to cigarettes among black \n     youths was the most provocative finding in interviews in \n     recent days with high school students in New York City, its \n     suburbs, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston, who consistently \n     raised the issue without being asked. But their comments \n     raised several other troubling issues, as well.\n       The students were perfectly aware of the health hazards of \n     cigarette smoking. A 17-year-old at Norman Thomas High School \n     in Manhattan said she was quitting because she might be \n     pregnant. A 15-year-old at Saunders said she did not smoke \n     during basketball and softball season but resumed in between.\n       But most paid no mind to the danger.\n       And despite laws prohibiting sales to anyone under 18, \n     virtually all the teen-agers said they purchased cigarettes \n     with no trouble at delis and bodegas.\n       The Federal legislation to curb teen-age smoking depends in \n     large measure on steep price increases as a deterrent. \n     Sponsors of the bill say that raising the price by $1.10 per \n     pack would reduce youth smoking by as much as 40 percent. But \n     talking to high school students suggests this prediction is \n     optimistic.\n       The adolescents said overwhelmingly that they would pay \n     $3.60 a pack--the current $2.50 charged in New York plus the \n     additional $1.10 envisioned in the legislation. A few said \n     that $5 a pack might inspire them to quit, or at least to \n     try.\n       But faced with that high a tariff, 17-year-old Robert Reid, \n     a student in Yonkers, had another idea. ``At that price,'' he \n     said, ``you might as well buy weed.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me read two paragraphs from the article:\n\n       It is not clear how much of the increase in smoking amongst \n     black teen-agers is due to the use of cigarettes with \n     marijuana, and experts say advertising has been the major \n     factor. But the marijuana-tobacco combination is notable \n     because it is the reverse of the more common progression from \n     cigarette and alcohol use to illegal drugs.\n       Many black teen-agers said in interviews that they were \n     drawn to cigarettes by friends who told them that nicotine \n     would enhance their high from marijuana, which has been lore \n     and practice among drug users of all races for decades. And \n     this is apparently no mere myth. Many scientists who study \n     brain chemistry say the link between cigarettes and marijuana \n     is unproven but likely true.\n\n  One other paragraph:\n\n       The students were perfectly aware of the health hazards of \n     cigarette smoking. A 17-year-old at Norman Thomas High School \n     in Manhattan said she was quitting because she might be \n     pregnant.\n\n  But that is the only reason she was quitting.\n\n       A 15-year-old at Saunders [High School] said she did not \n     smoke during basketball and softball season but resumed in \n     between.\n\n  The article also talks about the effects of the kind of antitobacco \nmeasures that are being discussed on the floor including pushing the \nprice of cigarettes to $3.50 to $4 to $5 a pack. Adolescents \noverwhelmingly said they would pay $3.60 a pack. The current charge in \nNew York is $2.50. An additional $1.10 would move that to $3.60, and \nthe teenagers did not see that as a problem. Now we are talking about \nthe legislation that is being debated on the floor right now. According \nto the article:\n\n       A few said that $5 a pack might inspire them to quit, or at \n     least to try.\n       But faced with that high a tariff, 17-year-old . . . a \n     student in Yonkers, had another idea. ``At that price,'' he \n     said, ``you might as well buy weed.''\n\n  In other words, he was saying you might as well smoke marijuana \nbecause they are going to end up being about the same price. I don't \nthink anybody on the floor of this Senate has thought about that. But \nthe kids are thinking about it. Let us think about those words, Mr. \nPresident: ``At that price, you might as well smoke weed.''\n  It is always easy for the partisans of big government to come up with \nbig spending, big bureaucracy plans, that whether or not it actually \nimpacts the intended target, in this case teenage smoking, it is sure \nto have all sorts of unintended but predictable side effects. For \nexample, how big of a tax increase are we looking at? Well, we don't \nknow for sure. Why shouldn't we be looking\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\nat this as a big regressive tax, and I think I can say, in all \nfairness, the biggest regressive tax in American history? How effective \nwill it be in actually curbing teenage smoking or, for that matter, \nadult smoking? How much more attractive will it make others? By that, I \nam talking about illegal drugs such as marijuana, especially to young \npeople.\n  Well, that teenager from Yonkers said it: If you are going to raise \ntobacco to that price, you just might as well smoke weed. Have we \nlearned anything at all from the black market of other nations? That \nhas been discussed by some of my colleagues on the floor in the last \nseveral weeks, and they have used it as an example and it bears \nrepeating because it shows a reaction to the marketplace.\n\n  In Canada, by 1992, a pack of cigarettes cost about $4.50 in U.S. \ndollars, probably about $6.75 in Canadian dollars, while the price in \nthe United States was $2. The result: the loss of billions of dollars \nin tax revenue and up to 40 percent of the Canadian market supplied by \nsmuggling, black market, illegal, under the table, vended in the alley, \nout of the backs of cars, vended by the black market of drug dealing. \nCanada rolled back its tobacco taxes in 1994, and Sweden recently \ndropped its tobacco tax over 25 percent. Do we really want to repeat \ntheir mistakes? We are about to start. When cigarettes in Mexico cost \nabout $1 a pack, where do you think the border will be? Or, more \nimportantly, how can we protect the border? The movement will be \nsignificant.\n  Does anyone think this would not be a tremendous windfall for \norganized crime or for cross-border drug trade in Mexico, which is \nalready at epidemic proportions? How many funding streams is that? \nWell, taxes, we know that. And if those funding streams that we are \nasking for to fund all of this dry up, then how do we pay for the \nprograms? Because they will surely dry up. Other nations have found \nthat to be the case. And they have had to back off, to up their moneys, \nto up their cash flow again to fund the programs that they were going \nto feed off of the taxes they raised from tobacco.\n  As a Republican, I think this big government approach is just the \nwrong way to go, especially when we have no real assurance that these \nprograms will do any good.\n  We need to take a hard look at drug use. And, yes, the teen tobacco \nuse situation in this country that we find is critical. We need to look \nat it in a practical and a principled way. The bottom line should be \nthis: If the Clinton administration won't lead on drugs--and at this \npoint I would say their credibility on drugs has been fatally \ncompromised--then it is the Congress that should lead. We should lead. \nThat is our job--to create public policy that makes sense for the \nAmerican people. That is why my colleague, Paul Coverdell of Georgia, \nand I are offering this amendment which would ensure that the drug \ncrisis is not ignored as we attempt to address the tobacco problem.\n  This amendment collects a number of initiatives that would make a \nserious impact on illegal drugs. It takes a three-pronged approach: \nattacking the supply of drugs by strengthening our ability to stop them \nat the border, providing additional resources to fight drugs that reach \nour neighborhoods, and by creating disincentives for teens to use \nillegal drugs.\n  Let me talk about some of those provisions that are embodied in our \namendment. Let me first talk about the one on supply, the supply side \nof the drug problem, because we all know it is a supply-demand \nequation. We cannot rely just on treatment programs for those who have \nalready started to abuse drugs. And you know there is a bit of that \nattitude--well, yeah, if they get hooked on them, we will treat them. \nThe problem is sometimes they get hooked on them, and they get killed \nor they die before they can get to treatment. We must stop drugs from \ngetting to our kids in the first place, or make every effort to try to \nstop it.\n  One key step in fighting the drug supply is increased resources for \nthe interdiction of those drugs; in other words, law enforcement. Fund \nthem, put them on alert, make it a No. 1 priority. This is the area \nwhere the administration has been most irresponsible. Slashing the \nCoast Guard's antidrug budget, with the result--and you know what the \nresult was--a major disruption in the rate of decline. The number of \nseizures for drug shipments turned back before they reached the United \nStates--listen to these figures; it happened on the President's watch \nafter he slashed the interdiction money--declined by 53 percent. We are \ntalking interdiction, at the border or out in the water; a 53-percent \ndecline in interdiction from 1992 to 1995.\n  So, what does our amendment do? We give the Coast Guard, the Defense \nDepartment, the U.S. Customs Service, the resources they need to target \nthat interdiction before drugs reach the American streets. Our \namendment does exactly that, and that is our intent. Our amendment also \nincludes the Drug-Free Borders Act, which attacks the 70 percent of \nillegal drugs that enter our country across the Mexican border. Mr. \nPresident, 70 percent of the problem is right there on that very \nidentifiable border. These provisions would increase the penalties for \ncrimes of violence and other crimes committed at our borders and enable \nthe INS to hire thousands--yes, thousands--of new Border Patrol agents.\n  But our amendment does not just stop at the border; it also \nstrengthens the hand of law enforcement in fighting drug dealers at \nhome and abroad. For example, our amendment increases the resources \navailable to DEA and the FBI. We also think parents deserve to know if \nconvicted drug dealers have moved into their neighborhoods. Our \namendment requires released Federal convicts, convicted of major drug \ncrimes, to register with local law enforcement personnel, who can then \nput their communities on notice. Why not? Those are the folks who have \nbeen killing our kids by selling drugs. Why not let the communities \nknow if they are back in those communities? These are only some of the \nprovisions in our amendment that attack the supply of drugs.\n  We also focus on the demand side of the problem by supporting local \nefforts to protect our neighborhoods, businesses, and schools from \ndrugs and provide incentives for young people to stay straight. Our \namendment includes a provision addressing needle exchange programs. At \na time when drug use, particularly heroin use, is increasing, this \nprogram clearly undermines our effort to fight illegal drugs. What \nprogram? The current program. The Clinton program. The green light to \nsubsidizing needle exchange programs. That is the green light for drug \nuse. The House has already passed legislation to stop this, H.R. 3717, \nby a strong 287 to 140 vote. The Senate should do the same. Our \namendment includes just exactly this. I hope the Senate can support it.\n  Another section of our amendment is the Drug-Free Student Loan Act. \nIt restricts loan eligibility for students who use drugs. This would \ntarget substance abuse without creating Federal mandates or authorizing \nnew spending. It puts the kids on notice: ``We ain't going to tolerate \nit anymore. Be straight, you will get your education. You can have a \nloan for it. But, use drugs and you are falling out of favor with the \npublic.''\n  The Drug-Free Teen Driving Act in our amendment would encourage \nStates to be at least as tough on driving privileges for those who use \ndrugs and drive as those who are drunk drivers. Stop and think about \nthe inconsistency today. You get caught a drunk driver, you get your \nlicense pulled. Drug abuse? No. No. We are not addressing that. This \namendment does. Same treatment.\n\n  Our amendment includes the Drug-Free Workplace Act. This section \nprovides incentives for employers to implement antidrug programs in the \nworkplace, such as clear antidrug policies, drug testing, and \nemployees' assistance programs. We also assist schools in the fight \nagainst drugs by allowing them to use Federal funds for drug testing \nprograms and victims' assistance. Our amendment also provides \nincentives for States to create an annual report card to parents and \nteachers, listing incidents of school violence and drug activities.\n  Another critically important part of our amendment would back up \ncommunities in their fight against drugs. We would authorize matching \ngrants funds\n\n[[Page S5629]]\n\nto support communities' efforts to establish comprehensive, \nsustainable, and accountable antidrug coalitions.\n  Senator Coverdell and I recognize you cannot do all of this from the \ntop down, that you have to work with the grassroots and help it grow \nfrom the bottom up. These and other provisions in our amendment are \ncommonsense measures to protect our young people from the growing \nmenace of drugs. They would counter the wrongheaded policies of this \nadministration and start sending the right signals to America's youth.\n  This amendment does not set up new bureaucracies nor impose new \nmandates. It supports law enforcement's attack on the suppliers of \ndrugs. It also supports local efforts to control drugs in \nneighborhoods, schools, and businesses. Nothing can be more important \nthan supporting these local efforts, because they are the front line in \nthe war on drugs. And right now, with the efforts in communities to be \ndrug free, they are the only line, the only real line that is working. \nWe do not need the hammer of the Federal Government to force \ncommunities to take action. As I have mentioned, they are already at \nit. All they need is a few resources and our help.\n  Let me give an example of something that is happening in my State \nthat I am so proud of. It is called the Enough Is Enough campaign. It \nis a community-based drug prevention campaign driven by the private \nsector. No government dollars or controls are involved. Why? The \nproblem became so bad in the Clinton years, the communities had to take \nit on. They said, ``If we cannot get help from the Federal Government, \nwe will do it ourselves,'' because they saw the numbers going up and \nthey saw the deaths occurring.\n  Most people in Idaho agree that this program is the most effective \nantidrug, drug awareness campaign they have ever seen. It builds on the \nsystems within every community that influence and involve specific \ngroups of individuals. It recognizes that each system has a special, \nspecific role to play in the prevention that is necessary and that it \ninvolves all of the community. It unites these systems. It includes the \nmedia and the public and private sectors behind a common goal--to equip \nour children to walk drug free through a drug-filled world. It focuses \non community teamwork to fight the drug culture and regain the quality \nof life for our children. Enough Is Enough is the largest community-\nwide drug prevention effort in Idaho's history. Antidrug advocate \nMilton Creagh has delivered his challenge to communities all over the \nState. More than 100,000 people have already participated in the \nprogram, and additional community coalitions are being formed every \nday.\n  This program is proof that the Federal Government does not have all \nthe answers. In fact, the Federal Government can do a lot of harm by \nforcing wrong programs and wrong incentives on local communities and \ncitizens. Instead, we should provide encouragement, support local \nantidrug initiatives, and that is the philosophy behind our amendment: \nGet our law enforcement involved, stop the stuff at the border.\n  In offering the amendment to the antitobacco bill, I have been \narguing that the danger posed by illegal drugs is greater and more \nimmediate and more deadly than any immediate problem that tobacco poses \non teenage America.\n  It is my strong belief that the bill before us tonight must not \nignore the drug crisis that threatens our youth, America's future.\n  Having said all that, however, I do not mean to suggest that we \nshould ignore teenage smoking. Let me repeat that for the Record, \nbecause I am quite sure there are some who will say, ``Well, Coverdell \nand Craig are trying to switch the focus.'' No; we are trying to \nrefocus. We are trying to do fine focus. We are trying to get this \nGovernment pointed in the right direction. In fact, as I have already \npointed out, there is a connection between youth smoking and drug use.\n  There are a number of commonsense antismoking measures we should \nseriously consider, but I would like to draw my colleagues' attention \nto the one thing in particular we know to be effective in combating not \njust teenage smoking, but drug use, violence, suicide, sexual behavior, \nand emotional disturbances.\n  In an area that is fairly underrated and where the Clinton \nadministration definitely has been a part of the problem, the one thing \nis parental involvement in their children's lives. A recent Washington \nPost article entitled ``Love Conquers What Ails Teens, Studies Find'' \nsummarized the results of a Federal study known as the National \nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health based on a survey of 90,000 \nstudents grade 7 through 12 and published in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association:\n\n       Teenagers who have a strong emotional attachment to their \n     parents and teachers are much less likely to use drugs and \n     alcohol, attempt suicide, engage in violence, become sexually \n     active at an early age.\n\n  That is what the Post reported.\n  Though less important than the emotional connection, the presence of \nparents at home at key times in the morning, after school, at dinner, \nat bedtime make teenagers less likely to use alcohol, tobacco and \nmarijuana.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government cannot mandate family cohesion, \nbut I cannot think of a better argument for passing S. 4, the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act. That would encourage a host of comptime-\nflextime options for America's parents. Why am I talking about this \nwhen we are trying to stop teenagers from smoking, when we have an \namendment on the floor about teenage drug abuse that we are trying to \ncurb? Because it ought to be a part of the package. We ought to \nunderstand and not be so naive as to say that it is the total \nenvironment in which the child lives.\n  I mention it only tonight for our Senate to understand that we cannot \ndo it; we are blocked on the floor; it is not the right thing \npolitically; somehow the unions oppose it. Why don't we wake up? Why \ndon't we understand that Government can, in fact, by its inaction, be \nan impediment?\n  Those are the conclusions I have drawn, and that is why I am a \ncosponsor with Senator Coverdell of this, what I believe to be the most \nimportant part of this total legislation.\n  Mr. President, in the coming days, the Senate will be faced with a \nstark choice: We can be panicked down the road of least resistance to \npassing a big Government antitobacco bill that won't do the job but \nwill become a permanent tax and regulatory nightmare, or we can pass \nsome commonsense legislation that will help States, localities, \ncommunities, and, most of all, parents take charge of their children's \nfuture. We can mount a strong antismoking campaign, and we can assist \nStates to do so.\n  Really, when it comes to controlling our borders, when it comes to \nstopping the massive new flow of drugs into this country, stimulated by \nan administration that just doesn't want to face the issue, then it is \ntime the Congress speak, and we can speak clearly and decisively if we \nvote, pass, and add as a major component to this tobacco legislation \nthe Coverdell-Craig teenage antidrug amendment.\n  It sets us in the right direction. It is a quantum step toward \ndealing with teenage drug use that, by everyone's measurement, is \nmoving at an astronomical rate, taking lives in unbelievable numbers. \nWe hear the statistic, 3,000 kids start smoking every day, and that is \ntrue, but thousands try drugs and get hooked and thousands die within a \nvery short time.\n  Thank goodness that in your adult years, if you are a smoker, \nsometimes common sense hits you like it hit me, that it was the wrong \nthing to do, that it wasn't healthy, that it was socially unacceptable, \nand that it was not going to cause me to be a good influence over my \nchildren, and I quit. But I doubt seriously that in my youth, if I had \nbeen hooked on drugs, I might not have had the opportunity to quit.\n  I hope this Congress awakens to the real issue, and I think my \ncolleague from Georgia and I are bringing the real issue to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. We will debate it tomorrow, and we will debate it \nMonday. I hope that we have a resounding vote in favor of the \nCoverdell-Craig amendment, that it become a part of this total package, \nand that we deal with it in a fair and responsible way, then find and \nbring about the funding necessary to ensure that we can put our Coast \nGuard back to interdiction, that we can stop the flow at the borders, \nthat we can go\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\nafter the pusher on the street, and that we can show our young people \nthat starting or experimenting with drugs is not only unacceptable as a \npart of the American culture, but that we will insist they quit for \ntheir safety and for their future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy I \ndelivered at the funeral for the former U.S. Senator from Arizona, \nBarry Goldwater, in Tempe, Arizona on June 3, 1998, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      In Memory of Barry Goldwater\n\n    (Remarks of Jon Kyl, Tempe, Arizona, As Delivered June 3, 1998)\n\n       We honor Barry Goldwater today by reflecting on why he has \n     made such a mark on our state, our nation, and the world.\n       All of us probably remember the first time we met Barry. In \n     my case, it was in May 1961 when I was a student at the \n     University of Arizona. After working with him in the \n     political arena for most of the ensuing years, and after \n     visiting with him often during his retirement, I think I know \n     why he has had the influence he has had. I have come to \n     believe it is because of his very unique perspective--about \n     nature, including human nature.\n       It is why he could do without all of the political folderol \n     that preoccupies so many in public life. It is why he could \n     shrug off his defeat in the presidential election of 1964--\n     not because he didn't care, but because he knew, in the end, \n     the most important thing was to tell the truth as he saw it, \n     and to build a foundation for the future.\n       It is why he cared about and understood people so well, and \n     could shape a political philosophy which works precisely \n     because it is predicated upon the true nature of man.\n       That sense of perspective, of what truly mattered, was \n     rooted in his early experiences traveling this state, rafting \n     down the Grand Canyon, photographing Arizona's landscapes and \n     getting to know a lot of common people. He was very much a \n     part of the land, the desert, the mountains, and the people \n     and places of Arizona.\n       One reason I think he liked common people is because, like \n     Abraham Lincoln, he saw himself as a common man. My dad is \n     the same way. They understood early on, that every person has \n     a unique and individual worth, and that that is why freedom \n     is indispensable to assure man's proper place in nature.\n       As a young man, Barry Goldwater helped run his family's \n     trading post on the Navajo reservation. He knew the Hopi and \n     the Navajo people and appreciated their way of life. He \n     captured on film the character and dignity of Native \n     Americans and other people. He saw their qualities as \n     individuals, and learned from them and respected them.\n       Others wanted to remake human nature. Barry Goldwater \n     appreciated it, as it is. In that respect, he grasped the \n     truth of the Founding Fathers, that freedom is indispensable \n     for the fulfillment of God's purposes for those He created in \n     His image.\n       This homegrown insight is what led him to be so alarmed by \n     the growth and power of government since the New Deal. ``A \n     government that is big enough to give you all you want is big \n     enough to take it all away,'' he said, reaffirming the belief \n     in limited government upon which America was established, and \n     upon which he and Ronald Reagan and others constructed a \n     conservatism for our time.\n       It was necessary to have someone of his courage and plain \n     speaking to persuade others of this nature-driven view of \n     liberty and smaller government, at a time when it was not \n     considered a very respectable view.\n       But, as Matthew Arnold said, ``The freethinking of one age \n     is the common sense of the next.'' There is no doubt that \n     Barry Goldwater--as the pathbreaker for today's common-sense \n     conservatism--is the most influential Arizonan in our \n     lifetime, indeed, in the lifetime of Arizona as a state.\n       Summarizing his own life, in 1988 he wrote:\n       ``Freedom has been the watchword of my political life. I \n     rose from a dusty little frontier town and preached freedom \n     across the land all my days. It is democracy's ultimate power \n     and assures its eventual triumph over communism. I believe in \n     faith, hope, and charity. But none of these is possible \n     without freedom.''\n       It was a privilege to know someone who was as obvious in \n     his virtues as he was in his opinions. When I visited with \n     him in the last few years, he seemed reluctant to offer the \n     specific political advice that I occasionally sought from \n     him. He wanted instead to talk about the people he had known, \n     about his early formative experiences in Arizona, and about \n     history.\n       There are too few people who give you the feeling that they \n     have the long view in mind. Barry Goldwater did. There are \n     too few who show us what it is like for a man to guide his \n     life by true principles. Barry Goldwater showed us. The \n     Senator from Arizona was not only a great patriot, he was, as \n     he wished to be remembered, an honest man who tried.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5630-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5630-S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NICK MURNION OF GARFIELD COUNTY, MONTANA--PROFILE IN COURAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on May 29, during the Memorial Day recess \nlast week, the Kennedy Library Foundation held its annual ``Profile in \nCourage'' Award Ceremony at the Kennedy Library in Boston. The 1998 \nProfile in Courage Award was presented to Nickolas C. Murnion, the \nCounty Attorney of Garfield County, Montana, for his courageous \nleadership in the confrontation earlier in this decade with the militia \ngroup called the Freemen.\n  The Profile in Courage award takes its name from President Kennedy's \nPulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Profiles in Courage,'' which my brother \nwrote in the 1950's, while he was still a Senator. The book told the \nstories of elected officials in American history who showed \nextraordinary political courage by doing what they thought was right, \nin spite of powerful resistance and opposition.\n  Nick Murnion clearly demonstrated that quality of political courage, \nand he did so at great physical risk to himself as well. His small \nrural community in Montana came under siege, beginning in 1993, from \nthe Freemen, a belligerent anti-government militia that took root in \nthe area. The members of the Freemen refused to abide by local laws or \npay taxes. They harassed and threatened public officials, and \nthreatened the life of Nick Murnion and anyone else who challenged \nthem.\n  But Nick Murnion stood his ground, and armed with the rule of law and \nthe strong support of other citizens in the community, he prevailed. \nFinally, in 1996, the FBI came to provide assistance, and after a \ndramatic 81-day siege, the militia members surrendered peacefully.\n  Today, as the nation struggles to deal with extremist groups, hate \ncrimes, church bombings, schoolyard shootings, and other distressing \nacts of violence in our society, Nick Murnion's inspiring story reminds \nus of leadership at its best in our democracy.\n  In accepting the Profile in Courage Award, Nick Murnion delivered a \ntruly eloquent address at the Kennedy Library in Boston, and I ask \nunanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Address of Garfield County Attorney Nickolas S. Murnion, 1998 Profile \n                in Courage Award Ceremony, May 29, 1998\n\n       Members of the President's family, Trustees of the John F. \n     Kennedy Library Foundation, family and friends.\n       I was both shocked and delighted four weeks ago when \n     Caroline Kennedy called me in a little town in Montana to \n     give me the great news that I had been selected as this \n     year's John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage recipient. I had a \n     vague awareness of the award, but my first reaction was \n     disbelief. I couldn't figure out how I could be selected for \n     such a prestigious honor, when I had no idea I was even being \n     considered. I will also admit that at the time, I was almost \n     more in awe in talking with Caroline Kennedy than in getting \n     the great news about the award.\n       My first recollection of any political race was in 1960, \n     when at the age of 7 I asked to see pictures in the newspaper \n     of who was running for President of the United States. My \n     first impression was that there was no question I would have \n     voted for John F. Kennedy. Later I remember a schoolteacher \n     telling us to remember President Kennedy as having made some \n     of the most eloquent speeches in our time. Looking back at \n     those speeches now, I believe she was right. The Kennedy \n     presidency was one that I remember very fondly for the ideals \n     expressed and the vision of a future where everyone could\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\n     share in the American Dream. Politics was a noble profession \n     to which a young person could aspire.\n       One of my biggest honors in being chosen to receive this \n     award is to represent the Big Sky State of Montana. \n     Apparently, John F. Kennedy also was fond of our state. When \n     he addressed the Montana Democratic Convention in 1960, he \n     quoted Thoreau: ``Eastward I only go by force. Westward I go \n     free.'' Then he added, ``That is why I have come to \n     Montana.''\n       President's Kennedy's last stop was in Great Falls on \n     September 26, 1963, where he closed his final speech by \n     saying: ``This sun in this sky which shines over Montana can \n     be, I believe, the kind of inspiration to us all to recognize \n     what a great single country we have--50 separate states, but \n     one people living here in the United States, building this \n     country and maintaining the watch around the globe. This is \n     the opportunity before us as well as the responsibility.''\n       As I appear before you today in the great state of \n     Massachusetts and in this historical city of Boston, I am \n     proud to be part of these 50 great states. My experience the \n     last five years in dealing with the Montana Freemen has \n     instilled in me a great appreciation for our democratic form \n     of government. Until you have to fight for your government \n     you tend to take it for granted. In 1994 in a small county in \n     Montana with only 1,500 residents and one sheriff and one \n     deputy, our people had to make a decision to take a stand \n     against 30 armed insurrectionists, even though it put their \n     own lives and property at risk. Even with the knowledge of \n     the risks, 80 people signed up to assist law enforcement in \n     whatever was needed to be done to deal with a situation which \n     was rapidly escalating into an armed confrontation. In \n     accepting this award I wish to acknowledge the courage of \n     those 80 people and of the rest of the community which \n     overwhelmingly condemned this movement.\n       In ``Profiles in Courage'' I was struck by the stands taken \n     by different people in history which left them alone to fight \n     the battle. Everyone seemed to desert them at one time or \n     another. I never felt completely alone in this struggle. I \n     had the people of Garfield County for support. I had Attorney \n     General Joe Mazurek assisting on behalf of the State of \n     Montana. When times got real bad, I knew I could always call \n     on Senator Max Baucus for help.\n       The story of Edmund G. Ross who cast the deciding vote in \n     stopping the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson \n     particularly touched me. Ross voted against the impeachment \n     to save the Union against those who wanted to continue the \n     struggles brought on by the Civil War. Years later the Kansas \n     newspapers finally praised the actions of Ross. ``By the \n     firmness and courage of Senator Ross, it was said, the \n     country was saved from calamity greater than war, while it \n     consigned him into a political martyrdom, the most cruel in \n     our history. Ross was the victim of a wild flame of \n     intolerance which swept everything before it. He did his \n     duty knowing it meant his political death. It was a brave \n     thing for Ross to do, but Ross did it. He acted for his \n     conscience and with a lofty patriotism, regardless of what \n     he knew must be the ruinous consequences to himself. He \n     was right.''\n       There is a growing wave of intolerance in this country by \n     those groups, which call themselves patriots, militias, \n     constitutionalists, common law courts, posse commitatus, and \n     freemen. Their numbers are estimated at between 5 and 20 \n     million. They appear to be the disenfranchised Americans who \n     believe the government has gotten so corrupt that the only \n     solution is revolution. They were not taken very seriously \n     until the Oklahoma City bombing. They have not gone away, \n     although their movement has gone more underground. They will \n     be back with the same hate-filled message filled with \n     scapegoats and conspiracy theories for all their problems.\n       As a prosecutor, I am not sure I did anything in this \n     situation that any other prosecutor in America would not have \n     done. Everyday, all across this country, men and women in law \n     enforcement put their lives on the line to enforce the law, \n     so that the rest of us can live in peace. They are the true \n     unsung heroes.\n       For many months before the FBI finally came to Garfield \n     County, we tried to devise ways to serve our arrest warrants \n     on fugitives residing in an armed camp. In those meetings, I \n     learned the immense pressure felt by our leaders when they \n     have to send men into harms way. The decision to make any \n     attempt to serve our arrest warrants could result in the \n     death of law enforcement personnel and of those people you \n     previously considered to be your friend and neighbors. Most \n     importantly, you learn that contrary to the television and \n     the movie portrayals, sending armed men into an armed camp \n     almost always results in something going wrong.\n       I also learned that those in law enforcement who are \n     trained to take these actions are much like you and me. They \n     are married with families, and their biggest desire is to go \n     back to their families. I salute all of the fine men and \n     women in the F.B.I. who came to our aid in Garfield County. I \n     also want us to remember F.B.I. agent Kevin Cramer, who lost \n     his life in an automobile accident on his way to the standoff \n     area. He left behind a wife and two small children and we \n     should not forget that we did have a fatality caused by the \n     standoff.\n       I want to share this honor with the people of the great \n     state of Montana who have over the past few years had to deal \n     with different types of hate groups in different communities. \n     In almost every case, the communities have come together to \n     condemn the hate-motivated activities. In Billings, we had \n     the wonderful example of a community showing support by \n     placing menorahs in the windows of hundreds of homes after a \n     Jewish family had a brick thrown through their window.\n       In other parts of Montana, we have had other Freemen-type \n     activity which law enforcement has vigorously prosecuted. \n     Lately, we had a fire set on one of our Hutterite colonies, \n     which has led to condemnation by our Congressman and an \n     intensive criminal investigation.\n       In Billings, Montana a campaign to deal with hate groups \n     used the message ``Not in our Town.'' In Garfield County, the \n     message our people sent was clear. ``Not in our County.'' In \n     the State of Montana, I am proud to say we have sent a \n     message ``Not in our State.'' I stand before you today in the \n     great state of Massachusetts and say ``Not in this Country.''\n       Those groups who look with envious eyes at the vast open \n     spaces of Montana with the idea of making it some type of \n     refuge for white supremacists need to understand: We know \n     about you and your hate-filled ideas. We will expose the \n     truth about you and the truth will defeat you. To the rest of \n     America, let Montana be an example of how hate can be \n     conquered.\n       Finally I share this award with my wife and children who \n     have had to endure the threats for the past 5 years. They \n     have quietly stood by me and I thank them for that. I am \n     deeply honored to accept this award and hope that I can live \n     up to the ideals behind it each day of the rest of my life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5630-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional retirement savings opportunities for small employers, \nincluding self-employed individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  small employer nest egg act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the National \nSummit on Retirement Savings which is taking place here in Washington \ntoday and tomorrow. I also want to use this occasion to introduce \nlegislation that will empower a greater number of working Americans to \nsave for their retirement through employer-sponsored retirement plans.\n  In the course of the next 2 days, the 239 delegates to the National \nSummit on Retirement Savings will address an issue of great importance \nas the baby boom generation draws closer to retirement age and the \nfuture of Social Security remains uncertain.\n  With savings rates at a 59-year low, and the revelation in the 1998 \nSocial Security Trustees Report that Social Security is actuarially \nbankrupt, it is evident that we face what amounts to a retirement \ncrisis.\n  The less individuals save for their retirement, the greater the \nstrain on an ailing Social Security system that is incapable of \nsustaining the fast-growing retired population.\n  Yet studies show that an increasing number of Americans are depending \non Social Security for their retirement income. According to the \nEmployee Benefit Research Institute, Social Security is the primary \nsource of income for 80% of retired Americans, and practically the only \nsource for 40% of retirees.\n  Those who depend on Social Security for their retirement can expect a \nstandard of living far lower than the one they enjoyed while in the \nwork force.\n  For instance, an individual who has an annual income of $15,000 per \nyear who retires in 1998 at age 65 can expect Social Security to \nprovide only one-half their previous income, and the replacement rate \ndrops steadily when moving up the income bracket.\n  Indeed, Social Security was never intended to be the major source of \nretirement savings that it seems to have become--its purpose was to \nserve as a single leg in a three-legged stool that would sustain \nAmericans in their retirement years.\n  Social Security's original purpose was to provide Americans with the \nminimal level of income in retirement that when combined with personal \nsavings and employment-based pensions would give retirees the living \nstandard they enjoyed before retirement.\n  Mr. President, given these facts about Social Security and the \ndecline in savings among Americans, it is crucial that steps be taken \nto ensure that the three-legged stool does not collapse under the \nweight of the growing retired population.\n  It is true that recent steps taken by Congress, particularly the 1996 \nenactment of the SIMPLE retirement plan, have succeed in increasing \nemployee participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans.\n  However, the complexity of qualification requirements under current \nlaw and the administrative expenses associated with setting up \nretirement plans, including the SIMPLE plan, remain significant \nimpediments to widespread implementation of these types of employer-\nbased retirement systems.\n  This is particularly true for small employers with less than 100 \nemployees, for whom the resulting benefits do not outweigh the \nadministrative costs. Consequently, only 42% of all individuals \nemployed by small businesses now participate in an employer-sponsored \nplan, as opposed to 78% of those who work for larger businesses.\n  To address this problem, I am introducing the Small Employer Nest Egg \nAct of 1998.\n  This legislation will create a new retirement option for small \nbusiness owners with 100 or fewer employees and it would be similar to \nthe SIMPLE plan\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\nand the SMART plan President Clinton proposed in his fiscal year 1999 \nbudget.\n  However, my proposal differs somewhat from these two plans in that it \nwould allow the same level of benefits--both to employers and \nemployees--as larger employers who maintain traditional qualified \nplans.\n  Furthermore, upon retirement or separation of service, employees \nwould receive 100% account value.\n  To offset the high costs associated with starting a pension plan, at \nthe centerpiece of this proposal is a tax cut equal to 50% of the \nadministrative and retirement education expenses incurred for the first \nfive years of a plan's operation.\n  In addition, participating businesses would be exempt from some of \nthe more burdensome administrative requirements associated with \nqualified plans.\n  That exemption would be in exchange for the employers' agreement to \nprovide a minimum benefit of 3% to all employees who satisfy a minimum \nage requirement of 21 years old and the minimum service requirement of \n1,000 hours during the preceding calendar year.\n  Mr. President, small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, \nproviding millions of jobs nationwide.\n  This bill I am introducing has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. It has also been endorsed by the National Association of \nWomen Small Business Owners and also of 220 small businesses in \nMinnesota alone. So it has very strong endorsement from the small \nbusiness community.\n  Small business owners want to help their employees to save for their \nretirement, yet many are unable to do so as a result of rigid \nGovernment policies that seemingly have little regard for the plight of \nthe small employer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to give small \nemployers the ability they have long sought to help their employees \nsave for their retirement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Baucus) (by \n        request):\n  S. 2131. A bill to provide for the conservation and development of \nwater and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                water resources development act of 1998\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, I join with Senators Warner \nand Baucus today to introduce the Administration's 1998 Water Resources \nDevelopment Act by request.\n  After 16 years of stalemate over the appropriate cost sharing of \nnavigation, flood control, environmental restoration, and other types \nof water projects, the Reagan administration and Congress were able to \nreach agreement on the landmark Water Resource Development Act \n(``WRDA'') of 1986. As a part of that important compromise there was a \ngeneral understanding that a two-year cycle of water project \nauthorization bills would be established. With the exception of 1994, \nthe administration and Congress have successfully worked together \ntoward that end.\n  It is time once again to continue the biennial water resources \nauthorization cycle with a 1998 WRDA. The bill we introduce today on \nbehalf of the administration represents an effort to identify \nworthwhile projects and policies in support of the Army Corps of \nEngineers Civil Works program.\n  I and other members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nwill conduct a thorough review of the administration's WRDA request, \nand the project and policy requests of individual Senators, to make \nsure that any bill reported to the full Senate later this year is \neconomically and environmentally justified.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is important to communities \nthroughout the nation. I look forward to working closely with \ncolleagues in the coming weeks to ensure enactment of WRDA '98.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2133. A bill to designate former United States Route 66 as \n``America's Main Street'' and authorize the Secretary of the Interior \nto provide assistance; to the Committee on energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                          ROUTE 66 LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Bingaman \nfrom New Mexico, I am pleased to introduce today what we will call the \nRoute 66 Preservation Act of 1998. Some here in the Senate may recall \nthat I introduced the Route 66 Study Act of 1990, which directed the \nNational Park Service to determine the best way to preserve, \ncommemorate and interpret ``America's Main Street''--Route 66.\n  Public Law 102-400 directed the National Park Service to conduct a \nstudy on the impact of that route, that highway on America's culture. \nThe study was completed in 1995, and addressed the feasibility of \npreserving what remains of the highway and the facilities associated \nwith it through private and public efforts.\n  Most nonprofit Route 66 organizations and other interested parties \npreferred preservation Alternative 5, asking for national recognition \nof Route 66 and partnerships between private and public groups for \npreservation. This bill is based on that alternative, and authorizes \nthe National Park Service to join with Federal, State and private \nefforts to preserve aspects of historic Route 66, the Nation's most \nimportant thoroughfare for east-west migration in the 20th century.\n  Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to \nSanta Monica, CA. The thoroughfare became the first completely paved \nhighway across the United States in 1938. It rolled through Illinois, \nMissouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. \nIn my home State of New Mexico, it went through the communities of \nTucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants, and Gallup.\n  The Legislation I am introducing today would have the National Park \nService designate an ``Office for Preservation of America's Main \nStreet'' with officials from the 8 affected States. The Preservation \nOffice would be authorized to:\n  Support State, local and private efforts to preserve Route 66 by \nproviding technical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, \nand making grants and loans;\n  Act as a clearing house for communication among Federal, State, local \nand private entities interested in the preservation of Route 66;\n  Assist States in determining the appropriation form of a non-Federal \nentity or entities to perform functions of the Preservation Office once \nit is terminated 10 years after enactment of this legislation; and,\n  Sponsor a road sign program on Route 66 to be implemented on a cost-\nsharing basis with State and local organizations.\n  Route 66 is really a modern-day equivalent to the Santa Fe Trail. I \nbelieve this bill will provide States and local communities a more \ntangible means of gaining Federal assistance to preserve aspects of \nRoute 66.\n  At one time, Route 66 was the most famous highway in the United \nStates. Now it is fading from the American landscape. If we want to \npreserve Route 66, it is now time to act.\n  Up to 500,000 Americans--one quarter of all entrants to California \nduring that era--migrated to California from the Dust Bowl on Route 66 \nfrom 1935 to 1940. John Steinbeck captured this journey and christened \nRoute 66 the ``Mother Road'' in his classic novel of the Depression: \n``The Grapes of Wrath.''\n  After World War II, another generation of Americans trekked across \nAmerica on Route 66, not to escape despair, but to embrace economic \nopportunities in the West. Songwriter Bobby Troup expressed the \nenthusiasm and sense of adventure of this generation in his song, ``Get \nYour Kicks on Route 66!''\n  Route 66 also allowed generations of vacationers to travel to \npreviously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures \nof the Southwest and Far West.\n  Route 66 began to decline with the enactment of the Interstate \nHighway Act in 1956. In 1984, the last federally designated portion of \nRoute 66 was decommissioned when interstate 40 was completed in \nArizona.\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\n  Hopefully, the Senate will join me in once again allowing another \ngeneration to ``get its kicks'' on Route 66.\n  The study has been completed, and now it is time to give the Park \nService some direction--let them set up a small office for the \npreservation of Route 66. The bill authorizes partnerships between the \nprivate sector, State entities and the Federal Government through \nexisting programs in an effort to preserve various aspects of this \nrather magnificent American roadway--Route 66.\n  Many songs have been written about it. Many dreams are described by \npeople who lived part of their lives there. Part of the Grapes of Wrath \ntook place on Route 66. I think before all of what remains of America's \nMain Street disappears, it is a good time to pass this kind of bill and \nsee if we can't preserve parts of it. Much is made of preserving \nhistoric things in the United States. It would be a shame, since there \nare so many people out there who care about this piece of American \nhistory and want to try to preserve the remnants of Route 66, if we did \nnot do something now to help them in that effort.\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support \nof this important legislation being introduced today by my friend \nSenator Domenici. The bill designates the old Highway 66 as ``America's \nMain Street'' and authorizes the National Park Service to help state, \ntribal and local governments in their efforts to preserve this unique \npiece of our national heritage.\n  Mr. President, Route 66 is more than a 2400-mile highway from Chicago \nto Los Angeles. In many ways it represents the American dream, the open \nroad, and our unending search for opportunity and adventure. This is \nthe ``Mother Road'' of John Steinbeck's classic 1939 novel ``The Grapes \nof Wrath.'' This is the road immortalized by Cole Porter and Jack \nKerouac. In the 1950s, this is the road that gave us the popular \ntelevision series ``Route 66.''\n  In my state of New Mexico, Route 66 ran nearly 400 miles from Glenrio \nin Quay County on the east to Manuelito in McKinley County on the West. \nBefore 1937, the road looped north through Santa Fe and Bernalillo and \nsouth through Isleta and Los Lunas. Many of us believe the state of New \nMexico has some of the most compelling scenery along the highway.\n  Mr. President, from the beginning Route 66 was intended to link \nAmerica's rural and urban areas. Much of the original roadway remains \nalong with those old classic filling stations, cafes, motels, and, of \ncourse, those unforgettable neon signs. Indeed, the old highway remains \nthe ``main street'' in many New Mexico cities, including Albuquerque, \nTucumcari, Santa Rosa, Bernalillo, Gallup, and Grants.\n  I think it is unfortunate that many drivers on our modern Interstate \n40 cross New Mexico without pausing to enjoy the nostalgia of the old \nhighway. That's why I am pleased that New Mexico is already working \naggressively to preserve and memorialize the old highway. The route in \nNew Mexico is now designated a scenic byway. Our state has worked hard \nto provide appropriate signage, and the familiar brown and white shield \nsigns are now prominent along the old route. A number of New Mexico \ntowns and pueblos have permanent exhibits on the history of Route 66 in \ntheir areas. The city of Tucumcari has a whimsical monument to Route 66 \nmodeled after a Cadillac tail fin. Soon there will be a Route 66 \ninterpretative center at the Pueblo of Acoma that will showcase the \nhistoric and cultural attractions of the region. A similar center is \nplanned for the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque.\n  Mr. President, Route 66 received its original designation in 1926 as \na result of the first national highway plan. Now, over seventy years \nlater, Congress has just passed a new highway bill that clearly \nrecognizes through the Enhancements and Scenic Byways Programs the \nimportance of preserving and protecting our national heritage. With the \nautomobile firmly entrenched in our culture today, highways such as \nRoute 66 are a genuine part of our heritage. This bill will help assure \nthat heritage is preserved. I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill with \nSenator Domenici, and I thank him for his efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2134. A bill to provide for air transportation between Denver, \nColorado, and London, England; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n                DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nto encourage the Secretary of the Department of Transportation to act \nexpeditiously in the interest of fairness and in support of the economy \nof my home state of Colorado.\n  I would like to explain the situation that causes me to make this \nproposal. There exists an agreement between the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom to allow US Airways to operate a direct flight from \nCharlotte, North Carolina, to Gatwick Airport in London, England. In \naccordance with fair and recognized practices, the airlines with \nestablished routes and time slots that have served Gatwick Airport for \nyears were not disturbed, and US Airways was given landing rights for a \ntime slot that is not currently occupied. Although it may not be US \nAirways' top choice, the time slot that has been allocated appears to \nbe commercially viable. US Airways, however, refuses to begin service \nunless they are given a better time slot at Gatwick. This request is \nbeyond the provisions of the approved agreement.\n  An unrelated agreement to allow British Airways to provide non-stop \nservice from Denver, Colorado, to London, England, is currently pending \napproval by the United States Department of Transportation. The \nDepartment has chosen to deliberately delay approval of the British \nAirways' agreement in order to pressure British Airways and the \nauthorities at Gatwick Airport to give US Airways the most desirable \ntime slots. The Department is simply holding the Denver-London flights \nhostage until the demands of US Airways are met. This is not proper use \nof the Department of Transportation's authority; it sets a negative \nprecedent for airline competition and cooperation between the United \nStates and Europe, and it is impacting the growth of Colorado's \neconomy.\n  The Secretary has been kind enough to meet with me personally, along \nwith my colleague from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, to \ndiscuss this issue. In spite of our concerns about Colorado, the \nDepartment still resists any effort to progress on the approval of the \nBritish Airways Denver-London flights. The date for beginning service \nwas postponed from June 1st to August 1st, and unfortunately British \nAirways will announce tomorrow that the delay in approval will preclude \nthem from starting service by August 1st. The start date for Denver-\nLondon direct service has been indefinitely postponed.\n  This postponement denies Colorado its first overseas international \nflight at Denver International Airport. It prohibits our tourism \nindustry from growing, especially during the upcoming ski season. It \nprevents increased competition that would result from connecting \nflights at DIA. It creates a problem for the employees in Denver who \nhave already been hired by British Airways, but who have no jobs.\n  I hope that the Department of Transportation takes immediate action \non the pending British Airways agreement, and I encourage my colleagues \nto support me and my efforts to ensure that the British Airways \nagreement is justly considered, and that Colorado is not harmed as the \nDepartment of Transportation deals with the separate concerns of US \nairways.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S.J. Res. 47. A joint resolution disapproving the extension of the \nwaiver authority contained in section 402(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \nwith respect to Vietnam; to the Committee of Finance.\n\n\n       Joint Resolution Disapproving Waiver Authority for Vietnam\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I am \nintroducing legislation to require Vietnam to provide freedom of \nemigration for the Vietnamese people before tax dollars from our \nconstituents across America are used to further expand our government's \ntrade relations with this communist regime. As provided for in the \nTrade Act of 1974, my resolution prohibits implementation of the \nPresident's decision yesterday to waive the freedom of emigration \nrequirements with Vietnam.\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\n  I am pleased that Senator Helms, the distinguished Chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, has joined me as a sponsor of this \njoint resolution, and I commend my colleague, Congressman Rohrabacher, \nfor introducing a companion measure in the House. I also note that our \nefforts are strongly supported by the Chairman of the House \nInternational Relations Committee, Congressman Gilman, the Chairman of \nthat Committee's panel on International Operations and Human Rights, \nCongressman Christopher Smith, and several other Members on both sides \nof the aisle in that chamber. Frankly, Mr. President, given the support \nfor this resolution by the relevant Committee chairmen, one has to \nquestion why the Administration moved forward on this in March of this \nyear and again yesterday. This is particularly troublesome given the \nfact that the President's own National Security Advisor stated this \npast December that the President would not move forward unless \nconsultations with Congress went well. Clearly, the consultations did \nnot go well.\n  When Congress considered and passed the amendment by Senator Jackson \nand Representative Vanik in the Trade Act of 1974, everyone at the time \nunderstood Congressional intent--free emigration was to be a condition \nfor expanding U.S. trade relations with non-market communist nations.\n  Today, nearly two and a half decades later, we do not have free \nemigration provided to the people of Vietnam by the communist regime \nthat took over that entire country by force in 1975. Moreover, the \nAdministration has failed to make a convincing case to the Congress to \njustify President Clinton's decision to waive freedom of emigration \nrequirements. Hanoi's record does not support this decision. Yes, Hanoi \nhas taken some steps to permit more orderly departures in recent years, \nbut there are still unwarranted delays, and I am very concerned that \nrecent promises and pledges of cooperation have yet to be \nsatisfactorily fulfilled.\n  Congressional intent was clear in 1974, and it has not changed since \nthat time. U.S. policy is supposed to put freedom of emigration ahead \nof the trade interests some might have with this one-party communist \nstate. We are supposed to be putting principle over profit, not the \nother way around.\n  I believe America should not abandon the Vietnamese people who long \nfor respect for human rights and democratic freedoms. They were \nabandoned over two decades ago, and we simply cannot let it happen \nagain. Jackson-Vanik requirements should not be waived for Vietnam if \nit is not absolutely clear that such a waiver would ``substantially \npromote'' freedom of emigration requirements as the law requires. This \npast March, State Department witnesses testified there had been \n``measurable'' progress. The term measurable does not imply to me that \nwe are seeing dramatic positive changes by Vietnam. I do not believe we \nhave seen ``significantly more rapid progress'' which was the standard \nset by Secretary of State Albright herself last year during her visit \nto Vietnam. And I fail to see how the President's first waiver for \nVietnam on March 9, 1998 has substantially promoted progress these past \nthree months. If more people had been permitted to leave Vietnam in the \nlast three months than we had seen over the last three years, then \nmaybe the waiver would have, indeed, substantially promoted progress, \nbut that has not happened, Mr. President, from what I have been told.\n  Today, as we introduce this joint resolution, there are still people \nin Vietnam who supported us and fought for us during the war who have \nnot been allowed to freely emigrate. Some of them have not even been \nallowed to meet with U.S. officials for interviews. I understand that \nothers have been forced to pay exorbitant bribes in order to be \nconsidered for exit visas.\n  Under the Trade Act of 1974, Congress has an opportunity to ensure \nthat freedom of emigration requirements are met by Vietnam before \nfurther trade benefits are extended. The joint resolution introduced \ntoday by myself and Senator Helms provides my colleagues the \nopportunity to go on record in support of the people of Vietnam. If you \nwant to send a message to the Government of Vietnam that they must \nfully comply with the promises and commitments they have made in recent \nyears, this is the way to do it.\n  Additionally, for those of my colleagues who continue to be \nconcerned, as I am, that Hanoi has not been fully forthcoming in their \naccounting for American POWs and MIAs, and their progress on human \nrights, then you should support this resolution. Some of my colleagues \nmay recall that both the POW/MIA issue and human rights concerns were, \nindeed, central to the provisions first adopted in the Trade Act of \n1974, and so it is appropriate that these concerns are made part of the \ncurrent debate as well.\n  How far must we go, Mr. President, to embrace this communist regime \nbefore they fully address our long-standing concerns on all these \nimportant issues? I am certain that the time has come once again for \nCongress to go on record in support of the objectives behind this \nresolution.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would note that the resolution we are \nintroducing today is strongly supported by numerous organizations of \nVietnamese-Americans, many of our national veterans and POW/MIA family \norganizations, several international refugee organizations, and a host \nof other concerned groups of Americans.\n  I look forward to the forthcoming debate on this timely and important \nissue.\n\n

HIS DECISION TO BE \nFORMALLY RECEIVED IN TIANANMEN SQUARE BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Ashcroft) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 101\n\n       Whereas nine years ago on June 4, 1989, thousands of \n     Chinese students peacefully gathered in Tiananmen Square to \n     demonstrate their support for freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas it was with horror that the world witnessed the \n     response of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     as tanks and military units marched into Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas Chinese soldiers of the People's Republic of China \n     were ordered to fire machine guns and tanks on young, unarmed \n     civilians;\n       Whereas ``children were killed holding hands with their \n     mothers,'' according to a reliable eyewitness account:\n       Whereas according to the same eyewitness account, \n     ``students were crushed by armored personnel carriers'';\n       Whereas more than 2,000 Chinese pro-democracy demonstrators \n     died that day, according to the Chinese Red cross;\n       Whereas hundreds continue to languish in prisons because of \n     their belief in freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas nine years after the massacre on June 4, 1989, the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China has yet to \n     acknowledge the Tiananmen Square massacre; and\n       Whereas, being formally received in Tiananmen Square, the \n     President would bestow legitimacy on the Chinese government's \n     horrendous actions of 9 years ago: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     President should reconsider his decision to be formally \n     received in Tiananmen Square until the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China acknowledges the Tiananmen Square \n     massacre, pledges that such atrocities will never happen \n     again, and releases those Chinese students still imprisoned \n     for supporting freedom and democracy that day.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Congress that the President of the United States \nshould reconsider his decision to be formally received in Tiananmen \nSquare by the Government of the People's Republic of China.\n  I submit this resolution, Mr. President, because I am convinced that \nthe President of the United States, the leader of the world's first \nfree nation and indeed of the free world, should not give the slightest \nreason for anyone to believe that he or the United States has forgotten \nthe crimes against liberty and humanity committed by the communist \nregime in Beijing.\n  As we mark the ninth anniversary of the massacre of pro-democracy \ndemonstrators in Tiananmen square, I think it is important that we \nconsider our own role in bringing those students, mothers, fathers and \nchildren into the streets to demand their freedom. We must never \nforget, in my view, that it was to the United States, the birthplace of \nfreedom, that these brave people looked in seeking a new path for \nChina.\n  ``The Goddess of Democracy''--our own Lady Liberty--and our \nDeclaration of Independence were, despite long-standing government \nbans, constantly on the minds and in the hearts of those who demanded \nfreedom and democracy.\n  The shot fired at Lexington and Concord continues to be heard round \nthe world. The natural human desire for freedom, for the liberty to \nworship, to enjoy the fruits of one's labor, to tend one's family and \ncommunity, will not die, despite the tanks and armored personnel \ncarriers of a despotic regime.\n  We have a responsibility in my view, Mr. President, to stand up for \nthe principles on which our nation was founded, the principles that \nbrought virtually all of our ancestors to these shores, the principles \nthat won the cold war and that continue to fire the hearts of all \npeoples the world over.\n  Now is the time for President Clinton to stand up for these \nprinciples. More than 2,000 freedom loving people, including children \nholding their mother's hands, were killed by the communist Chinese \ngovernment in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of innocent men and women \ncontinue to be held under inhuman conditions simply for standing up for \nfreedom, democracy, and the truth of individual human dignity. And the \nCommunist regime in Beijing continues to claim that it was right to act \nso brutally in putting down what it calls a ``counter revolutionary \nriot.''\n  Now is not the time, Mr. President, to greet Chinese officials in \nTiananmen Square. Now is the time to speak out for the oppressed, those \nwho have died and those who are imprisoned for their beliefs.\n  I have submitted this resolution because I believe it would be \ninappropriate, and a show of disrespect for those who have died for \nfreedom, for our President to be formally received in Tiananmen Square \nby the Chinese Communist Government.\n  It is my hope that the President will heed this call to stand with \nthe people of China, to uphold the principles of our nation, and to say \nnot to tyranny.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by \nseveral human rights, religious, and pro-family leaders urging the \nPresident to reconsider his decision to go to Tiananmen Square be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                         Washington, May 20, 1998.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Nine years ago, thousands of Chinese \n     students peacefully gathered in Tiananmen Square to show \n     their admiration of democracy. It was with horror that the \n     world witnessed the response of China's government as tanks \n     and military units marched into the square. Hundreds of \n     students died that day. Hundreds more continue to languish in \n     prisons for their belief in democracy. That day remains vivid \n     in the minds of Americans across the political spectrum.\n       Therefore, we were deeply disturbed when we received the \n     news that you will be officially recognized in Tiananmen \n     Square during your upcoming visit to China. Although the \n     signatories of this letter are often in disagreement over \n     U.S. public policy, we are united in our passion for the \n     founding words of this country: ``All men are created equal \n     [and] . . . are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable rights . . . [and] among these are life, liberty, \n     and the pursuit of happiness. . . .'' These words, we \n     believe, apply not just to Americans but to all men and \n     women. No lasting gain can be achieved by tarnishing the very \n     principles that we, as Americans, hold dear.\n       By being formally received in Tiananmen Square, Mr. \n     President, you are bestowing legitimacy to the ground where \n     innocent blood was needlessly shed. Nine years after the \n     massacre on June 4, 1989, Beijing has yet to acknowledge that \n     dreadful moment or the lives that were cruelly and \n     arbitrarily taken. We ask that you reconsider your decision \n     to go to Tiananmen Square until China's regime expresses \n     regret and releases those still imprisoned for their brave \n     stand.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gary L.

Res. 242\n\n       Whereas the President has pledged that the United States \n     ``must remain a champion'' of the liberties of the Chinese \n     people;\n       Whereas two of the most notable Chinese dissidents, Wang \n     Dan and Wei Jingsheng, effectively have been exiled from \n     their country;\n       Whereas thousands of other individuals remain imprisoned in \n     China and Tibet for peacefully expressing their beliefs and \n     exercising their inalienable rights, including freedom of \n     association, freedom of speech, and freedom of conscience;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     routinely, systematically, and massively continues to commit \n     widespread human rights abuses in Tibet, including instances \n     of death in detention, torture, arbitrary arrest, \n     imprisonment for the peaceful expression of religious and \n     political views, and intensified controls on the freedom of \n     speech and the press, particularly for ethnic Tibetans;\n       Whereas China has taken extraordinary steps to avoid the \n     condemnation of the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the President has failed to press China \n     aggressively to protect the civil liberties of the Chinese \n     people and failed even to sponsor a resolution at the meeting \n     of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights condemning \n     China's human rights violations, which include forced \n     abortion, summary execution, arbitrary imprisonment, and \n     persecution of religious minorities;\n       Whereas since November 1994, the President has declared \n     annually a national emergency regarding the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and stated that such \n     proliferation poses ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to \n     the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the \n     United States'';\n       Whereas, in a June 1997 report on proliferation activity, \n     the Central Intelligence Agency identified China as ``the \n     most significant supplier of weapons of mass destruction-\n     related goods and technology'', including missile, nuclear, \n     and chemical weapons technology to rogue states such as Iran;\n       Whereas United States satellite cooperation with China has \n     benefited China's intercontinental ballistic missile \n     program--missiles with nuclear warheads pointed at the United \n     States, and the Department of Justice is investigating \n     possible missile technology transfers to China resulting from \n     United States-Chinese satellite cooperation;\n       Whereas the President's decision to waive restrictions on \n     the export to China of missile technology similar to that \n     under investigation by the Department of Justice, and the \n     President's efforts to lift the requirements for launch \n     waivers altogether, undermine the present Justice Department \n     investigation and threatens United States national security;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice is investigating possible \n     campaign contributions from the People's Liberation Army to \n     the Democratic National Committee through contributions from \n     an executive at China Aerospace International Holdings, an \n     affiliate of China Aerospace Corporation, the firm which \n     oversees China's missile development and space programs;\n       Whereas China made written commitments to the United States \n     during the October 1997 summit to terminate nuclear \n     cooperation with Iran and was later reported to be violating \n     that pledge by attempting to provide Iran with hundreds of \n     tons of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, a material for use in \n     Iran's nuclear weapons complex to enrich uranium to weapons \n     grade;\n       Whereas the President, in allowing nuclear cooperation to \n     proceed with China, certified that ``the People's Republic of \n     China has provided clear and unequivocal assurances to the \n     United States that it is not assisting and will not assist \n     any nonnuclear-weapon state, either directly or indirectly, \n     in acquiring nuclear explosive devices or the material and \n     components for such devices'';\n       Whereas the credibility of this certification is undermined \n     by China's continuing proliferation activity, including \n     efforts to assist Iran's nuclear weapons program;\n       Whereas since the United States normalized trade relations \n     with China in 1979, China has risen from the 57th to 4th \n     largest supplier of United States imports;\n       Whereas China's trade and investment practices have \n     resulted in a 1997 trade deficit of $49,700,000,000, an \n     imbalance more than 2.5 times larger than the United States \n     trade deficit with all European countries, and accounting for \n     one-fourth of the United States trade deficit with the entire \n     world;\n       Whereas in the Executive branch's 1997 National Trade \n     Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers, China's trade regime was \n     identified as ``political'', ``severely restricted'', \n     ``prohibitive'', ``unpredictable'', ``preferential'', ``de \n     facto'', ``unpublished'', ``vague'', ``inaccessible'', \n     ``inconsistent'', and ``noncompetitive'';\n       Whereas facing Congress's near withdrawal of most-favored \n     nation (MFN) status in 1991 and President Bush's threat of \n     sanctions, China, in order to keep MFN status and have the \n     United States support its accession to the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO), agreed that it would allow the United \n     States automobile sector to compete freely in the Chinese \n     market and that, by December 31, 1997, it would eliminate \n     significant trade barriers to United States agricultural \n     exports;\n       Whereas China's trade liberalization commitments in 1991 \n     have not been honored, yet the Executive branch is moving \n     forward in negotiations for China to accede to the WTO;\n       Whereas concessions made by China in negotiations to accede \n     to the WTO have been piecemeal, inconsistent, and deficient, \n     and thus limit the economic opportunity of United States \n     businesses and workers;\n       Whereas Taiwan serves as an example of democratic \n     governance to China and the authoritarian Chinese communist \n     party;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China carried out missile \n     exercises in 1995 and 1996 intended to intimidate the people \n     of Taiwan, continues a military buildup directed at the \n     island, refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, \n     and consistently seeks to isolate Taipei from membership in \n     international organizations and general relations with other \n     countries;\n       Whereas the Chinese communist party has undermined the \n     institutions of democratic government in Hong Kong by \n     abolishing Hong Kong's elected legislature, designing a \n     framework for legislative elections that severely limits \n     representative democracy, and passing retroactive legislation \n     exempting Chinese entities from a host of Hong Kong's laws; \n     and\n       Whereas the Democratic Party of Hong Kong won every seat \n     elected by direct ballot in Hong Kong, garnering over 60 \n     percent of the popular vote, yet President Clinton has\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\n     declined to meet individually with the leadership of the \n     Democratic Party of Hong Kong: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, in the interest of improving United States-\n     China relations, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) a healthy and stable relationship with China is in the \n     national interests of the United States;\n       (2) the Chinese people should be allowed to freely exercise \n     their unalienable rights, including the rights to freedom of \n     speech, of religion, and of association;\n       (3) efforts by the Chinese government to restrict those \n     liberties pose a threat to a stable China and a positive \n     long-term relationship with the United States;\n       (4) the President should submit a report to Congress as \n     soon as possible after the proposed summit in China \n     concerning his progress in securing the release of persons \n     remaining imprisoned in China and Tibet and other significant \n     steps to improve human rights;\n       (5) China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     technology poses an unusual threat to the national security \n     of the United States;\n       (6) the President has failed to confront China's \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction technology, \n     proliferation that is directly responsible for contributing \n     to an escalating nuclear arms race between India and \n     Pakistan;\n       (7) the trustworthiness of the Chinese government is \n     undermined when nonproliferation and trade commitments of \n     Chinese officials are repeatedly broken;\n       (8) the President, in addition to applauding narrow trade \n     concessions from China, should ensure that the highest levels \n     of diplomacy are used to open the entire Chinese market to \n     United States trade and investment;\n       (9) China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     should be conditioned on China's compliance with past market \n     access commitments and further steps to open China's market \n     to United States investment and trade in goods and services;\n       (10) the United States should not jeopardize cooperation \n     with and assistance to the democratic government of Taiwan to \n     appease the Chinese government but instead should maintain \n     unambiguously its legal commitments to help maintain Taiwan's \n     capacity for self-defense while calling upon the Chinese \n     government to renounce the use of force against the people of \n     Taiwan;\n       (11) the preservation of democratic government and rule of \n     law in Hong Kong is an obligation of the Chinese government \n     and failure to honor that obligation will have a negative \n     effect on United States policy toward China;\n       (12) China is resisting the spread of democracy in Asia, \n     which is occurring from South Korea to Indonesia, and the \n     failure of President Clinton to meet with the leaders of the \n     Democratic Party of Hong Kong undermines his statement to \n     President Jiang that China's repressive government is ``on \n     the wrong side of history''; and\n       (13) the President should not go to China to attend a \n     summit with President Jiang until--\n       (A) the President has provided a full disclosure to \n     Congress concerning the transfer of United States satellite \n     and missile technology to China; and\n       (B) United States policy toward China in general has been \n     formulated more effectively to protect United States national \n     security, economic, and human rights interests.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is fitting on this day, the \nninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, to submit this \nresolution calling for the President to delay his trip to China. With \nallegations swirling about China's efforts to influence U.S. elections, \nand with the hard evidence we do have of China's continuing \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction technologies, rewarding \nChina with a summit visit is sending the wrong signal at the wrong \ntime.\n  There is perhaps nothing more indicting than a vote in the United \nStates Congress that the actions of a Commander-in-Chief were not in \nthe national interest. And yet, that is precisely what the House of \nRepresentatives did on May 20, 1998. By a vote of 417 to 4, the House \nvoted that the President's decision in February 1998 to allow the \nexport of satellite technology to China was ``not in the national \ninterest.'' The Justice Department reportedly protested the waiver, \nexpressing concern that it would undermine an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation of a possible satellite technology transfer that occurred \nin 1996.\n  What is just as troubling is the possible link between the export of \nU.S. satellite technology and political donations from China's People's \nLiberation Army (PLA). Liu Chao-ying, an officer in the PLA, gave \nJohnny Chung--one of the central figures in the Administration's \nfundraising scandal--$300,000 to funnel into democratic coffers in the \n1995-96 election cycle. Ms. Liu just happens to be a senior manager and \nvice president in the China Aerospace conglomerate, Beijing's state-\nowned company that oversees China's missile development and space \nlaunch programs.\n  The White House says it did not know the source of Mr. Chung's \nfunding. I question how diligently Administration officials and \ndemocratic fundraisers wanted to know. Warnings from the National \nSecurity Council as to the intentions of Mr. Chung, described by one \nofficial as a ``hustler,'' went unheeded. Senator Thompson's \nfundraising investigation describe in careful detail how the Democratic \nNational Committee dismantled its vetting process for contributions. \nMr. Chung himself visited the White House 49 times. This was not a \nsuperficial relationship. This man was a regular guest of the \nAdministration.\n  The recent scandals surrounding satellite technology transfers and \nChinese efforts to influence U.S. elections are only the latest, \ntroubling signs that this Administration's China policy is an abysmal \nfailure. As Harry Wu said at this morning's press conference to \ncommemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre, appeasement does not bring \npeace.\n  Appeasement is precisely what this Administration's China policy has \nbecome. China announces it will not conduct an inquiry into the \nTiananmen Square massacre, yet President Clinton begins his summit at \nthis site, where possibly thousands of Chinese were killed. In Hong \nKong, President Clinton will not meet individually with Martin Lee, the \nleader of pro-democracy forces in the former colony whose Democratic \nParty won over 60% of the popular vote in the May 24 elections. China \nis identified by the CIA as the world's worst proliferator of weapons \nof mass destruction technology, proliferation activity that has \ncontributed directly to the spiraling arms race between India and \nPakistan. Yet the Administration rewards China with a nuclear \ncooperation agreement that will send America's best reactor technology \nto China. China repeatedly breaks commitments to open its market to \nU.S. businesses, yet the President renews MFN year after year.\n  This Administration apparently will overlook any offense to our \nnation's principles and security to continue the bankrupt policy of \nengaging communist China. China points nuclear missiles at the U.S., \nand PLA officers describe the United States as China's ``international \narchenemy.'' Yet the Administration allows advanced satellite and \nmissile technology to be sent to China which a Pentagon memo says \nharmed U.S. national security.\n  China's actions, and this Administration's response to those actions, \nhas set the U.S.-China relationship on a gravely dangerous course. It \nis time for a fundamental reevaluation of U.S. China policy. This \nresolution will provide a good start. This resolution outlines the \nareas of concern in our policy toward China, from human rights to \nnational security to trade matters. In contrast to how U.S.-China \nrelations have been administered for the last six years, a sound \nrelationship between our two countries must be based on integrity, \nresponsibility, and mutual respect.\n  China's behavior across the board has not given any basis for this \nAdministration to pursue a ``strategic partnership'' with Beijing. \nAppeasement will not bring peace. This Administration obviously did not \nlearn the lessons of the Cold War. China is an aggressive power that \nseeks regional hegemony. Extending MFN trade status in exchange for a \n$50 billion trade deficit, sending China our best nuclear reactor \ntechnology in exchange for Chinese weapons proliferation, and beginning \nthe summit at Tiananmen Square when China continues to imprison its \npeople is not the kind of policy that will bring mutual respect and \npeace in East Asia.\n  I call on the President to delay his trip to China until questions \nsurrounding satellite technology transfer have been answered and U.S. \nChina policy has been formulated more effectively to protect American \ninterests. Senator Hutchinson is joining me as a cosponsor of this \nresolution, and I appreciate his tremendous work in this area. This \nresolution is designed to send a signal to the Chinese government and \nthe victims of its repression that there are limits to the tolerance of \nChina's appalling human rights record, continuing trade obstructionism, \nand destabilizing proliferation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5640-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 243--CONGRATULATING THE UNVIERSITY OF NEVADA-LAS \n VEGAS MEN'S GOLF TEAM ON WINNING THE TEAM'S FIRST NATIONAL COLLEGIATE \n                   ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. BRYAN (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 243\n\n       Whereas the University of Nevada Las Vegas Rebels men's \n     golf team shot four rounds of golf at a total of 1118 strokes \n     for a total of 34 under par, to beat the second place Clemson \n     Tigers by three strokes;\n       Whereas this score of 34 under par set a tournament record \n     by 11 strokes;\n       Whereas Chris Berry shot a total of 272 strokes for 16 \n     under par to finish second in individual competition, to help \n     ensure the championship for the Rebels;\n       Whereas the University of Nevada Las Vegas men's collegiate \n     golf team has displayed outstanding dedication, teamwork, and \n     sportsmanship throughout the course of the season in \n     achieving collegiate golf's highest honor; and\n       Whereas the Rebels have brought pride and honor to the \n     State of Nevada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the University of Nevada Las Vegas for winning \n     the 1998 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I \n     men's collegiate national golf championship;\n       (2) commends Chris Berry, for his second place individual \n     finish at the National Collegiate Athletic Association golf \n     championship;\n       (3) recognizes the achievements of all the players, \n     coaches, and staff who were instrumental in helping the \n     University of Nevada Las Vegas win the 1998 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's collegiate \n     national golf championship and invites them to the Capitol to \n     be honored in an appropriate manner to be determined;\n       (4) requests that the President recognize the \n     accomplishments and achievements of the 1998 University of \n     Nevada Las Vegas Rebels golf team and invite the team to \n     Washington, D.C. for the traditional White House ceremony \n     held for national championship teams; and\n       (5) directs the Secretary of the Senate to make available \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to the University of \n     Nevada Las Vegas for appropriate display and to transmit an \n     enrolled copy to each member of the 1998 University of Nevada \n     Las Vegas National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I \n     men's collegiate national championship golf team.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am proud to take the floor today to \ncommend and congratulate the University of Nevada-Las Vegas men's golf \nteam on winning the team's first National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation championship. This remarkable team of student-athletes \nacquitted themselves with great distinction this past week as they \nachieved this singular honor for themselves, for the community, and for \nthe State of Nevada.\n  This accomplishment is further embellished by the fact the team shot \n4 rounds of golf 34 under par, which set a tournament record by 11 \nstrokes.\n  Chris Berry, one of the team members, shot a total of 272 for 16 \nunder par, to finish second in the individual competition. What makes \nChris' success even all the more noteworthy is that Chris had been \ninvolved in tournament play previous years where he had the misfortune \nof finishing at the other end and he, through determination and hard \nwork, achieved this remarkable athletic achievement.\n  Congratulations should also go to the rest of his teammates, Bill \nLunde, Charley Hoffman, Jeremy Anderson and Scott Lander. Bill Lunde \nand Jeremy Anderson made the All American college golf team. This golf \nteam has had the goof fortune of being under the direction of an \nextraordinarily gifted coach as well. Dwaine Knight has placed the \nuniversity's golf program on the national map. They have, in recent \nyears, been top competitors, but not until this year did they achieve \nthe ultimate, and that is the collegiate championship. Coach Knight is \nably assisted by Assistant Coach Casey Whalen.\n  This year, under their coaching staff, the Rebels have won seven \ntournaments. The only other sports team in UNLV's history to attain \nnational collegiate championship was in 1990, when the men's basketball \nprogram was so honored in the Final Four, in Denver, CO.\n  UNLV completed its season No. 1 in the polls, and I have encouraged \nthe President to invite this extraordinarily able student athletic team \nto come to the White House and be appropriately recognized. The \nPresident himself is a golfer of note and distinction, and I am sure \nthese fine young men are going to be able to offer a few tips the \nPresident might take advantage of to improve his own golf game.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5642-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5642-S5643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   THURMOND AMENDMENTS NOS. 2447-2449\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. THURMOND submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill (S. 2057) to authorize appropriations for the fiscal \nyear 1999 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for \nmilitary construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \nEnergy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Political Freedom in China \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. ____. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups * * * experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, like many of my colleagues I am \ndeeply concerned about the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and \nPakistan. The leaders of these two nations acted with disregard and \nboth countries must be shown that such actions are unacceptable. No \nnation should think that it can conduct secret nuclear tests and not be \nheld accountable. The United States and the international community \nwill continue to impose sanctions on both countries, causing further \neconomic hardship for these impoverished populations. However, I \nbelieve we can do much more to prevent further testing.\n  India and Pakistan are two of the three nations who were suspected of \nhaving nuclear capability which had not joined the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty (CTBT). Now, both countries should be pressured to sign the \ntreaty immediately. In Tuesday's New York Times, Stanford Professor \nSidney Drell stated a compelling argument for United States \nratification of the CTBT, and I ask that the attached article be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. I agree with \nDrell's sentiment that, rather than pointing to India's and Pakistan's \ntests as reason for inaction, the Senate should immediately take up and \napprove the treaty. I feel strongly that Senate ratification would make \nour efforts to dissuade India and Pakistan from an arms race much more \ncredible, and would send a message to any other nations considering \ntests of their own. Of course, the US and the international community \nshould concentrate on facilitating the dialog necessary between Indian \nand Pakistan to diffuse the points of contention currently driving this \narms race, and ratification of the CTBT will help to shift that focus.\n  Additionally, the best way for India and Pakistan to address the \nsanctions resulting from their irresponsible nuclear tests is to sign \nthe CTBT, without conditions. Instead of spending scarce resources on a \nnuclear arms race, we must convince the leadership\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\nof both countries to rebuild their economies and improve the standard \nof living for the people, something that obviously has not been the \ncase for either India or Pakistan. Urging them to sign the treaty would \nbe one step in the right direction. Treaty ratification is also a \nnecessary step for restricting the flow of nuclear technology, from \nthese emerging nuclear powers and nations worldwide.\n  I urge Senator Lott to take up consideration of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, and I urge all of my Senate colleagues to vote for a \nban on nuclear testing by the United States. The United States must \nlead by example. We did not do enough to prevent the nuclear tests by \nIndia or Pakistan, and now we must do more to ensure that further \ntesting is halted in South Asia and throughout the world. President \nClinton is scheduled to travel to China and South Asia later this year. \nI believe such a diplomatic mission is extremely timely and must \ninclude visits to China, India and Pakistan for the distinct purpose of \ndiscussing global security in light of the round of nuclear capacity \ntesting in the region. I encourage my Senate colleagues to support the \nPresident in this endeavor.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 2, 1998]\n\n                    Reasons To Ratify, Not To Stall\n\n                          (By Sidney D. Drell)\n\n       Stanford, Calif.--The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan \n     have led some in the United States Senate to seek further \n     delay on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which has already \n     been awaiting ratification for more than a year and a half. \n     Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said \n     on Friday that ``the nuclear spiral in Asia demonstrates that \n     irrelevance of U.S. action'' on the treaty, calling the pact \n     ``unverifiable and ineffectual.''\n       To the contrary, the treaty's international monitoring \n     system, when used in combination with our own intelligence \n     resources, provides the means to verify the test ban \n     effectively. Moreover, a quick vote in the Senate approving \n     the treaty is an essential response to the South Asian \n     nuclear gambit.\n       While it is true that American intelligence failed to \n     provide imminent warning of India's first three nuclear tests \n     on May 11, we were well aware that the technical preparations \n     had been made for testing. Furthermore, the global network of \n     seismic sensors that will form the core of the treaty's \n     verification system did detect, locate and identify the main \n     nuclear blast that day.\n       It is evident that the system also proved effective in \n     detecting Pakistan's tests, both on Thursday and on Saturday. \n     And the treaty calls for the monitoring system to be beefed \n     up. Also, the treaty would allow us to request a short-\n     notice, on-site suggesting that a nuclear weapons test might \n     have occurred.\n       India has claimed that its last two announced tests, on May \n     13, had very low yields, in the subkiloton range. Whether or \n     not we succeed in corroborating possible tests of such \n     relatively small magnitude, we need to remember that very low \n     yield tests are of questionable value in designing new \n     nuclear weapons or confirming that a new design will work as \n     intended. Any failure by the monitors to detect such tests is \n     not the proper benchmark for determining the system's--or the \n     treaty's--effectiveness.\n       I know from my own work for the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, George Tenet, that the existing monitoring \n     system did the job last summer, detecting a ``seismic event'' \n     off Novaya Zemlya in Russia and eventually helping to \n     determine that it was not from a nuclear test. Our \n     intelligence services are rightly assigned the task of \n     monitoring for nuclear explosions, with or without the \n     treaty. But with the treaty, additional sensors would be \n     deployed in a global network that would complement our own \n     intelligence. Some of these additional sensors would be \n     ``aimed'' at the subcontinent. And with the treaty, we could \n     request onsite inspection of suspicious activities.\n       The test ban treaty--which has already been signed by 149 \n     nations and ratified by our nuclear allies, Britain and \n     France--provides the legal framework for a long-term solution \n     to the problem of nuclear testing in India and Pakistan. The \n     best way for these two nations to begin addressing the \n     international condemnation and sanctions that have resulted \n     from their tests is for them to sign the treaty, without \n     condition. Senate ratification would strengthen our hand in \n     pushing India and Pakistan toward a responsible course, and \n     it would help dissuade other states from going down the \n     dangerous road of developing nuclear weapons.\n       Senator Lott also expressed concern that the treaty ``will \n     not enter into force unless 44 countries, including India and \n     Pakistan, ratify it.'' Precisely for this reason, Article 14 \n     of the treaty calls for a review conference in September 1999 \n     to look for ways to put the treaty into effect if it has not \n     been approved by all 44 nuclear-capable nations (i.e., those \n     with nuclear weapons or with nuclear reactors for research or \n     power).\n       Only those nations that have ratified will have a seat at \n     that conference. Thus the United States must ratify the \n     treaty this year if we are to be a leader, as we must be, in \n     an effort to put the treaty into force.\n       Previous Senates have shown that they can act quickly and \n     courageously on such matters. When President John F. Kennedy \n     submitted the Limited Test Ban Treaty to the Senate in 1963, \n     the Foreign Relations Committee held its first hearing four \n     days later, and the treaty was approved by the full Senate in \n     less than two months.\n       Yet in the wake of the Indian and Pakistani tests, it would \n     appear that the Senate will not act even to bring the treaty \n     to a vote. Inaction will not help to deter further nuclear \n     tests or reduce nuclear dangers. Rather than pointing to \n     India's and Pakistan's tests as an excuse for inaction, the \n     Senate should be approving the treaty without delay.\n       Four decades ago President Dwight D. Eisenhower said that \n     not achieving a nuclear test ban ``would have to be classed \n     as the greatest disappointment of any administration--of any \n     decade--of any time and of any party.'' It would be tragic if \n     once more we fail to seize this opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5653-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5654-S5655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONFLICT IN THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the newspapers are full of \nKosovo and Serbia, of India and Pakistan and of course, Indonesia. \nThese threatening events have captured most of the headlines and have \nattracted the attention of the Administration in greater or lesser \ndegrees. These are not trivial issues, and we cannot afford to ignore \ntheir importance for challenging US interests.\n  But another conflict rages that, while small, challenges US interests \nin ways that few other conflicts can: I am speaking of the conflict in \nthe Republic of Georgia in the distant but strategically critical \nregion of Abkazia.\n  And yet the stability in independent Georgia is one of the principal \nUS interests in the former USSR and should be one of our overriding \nstrategic goals. This is not just sentiment for one of the earliest \nChristian civilizations in a part of the world where Christian \ncivilizations do not thrive: rather it is a clear statement of our own \nstrategic interest and objectives.\n  Georgia is a NATO borderland and an entry point to the emerging new \nSilk Road. It is a key ally of our partner Turkey and is important in \nmany ways: strategically, militarily, commercially. If Georgia were to \nbecome unstable, the entire region would be put in jeopardy.\n  Against overwhelming odds, Georgia has achieved strong positive \neconomic growth in the last few years. It is one of the most stable of \nthe post-Soviet states, with world-class leadership in President Eduard \nShevardnadze. It is America's natural ally in a neighborhood that \nfeatures Iran and Iraq.\n  Georgia is central to the successful development of what the new Silk \nRoad from Central Europe to China. This ambitious project will \neventually encompass pipelines, roads and railroads, airports and \ncommunications networks that stretch from Central Europe to China. This \ncorridor will completely alter the economics and the politics of \nEurasia in ways that we cannot now foresee, but which are certain to \nintersect US strategic interests in Eurasia in many places. The states \nof the Caucasus--Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia--lie at the very \ncenter of this new Silk Road. For the corridor to function, stability \nin these states is essential.\n  Not surprisingly, some people wish ardently to jeopardize America's \ninterests in this region by threatening Georgia's stability, and they \nhave fastened on a perverse way of doing so. the small, break-away \nregion of Abkazia has been Russia's best available instrument to \ndiminish Georgia's accomplishments and to imperil its remarkable gains. \nRussia is the only power to benefit from such activity. Let us not be \ntimid in naming the problem: Russia is the problem, the aggressor and \nthe single-most threat to stability in Georgia and the entire Caucasus.\n  Since the early 1990s, Russia, acting through Abkazia, has attempted \nto bring down Georgia. This is no secret. Virtually every expert to \ntravel to the region reports the same thing: Russia is responsible for \narming, training and sustaining Abkazia's so-called freedom fighters. \nRussia's support for the pro-Russian Abkazian leadership is barely \ndisguised: Russia has funneled arms and support for more than six years \ninto the Abkaz region of Georgia for one specific task: to destabilize \nthe government of Eduard Shevardnadze so that Georgia will be unable to \nrealize\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nits goals of being independent, of joining the community of free \ndemocratic nations, and of providing better lives--free lives--for the \npeople of Georgia.\n  It is high time the Administration took a strong position on the \nsubject of the Caucasus and of Georgia in particular. So far, it has \nnot only failed to reign in Russian efforts against Georgia, but by \nthis very failure, it has insured that the Russian-promoted \ndestabilization efforts will continue.\n  Administartion apathy on this subject is best illustrated by the \nastonishing lack of urgency that the State Department ascribes to \nplacing qualified and dynamic ambassadors in these countries. Georgia \nhas been without a U.S. ambassador for well over six months. No \ncandidate has yet been identified, let alone brought to the Senate for \nconfirmation, despite persistent and forceful requests by President \nShevardnadze and other key leaders in Georgia for such an appointment.\n  The Administration has also been supporting the Russian ``mediation'' \nof the Abkaz conflict: this policy must be reversed. Russian \n``mediation'' consists of injecting Russian peacekeepers into the \nregion to separate the Georgian and Abkaz combatants. Their behavior in \nthe recent fighting in Abkazia shows their true intentions: the best \ncase scenario shows that the Russian peacekeeping forces did nothing to \ninterdict the flow of separatist personnel and heavy weaponry into the \nregion where the fighting was taking place. The worst case scenario has \nthem actually providing weapons to the Abkaz combatants. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Allowing continued Russian control over this situation is tantamount \nto inserting the fox's first cousin as a mediator between the foxes and \nthe hens. The current situation insures that Georgia can only lose. It \nis time for the Administration to demand the removal of the bogus \nRussian peacekeepers, and to insist on their replacement by an \nindependent force of peacekeepers. To do less is to acknowledge \nimplicitly that Georgia remains within Russia's sphere of control.\n  This matter also raises the issue of the continued presence of \nRussian military bases in Georgia. They are there despite the \noverwhelming opposition of Georgian citizens. These bases were \nestablished at a time when Georgia was in no position to repulse \nRussian advances. Russia has no legitimate national security claim on \nGeorgia. Russia is no less safe--indeed it is safer--with a Georgia \nthat is free, independent, democratic and with free markets close to \nits southern border. These bases--from which the perpetrators of the \nassassination attempts on President Shevardnadze are reported to have \nfled--must be closed. The United States must not accept the notion that \nGeorgian independence can only be secured by Russian power. Nothing \ncould be more alien to the truth and to our national values.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Administration to state \nunequivocally that the stability and survival of an independent Georgia \nis a fundamental U.S. interest. That Russia's collusion with the Abkaz \nis nothing less than Moscow's effort to maintain control over sovereign \nGeorgia and will not be tolerated; and that it is time to put an end to \nRussian Trojan horses in Georgia--the phony Russian ``peacekeepers'' \nand the military bases that provide Russia with the means to threaten \nGeorgia's future and to put U.S. interests at risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5654-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO LAHAINALUNA HIGH SCHOOL OF MAUI, HAWAII\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Students learn the history and \nprinciples behind our constitutional democracy through the use of the \nDeclaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of \nRights.\n  These young students competed against 49 other classes from across \nthe Nation, demonstrating a youthful and enthusiastic interest in the \nfundamental ideas that are imperative for gaining a better \nunderstanding of our government. We the People is not only a \ncompetitive event, but it is also the most extensive civics program to \nreach more than 26 million students from elementary, middle, and high \nschools across the country.\n  I would like to recognize these fine students for their \naccomplishments: Iao Eisenberg, Tiffany Fujiwara, Jasmine Hentz, Erin \nLockhard, William Myers, Leah Nakamura, Ryan Ott, Michael Prieto, Julie \nReed, Sal Saribay, Justin Serrano, Jeffrey Shelton, Yee Ning Tay, and \nKerri Tsubaki. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of \ntheir teacher, Mrs. Ruth E. Hill, and the District and State \nCoordinators, Ms. Jane Kinoshita and Ms. Sharon Kaohi, respectively. \nWithout their dedication and leadership, our students would be unable \nto participate in this important program.\n  Mr. President, I commend all the students and teachers who \nparticipated in this program, and particularly the students of \nLahainaluna High School who represented Hawaii in the national \ncompetition. It is always heartwarming to see students actively engaged \nin the learning process. I wish the students and teacher of Lahainaluna \nHigh School the best as they continue to pursue their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5655-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5655-S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE MARSH BILLINGS NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, June 5, 1998, is a great day for \nVermont and for the Nation as we open Vermont's first, and the Nation's \nnewest, National Historic Park. On behalf of all Vermonters I want to \nwelcome the National Park Service and express my deepest gratitude to \nLaurence and Mary Rockefeller for making this possible.\n  Vermonters have always drawn a special strength from the land. And as \nVermonters, we have a responsibility to the land. I was proud to \nintroduce for myself, Senator Leahy and all Vermonters, the legislation \nthat created this National Historic Park in 1991. A perfect ``Vermont \nscale'' National Park, its size fits our State's landscape, \nincorporating many of the most significant attributes about Vermont: \nour stewardship of the working agricultural and forest landscapes, our \ndedication to conservation, and our commitment and respect for our \ntowns and communities.\n  Mr. President, the beauty and significance of this site will now \nforever receive the same recognition as our other great National Parks, \nsuch as Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Gettysburg.\n  George Perkins Marsh, Frederick Billings, and Laurence Rockefeller's \ndevotion and commitment to the issues of conservation, forest \nmanagement, and agriculture have helped develop this nation's attitudes \nfor how we treat and respect our lands. Private land owners throughout \nthe country have followed the example of these distinguished leaders. \nToday, those who work and own the land, and hold true to the ideals of \nMarsh and Billings, are this Nation's most important stewards. The \npreservation and conservation of the Nation's working landscape, and \nhistoric and natural resources are increasingly important and yet are \nbecoming more difficult to maintain. The Marsh Billings National Park \nwill forever serve Vermont and the Nation as a model for conservation.\n  I salute Mary and Laurence Rockefeller for their vision in providing \nthis park to the people of Vermont and the United States. The \nRockefeller family has given future generations of Vermonters, indeed \nall Americans, access to a truly historic and beautiful site. This is \nonly the most recent accomplishment in Mr. Rockefeller's more than 50 \nyears of conservation leadership. Laurence Rockefeller was the first \nperson ever awarded a Congressional Gold Medal for conservation work, \nand that award was richly deserved. I am proud to have been an original \ncosponsor of the legislation that granted him the award.\n  Mr. President, the people of Woodstock and the entire State of \nVermont have lived a long time in harmony with the landscape. Our first \nnational park not only recognizes the two founders of the American \nconservation movement,\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nit is a tribute to all Vermonters and to the Vermont way of \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5655-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF MABEL VIRGINIA JEWS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nlife of Mabel Virginia Jews, a dedicated mother and a great educator \nwho passed away on May 23, 1998. As we work to strengthen our Nation's \nfamilies, I hope we can all find inspiration in the life of this \nremarkable woman.\n  In 1934, Mrs. Jews graduated from then Morgan State College and \nfollowed her undergraduate studies with a Masters degree from the \nformer Salisbury State College in the 1960's. She lived most of her \nlife on Maryland's Eastern Shore where she dedicated herself to \neducation, both in her classrooms and in the life of her son, William \nJews, Jr. As a teacher, Mrs. Jews taught English and home economics in \njunior high and high school where her patience and kindness taught \nstudents to feel comfortable about learning. In addition to her service \nas a schoolteacher, Mrs. Jews also worked as hospital administrator, \nPentagon employee and property manager.\n  Mabel Jews believed in getting behind our kids, making her son and \nhis education her top priority. Mrs. Jews focused her life's work on \nhelping young Bill build an educational record that would give him the \nopportunity to attend any school in the country. I'm pleased to say he \nchose Maryland's Johns Hopkins University. As many of my colleagues \nknow, Bill Jews is now the president of CareFirst Inc. and chief \nexecutive officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland. We can \nimagine how proud Mrs. Jews was of her son's success. She was a model \nmother who espoused the values we work to promote in our country's \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I am honored today to pay special tribute to such an \ninspirational and important Marylander. Throughout her lifetime, Mabel \nJews made vital contributions to the successful life of her son Bill, \nas well as to the lives and lessons of those who surrounded her. The \ngreat state of Maryland is fortunate to have been home to such a great \nwoman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5656-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5656-S5657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to mark National \nSmall Business Week. This is the week when we honor, as we have for the \npast 35 years, the American entrepreneurs who have done so much to make \nours a prosperous, thriving nation. America's 23 million small \nbusinesses employ more than half our country's private work force, \ncreate two of every three new jobs, and generate a majority of American \ninnovations.\n  Mr. President, it would be impossible to exaggerate the contribution \nof small business to America's economy. Small business is our engine of \neconomic growth. Small business-dominated industries produced an \nestimated 64 percent of the 2.5 million new jobs created during 1996. \nSmall businesses also account for 28 percent of jobs in high technology \nsectors--the sectors of our economy pushing us into the future and \nkeeping us competitive in world markets.\n  Small businesses also serve as the training ground for America's \nworkforce, providing 67 percent of workers with their first jobs and \ninitial on the job training in basic skills.\n  Small business is especially important in my own state of Michigan, \nwhere almost half a million small businesses and sole proprietors \ncreated every net new job in our economy from 1992 to 1996.\n  How did Michigan's small businesses accomplish this? Ask Pamela \nAguirre of Mexican Industries in Michigan and Cheryl Hughes of C \nHughes. Both these women are being honored by the Small Business \nAdministration for their efforts in expanding their small businesses \nagainst great odds through hard work, perseverance and devotion to \nquality.\n  Ms. Aguirre has taken the eight employee leather and soft trim \nautomotive products manufacturer she inherited from her father and \nturned it into a 1,500 employee eight plant corporation with 1996 sales \nof $158 million. Her company had plants in Detroit empowerment zones \nbefore they were empowerment zones. Hundreds of local residents have \nfound training, skills and careers thanks to her.\n  Cheryl Hughes started running her highway construction company in \n1980 out of her home. Now, after weathering reductions in federal \nhighway funding, C Hughes employs 60 people, has achieved annual \nsales of over $7 million, and is recognized as one of the fastest \ngrowing privately held companies in Michigan.\n  Entrepreneurs like Pamela Aguirre and Cheryl Hughes deserve our \nrespect, Mr. President. Their efforts make their communities and our \nnation better and more prosperous. By providing jobs they help people \nlearn skills and build lives for themselves and for their families.\n  But they also need our help. If small business owners like Pamela \nAguirre and Cheryl Hughes are to continue to grow and to provide good \njobs to millions of Americans, they must be freed from excessive \nfederal regulations and mandates, and from frivolous lawsuits that \ndrive up the cost of insurance and can drive a small business owner \ninto bankruptcy.\n  For example, Mr. President, current regulatory costs are staggering--\n$647 billion in 1994 according to the General Accounting Office. Our \nsmall businesses cannot afford to bear this kind of burden. What is \nmore, many small companies refuse to grow because doing so would \nsubject them to a number of costly, unnecessary regulations.\n  The answer, in my view, is real-world cost benefit analysis. No one \nwants to put our families and children at risk from unsafe products or \nprocedures. But the federal government must implement strict policies \nseeing to it that scientific data is used to determine whether any \nproposed regulation will cause more harm than good--to people, to the \neconomy and to small business.\n  In addition, Mr. President, Washington too often imposes unfunded \nmandates on America's job creators. The benefits of government programs \nare there for all to see. But the costs imposed by these programs on \nworkers, consumers, and small businesses are not so clear. Reduced \nwages, increased prices and stagnant growth all can result from \nunfunded federal mandates. That is why I believe it is crucial that we \ninstitute mandate reform legislation that would direct the \nCongressional Budget Office to study the effects of proposed private \nsector mandates on workers, consumers and economic growth, and provide \na point of order allowing members to call Congress' attention to these \ncosts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, entrepreneurs increasingly are being forced \nout of business, or deciding not to go into business for themselves, \nout of fear of lawsuits. One recent Gallup poll reported that fear of \nlitigation has caused 20 percent of small businesses not to hire more \nemployees, expand their business, or introduce new products. And that \nfigure does not include those who have decided not to go into business \nat all.\n  The culprit is the frivolous lawsuit. The stories are well-known: A \nNorthridge, California woman claims damages from a store after she \npulled out the bottom box in a blender display stack and brought it \ndown on her. A former smoker in Seattle sues a supermarket and \nWashington dairy farmers for failing to warn him that a lifetime of \ndrinking whole milk might clog his arteries and cause him to have a \nheart attack. A teenager in Nashau, New Hampshire sues the manufacturer \nof a basketball net after he attempts a slam dunk and looses two teeth \nwhen they get caught in the net.\n  We must put a stop to this lawsuit abuse before it stifles our \neconomic growth, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Ideally, we \nwould pass legislation discouraging all frivolous lawsuits. \nUnfortunately, while we have tried several times to enact broad-based \nlegal reform, the President has successfully opposed it. That is why I \nhave sponsored the ``small business lawsuit abuse protection act.'' For \nsmall businesses, this legislation will limit the punitive damages that \ncan be awarded against the company. Punitive damages would be available \nonly if the injured party proves convincingly that the harm was caused \nby the small business through at least a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights and safety of others. And punitive damages \nwould be limited to the lesser of\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n$250,000 or two times the compensatory damages awarded for the harm.\n  The bill also would limit joint and several liability for small \nbusinesses. This doctrine, according to which a company that caused, \nsay, two percent of the harm could be held liable for the full amount \nof damages, has forced many companies related to an accident \ntangentially if at all (including, for example, Mr. Van de Putte) to \npay the entire amount of the settlement because others are bankrupt or \notherwise not subject to being sued. Under this legislation a small \nbusiness would be liable for pain and suffering and any other \nnoneconomic damages only in proportion to its responsibility for \ncausing the harm. They would still be fully, jointly and severally \nliable for economic damages.\n  For the sake of our small businesses, and for the sake of the \nmillions of Americans who rely on those small businesses for goods, \nservices, training and jobs, we must address the costs Washington and \nour broken civil justice system impose on entrepreneurial activity and \nbusiness growth. It is my hope that National Small Business Week will \nprovide all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the tremendous \ndebt we owe the entrepreneurs of our country and that we will do our \nbest to encourage them to continue making life better for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5656-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATION OF JUNE DAIRY MONTH\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate \nNational Dairy Month and the great history of the dairy industry in our \nnation. As many of you know, even before the inception of National \nDairy Month, in 1937, Wisconsin was historically the national leader in \nmilk and cheese production. Even today, Wisconsin leads the nation in \ncheese volume and variety, offering more than 300 varieties, types and \nstyles of cheese.\n  Mr. President, during June Dairy Month, we celebrate America's dairy \nindustry and Wisconsin dairy's proud tradition and heritage of quality. \nIt provides Wisconsin's dairy farmers a special time to reflect on \ntheir accomplishments and those of their ancestors, and to look forward \nto continued success in the future.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, Wisconsin was nicknamed America's \nDairyland in the 1930s, but it became a leader in the industry soon \nafter the first dairy cow came to Wisconsin in the 1800's. This year's \ncelebration of National Dairy Month, is especially important for the \npeople of my home state of Wisconsin because this is also the year we \nare celebrating our sesquicentennial--150 years of Wisconsin statehood. \nDairy history and the state's history have been intertwined from the \nbeginning. Why, before Wisconsin was even declared a state, Ms. Anne \nPickett established Wisconsin's first cheese ``factory'' when she \ncombined milk from her cows with milk from her neighbor's cows and made \nit into cheese.\n  Other Wisconsin dairy firsts include: the development of Colby cheese \nin 1874, the creation of brick cheese in 1875, the first dairy school \nin America- established in 1891 at the University of Wisconsin at \nMadison, the first statewide dairy show in the U.S. in 1928, and the \ncreation of the world-record holding 40,060 pound, Grade-A Cheddar \ncheese in 1988. And Wisconsin also can claim one of the best-tasting \ninventions in the history of dairy industry: the creation of the first \nice cream sundae in 1881.\n  Wisconsin cows produce more than 22.4 billion pounds of milk a year, \nnearly 90 percent is processed into cheese and other products. \nWisconsin leads the nation in the production of cheese and are the top \nproducer of many varieties including Cheddar, American, Muenster, \nBrick, Blue and Italian--not to mention the ONLY U.S. producer of the \nfamous Limburger cheese variety. Also, Wisconsin buttermakers produce \nnearly 25 percent of America's butter supply.\n  National Dairy Month is the American consumer's oldest and largest \ncelebration of dairy products and the people who have made the industry \nthe success it is today. During June, Wisconsinites will hold nearly \n100 dairy celebrations across our state, including dairy breakfasts, \nice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, festivals and other events. \nThese events are all designed to make consumers aware of the quality, \nvariety and great taste of Wisconsin dairy products and to honor the \nproducers who make it all possible.\n  I am proud to honor this great American tradition--proud to honor the \ndairy producers not only in Wisconsin, but also those across this great \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5657-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO KAIMUKI INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise \ntoday to honor the students, teachers, staff, administrators, parents, \nand supporters of Kaimuki Intermediate School from Kaimuki, O'hau for \ntheir achievement in receiving the prestigious Blue Ribbon Schools \naward. This year, Kaimuki Intermediate School was one of the schools \nselected from hundreds of secondary schools across the nation to \nreceive this award. It is a reflection of the administration's, \nteachers', and staff's determination to provide an excellent \neducational environment for their students.\n  The U.S. Department of Education presents the Blue Ribbon Schools \naward to schools that have excelled in leadership, community \ninvolvement, environmental awareness, and a continuous desire to \novercome the barriers that impede a quality education. This award is \none of the most prestigious educational awards in the nation. Schools \nthat receive this recognition provide a challenging education for their \nstudents, strive to maintain a clean and healthy environment, develop \nand maintain family relations, and recruit and maintain high caliber \nteachers.\n  Mr. President, it is no surprise that Kaimuki Intermediate School, \nwhich challenges students academically, has been chosen for such an \nhonor. Students are given numerous opportunities to expand their \ninterests and talents by participating in committees, including School \nCommunity Based Management (SCBM) and the Student Activities Council \n(SAC). These committees enable students to participate in the \nadministrative process of their education and allow them to contribute \nideas to improve school activities and develop ideas that could further \nbenefit their education.\n  The students at Kaimuki Intermediate School have had many \naccomplishments. One student traveled to Washington, D.C., to compete \nin the national math competition. The eighth grade girls basketball \nteam won first place in their league, and other students participate in \na wide range of activities like intermural and extramural sports, band, \nand math competitions. Indeed, Kaimuki Intermediate School has excelled \nin their effort to provide students with a well rounded education.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to recognize everyone who has \ncontributed to making this award a reality, and congratulate the \nfaculty and staff and, most importantly, the students of Kaimuki \nIntermediate School for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5657-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5657-S5658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PATRICIA RUSSO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, later this month the State of \nConnecticut will say good-bye to one of its strongest and most \nrespected voices on women's issues: Patricia Russo. Known by her \nfriends as Pat, Ms. Russo has worked for the past 18 years to promote \ncivil rights for women, assure equality in education for girls, and \nhelp women achieve economic parity in the workplace. This July, Pat \nwill be moving with her family to Tokyo, and she will be dearly missed.\n  Pat Russo has served on the Permanent Commission on the Status of \nWomen (PCSW) for the past 15 years. She currently serves as the \nChairperson of this agency, which provides research and analysis to \nlegislators and state leaders on issues such as sex discrimination, \nchild care, sexual harassment, child support enforcement and the \neconomic status of women.\n  On behalf of the PCSW, Ms. Russo is the founder of the Connecticut \nWomen's Agenda, a state-wide coalition of key women's organizations in \nConnecticut. She also chairs the PCSW's Congressional District Advisory \nCouncil (CDAC) in the fourth congressional district.\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\n  Ms. Russo's work on behalf of ending violence against women earned \nher a seat on the 1997 Task Force to Study Domestic Violence, along \nwith the Attorney General and other state leaders.\n  In addition to her work at the PCSW, Ms. Russo also serves on the \nAdvisory Board of Woman magazine and the Advisory Council of the Rape \nand Sexual Abuse Crisis Center. She was recently appointed to the Board \nof Directors of the National Association of Commissions for Women \n(NACW). She is also President of the Women's Business Development \nCenter of Connecticut, a new agency that moves women from welfare to \nwork.\n  Pat Russo's leadership has earned her numerous awards, including the \nprestigious Hannah G. Solomon award, given by the National Council of \nJewish Women, and the distinction of ``Woman of the Year'' by the \nBusiness and Professional Women of Connecticut.\n  In 1997, Ms. Russo was named to the Racial Justice Committee of the \nYWCA of Greenwich, and is an honorary member of the American \nAssociation of University Women, in celebration of her 20 years of \nactivism on behalf of Connecticut women.\n  I have known Pat personally for many years and worked with her on \nmany important issues. I have always found her to be extremely capable \nand completely dedicated to improving the quality of justice for women \nin this country. She is truly a remarkable individual, and I am sad to \nsee her go. I wish her only the best as she leaves for Japan and in all \nof her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5657-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S.-PHILIPPINE RELATIONS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

The \npeople of the Philippines have shown themselves to be strong and loyal \nfriends of America.\n  The significant number of Filipinos who have come to the United \nStates also have made great contributions of our nation through their \nculture and their individual initiative.\n  The Philippines has become a major trading partner for the United \nStates and remains a strong ally in our efforts to maintain regional \nstability.\n  It is my hope that our two nations will enjoy another 100 years of \nmutual respect and support, and that my colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating the Philippines on the anniversary of its independence \nfrom Spain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5658-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      U.S. SPECIAL FORCES TRAINING\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, several months ago, as the conflict \nin Indonesia escalated, United States Special Forces training of \nIndonesian troops came under intense scrutiny. As journalists and human \nrights groups compiled and publicized allegations of torture, \ndisappearances and killings by ``Kopassus,'' an Indonesian special \nforces commando group, and other Indonesian military units, the Defense \nDepartment was conducting joint exercises with some of these same \nforces. It was only several weeks ago that Defense Secretary Cohen \nsuspended the program because of instability in the country.\n  The training of U.S. Special Forces on foreign soil provides a \nvaluable opportunity for our soldiers to learn how other militaries \noperate and to familiarize themselves with different cultures, climates \nand terrain. They need to be able to operate in the most difficult \nconditions. However, while the program benefits our soldiers, it also \nprovides training to foreign security forces. And sometimes those \nforces have a history of involvement in human rights violations. Unlike \nthe International Military Education and Training (IMET) program which \nscreens foreign participants for any involvement in human rights \nviolations, the Special Forces program, which conducted training \nexercises in 102 countries in fiscal year 1997, apparently does not. No \ncredible effort is made to screen prospective foreign participants. If \nthere were, there is no way this training would be conducted with \nKopassus, which has been implicated in a pattern of torture and \nextrajudicial killings dating back many years.\n  A May 25, 1998 article in the Washington Post describes how the \nSpecial Forces program in Colombia has continued to operate and \nmaintain close relationships with foreign security forces there despite \nthe Colombian army's abysmal human rights record, pervasive allegations \nof drug-related corruption and accusations linking the armed forces \nwith paramilitary killings of civilians. Just as in Indonesia, where \nSpecial Forces training continued despite a congressional cut-off of \nIMET assistance due to human rights concerns, the Special Forces \ntraining program in Colombia, funded by the Department of Defense, \ncontinued in 1997 even though our aid to the Colombian army was \nwithheld on account of a human rights provision in our Foreign \nOperations law.\n  I do not oppose Special Forces training. Our soldiers need the \nexperience. But we also need a consistent human rights policy. The \nhuman rights procedures that have been applied to the IMET program are \nfar from foolproof, but they do help reduce the chance that the foreign \nforces we train have been involved in human rights abuses. These same \nscreening procedures should apply to training conducted by U.S. Special \nForces.\n  Mr. President, a country is judged, in part, by the company it keeps. \nBy failing to establish a clear, transparent and comprehensive policy \nthat governs all our military training programs and adequately takes \ninto account human rights considerations, the United States, and our \nsoldiers, will continue to be implicated in the atrocities of those we \ntrain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5658-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5658-S5659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RELEASE OF ``UNDER THE RUG: SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THE MATURE WOMAN''\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

The study found that in 1998, substance abuse by mature \nwomen will trigger more than $30 billion in health costs--$10.1 billion \nin inpatient hospital bills, $12.2 billion in nursing home bills, and \n$7.7 billion for physician services and home health care.\n  I would like to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ford. Her courage and \nher gallantry has given hope to others who have faced similar if not \nidentical problems. By speaking out and by facing her own problems with \nthe love and support of her family, she gave those who have less power, \nor maybe less love, the strength to do what she did. Mrs. Ford, Liz \nTaylor, Ann Richards, I think we really owe a debt of gratitude to \nthem, and we owe a debt to every well-known woman in our society who \nhas been willing to step forward, speak up and speak out about the \ndangers of older women and substance abuse.\n  I'd also like to pay tribute to President Ford for the courage to \norganize a family intervention. Thank you for showing us that when a \nman really loves a woman, sometimes you need tough love. If Mrs. Ford \nhad had a heart attack, Mr. Ford would have been the first one there \nwith CPR. His intervention was the CPR of substance abuse.\n  Today's findings address a problem hidden in the shadow for too long. \nMature women who struggle with depression and loneliness and fight them \nwith drugs and alcohol today know they are not alone. This study shines \nthe bright light of research and knowledge to take this problem out of \nthe shadows.\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\n  It is the first step to help mature women get help from doctors, from \nfamily, and from friends. It is the first step to help grown men and \nwomen identify the warning signs of addiction, not just with their own \nkids, but with their parents. It is startling and troubling that mature \nwomen are more likely to be hospitalized for substance abuse than for \nheart attacks.\n  In Maryland in 1996, 285 mature women sought help for substance abuse \nin certified treatment centers, 230 in 1997. Thousands more are too \nscared, too sick, or too alone to seek out care they need. This study \ncan help them. And it can help America.\n  I have been a life-long fighter for mature Americans. I believe \n``honor your mother and father'' is not just a good commandment, it's \ngood public policy. That's why I am such a big supporter of research \nlike today's study. This study not only highlights a big problem, it \nhighlights opportunities to make good public policy.\n  If we can end substance abuse among the elderly, we can lower \nfinancial costs for Medicaid and Medicare. More importantly, we can \nlower the emotional cost to women and families. We can't let a blanket \nof shame and denial blind us to problems that we can and should solve.\n  I support more research to help protect seniors from scams, from \npoverty, and from threats to their health. I send thanks to Bristol-\nMyers Squibb and to the National Center on Addiction and Substance \nAbuse for revealing this troubling problem and helping to create \nsolutions.\n  Today's research, which focuses on women and seniors, is one big \nreason I am a big supporter of NIH. Women's health has made great \nheadway with NIH. In 1990, Congresswomen Connie Morella, Pat Schroeder \nand I showed up on the steps at NIH to launch what we hoped would be a \nwomen's health initiative. Through our efforts, the Office of Women's \nHealth Research was established so that women would no longer be left \nout of clinical trials and research protocols. I am pleased that we are \nnow seeing more and better research on women's health.\n  I am sending this report to Dr. Varmus, Director of NIH with my \nendorsement and with my request that NIH expand its research on alcohol \nand drug abuse by mature women. Today's study is a shining example of \nwhat can get done with attention and money and more women in the House \nand Senate.\n  I would ask all my colleagues, men and women, Democrat and \nRepublican, House and Senate, to read the executive summary of ``Under \nthe Rug: Substance Abuse and the Mature Woman'', which I will send to \nthem. We shouldn't play politics with women's lives, and we shouldn't \nplay politics with the lives of the mature women and their families who \nare trying to cope with the terrible problems of substance abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5658-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BEVERLY GIBSON\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an \noutstanding Montanan, Beverly Gibson. She will retire June 30 after \ntwenty years as assistant director of the Montana Association of \nCounties and nearly 30 years of outstanding public service to her \nState. Through her work I believe Bev knows almost everyone involved in \ncounty government in the State, and those of us who have had the great \nfortune to know her stand in awe of this great lady's achievements.\n  Montana-born and journalist by training, Bev has been the heart and \nsoul and living history of MACO since its very early expertise have \ntouched many lives. In a State like mine, with its vast area and sparse \npopulation spread over 56 counties, local government is the lifeblood \nof politics. Bev is the real champion in this arena.\n  At MACO Bev is known as the person who gets things done. Twice a \nyear, MACO holds statewide meetings and she was always the first to get \nthere and welcome everyone. She would research all the issues, staff \ncommittees, act as official photographer, coordinate speakers and \nagency representatives and was the last to say goodbye. Can you imagine \ndoing that for 168 commissioners of different parties? I honestly don't \nknow how the organization will get along without her, except that she \nis leaving an incredible legacy that will brighten the way for others.\n  As she retires, I want to wish her much joy, health and happiness. \nAnd I also want to say thanks, Bev, for a job well done and for a real \nservice to Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5659-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5659-S5660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMEMORATION OF PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS OF 1989\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join in marking \nthe ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, a tragic day \nwhen a still unknown number of Chinese--some say hundreds, others, \nthousands--died at the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and \nperhaps thousands more were placed in detention.\n  Despite this monumental tragedy, China's leaders remain unwilling to \nre-examine the events of June 4, 1989. Indeed, they would like nothing \nmore than to have Tiananmen fade from the world's memory.\n  But today, the spirit of Tiananmen lives in our memory in the \nstrongest way. We have recently welcomed to the United States two key \npro-democracy leaders who were released from Chinese prisons. But as \nlucky as we are to have Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and others in our \nmidst, we are all well aware that they are not yet free; they remain in \nthe United States because they cannot return freely to their homeland.\n  Moreover, at least 158 people remain in prison for their role in the \n1989 demonstrations. Certainly for these people and their families, \nTiananmen remains a part of daily life.\n  For those of us who are concerned about human rights in China, the \nvery date of June 4th remains a powerful reminder that the Chinese \nGovernment has not changed.\n  But despite the lack of progress, the executive branch of our \ngovernment continues to pursue a policy of constructive engagement with \nChina, a policy that will be capped off by the President's visit to \nBeijing at the end of the month. This upcoming summit is yet another in \na long line of unwise steps that the Administration has taken with \nrespect to China. I have generally opposed all of these steps because I \ndo not see that progress has been achieved on human rights in China. \nThis includes the October 1997 state visit of Chinese President Jiang \nZemin. That was a mistake. We should challenge China's leaders rather \nthan toast them.\n  The failure of the United States to sponsor a resolution condemning \nhuman rights abuses in China and Tibet at the most recent meeting of \nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights was also a mistake. The \nAdministration made this decision despite the overwhelming support in \nthe Senate of a resolution that urged the United States to ``introduce \nand make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution'' at the Commission \non Human Rights. I was proud to co-sponsor that resolution.\n  As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have \naggressively lobbied against resolutions at the UN Human Rights \nCommission earlier and more actively than the countries that support a \nresolution. In 1997, China threatened Denmark, which had made a \ndifficult and courageous decision to sponsor a resolution on human \nrights in China. This year, Chinese officials played a diplomatic game \nwith various European governments, and succeeded in getting European \nUnion foreign ministers to drop any EU co-sponsorship of a resolution.\n  The complete failure of the United States and the EU to push for a \nresolution at the Commission was, in my mind, gravely unfortunate. The \nmultilateral nature of the Commission makes it an appropriate forum to \ndebate and discuss the human rights situation in China. By signing \ninternational human rights treaties, China has obliged itself to \nrespect international human rights law. One of the basic purposes of \nthe Commission is specifically to evaluate China's performance with \nrespect to those commitments. The Commission's review has led to \nproven, concrete progress on human rights elsewhere, and the \nexpectation has been that such scrutiny would lead to concrete progress \nin human rights in China, but China's rulers cynically ignore their \nlegal and moral duty to respect the human rights of their own citizens. \nAnd they do it with impunity.\n  Despite China's announcement last year that it would sign the United \nNation's Covenant on Economic, Social\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nand Cultural Rights and take a few other token steps, I see no evidence \nof real human rights improvement on the ground in China. The fact that \nhuman rights conditions in China are growing worse, not better, demands \nthat human rights continue to be a top priority in our China policy--\nbut it is not a priority, and the rulers in Beijing know that.\n  Nearly four years after the President's decision to de-link most-\nfavored-nation status from human rights--a decision I have always said \nwas a mistake--we cannot forget that the human rights situation in \nChina and Tibet remains abysmal. Hundreds, if not thousands of Chinese \nand Tibetan citizens are detained or imprisoned for their political and \nreligious beliefs. The press is subject to oppressive restrictions. And \nmonks and nuns in Tibet are harassed for showing reverence to the Dalai \nLama.\n  In a well-quoted sentence, the most recent State Department human \nrights report notes that ``the Government of China continued to commit \nwidespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of \ninternationally accepted norms, including extra-judicial killings, the \nuse of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and \nsterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners, and tight \ncontrol over the exercise of the rights of freedom of speech, press and \nreligions.'' If that shameful litany is not grounds for a tougher \npolicy, please, somebody, tell me what is!\n  Today, on the ninth anniversary of one of the most traumatic events \nin the modern history of China, we remember the courageous people who \nstood before the tanks, who gave their lives for bravely choosing to \nexpress their notions of freedom and breathed their last on the bloody \npaving stones of Tiananmen, and we honor those heroes who continue to \ntake risks to struggle for real change in China and Tibet.\n  It is unfortunate, then, that the President's proposed trip to \nBeijing, which will take place in just a few weeks, will send the wrong \nsignal--not only to China's leaders, but also to those in China and \nTibet who have worked so tirelessly to achieve the basic freedoms that \nwe, as Americans, take for granted. In particular, in a move that \nalmost adds insult to injury, the President has agreed to stage his \narrival ceremony in Tiananmen Square itself.\n  If ever a moment cried out for a gesture, Mr. President, that will be \nthe moment. That will be the chance for our President to restore some \nsmall moral weight to our China policy.\n  Mr. President, if the President of the United States feels he must go \nto Beijing, if he feels he must go there this month, a month when we \nremember and honor the heroes of Tiananmen, and if he feels he must \nvisit the site of that horrible 1989 massacre, I hope he will take the \ntime to visit with the families of the victims--a suggestion I made to \nAssistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth in a recent Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing.\n  Finally, it is imperative that throughout his visit to China, the \nPresident send a clear unequivocal message about the importance of \nhuman rights, of the rule of law and of democracy. The students at \nTiananmen erected a goddess of democracy. Our China policy worships \ntrade and pays short shrift to the ideal of freedom. Our policy has got \nto change.\n  We owe as much to the victims, to the champions of democracy in China \ntoday, and to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5659-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5660-S5661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR PELL ON CUBAN POLICY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an editorial \non U.S. policy toward Cuba written by my esteemed predecessor, the \nHonorable Claiborne Pell. The editorial was printed in the May 5, 1998 \nedition of the Providence Journal Bulletin.\n  Senator Pell served in the United States Senate for thirty-six years. \nWhile in the Senate, he served as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations for eight years. Senator Pell's remarkable career also \nincluded eight years of service as a State Department Official and \nForeign Service Officer as well as the United States Representative to \nthe 25th and 51st Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. \nSenator Pell's positions have taken him to Cuba on three occasions, \nmost recently in early May. Senator Pell's observations of American \nforeign policy toward Cuba have led him to the conclusion that \ncontinuing the 38 year embargo on Cuba will not destabilize the Castro \nregime and is hurting the Cuban people.\n  In his editorial, Senator Pell makes a number of insightful points. I \nhope all my colleagues will take the opportunity to read this piece by \nan expert in foreign relations and seriously consider his observations \nregarding relations with our neighbor.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the editorial from the Providence Journal \nBulletin be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n          [From the Providence Journal-Bulletin, May 5, 1998]\n\n                     Our Cuba Policy Has Not Worked\n\n       One can only hope that the small but significant changes in \n     U.S. policy toward Cuba that President Clinton announced in \n     late March portend more sweeping changes in the months ahead \n     toward a more rational, more self-interested and more \n     effective U.S. policy.\n       Having just returned from a five-day visit to Cuba with a \n     distinguished group of Americans, I am more convinced than \n     ever that our existing policy, built around the 38-year-old \n     embargo of Cuba, simply doesn't work.\n       The embargo upsets the Cuban government and hurts the Cuban \n     people, but, from our discussions with an array of Cuban \n     government officials, religious and dissident leaders and \n     foreign diplomat observers, one thing emerged clearly: The \n     Cuban economy is strong enough to limp along for the \n     foreseeable future. There is no evidence at all to suggest \n     that U.S. economic sanctions are any more likely to \n     destabilize the Castro regime in the near future than they \n     have been over the past 38 years.\n       Cuba is now some six years into what the regime \n     euphemistically calls the ``special period,'' the time of \n     economic distress that began with the collapse of the Soviet \n     Union. Cuba lost its preferential trading arrangement with \n     Moscow and the other former communist republics of Eastern \n     Europe, and was left to fend for itself.\n       If U.S. economic pressure was ever to work, that was the \n     time. But Cuba has muddled through. In moves that must have \n     been bitter pills for Castro to swallow, Cuba ``dollarized'' \n     its economy, allowed private farmers' markets and other \n     small-scale private enterprises, and offered more favorable \n     terms for foreign investment.\n       As a result, the Cuban economy, in free fall during 1993, \n     has started to come around. The evidence abounds in Havana. \n     Not only tourists, but all Cubans can purchase an array of \n     consumer goods in ``dollar stores'' that are prevalent in \n     Havana. When we asked one government official how Cubans with \n     no access to dollars can survive, he shot back: ``Who doesn't \n     have dollars?''\n       One exquisite irony is that this dollar-focused Cuban \n     economy is now in part propped up by an annual deluge of \n     dollars, estimated at $600 million to $1 billion, that \n     arrives in Cuba from the United States, primarily from Cuban-\n     Americans anxious to make life easier for their relatives. \n     Whatever pain the embargo causes is offset by this dollar \n     flow, which they will likely increase with the restoration of \n     legal remittances.\n       Tourism has expanded greatly since I last visited Cuba 10 \n     years ago, and brings both much needed hard currency and less \n     desirable consequences, including prostitution, which seems \n     widespread in parts of Havana after dark. Our delegation \n     visited only Havana and we were told that times are tougher \n     in the smaller cities and the countryside. But the Cuban \n     economy has clearly recovered and, while it could benefit \n     from many more reforms, there is no sign it will collapse.\n       Cuba is still very much an authoritarian state with tight \n     state control over all aspects of society, including public \n     debate. One day, I visited a showplace medical campus where \n     very interesting neurological research is being conducted. \n     The center was equipped with what appeared to be \n     sophisticated computers and has its own ``web site.''\n       Next, I sat with a group of dissidents and asked about \n     their access to the Internet. ``We can't use the Internet,'' \n     one said. ``We cannot even have computers; they just take \n     them away.''\n       Yet I felt a much greater openness in Havana this time than \n     in my last visit, and certainly than in 1974, when Sen. Jacob \n     Javits (the late U.S. Republican senator from New York) and I \n     were among the first members of Congress to visit since the \n     revolution. Back then, we were shadowed everywhere we went, \n     were confident our hotel rooms were bugged, and sensed a real \n     oppressiveness in the city. In those days, the infamous \n     Committees for the Defense of the Revolution were an \n     effective neighborhood spy network; today, they seem more a \n     network of aging busybodies. Havana is certainly not a free \n     city, but it has a liveliness and verve that startled me.\n       On this trip, everywhere we went people still were abuzz \n     about the visit of the Pope. Church leaders do not know yet \n     whether the visit, of which virtually all Cubans seemed \n     immensely proud, will lead to much greater openness. But \n     colleagues of mine went to Mass on Sunday at a Jesuit church \n     in a rundown section of the city, and described a vibrant \n     community with an abundance of\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\n     young adults worshipping with pride and intensity. The \n     dissidents we met reported that a substantial number of \n     political offenders have been freed and the atmosphere seems \n     to them ``more relaxed.''\n       Cuba's repressive communist regime has survived, if not \n     thrived, for 38 years in economic isolation from the United \n     States. When a policy has failed that long, isn't it time to \n     try something else? In my view, a policy of contact, trade, \n     cultural exchanges and dialogue, just as we had with the \n     communist states of Europe, could well lead to a more open, \n     free-market economy and more political diversity in Cuba. \n     Even if it doesn't, it won't be any less effective than the \n     policy we've been following these past 38 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5660-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5661-S5662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n      MASSACRE OF PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS ON TIANANMEN SQUARE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of a Senate resolution at the \ndesk which would express the sense of the Senate on the ninth \nanniversary of the massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators on Tiananmen \nSquare in China. I ask further consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I find myself in the awkward position of \nhaving to object to consideration of my own resolution. I want to make \nthis clear that I am doing this solely as a courtesy to the Democratic \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am really surprised and shocked that \napparently there is objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to \nconsideration of this important resolution. I had hoped that we would \nconsider this evening a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nupon the ninth anniversary of the tragic massacre of Chinese students \nin Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.\n  My resolution, had I been permitted to proceed with it this evening, \nwas cosponsored by the distinguished majority leader, by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, and by the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Abraham. Regrettably, my colleagues from the Democratic side of \nthe aisle have blocked consideration of this resolution. I would, \nhowever, like to take a moment to explain why I consider it to be very \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, 9 years ago, thousands of students were peaceably \nassembled on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, peacefully protesting their \ngovernment's refusal to permit them even the most basic freedoms of \nexpression, association, and political activity.\n  As a symbol of their hopes and aspirations for a democratic China, \nthese students constructed a scale model of our own Statue of Liberty. \nIt was to them, as it is to us and to untold millions around the world, \na symbol of freedom's promise for people everywhere. Quoting Thomas \nJefferson, these brave Chinese students spoke eloquently of the need \nfor China to develop democratic institutions, and finally to allow a \ndegree of political progress to match its dramatic economic change and \ndevelopment in recent years.\n  Nine years ago today--today--the excitement and the promise of this \nChinese democracy movement were extinguished as troops and armored \nvehicles were ordered into action against the peaceful students. Mr. \nPresident, it may never be known exactly how many died in the resulting \nbloodbath, but hundreds of Chinese demonstrators were certainly killed \nand many thousands more were arrested for so-called \ncounterrevolutionary offenses that consisted only of attempting to \nassert rights that it is the duty of civilized governments everywhere \nto observe, protect and promote.\n  I am wearing, Mr. President, a ribbon to commemorate just one of \nthose political prisoners from that very sad period.\n  I had hoped to introduce and have the Senate pass this resolution to \nmake very clear to everyone in this country and, indeed, around the \nglobe that the U.S. Senate has not forgotten what occurred in Tiananmen \nSquare 9 years ago today.\n  Mr. President, my resolution sought to do no more than to make clear \nthat what occurred on June 4, 1989, was profoundly wrong and that we \nshould not permit ourselves or our Government ever to forget this. This \nresolution would have merely expressed the sense of the Senate that our \nGovernment should remain committed to honoring the memory and the \nspirit of the Chinese citizens who died on Tiananmen Square and that \nassisting China's peaceful transition to democracy should be a \nprincipal goal of our foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we remember Tiananmen Square \ntoday precisely because we do enjoy increasingly close ties with the \nregime in Beijing. Relations with the People's Republic of China are--\nand must--be a continual balancing act. The memory of Tiananmen Square \nshould help us find the appropriate bounds, preventing us from giving \nway to a wholly unchecked enthusiasm in U.S.-Chinese relations by \ndisregarding the fundamental nature of the regime with which we are \ndealing. China is not a democracy, after all, and its government still \nhas few qualms about using armed force to suppress the legitimate \naspirations of its people for basic liberties.\n  I do not expect democracy to flower overnight in China. But it is \ntoday quite clear that China is capable of democracy. The very strength \nof the student movement that Communist authorities tried to crush on \nTiananmen Square nine years ago attests to the powerful appeal that \ndemocracy and human rights have in China. The successes of pro-\ndemocracy candidates in Hong Kong's recent elections also attest to how \nstrong democratic ideals can be in China when not suppressed by \nautocrats intent upon preserving their own power and privileges. Most \nof all, the new and thriving democracy on Taiwan stands as the clearest \nindication that the phrase ``Chinese democracy'' is not an oxymoron. In \nfact, the phrase ``Chinese democracy is a ray of hope for a quarter of \nour planet's population.\n  This is why it is important always to keep Tiananmen Square in our \nminds as we pursue our ``engagement'' with China. While we cannot \nignore China and its huge population, neither can we ignore the human \nrights abuses committed by its government. Sound public policymaking is \nabout pragmatism, but it is about the pragmatic pursuit of principles. \nWithout principle, pragmatism is no more than a fraud, a process that \nlacks a purpose; there is no substitute for an underlying moral \ncompass. This is why I very much wanted to introduce my resolution \ntoday: in U.S.-China relations, the memory of Tiananmen Square is one \nof the cardinal points on our moral compass, without which we cannot \nnavigate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution I would have \nintroduced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res.--\n\n       Whereas in the spring of 1989, thousands of students \n     demonstrated in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in favor of \n     greater democracy, civil liberties, and freedom of expression \n     in the People's Republic of China (PRC);\n       Whereas these students' protests against political \n     repression in their homeland were conducted peacefully and \n     posed no threat to their fellow Chinese citizens;\n       Whereas on the evening of June 4, 1989, these students were \n     brutally attacked by infantry and armored vehicles of the \n     People's Liberation Army (PLA) acting under orders from the \n     highest political and military leadership of the PRC;\n       Whereas hundreds of these students were killed by the PLA \n     in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for offenses no more \n     serious than that of seeking peacefully to assert their most \n     basic human, civil, and political rights;\n       Whereas many of the leaders of the student demonstrations \n     thus attacked were subsequently imprisoned, sought out for \n     arrest, or otherwise persecuted by the Government of the PRC;\n       Whereas during or shortly after the brutal assault of June \n     4, 1989, at least 2,500 persons were arrested for so-called \n     ``counter-revolutionary offenses'' across China and dozens of \n     persons were executed;\n       Whereas the Chinese government has never expressed regret \n     for its actions on June 4, 1989, still imprisons at least 150 \n     persons in connection with the Tiananmen Square \n     demonstrations, and has continued to deny its citizens basic \n     internationally-recognized human, civil, and political \n     rights;\n       Whereas the Government of the PRC, as detailed in \n     successive annual reports on\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\n     human rights by the United States Department of State, still \n     routinely and systematically violates the rights of its \n     citizens, including their rights to freedom of speech, \n     assembly, worship, and peaceful dissent; and\n       Whereas the Tiananmen Square Massacre has become indelibly \n     etched into the political consciousness of our times as a \n     symbol both of the impossibility of forever denying a \n     determined people the right to control their own destiny and \n     of the oppressiveness and brutality of governments that seek \n     to do so: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, in the interest of expressing support for \n     the observance of human, civil, and political rights in China \n     and around the world, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should remain committed to \n     honoring the memory and spirit of the brave citizens of China \n     who suffered and died in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for \n     attempting to assert their internationally-recognized rights; \n     and\n       (2) supporting the peaceful transition to democratic \n     governance and the observance of internationally-recognized \n     human, civil, and political rights and the rule of law in \n     China should be a principal goal of United States foreign \n     policy.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/04/senate-section/article/S5661-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS COLLEGIATE GOLF TEAM ON \n                        THEIR NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n102, introduced earlier today by Senator Rockefeller and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 102) recognizing \n     disabled American veterans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I, along with Senators Specter, Lott, \nand Daschle submit a Senate Concurrent Resolution that will allow the \nDisabled American Veterans to sponsor an event on the U.S. Capitol \ngrounds on June 16 and 17, 1998, during which they will donate 147 \ntransportation vans to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Senator Specter, Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and \nI were asked to help coordinate this unique event, and we are grateful \nfor the support of the Leadership on both sides of the aisle. As my \ncolleagues are aware, Senator Specter is unable to be here today due to \nrecent surgery.\n  Mr. President, the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) was chartered by \nthe Congress of the United States in 1932 and serves as an incredibly \nstrong advocate for our Nation's disabled veterans. In 1987, as part of \ntheir mission, DAV organized a nationwide transportation program to \nhelp sick and disabled veterans receive the essential medical care they \nso desperately need. From the time of its inception to the present, DAV \nwill have donated 750 vans in support of this program.\n  In my state of West Virginia, thousands of veterans live in rural \nareas, miles from the nearest VA medical center, and often in areas \nwith no public transportation. So I am acutely aware of how veterans \nnot only in West Virginia, but from coast to coast, rely on the DAV \ntransportation program to receive essential medical care. I am proud to \nhave worked with DAV to help foster this program.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join us in supporting legislation to \nauthorize use of the Capitol Grounds for this remarkable event. And I, \nalong with Senators Specter, Lott, and Daschle, commend DAV for their \ndonation and work on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements related to the concurrent resolution be printed in the \nRecord at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
