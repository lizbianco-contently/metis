So \noften our prayers are for what we need You to do to make us happy. Now \nin this quiet time, inspire us to think imaginatively about how we can \nbring happiness to those with whom we work and those whose friendship \nwe enjoy.\n  Lord, our tendency is to think of some big, grand thing we could do \nand then because of the immensity of it, we never get it done. Help us \nforgo these grandstanding feats of herosim and do something that simply \nmakes life more of a joy to the people in our lives. We want to make \nthis a day free of uncreative, unproductive criticism. Today, we will \nnot be a nagging, faultfinding source of distress. Whatever we do that \ncauses anxiety, help us to change.\n  We confess that often it is what we fail to do that causes \nunhappiness. We know people need encouragement and affirmation. Today \nwe give up the control we get by withholding the attitude or the words \nof approval not just of what people are tying to do, but what they are \nstriving to become. May the end of this day be a time for remembering \nthe happy memories we gave others. That's what it's all about, and \nthat's what we're going to be about today.

Mr. President, we do want to talk this morning, however, \nabout an item of great importance to all of us--the citizens and to all \nof us as Members of the Senate--and that is taxation, the question that \nwill be before the Senate this week, as the Finance Committee has \ncompleted their work on the reconciliation bill, and we will now be \naddressing that.\n  We will be talking about tax relief, which I suspect is perhaps one \nof the most important topics we will talk about this entire year, not \nonly because of the tax aspect of it because, as you go into the budget \nprocess, it seems to me that budgets are much more than just numbers, \nthey are much more than various spending proposals, they sort of set \nthe parameters of what we will be doing in Government for at least the \ncoming year; in this case, at least 5 years.\n  These decisions will frame the size of the Government over time. If \nyou prefer smaller governments or larger governments--I happen to \nprefer smaller ones--the budget has to do with that. The budget has to \ndo with the kinds of priorities that we will set among programs, among \nthe kinds of things that\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nwe do. Of course, if we are going to be responsible, as we should be, \nover time to pay for what we want--which we haven't done for 25 years--\nand seek to balance the budget, then revenues and expenditures and tax \nrelief are all part of this package, and probably, in the broad sense, \nare the most important decisions that we will make with respect not \nonly to taxpayers, but program recipients and everyone else over this \nnext 5 years.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMAS. So, Mr. President, we will be talking about the taxes \nthat are generally going to be in the reconciliation bill, such as some \nrelief on the cost of education, in terms of deductions, in terms of \ncredits for parents who have youngsters in school. We will be talking \nalso about the family credit, the $500-per-child credit, so that \nfamilies can retain and then use that money in their own way to raise \ntheir children. We will be talking, hopefully, about capital gains tax \nrelief, the idea that investments would not be taxed at as high a level \nas they have been, the idea of encouraging investments so that we \ncreate jobs and so that we strengthen the economy, and capital gains \nhas a good deal to do with that.\n  Hopefully, we will also be talking about estate taxes, the kind of \ntaxes that are levied on property and assets that people have worked \ntheir entire life to accumulate and then, in many cases, have to spend \nmore than 50 percent of the value of those assets in taxes and are \nunable, often, to pass them on to their families. They are particularly \nimportant, I think, Mr. President, in areas such as your State of \nKansas and my State of Wyoming, where small business and agriculture is \nvery prominent. Often the assets of families, small businessmen, \nranchers, farmers, are tied up in fixed assets, such as land and so on, \nand they have to sell their property in order to pay the taxes.\n  So these are the kinds of decisions with which we will be dealing. I \nlook forward to it, frankly. It has been a very long time, it has been \na very long time since we have had a fundamental reduction in taxes.\n  The concept in this place, in this Senate, in this Government, until \nthe last couple of years, is let's have more taxes, let's have more \nmoney, let's have more Government, and now we have an opportunity to \nseek to start to turn that around and, hopefully, over time reduce the \nsize of Government, move more and more functions to the State where \nthey belong and can be best implemented, and then give taxpayers a \nbreak.\n  We will be caught up, Mr. President, as we go into this over the next \nweek or more, in great details, as we should be. But I hope we don't \nforget the concept of what we are seeking to do. We will be caught up \nin details. We will be caught up in the great political spin that goes \non, seemingly has gone on with more fervor in the last year or two than \nI ever recall. Everything is sort of couched in terms that are designed \nto package it and sell it. It is not really basic stuff. It is all \nfluff. We shouldn't do that.\n  For instance, we will hear the idea that every tax reduction is a tax \nbreak for the rich. Well, now, that isn't the case. If it is, then \nthere are an awful lot of us who apparently are rich and didn't know \nit. People at $40,000 get some kind of tax break, and it is termed then \nas a tax break for the rich. That is not true.\n\n  We need to talk a little bit about really what the facts are. There \nis a notion that will be talked about, that, ``Well, we don't need any \ntax reductions, we need to keep the revenue coming so we can continue \nto spend and spend more,'' and that has been the philosophy. It is not \nthe principle philosophy of this country. The country was to have a \nconstitutional government that does those things that are provided in \nthe Constitution, and those things that are not provided in the \nConstitution should be done by the States or by the citizens. That is \nwhat the Constitution says.\n  Rather than talk about the facts and philosophy of government, we \nwill be talking about political aspects of it. We will be talking about \nspin. We will be talking about the message that has come over the last \nmonths from the White House with the message merchants that are the \nresult of the polling experts. I hope we can cut through that and just \ntalk like we do in Wyoming, frankly. I was there yesterday. Those folks \ndon't spin it, they just say, ``Hey, let's just talk about what it \nreally is,'' and that is what we ought to do here.\n  One of the things we ought to understand as we take a look at taxes \nand tax burden for working Americans is that it is higher than it has \never been. It, as a matter of fact, represents over 30 percent of GDP--\nover 30 of gross domestic product in taxes. I don't think we imagined \nthat that would be the case in this country with limited government. It \nis three times as high as the highest tax burden during Roosevelt's New \nDeal--three times as high. So we ought to be talking about some kind of \ntax changes philosophically.\n  We will talk about income tax relief. That is what we are basically \ntalking about, income tax relief. We are talking about people who pay \nit. You are not going to get income tax relief unless you pay taxes, \nand there is this idea that whenever we want to do anything to relieve \nthe burden on those people who pay taxes, that somehow it is a big tax \nbreak for the rich. Everybody, of course, wants to help folks who need \nhelp to help themselves. That is not the issue here. We are not talking \nabout how you do that. We are not talking about welfare; we are not \ntalking about those kinds of things. We are talking about tax relief.\n  We ought to talk about that. It is very legitimate to talk about \nhelping those who need help, and we should do that and we do that. But \nwe ought not to tie everything together and not be able to clearly look \nat what we are talking about. We are talking about tax relief. We are \ntalking about tax fairness. We are talking about opportunity. We are \ntalking about encouraging investment to create jobs. Those are the \nthings that we are talking about.\n  Tax relief is designed to allow people who work hard, people who, \nbecause they work hard, are successful to keep more of what they earn. \nWe are talking about the incentive to work harder, the incentive to \ninvest, the incentive to invest to strengthen the economy and to create \nnew jobs. That is what we are talking about. So we ought to strip the \nother stuff away and really think about it a bit.\n  Tax relief is part of, it seems to me, a historical American \nphilosophy of limited government, of allowing people to keep what they \nearn after they have paid the necessary costs of the services they want \nfrom government. That is a philosophy that I think is strong.\n  President Clinton in Denver this weekend boosted, as he should, about \nthis economy, about the growth of a market economy, the growth of a \nfree-enterprise economy, and yet, often the White House ignores the \nvery thing that allows this economy to be stronger than the economies \nyou see around the world, because it is an incentive-driven-private-\nenterprise-market economy. That is part of what we are talking about \nwhen we talk about taxes, when we talk about the level of taxes and \nwhen we talk about tax relief.\n  It is tax relief from that 30 percent of GDP that is collected in \ntaxes. Keep that in mind. Every family pays nearly 40 percent of their \nincome in taxes. That is very hard. I am not opposed, nor is anyone I \nknow of opposed, to taxes. If we are going to have a government which \nis legitimate, if we are going to do the things in government that \nneeds to be done, we have to pay for it. That is what taxes are for. We \nraise revenues to pay for those legitimate functions of government and, \nif we are responsible, we will do that.\n  We have not been as responsible as we should have been over the \nyears. When we wanted some programs, when we wanted some services, when \nwe wanted something to be done for us, rather than pay for it, we put \nit on the old credit card, and the credit card is now maxed out, of \ncourse. So you have to pay for it. There is nothing wrong with that. \nBut there is a concept of taxation that I hope we will consider, that I \nhope we will take a look at. Taxation ought to generally be for the \npurpose of creating revenues to do the things that we are supposed to \ndo to be responsible in government. Let's pay for it.\n  Unfortunately, over a period of time, it seems to me--and we continue \nto do that--tax policy is designed as much to influence behavior as it \nis to raise revenues, so that each tax relief has a\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\ngreat deal of conditions attached. ``If you will do this, then we will \ngive you tax relief.'' ``If you behave in this way, we will give you \nsome tax relief.'' So we have created then a complicated and \ninefficient and, frankly, unfair tax system which brings about, of \ncourse, a great deal of debate about how we simplify the tax system.\n  We are not going to talk about that much this week. That is OK. That \nis OK. We are dealing with the short term. We are dealing with \nsomething we have not talked about for years, and that is tax relief. \nWe ought to do that. And I am pleased with what has been done in the \nbudget.\n  I am pleased with what has been done in the Finance Committee to move \nin that direction. That is not as far as we ought to go. Our next step \nthen ought to be to take a broader look at how we simplify taxes. I do \nnot have a favorite way of doing it. There are a number out there that \nare possible, whether they be flat taxes, whether they be sales taxes, \nwhatever. But we ought to do that. We ought to see if we cannot move \naway from this idea that taxes are designed to impact and direct \nbehavior and get to something that is much more simple, much more \ncollectible, much more less intrusive on people's lives. But, as I \nsaid, that is not the issue that will be before us this week.\n  The issue is to seek to get some tax relief for taxpayers in this \ncountry. You say, well, that sounds pretty simple. What is so \ncomplicated about that? Just listen over this week and you will hear \nall kinds of things about tax breaks for the rich, about those people \ndo not need it, we should not have tax breaks because we ought to have \nmore programs. And you will see all that, hear that coming from the \nWhite House and hear that coming from all over. And so it is not easy. \nIt is not simple. The idea of tax relief, which sounds very simple, is \nnot.\n  Most everyone agrees there ought to be some progressiveness in the \ntax system. And there is. Today's Code is more progressive than it was \nin 1950. The lower half of taxpayers pay less than 5 percent in total \ntaxes. And 25 percent of the taxpayers pay 80 percent of the taxes. \nThose that have over $42,000 in income are in that category. So we do \nhave a progressive tax system. And we should have. And we will continue \nto. But we ought not to confuse tax relief with all of the other kinds \nof issues that happen.\n  As I mentioned, the typical family of four forfeits nearly 40 percent \nof their income, more than they spend on food, shelter and clothing \ncombined. So it is tough. It is tough to raise a family. It is tough to \nsend your kids to school. It is tough to save for retirement. Nearly 3 \nhours out of every 8-hour workday are spent financing Government--money \nthat is spent on Washington's priorities, not yours.\n  More taxes, more government--that is one of the things that causes us \nto take a look at how you make government more efficient, that you \nrequire more efficiency, makes us take a look at the idea of private \ncontracting rather than having an increased size of government because \nit is more efficient, because it costs less, but unless you have some \nreason to do that, the government continues to get larger.\n  So we need to balance the budget, but keep in mind that you can \nbalance the budget by raising revenues, that that is not what we ought \nto do. We ought to balance the budget while controlling and reducing \nthe size of government. That is the challenge. And that is the \nchallenge that we need to undertake.\n  Unfortunately, we have not balanced our budget. But we now are in a \nposition to do that. We now have a budget in place that will do that \nover 5 years. We will also allow for some tax relief. And that is what \nwe will be talking about this week.\n  I think there is a considerable amount of history that we ought to \ntake into account. As we do it, we ought to talk about how long it has \nbeen since we have talked about tax relief. It has been a number of \nyears. We ought to keep in mind the fact is, over the last several \nyears that the movements in taxes have been simply to raise them. We \nought to keep in mind the fact that there are ways to reduce spending.\n  We have accomplished a good deal in the last little over 2 years. We \nhave moved to change welfare from an entitlement. We moved to cause it \nto be moved back to the States where it can be more effectively \nhandled. We have done something about the entitlement of agriculture \nand farm programs. The Presiding Officer was the Senator who had the \nmost leadership and impact on the changes in the farm bill. That is a \nfundamental change that we have made over a period of time.\n  We have talked in the last 2 years, and now, having moved toward \nessentially balancing the budget--we have not done that for a very long \ntime--this Congress and last year's Congress have caused that movement \nto where we are now talking about how we balance the budget and when we \nbalance the budget. Prior to that time, there was no talk about \nbalancing the budget.\n  So we have made a lot of progress. We have made a great deal of \nprogress in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. Does it go fast enough to suit \neveryone? Of course not. Will this tax bill suit everyone? Of course \nnot.\n  There will be arguments about whether there is enough in there for \ncapital gains. There will be arguments if there is enough in estate \ntaxes. There will be arguments as to why we do not do something else. I \nhad a call from a lady yesterday in Cheyenne who is retired whose home \nis valued so it already comes under the estate taxes. She says, ``I \nsent my kids to college and I didn't get a credit.'' She says, \n``There's nothing really in there for me much.'' Well, there are a few \nthings.\n\n  But it is true, it is true, it will not suit everyone. But I say to \nmy colleagues, let us move forward with this great opportunity for the \nfirst time in several decades that really makes some meaningful kind of \nadjustments in tax relief, to pursue the idea that Americans should be \nable to keep their hard-earned money, to pursue the idea that we ought \nto reduce the size of government and therefore the demand on taxes, to \npursue the idea that being able to keep more of the money that you work \nfor and earn is part of the incentive in this system.\n  So, Mr. President, this will be a very important week, and the week \nafter, when we really decide the direction that we will take on budgets \nand tax relief and how it will be adjudicated.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my friend and associate \nfrom Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I wish to offer my thanks to my friend and colleague from across the \nprairie from the great State of Wyoming.\n  People in Wyoming and Nebraska and all over America, I think, rather \nplainly understand and sense what we are doing this week in this body \nin this Congress; and that is addressing their issues.\n  You know, Mr. President, I am amused at much of the debate that has \nbeen raging in the Congress the last few months on the budget and \ntaxes. And, you see, I define this down rather simply. Whose money is \nthis? Whose money are we talking about? Is it the President's money? Is \nit my money? Is it the distinguished Presiding Officer's money? Is it \nCongress' money? No. No.\n  You see, this is about the people's money. This is about the hard-\nearned money of taxpayers. The Government should be accountable to the \npeople. Our taxpayers, our citizens should not be accountable to \ngovernment. And we are living at a time when we are taxed as highly as \nat any time, except in World War II, in the history of this country. We \nare living during a time when we are taxed that highly. A median family \nof four, total tax paid out, over 40 percent. These struggling young \nfamilies are paying more in taxes than they are in combined efforts to \nensure that they have enough for shelter or clothes or food and other \nnecessities.\n  At some point, Mr. President, we will not only bankrupt our country, \nbut we will surely bankrupt the opportunities for our young people. \nThese young people starting out in life in our country, a country of \npromise, of hope, of opportunity--always has been--are looking at a \nvery bleak future unless this Congress steps up and honestly deals with\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nthe challenges that take us into this bold new great century.\n  And it does start with tax cuts. It starts with real tax relief. And \nwhat we will be debating this week is tax relief for families, for \nlower middle-income people, people who need tax relief, people who pay \nthe bills in this country. But let us not also be unmindful of what \nelse is attached to what we will be debating.\n  Real budget cuts, putting this country on the trajectory for fiscal \nresponsibility, we have an opportunity here for the first time in 30 \nyears to agree to a balanced budget, a budget that would be in balance \nwithin 5 years, put this country on a course to balance our budget as \nfar out as the eye can see. We also have an opportunity to cut \ngovernment.\n  Government is too big. Government is unresponsive. Government cannot \npossibly do everything we have asked government to do. We have \noverloaded our circuits, Mr. President. Not government's fault. But we \nhave asked government over the last 30 years to do everything.\n  And who has paid the bill? Who has paid the bill? Well-intentioned \nprograms, but this is an era of prioritizing our resources. And we \nstart with giving our people, our taxpayers, the people who have been \ndoing the heavy lifting and paying the bills in this country the last \n30 years, especially, a break, give them some of their money back.\n  My goodness, they understand how to spend their money better than \ngovernment does. Let us decentralize power. Let us put power back where \nthe people are. Let us make government accountable and make it \nresponsible. So all of this is a total package.\n  Mr. President, I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. Before I \ncame to this body, I was a businessman. I started my own companies, \ninternational/national companies. And the opportunities that lay ahead \nfor this country, for our people, and the world, if we are wise enough \nto understand and seize the moment, the potential for our people is \nunlimited if--if--we are wise enough to cut our taxes, to cut our \nspending, to balance our budget, and take the burden of government off \nthe backs of our people who produce.\n  Oh, we will be able to get along for the next 5, 10 years. But we are \nentering a time like no other in the history of man. It is a time full \nof hope; but it is a time of great competitiveness. This next \ngeneration coming in behind us will have to compete in a complete \nglobal economy. And as we look all around the world, on every \ncontinent--and it is not just Asia--South America, Eastern Europe, the \nformer Soviet Republics, all of the areas in the world are doing well \nand will continue to explode with opportunity. They are disciplined. \nThey are focused. And the movement of most of the governments in the \nworld today is less government.\n\n  The countries in trouble today are in trouble because of the burden \nof taxes and the burden of government. We have an opportunity here, as \nmy distinguished colleague from Wyoming said earlier, to change that. \nImperfect? Yes. Do the taxes go deep enough, far enough? No. But it is \na beginning. It is a start. It is tangible. It is real.\n  We can build on that. And we can show America that, in fact, we can \ngovern and lead and do the people's business, that we do not get all \ntangled up in esoterics, in tactics and nonsense that goes on in this \ntown. But, in fact, we can stay focused and clear-headed and do the \npeople's business, and do what we are required to do on behalf of the \npeople of this country.\n  Mr. President, I want to also address for a moment some of the \nweekend television on this issue of tax cuts. I was a little amused \nthat I saw our distinguished Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin, who \nis a great public servant, who is dedicated, who has done a good job as \nSecretary of the Treasury, talk about the White House modeling of our \nproposed tax cuts that show most of the benefits going to the higher \nincome and the wealthy. That is just not true, absolutely not true.\n  I note here, for example, a press release sent out on Friday from one \nof the big six accounting firms, Deloitte & Touche. In the first \nparagraph it talks about:\n\n       Families with household incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 \n     are the biggest beneficiaries on a percentage basis under the \n     Senate tax plan, according to a new analysis by Deloitte & \n     Touche.\n       The big winners are middle-class families with kids.\n\n  And it goes on and on.\n  The scoring, the methodology, the models that the Members used are \nthe same models that the Congressional Budget Office uses, that we use, \nthat most everybody uses. I want to take issue with my friend, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, when he talks about some scoring model he \nreferred to over the weekend. That, in fact, is rather bizarre. It \nimputes income from unrealized capital gains. It talks about rent back \nincome. If you own your house and you actually put that house on the \nmarket for rent--that is just nonsense. What we are talking about here \nis real tax relief for real people. If we do this right, we can give \nthe American public, for the first time in 16 or 17 years, a tax cut, a \nreal tax cut that we can build on.\n  Mr. President, in my final comments, I will reference my weekend back \nin Nebraska. I was, on Saturday, in North Platte, NE, the home of \nBuffalo Bill. Being a good Kansan, Mr. President, you probably \nunderstand that and have probably been across the border and paid \nhomage to Buffalo Bill's home ranch. It was amazing to me, all day in \nNorth Platte, NE, farmers, ranchers, small business people, and \nfamilies would come up to me during the day and talk about this issue. \nFarmers, ranchers, and small business people asked me, ``Senator, do \nyou think I consider myself rich because I support capital gains tax or \ninheritance tax relief? You see I don't think I am very rich. I have an \nincome of $50,000, $40,000, or $60,000, but I would like to leave my \nchildren something. Why is it fair, Senator, for the Government to take \nthese big chunks out of an estate that the Government did not do \nanything to produce? I paid my taxes, and my father and mother paid \ntheir taxes all along the way. Yet in the end, the Government \nautomatically comes in and gets half.''\n  Mr. President, being the former chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, you understand what it has done to agriculture in this \ncountry, what it has done to devastate farms being passed along from \ngeneration to generation, ranches, and small businesses. It is unfair \nand wrong.\n  Anybody who has an asset is going to deal with a capital gains tax. \nYou do not have to be a millionaire. It is a sense of fairness, a sense \nof getting ahead in this country, a sense of doing the right thing. We \nhave a Tax Code in this country that essentially penalizes success. We \ngive disincentive to savings and investment.\n  Now, are we going to change the Tax Code this week? I doubt it. But \nthis is surely a darn good start. It is a very tangible, real beginning \nfor the people of this country who deserve it most. I hope my \ncolleagues during the debate this week will rivet in on this debate \nbecause it will be, as Senator Thomas said, one of the most important \ndebates not only of this Congress but, I think, of the last 10 years \nand into the next century because we have an opportunity to truly shape \nand mold the future of this country, the future for our young people.\n  We cannot leave them the mounds of debt that we are now leaving them, \nthe burden of regulation, the burden of big Government, the burden of \nhigh taxes, and think they are going to succeed. They will not. We must \nget at it. This is a good start. I strongly support what we have done \nso far and what has been produced out of the Finance Committee and over \nin the House Ways and Means Committee.\n  With that, I yield back my time to Senator Thomas of Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I just want to say the three of us here, \nand probably whoever else joins us, have not been in the Senate very \nlong, a couple of years. Most of us came in 1994. I want to say I am \nvery proud of what has happened in these last 2 years, not because of \nus entirely, but we have been here to see a substantial change in the \ndirection that this Congress has taken. One of the reasons has been \npeople coming, I think, in real close contact with the folks at home \nwho want to see some change, who want to see some change in the Tax \nCode, who really have been able to communicate the needs that have to \ntake place if we are going to realize the successes that we want.\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\n  So I have been very proud of the commitment of the freshman and the \nsophomore class in this place over the last couple of years. We hope to \ncontinue to do that, and one of the areas is the size of government, \nthe cost of government, the opportunity for people to keep the money \nthat they have earned. We are pleased to be a part of that.\n  One of the persons who has been very effective in doing that over \nthese 2 years is the Senator from Arizona. I am delighted he is here to \njoin us this morning. I yield the floor to Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for organizing this \nsession this morning for us to talk about the importance of tax cuts \nand the activity that the Senate is about to engage in finally \nproviding the tax cuts to the American people.\n  Throughout my campaign in 1994, that was one of the central features \nof every meeting that I attended--people calling for tax cuts. I will \nget back to that in a moment.\n\n  I was reminded, when the Senator from Nebraska was talking about \nbeing in North Platte, NE, this weekend and hearing from his \nconstituents there, that I flew over North Platte, NE yesterday. That \nis what the pilot of the airplane said, and it reminded me that I had \njust been to a meeting in Colorado where people from all over the \ncountry were saying the same thing. Nebraska is my State of birth, and \nI literally flew right over the area where I was born. It does not \nmatter whether you are from Kansas, Nebraska, or Wyoming, people around \nthis country have galvanized around a couple of central thoughts these \ndays, one of which is that the Government is taking too much of their \nmoney and they would like a little bit more freedom as to how they \nspend their own money.\n  It is interesting that the announcement last week by the American \nTaxpayers Union, a group that identifies a day called Tax Freedom Day, \nthe day that we finally begin working for ourselves and our families \nrather than the Government, that day has now been moved back. It was \nApril 29 back when I entered the Congress. It is now May 9. What that \nmeans is that the average family has to work until May 9 to pay the \nFederal Government everything it owes, and after that it can begin \npaying the State governments and other governments and eventually begin \nworking for itself.\n  It is high time, Mr. President, that the Congress initiate the action \nand that the President support the action to reduce taxes for hard-\nworking American families. I think we find that throughout the country, \nwhatever State we are from, that is what our constituents are telling \nus.\n  Now, we had tax cuts in 1981 and in 1986, but we had big tax \nincreases in 1990 and 1993. Those two tax increases were ostensibly for \nthe purpose of balancing the Federal budget. What we found is that the \ntax increases did not help to balance the Federal budget at all. What \nhas really helped to move us toward a balanced budget are two things. \nOne, a robust economy producing wealth, producing jobs, and producing \nrevenues to the Treasury, and also a Congress that has been more \nwilling to hold the line on spending. Through a combination of those \ntwo things we can achieve a balanced budget, and that is what the \nbudget agreement was all about.\n  Unfortunately, we are not spending enough of that revenue generated \nby a robust economy on the tax relief that should be provided to \nAmerican families. As a result, the budget agreement only provides for \n$85 billion over a period of 5 years in tax relief to American \nfamilies, not nearly enough to do the job we should be doing. That \nrepresents about 1 percent of the $8.6 trillion that will be coming \ninto the Federal Treasury during this 5-year period. So, clearly, we \ncould use more of the increase in revenues to offset the tax burden on \nthe American family.\n  But at least the negotiators who put this together in the Finance \nCommittee, which has put together a good package of tax relief for \nAmerican families, has recognized that a thriving economy is one of the \nkeys to not only continued economic growth but also getting rid of the \ndeficit, that the economy producing wealth also translates in revenues \nto the Treasury that will enable us to achieve a balanced budget. What \nthey have also recognized is it will enable us to provide tax relief.\n  Now, there is another aspect of good news in this, Mr. President. Not \nonly does a thriving economy bring in more revenue and therefore enable \nus to balance the budget and provide tax relief, but that very tax \nrelief helps to fuel the economy to grow even more, produce even more \njobs, produce even more wealth, and therefore more revenues to the \nTreasury. So, it is a very positive and constructive cycle--tax relief \ncan assist the economy to continue to thrive to produce more wealth to \nproduce more revenue to the Treasury.\n  Therefore, we ought to consider that this is just the beginning of \ntax relief. For those of us who have been preaching this for a long \ntime, I think we should at least get a little bit of credit for the \ntheory that has resulted in the good situation that we are in right \nnow, and that perhaps those who said no, the only way you can have a \nbalanced budget is by raising taxes, will now acknowledge that those of \nus who have been proposing cutting taxes have had something to say for \nthese last several years.\n  The original budget agreement here that we are trying to implement \ncalls for $85 billion in tax relief over a 5-year period. That is not \nenough to do everything that everyone would like. As a matter of fact, \nthe original Republican plan called for a reduction in capital gains \ntaxes, estate tax relief, $500 per child tax credit, and some \neducational and IRA benefits to American taxpayers. That would cost \nabout $188 billion over the 5-year period if you do not count increased \nrevenues that would be produced as a result of capital gains \nreductions. So you can see from a program that would theoretically cost \nthe Treasury $188 billion, trying to squeeze all of that into $85 \nbillion is going to mean that this tax relief is not as robust as we \nwould like it to be, and that is a fact.\n  But I do compliment the Finance Committee for making the most out of \nthe $85 billion it was provided. I think, as we will see as this is \ndebated on the floor this week, the benefits to the American taxpayers, \nas the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, are significant. Most of \nthem go to working families. There are some that go to the risk-takers \nin our society, but after all, if there is not some reward for risk-\ntaking in our economy, people are not going to take risks, they will \nnot make those investments that eventually produce the great companies \nthat hire the people that produce the wealth and end up creating \nrevenues for the Treasury.\n\n  So it is a combination of providing most of the tax relief for \nAmerican working families and, in addition to that, some reward for the \nrisk-takers in our society.\n  The American Council for Capital Formation has estimated that the \ncapital gains relief that is provided for in our bill would reduce the \ncost of capital by at least 8 percent. What that would do is permit the \ncreation of 150,000 new jobs each and every year. So that is one of the \nbenefits of this capital gains reduction we are talking about, Mr. \nPresident. It is to enable capital to be more efficiently used in our \neconomy. Instead of having $7 trillion in pent-up assets that nobody \nwants to sell or dispose of because they will have to pay a big tax on \nit of 28 percent, if we reduce that to 20 percent for higher bracket \ntaxpayers and 10 percent for lower bracket taxpayers, that is an \nincentive for them to finally sell that asset that they have been \nholding on to, and by that sale we actually not only help to put the \nmoney into more productive enterprises but also eventually create more \nrevenue to the Treasury as a result of the tax that is paid every time \none of those assets sells.\n  A lot of economists today will criticize the current capital gains \npolicy because what it has done is to tie up capital in older \nindustries, in businesses that were created a long time ago. People do \nnot want to sell when they have to pay the capital gains tax on it and \ninvest it in a more contemporary kind of business. But America has led \nthe world in enterprise, in new businesses--in our high tech computer \nindustry, for example--and if we are going to continue to maintain that \nlead, we need to have the capital to invest in these new and emerging \nindustries. The only way that will be possible is if there is an \nincentive for people to get rid of the investment in the\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nolder industry or business and invest that in one of the new emerging \nbusinesses.\n  Interestingly enough, this American Council for Capital Formation \nnotes that the cost of capital would be reduced by 8 percent, which \nwould create new jobs. It will also help the Treasury. It should be \nnoted, between 1978 and 1985, the top margin of tax rate on capital \ngains was cut by almost 45 percent--it went from 35 percent down to 20 \npercent--but total individual capital gains receipts tripled, from $9.1 \nbillion to $26.5 billion annually.\n  Obviously, a capital gains tax cut is a winner for investors, for job \nseekers, as well as for the U.S. Treasury. That is why we believe that \nthe capital gains components of tax relief, as the Senator from \nNebraska pointed out, has to be one of the critical components and will \nbenefit all American families as well as the U.S. Treasury.\n  We have talked about the other aspects of this tax proposal, my \ncolleagues have, but I wanted to specifically single out the capital \ngains tax because it does not help just the wealthy, as some folks \nsay, but will provide benefits to all taxpayers in this country and all \nworkers.\n\n  One last word, Mr. President. I have sponsored the bill to repeal the \nestate tax, or the so-called death tax. My bill has more cosponsors \nthan any of the other bills relating to the estate tax in the Senate \nand, likewise, the corresponding bill in the House. The Senator from \nNebraska, the Senator from Kansas, and the Senator from Wyoming have \nall been very supportive because of the impact on farms and small \nbusinesses in their States. It is the same throughout the country. We \nneed to do something about this.\n  Unfortunately, because of the original budget agreement limiting the \ntax cuts to only $85 billion over the 5-year period, or 1 percent of \ntax revenues, the administration made sure that there wasn't too much \ntax relief in the agreement. The Senate leaders were trying to push for \nmore, but because there was an agreement we are not going to be able to \ndo everything we should. All we are going to be able to do on estate \ntax relief is very, very modest relief. I regret that. All of us do.\n  Basically, what we are doing is raising the exemption from $600,000 \nup to a million dollars over a 10- or 11-year period. Inflation alone \nwill mean that not even this legislation will keep pace with inflation. \nSo that is totally inadequate. In order for us to do what we do in the \nother areas, I guess we are going to have to be willing to accept that. \nWhat it means, Mr. President, is that there is still going to be a big \nincentive for those people concerned about the estate tax to come in \nwith a second round of reforms, beginning next year.\n  As a result of an amendment I was able to get passed in the budget, \nand which stayed in the budget, we are not precluded from offering \nadditional tax relief beginning next year. One of the first things I am \ngoing to do--and I think my colleagues will support me on this--is get \nadditional estate tax relief beyond that which is agreed to in this \nbill. We all recognize that it is totally inadequate in this bill. We \nsupport the tax relief, but we don't, for a minute, contend that it is \nadequate.\n  So those are the two points I wanted to make--first, that the capital \ngains relief in this legislation will be enormously beneficial to \nworking families, to the risk-takers in our society, and even to the \nTreasury, which will enable us to continue to be on a track to balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  Second, this whole package is just the beginning. We begin the \nprocess of reducing the tax burden on working Americans, but even \nbeginning next year we will have proposals to continue that process. It \nis the right thing to do. It is what our constituents asked us to do, \nand for future generations it is the only thing we can do to fully \ncomply with our obligation to leave this country a better place than we \nfound it. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for the time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are joined by the Senator from Alabama, \nwho is also new here. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to be here to \ntalk about one of the most important issues facing this country, and \nthat is the tax burden on working Americans. Many people think that it \nis just a political gimmick when we talk about the need to reduce \ntaxes. They think that is just a gimmick to get votes, that we are \ntrying to appeal to the people in a way that somehow is less than \nhonest and forthright, or that we are seeking to buy votes by promising \na tax cut. Mr. President, it is much, much deeper than that.\n  The problem in this country is that we are reaching a tax burden that \nis unacceptable. An excessive tax burden has the capacity to diminish \nour competitiveness in the world, while an easing of that tax burden \nhas the potential to increase our productivity as a nation. All we have \nto do is let people keep more of their hard-earned money. Taxes are, in \na way, a penalty, a punishment on hard work. If you want to reduce \nsomething, you tax it. If you want to encourage something, you \nsubsidize it. One of the problems with our country is that we have been \npenalizing good behavior. We have been penalizing people who work \nhard--husbands and wives who have jobs, or maybe they have two jobs \neach. They work and make money to take care of their children. We are \ntaxing them to a degree that we have never taxed them before. We have \ndiminished their strength and hurt those families that are struggling \nto get by. We subsidize people that don't work, give money to people \nwho choose not to work, and we have wasted money on programs that are \nactually counterproductive. The U.S. Government is not an efficient \nentity. We do not use dollars wisely. But families do. They are \nstruggling to get by.\n\n  Let me ask you, how bad is the situation we are currently dealing \nwith? First of all, I don't think anybody would be surprised to know \nthat this Government brings in more money today than it ever has in its \nhistory. Every month, every year that goes by, we bring in more money \nthan the month and the year before. That will not change, even when we \npass these tax breaks for working Americans. So we are bringing in more \nmoney. We are not trying to shut down this Government. We are going to \nallow it to bring in more money. We are going to allow this Government \nto bring in more money, even with these tax cuts. So this is not an \nextreme position.\n  What you may not know is this: When President Clinton took office in \n1992, 19 percent of this Nation's gross domestic product went to the \nGovernment. That is a very large sum, no doubt about it. Since that \ntime, and since his 1993 tax increase--the largest tax increase in \nhistory--we have gone from, last year, 20.9 percent of the gross \ndomestic product--the gross domestic product is the total of all goods \nand services produced in this Nation--going to government, to, this \nyear, over 21 percent. This 21 percent is paid by the taxpayers and \nworking citizens of this Nation to the Government in the form of taxes.\n  I think it is important, Mr. President, for us to think about this in \nhistorical terms. What does this mean?\n  Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote \nrecently about this. He made this point: Never in the history of this \nNation have we reached the point where 21 percent of the Federal gross \ndomestic product is paid to this Government in the form of taxes--not \nduring the height of World War II did we reach that level, not during \nthe Korean war did we reach that level, not during the Vietnam war did \nwe reach that level, and not during the recessions when the economy has \nslowed down did we reach that level; none of those times have we \nreached the point where we paid the highest level in history--21 \npercent of the gross domestic product--to this country.\n  Last year, when I ran for office and I asked people for their \nsupport, I talked to them about the future and the direction this \ncountry ought to take. They expressed to me their desire to have less \nGovernment, a return to local government, and a reduction in the power \nand influence and waste and mismanagement of the Federal Government. \nThe trends are clear, and the trends are not good.\n  What this tax proposal does is, it says to this giant bureaucracy of \nthe Federal Government that we want to bring you under control. We \ndon't want 22 percent of GDP going to the government next year, 24 the \nnext, 26 the\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\nnext, and 28 the next and, finally, a third, or even a half of our \nmoney going to the Federal Government. That is not the way to keep this \nNation strong. We need to do better.\n  Taxes are too high. We are not claiming they are too high because we \nare trying to get people's support by promising some political tax \ngimmick. This is a fundamental, governmental policy change. That is \nwhat I was sent here to do, to be a part of that. I wish that the tax \ncuts that have been proposed and are being pushed by my Republican \ncolleagues could be bigger. But we know we have to have bipartisan \nsupport and be able to overcome a Presidential veto. As a result, we \nhave had to work hard and compromise to reach a significant tax cut. \nThis is significant tax cut, but I wish it were bigger. It is a good \ntax cut; we need to have it and we need to proceed with it.\n\n  One complaint that has been made, Mr. President, is that this is a \ntax cut for ``rich'' people. It doesn't help the poor people. Well, a \ntax cut can only be applied to those who pay taxes. This is a tax cut, \nnot a welfare program. We have welfare programs. We still have our Food \nStamp Program. We still have our Aid to Families With Dependent \nChildren. We are going to provide more money this year than ever and \nprovide health insurance for those who don't have it. We are going to \ncontinue Medicare and strengthen that and make it a sounder policy to \nhelp poor people in America. This is not a welfare program. We are \ntalking about a tax cut for people that are working and paying taxes. \nThat is who needs a break right now--middle America. We need to be \nright up front about it. This is not a welfare program. It is a tax cut \nfor people who are paying more taxes than they ought to pay.\n  Federal income taxes are graduated. The highest income people do pay \nmore taxes. A family of four making $20,000 does not pay income taxes. \nMost families of four will not pay any taxes with a $20,000 income. Our \nidea is to allow those middle-class Americans, who are working and \nstruggling to get by, to keep more of their money.\n  I have traveled Alabama in the last few years and I have talked to \npeople. I have seen studies and all of the economic data that we get \naround here. I have served on the Joint Economic Committee of the \nSenate and the House, where we have dealt with economic reports from \nthe Department of Labor and various other departments of the \nGovernment. We have analyzed those figures, and what my instincts tell \nme, and what I have learned from campaigning throughout Alabama, as \nwell as from what the statistics show, is that middle-class, working \nfamilies are struggling to a degree they have never struggled before.\n  In 1950, 70 percent of a middle-class, average family's income was \nshielded from Federal income tax. They paid no taxes on 70 percent of \nthe money they earned. Today, only 30 percent is shielded. The \npercentage that you pay on the amount that you earn is higher. Taxes \nhave gone up. In 1950, the average working family only paid 2 cents out \nof every dollar to the U.S. Government in the form of taxes--2 cents. \nToday, it is 25 cents. That is a dramatic change in American policy. I \nsubmit to you, Mr. President, that it is unacceptable.\n  I think it is time for us to be frank with ourselves, to be honest, \nto realize that we can't keep increasing tax burdens so that we \npoliticians here in this Senate and this Congress can pass programs and \npass out money and claim we are heroes. It is not our money we are \npassing out. It is money that we took from some family that needed that \nmoney.\n  Let's think about this $500 per child tax credit. A family of three, \nat $1,500 per year, can divide that up per month and it will be over \n$100 per month, tax free. Tell me a family making $30,000 can't use an \nextra $100 per month. Frankly, I am concerned about the idea that we \nought to mandate in later years, at age 13 or 14, that they be required \nto apply that tax credit toward college savings. I am telling you that \nis not realistic. Working families in America today are concerned about \ngetting by; they are not always concerned about college. They have a \ncar that needs tires on it. They might need to fix the muffler. The \nchildren might need to go on a school trip. Where are they going to get \nthe money for that? This could provide that. I think we ought to trust \nthe families with these decisions and let this be their tax cut. We, in \nCongress, should not try to manage what they are going to do with it. A \nlot of kids don't go to college. A lot of kids work their own way \nthrough college. Maybe that family desperately needs that money now for \npersonal items just to get by. That is who we ought to be supporting.\n  So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly about this. I am most proud \nto be associated with a group of Senators who are committed to \nrealistically reducing the tax burden on America.\n  I was so proud to be associated with Senator Kyl from Arizona who \nspoke previously. Senator Kyl has been a champion for estate tax \nreduction. And I was pleased to join with him as an original cosponsor \non his bill to eliminate this estate tax. I think that is an unfair \ntax. The estate tax only brings in about 1 percent of the Federal \nGovernment's income. Considering the amount of money it brings in \ncompared with the cost of administering that program and the great \ngymnastics that people go through to try to avoid it, the estate tax is \njust inefficient and unfair. We could eliminate that tax and make this \ncountry and this economy more healthy.\n  Total Federal Government and State government taxes now amount to \nover 30 percent of the gross domestic product. In my opinion, measuring \nthe tax rate to the growth domestic product is a good and just way to \ndetermine just how significant our tax burden is.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to share this story. I think it is a \nvery important story. I serve on the Joint Economic Committee. Alan \nGreenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, testified at one of \nthe first committee hearings I attended. It appeared he was about to \nraise interest rates, and everyone was most anxious. The economy was \ngoing along well. We were all pleased about the growth of the economy. \nThere were a number of discussions about why the economy was doing so \nwell. Some joked that it was President Clinton, and some said it was \nMr. Greenspan. It was just a lighthearted conversation.\n  When it came my time to ask him questions, I asked him about an \narticle that I had read in USA Today. They interviewed business people \nfrom Germany, England, and Japan. They asked them why the American \neconomy was doing better than the economies of those three nations. \nWhen you boiled it down, those representatives from those three nations \ngave three reasons. They said the American economy is stronger because \nwe have lower taxes, less regulation, and a greater commitment to the \nmarket economy, to the free market.\n  I asked Mr. Greenspan if he agreed with that. He said, ``Yes, I \nabsolutely agree with that.'' He said that without hesitation.\n  Those are the cornerstones of a strong and vibrant economy. We cannot \nkeep raising our taxes every year so that we take a larger and larger \nportion of our gross domestic product. We will end up like Germany with \nunemployment over 12 percent instead of around 5 percent. That is what \nwe will be heading to.\n  So this drive, this imperative to reduce taxes is not just to see if \nwe can buy votes for letting people have more money; it is to try to \ninvigorate and maintain the competitive capacity of this Nation. That \nis why we are doing better than the rest of the world.\n  I don't know who you could say deserves credit for this economy. We \ncould have a lot of different ideas. But I would say that the \nRepublican Party and Presidents Reagan and Bush, who spent a whole \ncareer fighting to reduce regulations and to contain the growth of \ntaxes, even reduce taxes, played an important role in this economy. We \nneed to remember that and maintain our historical position as a nation \nthat will fight to keep its tax burden from going up.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to express my \nexcitement and primacy of support for legislation that will allow \nAmericans who work hard every day to keep more of their money. They can \nspend it on the things they want to spend it on and not on something \nthat somebody in Washington wants to spend it on. It will be good for \nthem. It will be good for their families, and it will be good for the\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\ncompetitive and productive capacity of this Nation.\n  I think this is an extremely important issue. We should not minimize \nit. Lower taxes will make us a stronger and more competitive Nation. We \nwill have a greater increase in our economic growth. And out of that \ngrowth, we will have the capacity to serve those who are less \nfortunate. If we kill the goose that laid the golden egg, if we \ncontinue to tax this economy to the degree that it drives its growth \ndown, we will not have that strength and that capacity to meet the \nchallenges of our Nation.\n  Just look at the economies of Europe and Japan. You will see what can \nhappen to us if we are not careful.\n  I am excited about what is happening. I look forward to having the \nopportunity to vote on many of these issues. I hope that the result \nwill be that this economy will be free from further taxation, that we \nwill have more growth and more productivity, and that we will be more \ncompetitive in the world.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6049-6", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on Thursday, June 19, I appeared before the \nSubcommittee on International Economic Policy, Export and Trade \nPromotion to testify on Global warming and on behalf of my sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution on the same matter which now has 61 cosponsors \nincluding myself.\n  I was pleased to appear on the same panel with my good friend, \nCongressman John Dingell. I ask unanimous consent that my testimony and \nthat of Congressman Dingell on that occasion be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                  Statement of Senator Robert C. Byrd\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to appear \n     before the subcommittee to discuss the critically important \n     issue of the negotiations aimed at signing a protocol during \n     the third session of the Conference of the Parties to the \n     United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, \n     which is scheduled to be held in December in Kyoto, Japan. I \n     am concerned that the protocol that results from these \n     negotiations could have a serious impact on American industry \n     and on our economy, while at the same time failing to address \n     a looming threat to the global environment.\n       On June 12, I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution, \n     together with Senator Hagel and a bipartisan group of my \n     colleagues, which addresses the conditions for U.S. agreement \n     to revisions to the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change. The resolution has been cosponsored by 60 \n     Senators from both sides of the aisle. This resolution states \n     the Sense of the Senate that the developing world must fully \n     participate in the treaty negotiations and commitments and \n     play a meaningful role in effectively addressing the problem \n     of global climate change.\n       In essence, the resolution accepts the thesis, which is \n     still the subject of some dispute, that the increasing \n     release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its \n     accumulation in our atmosphere are causing a very gradual \n     heating of the globe, which has many adverse consequences for \n     us all. I believe the Administration should be commended for \n     its efforts on this issue, and I commend this subcommittee \n     for its attention to this matter. If substantial steps are \n     going to be taken to influence carbon dioxide and other \n     greenhouse gas emissions, we need to accelerate new \n     technologies, anticipate new developments, and encourage \n     public/private sector participation.\n       President Bush signed the United Nations Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change, the so-called Rio Pact, in \n     1992, which was subsequently approved by the Senate, and \n     calls on the industrialized nations to aim to reduce their \n     greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to their 1990 levels by the \n     year 2000, a goal which will not be achieved by the U.S. nor \n     by the vast majority of the industrialized nations unless \n     further steps are taken.\n       The parties to the Framework Convention met in Berlin in \n     1995 to discuss the future direction of the treaty in light \n     of this projected failure to meet the voluntary objectives, \n     agreeing that any new commitments would be binding upon the \n     signatories. Specifically excluded from any new commitments, \n     however, would be the countries that comprise the developing \n     world. The rationale for the so-called Berlin Mandate was \n     that it is the industrialized OECD (Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development) nations that have been the major \n     emitters of greenhouse gases in the past, and will continue \n     to be in the next decade.\n       There are two intrinsic problems with the Berlin Mandate. \n     First, while the industrialized world is the primary \n     contributor to the current problem, that will not be the case \n     in only a few years. As this chart demonstrates, the \n     emissions of the developing world are rapidly increasing on a \n     sharp, upward slope. These emissions will actually surpass \n     those of the industrialized OECD nations by the year 2015. In \n     short, the developing world is rapidly becoming a clone of \n     the OECD nations.\n       Let us assume that the current negotiations for a new \n     protocol, which are to be concluded in Kyoto this December, \n     result in a binding commitment that the OECD nations must \n     reduce their emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. This chart \n     demonstrates that under such a scenario the OECD nations will \n     sharply reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. The price \n     we will pay in order to achieve these reductions is open to \n     debate, as estimates differ. Nonetheless, the key point is \n     that this responsibility will not be shared because of the \n     Berlin Mandate, for the chart clearly shows that the \n     emissions of the developing world continue on their \n     inexorable upward track, even as we in the OECD group make \n     the painful and costly adjustments necessary to force down \n     our emissions.\n       This demonstrates the second problem with the Berlin \n     Mandate, which is that we gave away the store, and we \n     received nothing in return. Many of the biggest emitters of \n     greenhouse gases in the developing world have refused to even \n     discuss, let alone seriously consider, taking any emissions \n     limitations commitments upon themselves. In what can only be \n     viewed as an act of environmental irresponsibility, the \n     developing nations have adamantly refused to recognize that \n     they will, over the next two decades, become the primary \n     cause of the problem, in terms of annual emissions.\n       The refusal of the developing world to discuss any future \n     emissions limitations commitments has become a central issue, \n     for any attempt to bring them into the process is labeled by \n     some as a ``treaty killer.'' I have a different perspective. \n     My resolution is not a treaty killer. It is, in fact, a \n     treaty enhancer. It calls upon the Administration not to \n     agree to a protocol, unless it includes new commitments to \n     limit or reduce greenhouse gases emissions for developing \n     country parties within  the same compliance period. My \n     resolution improves the treaty. For any treaty that does \n     not include emissions limitations provisions for the \n     developing world is inherently unsound and ineffectual on \n     its face. Environmentally, we are all in the same global \n     boat. What good does it do for the United States and other \n     developed nations to work feverishly to plug the holes in \n     the boat, if the developing nations are drilling holes at \n     the other end just as fast as we plug them? Be assured \n     that the global boat will sink just as rapidly and we are \n     all going to be in for a long, long swim.\n       Bringing the developing world in under the climate change \n     tent, as part of any future treaty, will not only increase \n     the prospects of Senate ratification, it will also be \n     enormously beneficial for the international environment. Let \n     me further clarify that point. This chart shows the world of \n     1995, in terms of world carbon emissions in millions of \n     metric tons of carbon. The United States and OECD nations, \n     shown in red, are responsible for a little over half of that \n     total. The next chart projects the world as it might be after \n     the currently proposed treaty is adopted, with only the \n     developed world taking action to reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions. The difference is startling. The developing world, \n     shown in purple, has assumed the U.S. and OECD nations' place \n     as the biggest global polluters. The problem remains the \n     same, only the names have changed. And again, because of the \n     flawed Berlin Mandate, all of these emissions from the \n     developing world will be completely uncontrolled, and free to \n     increase even further. From this perspective, it is the \n     Berlin Mandate--and the fact that it lets the developing \n     world off the hook scott-free--that will seriously harm the \n     global environment in future years.\n       Finally, let us examine the role of China. Despite \n     possessing a strong and growing economic and industrial base, \n     despite possessing the ability to launch satellites into \n     orbit, China is still counted among the family of developing \n     nations. But its industrial growth is matched by its growing \n     contribution to global pollution. This chart compares China's \n     contribution to global carbon emissions to the contribution \n     made by the United States. On the left, we can see that based \n     upon current trends, China will surpass the\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\n     United States in carbon emissions by 2015. On the right, we \n     can see that if current proposals are adopted, under which we \n     would reduce our carbon emissions to 1990 levels, while \n     imposing no requirements upon the developing world and China, \n     China all by itself will greatly exceed the United States in \n     metric tons of carbon emitted.\n       I find it disturbing that despite its future role as the \n     world's leading contributor to the problem of carbon \n     emissions, China has indicated steadfast refusal to apply any \n     type of binding obligations upon its own economy and \n     industries. I believe that if the treaty we are negotiating \n     today does not equally commit developing nations like China \n     to binding commitments, there will be no incentive for China \n     and the other nations of the developing  world to make \n     responsible and environmentally sound choices as they \n     develop. You can be sure that after China assumes its role \n     as a leading carbon emitter, she will not be very eager to \n     make the tough and costly corrections to retrofit her \n     industries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. \n     Indeed, she may expect to benefit from a treaty in which \n     she escapes binding commitments, because it may allow her \n     to import industries from OECD nations that would choose \n     to relocate there rather than change their ways and clean \n     up their acts at home.\n       My message to U.S. negotiators is that all nations, but \n     particularly those that are making and will make a \n     significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, need to \n     (1) make commitments at Kyoto that unequivocally demonstrate \n     an action program to tackle this problem, and (2) to start \n     with aggressive efforts to act on those commitments \n     immediately and not settle for vague promises to return to a \n     future negotiation to get serious. Finally, while countries \n     have different levels of development, each must make unique \n     and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with \n     their industrialization. The developing world must agree in \n     Kyoto to some manner of binding targets and commitments which \n     would begin at the same time as the developed world in as \n     aggressive and effective a schedule as possible given the \n     gravity of the problem and the need for a fair sharing of the \n     burden.\n       In closing, I note that my resolution states than any \n     treaty presented to the Senate be accompanied by a ``detailed \n     explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may \n     be required to implement the protocol or other agreement and \n     should also be accompanied by an analysis of the detailed \n     financial costs and other impacts on the economy of the \n     United States which would be incurred by the implementation \n     of the agreement.'' There surely will be costs if the United \n     States is to make the changes to our existing industrial base \n     and to our existing lifestyle necessary to meet the goals of \n     this treaty. Our smokestacks must be cleaner and our \n     automobiles more efficient. There are many ways to achieve \n     these goals. We must be able to tell the American people what \n     will be required to meet any proposed commitment.\n       Politically, I believe that there needs to be a strong \n     consensus between the President and Congress about any plan \n     of action. The Administration's policy of follow-on \n     multilateral negotiations to deepen the impact of the Rio \n     Pact requires very substantial consensus-building with the \n     Congress, and broad educational activities to bring the \n     American public along. To impose effective, legally-binding \n     measures on the U.S. economy, will mean having the strong \n     support of the Senate. We Senators need to be deeply \n     concerned over the alarm that has been expressed to us by a \n     very broad range of American industry and labor over the \n     impacts on our economy of a treaty which commits the United \n     States to deep emission reductions, and which does not spread \n     the burden of responsibility equitably across the globe. \n     These assessments by bedrock American industry must be taken \n     seriously. I hope that this hearing will result in new Senate \n     attention to the progress of these negotiations, and that \n     this Committee will serve to interact regularly with the \n     State Department and Administration policy-makers as our \n     negotiating strategy is developed and refined.\n       The resolution that Senator Hagel and I introduced, and \n     which has won the support of a majority of sixty Senators, is \n     aimed at that negotiation, and beyond. Since carbon and other \n     greenhouse gases can accumulate in the atmosphere and persist \n     for long periods, we will not as a community of nations get a \n     handle on these threats to our global climate unless everyone \n     participates and does their share to solve the problem. We \n     all share our earth in common. We breath the same air, and we \n     are exposed to the same global climate system. We must all \n     accept our share of the responsibility for the global \n     climate. We must keep this fragile boat afloat, together, and \n     the sooner we have commitments from all its passengers to \n     work together in that effort, the better.\n\n Testimony of the Honorable John D. Dingell, Senate Foreign Relations \n Committee, Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Export and \n                     Trade Promotion, June 19, 1997\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your holding this hearing. I \n     consider it a great honor to testify beside my good friend \n     and highly respected colleague from West Virginia, Senator \n     Byrd.\n       I do not appear before this Subcommittee as a critic of the \n     idea that we are engaged in climate change negotiations and \n     that we are moving forward. I'm critical of the idea that we \n     are negotiating without the full and proper information that \n     we need.\n       With respect to the climate change negotiations, I have \n     several questions to which I have yet to receive satisfactory \n     answers.\n       One: Have we overreached on the science?\n       The State Department has concluded that current science \n     proves that global warming is ``dangerous'' and requires \n     immediate emissions reductions. But the official U.N. \n     scientific body has gone only so far as to identify a link \n     between human activity and warming, but their own document on \n     the science states, and I quote, ``our ability to quantify \n     the human influence on global climate is currently limited.'' \n     In other words, we don't know with any degree of precision \n     how big the problem is, we don't know how fast it's moving, \n     or how it can be mitigated.\n       My friend and former colleague Tim Wirth, who will testify \n     later this morning, agrees on this point. At a public forum \n     this February he said there is ``no doubt about the theory'' \n     of climate change and that ``we don't know where, how much or \n     how fast.''\n       Two: Is what we're seeing here a classic example of mission \n     creep?\n       We've seen a shift from voluntary to mandatory policies. \n     Initially, the Administration's policy was based on voluntary \n     agreements with industry and reliance on ``joint \n     implementation'' of mutually beneficial partnerships between \n     U.S. industry and developing countries. For instance, U.S. \n     companies would get credit for helping developing countries \n     build clean power plants. But sometime early in 1996, the \n     tone changed. Mandatory emissions reduction became the goal.\n       Three: Who is representing America's interests? Are we \n     setting ourselves up for an economic fiasco?\n       In a letter to me in 1995, President Clinton promised not \n     to agree to anything which would adversely affect U.S. \n     competitiveness. But the State Department has signed onto \n     agreements that are procedurally and substantively \n     disadvantageous. The outcome may be an agreement late in 1997 \n     in Kyoto imposing mandatory emissions reductions on developed \n     countries, and at best only voluntary steps for developing \n     nations.\n       We've already committed ourselves to steps to control \n     emissions and potentially harm our competitiveness. The \n     developing countries are scot-free. We've gotten not a \n     single, solid, binding commitment from them.\n       My friends in the Administration argue that they are being \n     hard-nosed because they have rejected the more extreme \n     proposals advanced by groups such as the Association of Small \n     Island States, or AOSIS. But I find scant reason to \n     congratulate our negotiators for refusing the chance to \n     submit our unconditional surrender.\n       Four: Even if you disagree that climate change is a \n     problem, is the Administration really doing anything to \n     protect the environment?\n       The theory of global warming holds that greenhouse gases \n     have an effect no matter where in the world they are emitted. \n     This is not like the debate over acid rain or ozone, where \n     emissions from one part of the country were thought to cause \n     problems in another, identifiable region. China will surpass \n     us in terms of emissions early in the next century. If you \n     accept the theory of global warming, those emissions will \n     cause as much harm to the climate as emissions from the \n     developed countries today.\n       Five: How is all this going to work?\n       I've yet to see a proposed negotiating text that includes \n     specific dates and numbers. Those are important matters, but \n     there are some other fundamental issues at hand: Who will \n     have to do what? Who will enforce the agreement, and how \n     timely would enforcement be? If we establish a trading \n     system, is China or any other developing country going to be \n     allowed to keep credits for themselves as a country? Or will \n     companies be allowed to use them to offset operations \n     elsewhere in the world? Does anyone seriously believe China, \n     or any other country for that matter, will act on altruistic \n     motives?\n       This leads me to my sixth and final question. Why are we \n     doing this before we have the most basic information about \n     how climate change policies will affect our economy? In \n     short, has the Administration bothered to do its homework?\n       We were supposed to have the vaunted analysis and \n     assessment of the impact of climate change policies on the \n     U.S. economy by the end of last year. It has not been \n     completed yet, despite repeated promises to Congress and \n     industry that it would be available before important policy \n     decisions are made. But the State Department formally \n     proposed a cap-and-trade negotiating position in January. In \n     short, the analysis is self-evidently too late to inform the \n     process, and likely will be used to justify what the \n     Administration has already decided to do. Just as clearly, \n     public participation and comment on the analysis and \n     assessment is irrelevant. And the Department of Commerce \n     official in charge of the analysis and assessment has moved \n     on to pursue other career opportunities.\n       I have asked the Administration whether, when they go to \n     Kyoto next December, they will refuse to sign any agreement \n     that binds the U.S. to new emissions obligations unless it \n     holds our economic competitors in the developing world to \n     equivalent obligations. I cannot in all truth say that I have \n     received a reassuring answer.\n       My concerns very closely parallel those of American labor, \n     and I am delighted that you\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\n     will be hearing from Secretary-Treasurer Trumka of the AFL-\n     CIO. I commend to you the resolution on climate change \n     adopted by the AFL-CIO Executive Council, as well as the \n     Senate resolution offered by Senator Byrd.\n       Let me close by noting again that I am not opposed to our \n     being part of international negotiations on climate change. \n     But I would approach those negotiations the way I would \n     approach a high-stake poker game: with an open mind, but not \n     with a blank check.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6056-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHARLES BEATTY'S DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, recently, the Rocky Mountain News reported \non a new program in Colorado, the Community Entrepreneurial Program, \nwhich provides small business loans to inner city Denver entrepreneurs.\n  The Community Entrepreneurial Program uses private and nonprofit \nfunds, not government money, to fund these micro-loans. It is part of \nan international effort to set up small businesses around the world, \nEnterprise Development International, headquartered in Arlington, VA.\n  As we continue to find ways to help people help themselves, this \nprogram is leading the way in helping individuals with the initiative \nand drive to start a small business.\n  To quote Wil Armstrong, a Denver business leader who is very active \nin the Community Entrepreneurial Program, ``We're backing one little \nbusiness at a time, trying to make a difference for just one person or \none family at a time.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Rocky Mountain News story be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, May 25, 1997]\n\n                      Micro-Loans Aid Denver Poor\n\n                             (By Al Lewis)\n\n       Micro-loans have long been heralded as a solution to Third \n     World economic woes. Now a handful of micro-lending \n     organizations are bringing them to Denver.\n       ``We call ourselves the investment banker to the ghetto,'' \n     said Stephen Rosenburgh, chief executive officer of \n     Arlington, Va.-based Enterprise Development International.\n       ``We seek to enable the poorest of the poor.''\n       Since 1985, his group has helped 660,000 people set up \n     small businesses around the world. It has helped first-time \n     entrepreneurs purchase everything from rickshaws to trucks, \n     hand tools to laptops.\n       Now the group is contributing to a $240,000 loan pool that \n     will finance small start-ups in low-income areas of Northeast \n     Denver.\n       The Community Entrepreneurial Program, launched last week, \n     will make 16 to 20 loans of up to $15,000 to entrepreneurs in \n     the Whittier, Five Points, Park Hill and City Park East \n     neighborhoods, said Bill Bridges of Belay Enterprises.\n       ``A lot of inner-city people find it hard to connect with a \n     bank,'' Bridges said. ``But with welfare reform on the \n     horizon, home-based businesses and self-employment are going \n     to become very important.''\n       Belay received $20,000 from Enterprise Development \n     International to launch the program. it also received $20,000 \n     from Agape Christian Church, Church in the City, Jubilee \n     Community Church and Loving Saints Christian Church; and it \n     received $40,000 from a statewide organization called \n     Colorado Capital Initiatives.\n       The $80,000 from the various groups will be used to secure \n     $240,000 worth of loans from Northwest Bank Colorado.\n       The three-year loans carry interest rates of just one point \n     above the prime lending rate.\n       They will help start businesses ranging from painting and \n     carpentry contractors to home-based medical billing and \n     mortgage brokerage services, Bridges said. Loan candidates \n     will be referred by participating churches.\n       Micro-lending programs like Belay's may be the wave of the \n     future for corporate charity.\n       Business people sometimes scoff at the idea of a handout, \n     but they are usually happy to donate money to programs that \n     cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit in beneficiaries, \n     Rosenburgh said.\n       They also offer their time and expertise.\n       ``I want to use business in a way that impacts others,'' \n     said Wil Armstrong, vice president of Cherry Creek Mortgage \n     Co. Inc.\n       Armstrong, who once volunteered at Mother Teresa's home for \n     the destitute in India, is director of Enterprise \n     International. His father, former Colorado Republican Sen. \n     William Armstrong, serves on the group's international \n     advisory board, which is chaired by Jack Kemp.\n       ``Mother Teresa was out to change the world for one person \n     at a time,'' Armstrong said. ``In a lot of ways, that's what \n     I believe Enterprise does. We're backing one little business \n     at a time, trying to make a difference for just one person or \n     one family at a time.''\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. I understand we \nare on the reconciliation bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Time has been running?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time has run?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that the leadership has indicated there \nwill be no votes today, which does not mean there will not be \namendments offered. We hope that we will take a few amendments and \ndebate them and then put them over in some stacked regime for tomorrow.\n  I also understand there are 20 hours of debate equally divided on \nthis bill. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And that there is also an agreement between the leaders \nthat we will use 10 hours of that 20 today before we recess. So I think \nthat sort of sets the stage for those who are interested in attempting \nto modify the bill before us.\n  I have a couple of technical consents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the presence and use of \nsmall electronic computers be permitted on the floor during the debate \nand discussions on this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing staff of the Budget Committee be permitted to remain on the \nSenate floor during consideration of S. 947 and the list be printed in \nthe Record. This list contains both the majority and minority staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n                             Majority Staff\n\n       Victor Block, Scott Burnison, Amy Call, Jim Capretta, Lisa \n     Cieplak, Kay Davies, Kathleen M.

I ask unanimous consent the privilege of the floor \nbe granted to Austin Smythe and Anne Miller during the pendency of S. \n947 on the day of Monday, June 23.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire, am I correct in \nassuming that Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan intend to come to the \nfloor early this afternoon with a modification, an amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have heard that Senator Moynihan will be here, as \nwill, I assume, Senator Roth, at about 1:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That might be the first matter we take up, I \nunderstand, since it is the chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That could be very well the case.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What I would like to do is make a few opening remarks, \nyield to my friend and colleague Senator Lautenberg, and see where it \nturns out.\n  Today the Senate begins consideration of S. 947, the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997. Some people wonder, when we had the debate and told the \nAmerican people that we finally had reached an agreement, 5 years in \nduration, that would get us to a balanced budget, some people wanted us \nto tell them precisely what the agreement contemplated when, as a \nmatter of fact, the agreement covered only a portion of what must be \ndone by Congress. Then, in addition, a budget resolution was taken up \non the Senate floor. During the discussion of that budget resolution, \npeople would ask questions like, ``What changes are there going to be \nin Medicare to make it solvent for the 10 years that are being \npromised?'' They might ask the question, ``What is going to happen to \nMedicaid under this budget proposal and this agreement?''\n  Frankly, for the most part, we told them what we knew and we told \nthem that, in due course, a piece of legislation would be coming \nthrough that would change various laws of the land and would accomplish \nthe goals, the savings required over the first 5 years and estimated \nover 10. And now, today, to put it into perspective and so the process \nis understood better, the committees that were charged under that \nbudget resolution to do things--for the most part to decrease the cost \nof programs within their jurisdiction, within their authority; in a \ncouple of instances they were asked to increase slightly, the \nexpenditures--essentially those committees, eight in number, have done \ntheir work and now what we have is a law, what could be a law, that is \na bill, not a budget resolution.\n  The bill before us is a very special bill. It is called a \nreconciliation bill. That is significant in the U.S. Senate, more \nsignificant than in the House, because in the U.S. Senate this proposed \nbill, this reconciliation bill, is granted some very powerful immunity \nfrom the rules of the Senate. The biggest one is the bill cannot be \nfilibustered. So you see right off, when I asked the question, is it \nnot correct that there are 20 hours of debate on this bill?--and the \nParliamentarian answered yes--that is by law. In other words, we came \nalong and said these bills should not be delayed. They are part of \ngetting you the budget changes you need, and they deserve a privilege \nof being immune from filibusters. So the law set down how much time \nwould be used for debate.\n  In addition, you will hear throughout the next 2 days some \ninteresting verbiage. We will talk about amendments to the bill. Again, \nthis bill is not an ordinary bill. Either by the statute that created \nthe process or by subsequent enactment of the Congress, we have said \nthat it is very difficult to amend this bill. So, essentially almost \nanything you try to do to this bill that changes matters of real \nsubstance that are in it are generally subject to a point of order and \nrequire 60 votes, if the point of order is made on a waiver, to make \nthem germane and thus subject to being added to this bill.\n  In the meantime, since that law, we adopted another rule for \nourselves. The more we did these the more we found that Senators found \nways to get around what was contemplated. So, what we did, with the \ncooperation and assistance of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, we adopted a rule for ourself about this bill \nand we have now named it after the Senator. It is called the Byrd rule. \nEssentially what it says is that matters within this bill or matters \nattempted to be added to this bill that do not substantially decrease \nthe deficit--that is, if you introduce them, for instance, to do away \nwith a commission, but it really isn't there to save money--then the \nParliamentarian will rule that it takes 60 votes to pass them.\n  This is very different from an ordinary bill that comes before this \nbody, which is the most generous parliamentary body in the world in \nterms of permitting Members to make amendments and argue what one might \neven call irrelevant matters to a bill pending. So, as an example, you \ncan have a bill coming through here on education and somebody can get \nup and say, ``I would like to debate the troops in Bosnia.'' They would \nget up and they could introduce a resolution or a statute on that \neducation bill that says we are going to be out of Bosnia in 6 months. \nFrankly, it is debatable for as long as the Senate wants to debate it \nand it cannot be stricken for germaneness or relevance because, under \nthe Jeffersonian rules that we adopted and parliamentary \ninterpretations, we are free to offer nongermane, extraneous amendments \nto the bill.\n\n  In any event, Members now are familiar enough that they do go ask for \nsome assistance before they up and offer an amendment to just change \nthis reconciliation bill and do things their way. On the other hand, \nthey may offer them even if they are not germane and subject to the \nByrd rule, and everybody knows they are apt to be defeated because it \nrequires 60 votes to concur in their adoption.\n  So that is about where we are. Again, getting back to where we are, \nthis legislation is the first reconciliation bill that was instructed \nby that budget resolution that we talked to the American people about, \nin terms of getting to balance. It was about 2 weeks ago we adopted \nthat resolution. It told these eight committees of the U.S. Senate to \ndo some work to change some laws. In a sense, this represents the first \nleg of a three-legged stool that must be constructed to implement the \nbalanced budget, and the bipartisan budget agreement that attended it, \nthat the Speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders of \nthe Senate agreed and concurred on on May 15.\n  I characterize this as the first leg, because that historic \nagreement, to be fully implemented, requires changes both to \nentitlement spending, that is this first reconciliation bill; changes \nto our tax laws, that is the second reconciliation bill; and then, in \ndue course, there will be 13 appropriations bills that are annual \nspending of\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\nmoney that will have to be kept within the limits prescribed in this \nagreement and also will have to provide some priority items that were \nagreed to between the President and Congress for matters that pertain \nto crime, education, and about 13 different items. Some are small, some \nare large. We have to try to put those in their appropriate place in \nthe appropriations bills. So, I characterize this as the first leg \nbecause the historic agreement, to be fully implemented, requires \nchanges in both the entitlement spending and changes to our tax laws \nand, also, limits on the annual appropriations spending account.\n  Obviously, it is complex. I do not know if we could get anywhere near \nwhere we are if we did not have these bills, which are privileged, as I \nindicated, for many of them would go on in debate for 3 or 4 weeks and \nmany of them would be so burdened down with amendments that you would \nnot recognize the bill when you finished. So, we are ready to take the \ncumbersome nature of it all and work as hard as we can so that by \nSeptember 1 we have all three legs completed and perhaps the procedural \nchanges that we must get to enforce it, which will come along here \nshortly, and thus be where we ought to be to reconfirm to the public we \nare on a path to a balanced budget.\n  Last week these committees of the Congress completing this bill, this \nfirst leg, were quietly adopting spending limits established in the \nagreement for the upcoming fiscal year. Later in the debate on this \nreconciliation bill, I will offer an amendment, hopefully with my \nranking member, Senator Lautenberg, to establish appropriation limits \nfor the next 5 years as required by the agreement. I understand Senator \nLautenberg is concerned about one aspect of that. We will try to work \ntogether on that.\n  So, before the week is out, the Senate, in rapid succession, will \nhave built the three legs of the stool necessary to carry out the \nbipartisan agreement which we negotiated over a period, generally now \nunderstood to be as long as 5 months of negotiating. Among those three \nlegs, first the entitlement spending bill is before us today and, I \nrepeat, immediately after it the second leg, the tax reduction bill, \nwill follow, and then in due course the appropriations. When completed \ninto law and signed by the President--and I am hopeful the two \nreconciliation bills will be, and I am hopeful that before September 1 \narrives we will have passed all the appropriations bills, thus enabling \nGovernment to operate for another year--what we will have is we will \nhave set about to balance the Federal budget by 2002.\n  If that works, and I have no reason to believe it will not, it will \nbe the first such accomplishment since 1969. Reducing Federal spending \ncompared to current Federal spending projections, spending will slow by \nnearly $290 billion over the next 5 years. And if the reform policies \nwe adopt this week continue unchanged, we will have reduced Federal \nspending by nearly $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years, counting the \ndebt service that we will not have to make because of reduced \nborrowing. Changing the scope of spending measured by the size of a \ngrowing economy resulting from this balanced budget plan, Federal \nspending will decline from 20.8 percent in 1996 to 18.9 percent in \n2002.\n  Frankly, when I started, in 1974, as a member of the Budget \nCommittee, I really was skeptical as to whether we would ever break \nthis 20 or 21 percent of spending versus the gross domestic product. We \nwill be down to 18.9 when this budget agreement is fully implemented. \nAgain, that will be the lowest level since 1974, and, more important, \n52 percent of the 5-year savings will be derived from reduced \nentitlement growth, particularly through the reforms and changes made \nto Medicare and Medicaid Programs and, in particular, on Medicare, to \navoid the bankruptcy of that program.\n\n  Funding priority programs will achieve balance in 2002, and the \nagreement does assume some directing of our limited Federal resources \nto priority programs, such as children's health, assistance to disabled \ncitizens, education, environment, transportation, crimefighting, and \ninternational affairs.\n  Reducing Federal taxes. When we complete the second reconciliation \nbill, the agreement will have been achieved to reduce taxes on American \nfamilies and businesses to provide incentives, savings and investments \nand to provide relief for families with education expenses.\n  Enforcing the agreement, when we finally complete work this week, \nwill be extended and strengthened because we are going to add to the \nBudget Enforcement Act of 1990 and give the American people \nassurances--as sure as we can--that we will live by these decisions, \nbecause to break any of these caps over the next 5 years will require a \nwaiver of this agreement and will require a supermajority of 60 votes.\n  So, Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, in short, this could \nturn out to be a very busy and, hopefully, a very successful week. It \nwill be a week in which the fiscal policy decisions we make will \nresonate for many years to come. As it relates to the immediate bill \nbefore us, I thank the eight committees, their chairmen and ranking \nmembers, for acting as quickly as they did to report to the Budget \nCommittee their legislative pieces which will carry out the agreement.\n  The legislation before us is, in very large part, consistent with the \nagreement. However, in a few areas, the legislation does not comport \nwith the agreement. An argument can be made that certain provisions are \ninconsistent with the agreement. Obviously, we will work on those over \nthe next 2 days. Under the Budget Act, the Budget Committee could only \nbundle the eight committees and the language given to us for this \nreport, and I quote from the statute, ``without any substantive \nrevision.''\n  It falls to the leadership and us in the full Senate to attempt, \nwhere necessary, and to the extent the rules of the Senate permit, to \nmake changes that might result in it being made more consistent with \nthe agreement and, I also want to mention, to the extent it is not \ntotally inconsistent in some areas. There is one additional opportunity \nto fix it, and that will be when we go to conference with the House. \nThey will be working on their bills simultaneous with this, and they \nwill be off the mark in a few areas. When we go to conference, we will \nattempt to reconcile those differences and make them as consistent with \nthe agreement as possible.\n  I remind all Senators and their staffs, again, that this bill is on a \nspecial fast track, as I have alluded to. It is actually the paramount \nspecial fast-track legislation provided for in the laws and rules of \nthe Senate. So amending can be tricky. I have already indicated that \ngermaneness and not being extraneous are very important, and you can \nviolate those standards only with 60 votes.\n  So over the next 20 hours allowed on this legislation, I anticipate \nwe will have four broad areas of amendments, and not all will be \ngermane and probably many will be extraneous, but nonetheless, we will \nneed to consider, first, as I mentioned earlier, the agreement calls \nfor enforcement under the strict rules of the reconciliation budget \nprocess. Enforcement could not be considered in the committee. Any \nenforcement legislation similar to 1990 and 1993 will need to be \nconsidered on the floor. The joint Budget Committee staffs and the \nadministration officials have been preparing such an amendment, and \nother Senators will probably also offer their amendments to enforce the \nagreement.\n  Second, there will be a group of amendments that may need to be \nconsidered to bring legislative language into compliance. I will work \nwith the leadership and the affected committee chairmen and ranking \nmembers to make sure that these amendments are necessary and consistent \nwith the agreement.\n  Third, the legislation before us falls short of the deficit reduction \ntarget assumed in the agreement. It may be necessary to consider some \namendment that would bring the legislation before us into compliance, \nor modifications to the agreement will have to be considered.\n  Finally, the legislation before us includes provisions on which the \nagreement was silent. Some of these in the Medicare area have been \ncontroversial, such as means testing of the Medicare deductible or \ngradually increasing the age when individuals will be eligible for \nMedicare. I am sure we will have\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nsome hearty discussions about these provisions, and there will, \nobviously, be amendments to them.\n  So now, Mr. President, the Senate business and work lies before us. \nIt is important work for the country's fiscal future. After nearly 2 \nyears of debate with the administration on how to achieve a balanced \nbudget, it is work that, once completed, I think, will become law and \nwill balance the budget. It has been way too long in coming. I look \nforward to closing a chapter in the Senate at the end of this week, \nperhaps as late as Saturday, and immediately upon return from the \nFourth of July recess, to reconcile with the House our differences and \nget this completed as early after the Fourth of July as possible.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senators for listening. I yield \nthe floor at this point.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I want to say, Mr. President, this \nis my first year as ranking member on the Budget Committee to process \nthe budget resolution, and it has been an interesting experience. It is \na fairly complicated process. I had a lot of learning to do. I still \nfeel that I am playing catchup in some areas, but it was largely \nthrough the good work of Senator Domenici that the process moved fairly \nexpeditiously. We work well together. The relationship, on a personal \nbasis, is excellent. We disagreed without being disagreeable, and we \ncompleted this arduous task. It has gone on for several months and I \nthink probably will be a milestone mark in the way a budget is \ndeveloped because of the target that it has, a balanced budget in the \nyear 2002, 5 years hence. There will be enormous change as we go along.\n  Mr. President, I have to point out that this comes at a time when \nthings are pretty good. Since President Clinton has been in office, we \nhave seen dramatic changes in our fiscal condition. For instance, the \nannual deficit came down from $290 billion, in round terms, in 1992, to \nan expected $70 billion level for the year 1997.\n  So we have had dramatic declines in the deficits. Our unemployment is \nat a low point in decades. America is very competitive. We are sending \nout the kind of high-valued products that we like to see being shipped \nto other countries, in terms of international commerce. We have the \nlowest deficit to GDP among all countries of the world, running around \n1.5 percent, the envy of almost every nation on this globe. Our ratio \nof taxes to GDP is the lowest of any nation on the globe. We are \ntalking about large societies, advanced societies.\n  We just saw completion of the gathering of the heads of government in \nDenver, eight countries, including ours, in which I guess America \nboasted a little bit because we have been leading the way. Countries \nthat were so envied for so many years, like Germany and Japan, are \ntrying to figure out how we did it and with a tax base that enables \npeople certainly to succeed, acquire, in some cases, incredible \nfortunes, fortunes far larger than we ever dreamed possible.\n  There used to be a time in America when if someone was a billionaire, \nthat was a stand-out person. It is not all inflation, but today they \nare counting billionaires and multibillionaires. There is success after \nsuccess of people going into the corporate world, from whence I came, \nand work a few years with a company and walk out with $20 million, $50 \nmillion, some people being paid $25 million a year on a regular \nroutine.\n  It is quite incredible and quite different, by the way, than the guy \nwho works hard every day and tries to support his family and thinks \nabout where he is, whether his kids are going to be able to get an \neducation so they can move up the economic ladder. He worries about his \nold age, ``Will my pension be there when I am ready to retire?'' ``Will \nI be able to give a hand to my mother if she falls sick beyond the \ncapacity of the system as it is presently designed to take care of \nher?'' ``Will I be able to continue to live on a little plot of land \nand maintain my home, our home?'' Or, ``Will my wife and I have to work \nshifts so that she can be home when I am not, and vice versa, to take \ncare of our kids?\"\n  That is the picture we see in America today, with all the good \nresults. People at the top are doing very, very well, and people at the \nbottom are doing slightly better but still very worried. The price of a \ncollege education, the opportunity for the kind of jobs that can \nsustain a family--it is quite different in the levels of income.\n  So, Mr. President, when we look at a bill like this which we will be \nconsidering very soon, the tax consequences of our deliberation--and we \nwill be running into some difficult discussions here, because I know a \nlot of my colleagues are worried about tax breaks for those who don't \nneed them and tax opportunities for those who do.\n  Today, we are talking about the first of the two reconciliation \nbills, this one called the spending reconciliation bill. Senator \nDomenici went through some explanatory statements to let people \nunderstand what it is about this arcane system of ours--frankly, it is \na mystery to most and to many even inside this place--about the budget \nresolution, the reconciliation, enforcement, and all of the terminology \nthat becomes routine when you are working with it every day, and \ntalking about germaneness and relevance. Around here, relevance, to \nsteal a phrase, when they talk about beauty in the eyes of the \nbeholder, relevance here is in the eyes of the bellower. That is where \noften debate comes about--relevance. But we have a process by which we \ndetermine whether or not something is relevant. So that will be \nconsidered as we go along.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I want to just say once again that I commend the \nchairman of the Budget Committee for his hard work and cooperative \nattitude over the past many months. We have spent long days in tight \nquarters working on this--by the way, no longer smoke-filled; that's \nout, as we see now with the tobacco legislation in front of us.\n  Senator Domenici is one of the most competent, serious, hard-working \nSenators in this body. I enjoyed, as I said earlier, working with him \nover these past few months. The reconciliation bill before us includes \nprovisions that have been, as the chairman noted, reviewed and \ndeveloped by eight different authorizing committees. Our colleagues on \nthose committees deserve real credit for moving fairly quickly to put \nthese pieces together. I commend them for their hard work.\n  When I look at the final product, there is much in this legislation \nto be pleased with. It makes some improvements in Medicare solvency and \nextending the trust fund. It restores some important benefits to legal \nimmigrants. It includes $3 billion to move people from welfare to work. \nWe want that to happen. And it softens the law that denies food stamps \nto those who try but are unable to find work.\n  Despite these positive elements, Mr. President, I have serious \nconcerns about this legislation in its current form. It is blatantly \ninconsistent in parts with the bipartisan budget agreement. Once again, \nI have to say that we labored long and hard and honestly, I believe, in \ntrying to establish agreements. They did not always go down easy. Some \nof these were bitter pills to swallow. But we inched our way at first \nto get there, and finally it evolved into a consensus that we felt we \ncould live with.\n  The bipartisan budget agreement had some problematic provisions that \nnow we are seeing--frankly, I would have to use the word ``attacked''--\nin some ways. I want to touch on a few examples.\n  First, I think this bill does challenge or violate the provision in \nthe budget agreement that protects senior citizens with modest incomes \nfrom increases in Medicare premiums. The bipartisan negotiators set \naside $1.5 billion specifically for this purpose. But the Finance \nCommittee has refused to allocate this money. Now, this must be fixed. \nI understand they are considering it even as we speak.\n  Second, the bill violates the provision in the budget agreement that \nprotects those who have come into our country legally, paid taxes, \nplayed by the rules, who suffer at a future time from a disability, \naccident, sickness, or otherwise. The budget agreement clearly requires \nthat these innocent\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nvictims be protected. However, the Finance Committee has refused to \ninclude that in their agreement and included only a temporary \nrestoration of benefits. This, too, must be fixed.\n  Third, the bill fails to provide Medicaid coverage for the 30,000 \nchildren who are losing SSI benefits under last year's welfare bill. \nThis runs counter to the goal of ensuring that America's children have \nhealth care coverage. It is another blatant violation of the bipartisan \nbudget agreement.\n  Mr. President, it is up to the congressional leadership, not the \nleadership of the committees, to correct these problems and to bring \nthe reconciliation bill back into compliance with the budget agreement. \nSenators Lott and Daschle have agreed in writing to do this through \nbipartisan leadership amendments. I am confident that this commitment \nis going to be fulfilled. But as I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, I \nam concerned about other provisions as well in this reconciliation bill \nthat go beyond the bipartisan budget agreement. I want to outline some \nof these.\n  First, the bill changes the age for eligibility in Medicare from 65 \nto 67. Mr. President, that may be a worthwhile subject, but not here, \nnot in this bill. There is no legislation to protect the seniors who \nwill be aged 65 and 66 as they wait for eligibility going from one \nplace to another. For many companies, for many situations, the \nretirement period is age 65. It is common. I do not think it is right \nto be in here. The issue was never discussed during the negotiations on \nthe budget agreement. So while there may be an argument for considering \nrelated proposals as part of a broad review of health care and \nentitlements, this is not something that we ought to be doing now on a \nfast-track reconciliation bill. Our senior citizens deserve more than \nthat, or one day to be senior citizens.\n  Nor, Mr. President, should we be considering a fundamental change in \nthe universal nature of the Medicare Program as part of a fast-track \nbill? This legislation would introduce means testing to Medicare. \nAgain, I realize that there are Senators here who support this \nproposal. But the long-term implications for this move are enormous. \nThey deserve much more thorough debate than is possible in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us also includes several other \nprovisions that go beyond the bipartisan budget agreement that are of \nconcern.\n  The bill would increase the financial burdens on some of our most \nvulnerable senior citizens, poor people, people impoverished by \nestablishing a new copayment for home health visits.\n  It would authorize medical savings accounts, a new approach to \nMedicare that could, in my view, harm its long-term viability, harm the \nviability of the whole Medicare Program, because it would give people \nchoices outside the system and perhaps would pull out those who are in \ngood health and leave the rest to those who are not quite up to snuff. \nIt would make excessive burdens for them. It cuts the Medicaid \npayments. The hospitals also would be curtailed, and they serve a \ndisproportionate share of poor and uninsured patients.\n  So, Mr. President, these and other problematic provisions should not \nbe in a reconciliation bill--again, I remind you, fast track; this will \nbe done sometime tomorrow--that is designed to implement a bipartisan \nbudget agreement. I hope that many of these things can be eliminated \nbefore the Senate has to vote on final passage of the legislation.\n  I want, Mr. President, to caution my colleagues that they are to get \nhere with their amendments because the time continues to pass. As \nSenator Domenici has said, at some point the 20 hours that is allocated \nfor the debate will be consumed by just wasting time. If that is the \ncase, those who have amendments that they care about will be here in \nthe final moments of the time that we have allocated to this debate and \nthey will not be able to bring them up. They may be able to introduce \nthem and get a vote on them, but they are not going to be able to \ndiscuss them, they are not going to be able to argue the merits. I \nthink that is something that people ought to pay a lot of attention to \nif they are serious about the amendments that they are proposing.\n  So, I plead with our colleagues, get over here, get your amendments \nin. The fact that there will be no votes today does not have anything \nto do with the time schedule. If these issues are going to be voted \nupon, these amendments, that can be done tomorrow, but the debate will \nhave to be held before we run out of time.\n  So I conclude, Mr. President, by saying this to my friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, that despite the \nvarious controversies that have pitted our two parties against each \nother, we have managed to maintain a spirit of bipartisanship in our \nefforts to balance the budget in the proper way. I believe that we will \nmaintain that cooperative approach. But if we are going to do it, many \nof these problems will have to be addressed before this legislation is \nsent to President Clinton. I look forward to working with Senator \nDomenici and with the leadership on both sides of the aisle to make it \nhappen.\n  Let us get a bill that we can live with, a consensus bill, much in \nthe manner that we shook hands on; maybe with a grimace or two across \nthe table, but we did it. We arrived at a consensus. I need not go to \nsuch elementary teachings to say a consensus really reflects a give-up \nby all parties to a discussion. A consensus is not I win, you lose; it \nis we both win a little and we both lose a little. That is what we did \nto get to where we are. Therefore, I express some disappointment in the \nchanges that have been made in the process of reconciliation and hope \nthat we will be able to change the changes and get on with this \nbipartisan budget agreement that we concluded here on the floor not too \nlong ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to thank Senator Lautenberg for his \nobservations and his comments. Whatever words he had to say about me, I \nappreciate.\n  I say, I have just an evaluation that is mildly different. I think, \nconsidering the great bulk of things the committees had to do--and, you \nknow, we had an agreement for the first time that told them they had to \ndo certain things; before it was a very vague instruction--I think they \ndid fairly well. I mean, I think we can count on the fingers of our \nhands--probably even if we did not have all five fingers, we could even \non less than five--the areas that they did not comply with. I think \nthey are going to work with us to try to get those done.\n  Obviously, there is one that is difficult that has to do with the \nradio and television spectrum. That is a little more difficult. The \nadministration told us we could get a lot of money and, if we did not \ngo that far, it would not last. It turns out it is very hard to do \nthat. But we are working on that, in a bipartisan fashion also.\n  I say to Senator Wellstone, you have been here for a while. Senator \nJudd Gregg has indicated that it was all right with you if he \nproceeded.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  I just want to ask the managers--it is fine with me if Senator Gregg \nproceeds. It is my understanding that Senator Moynihan will be coming \nto the floor seeking a modification.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. He and Senator Roth or somebody.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. When do we expect them to come to the floor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thought it was 1:30 to 2 o'clock. I think we will \nhave some time for statements before that if you want to make a \nstatement before that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to both my colleagues, I potentially am ready to \ndo an amendment or two. But I would rather wait until after some \ndiscussions with other Senators. Also, Senator Moynihan and Senator \nRoth will be here.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Gregg, how much time would you like?\n  Mr. GREGG. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield the Senator 20 minutes.\n  I wonder if you could do me a favor. I am going to sneak out and get \nsomething to eat. Would you manage the floor for about 15 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. First, I rise to congratulate the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from New Jersey, the chairman and ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, for getting us to this point where we are in the \nprocess of voting on and hopefully reaching a conclusion on two very \nimportant reconciliation bills which deal with the critical elements of \nhow we manage entitlement spending and how we manage tax policy here at \nthe Federal level, and which lead, hopefully, to a conclusion that we \ncan say with certainty that the balanced budget agreement which was \nreached has been met and that we will therefore have a balanced budget \nwhich our children can look to as a benefit and which we can look to as \na success.\n  I want to speak specifically about two elements of the reconciliation \nbill which I consider to be important, two different bills, the one \nthat deals with the spending, the entitlement bill, and the one that \ndeals with tax policy, and talk about the Medicare Choice Program, \nreform program, and the pension language within these two bills, \nbecause I think these bills have made giant strides in both these areas \ntoward addressing some fundamental public policy needs.\n  I commend Senator Roth and the Finance Committee for including these \nimportant provisions on both Medicare and on pension reform.\n  Earlier this year I introduced S. 246, the Choice care bill. It was \nessentially similar to legislation that I had introduced in the last \nCongress, which was included in the Balanced Budget Act that year, \nwhich unfortunately was vetoed by the President. The Medicare savings \nachieved in this reconciliation bill represent only a tentative start, \nhowever, toward placing the Medicare system on a path toward long-term \nsolvency. But they are an important start. There are still trillions of \ndollars of unfunded Medicare liability awaiting us, and this \nlegislation does not address it all, but it does get us off on the \nright foot.\n\n  I am pleased we have taken this opportunity to enact some of the \nstructural reforms that are key to real substantive Medicare reform and \nthe stabilization of the Medicare trust funds. In my Choice care bill \nand in the provisions contained in this legislation, seniors will be \nable to choose from a large variety of health care purchasing options. \nThey can remain in their traditional Medicare plan, they could instead \nbuy an HMO, or they could buy from a competing medical plan provided \nthat it meets the benefit standards of the present Medicare system. So \nseniors will have a wide variety of new and exciting choices.\n  When we offer seniors this great array of choices, we benefit not \nonly the seniors but the system as a whole by bringing it into the \nmarketplace. Traditional Medicare must then effectively compete for the \nright for seniors' health care spending in the marketplace and the \npeople in the marketplace who are willing to give other options to \nseniors. Suppose, for example, there are plans that can deliver \nservices more effectively and more efficiently than Medicare in a \nparticular region of this Nation. If they can do that, then they can \noffer a more substantial package of benefits for the same costs, and, \ntherefore, seniors will have an incentive to buy from these plans.\n  Take, for example, if a plan was able to offer the seniors not only \nthe basic Medicare benefit but also maybe an eyeglass benefit or a \nprescription drug benefit. That option is now going to be available to \nthe seniors. This benefits the health of the system because, at the \nsame time, this legislation gains control over the rate of growth of \nthe per capita spending in the Medicare Program. So whenever seniors \nmove into these plans that can offer them a better benefits package, \nthe entire system will save money because the Medicare system will be \nspending less money per capita on these seniors than it would under the \ntraditional Medicare system.\n  If they are getting a stronger package, you might say, how can that \nbe? It is called the marketplace, it is called capitalism, it is called \nwhat is happening in the private sector today, in the health care \nsystem generally. But, unfortunately, it is not helping Medicare, which \nwas designed for a 1960's health care delivery system, which simply is \nnot operable in the 1990's or as we go into the year 2000.\n  This legislation begins to flatten the wide disparity in \nreimbursement levels that exist between geographic regions in this \ncountry by gradually blending over time local and national \nreimbursement rates. If we do this, then we make spending patterns in \nMedicare more fair and reward those regions of the country that have \nalready done well in holding down costs. The disparity between regions \nis really excessive. For example, in some parts of this country, like \nNew Hampshire and Oregon, and I suspect in Wyoming, where the Presiding \nOfficer is from, the costs of Medicare benefits are significantly lower \nthan in areas like Staten Island. In fact, it is lower by almost $500 a \nmonth.\n  It is imperative we include such reform as a component of the \nMedicare Choice Program because only by doing so can we be sure that \nseniors in low-cost areas will ultimately have access to a wide array \nof benefit packages. As long as reimbursement rates in some parts of \nthe country are unfairly low, it will be difficult to entice plans into \nthose regions to compete for seniors' dollars even though the health \ncare benefits in those areas today are being maintained at a high \nlevel.\n  I believe we should have increased the incentives available to \nseniors to become cost conscious by offering them opportunities to save \nmoney in the manner in which they buy Medicare. That is the incentive \nthat truly moves shoppers, and I believe that Medicare Choice would be \na greatly strengthened reform if we had included a cash-rebate \nincentive. Under my original bill, S. 246, every time a senior bought \nfrom a less expensive plan, even though the benefit package in that \nplan had to meet the same benefit package or exceed the benefit package \nof the present Medicare system, if the plan costs less because of \ncompetition and efficiencies within that plan, then 75 percent of the \nsavings would have gone to the individual, and the remaining 25 percent \nwould have been deposited in the trust fund. Thus, the trust fund would \nnever lose money due to such rebates.\n  On the contrary, the trust fund would receive money every time a \nsenior sees this incentive to make a cost-conscious decision. \nUnfortunately, this language was left out of this bill, and, in fact, \nthere is some language in this bill which undermines the ability to \ncreate incentives in the Medicare system under the Medicare Choice \nplan. I expect I will be offering an amendment to correct this, an \namendment to strike that section which limits the ability to offer \nincentives, because lacking that important incentive we cannot, in my \nopinion, create the huge marketplace forces which we need in order to \nsignificantly control the costs of health care and to create \nmarketplace forces within the health care systems.\n  Even considering that, this package still offers the incentive to \nseniors that where their plan can be more efficient, they will be \noffered an enhanced package of benefits. That is a significant \nincentive. While perhaps not as powerful a purchasing incentive as an \nactual cash rebate, for example, it is my hope that the prospect of \nstrengthened benefits will prove a powerful enticement that allows \nseniors to move more comfortably into buying Medicare Choice plans.\n  I am reminded of the old saying that you begin a trip, a long \njourney, with one small step. Well, this package that has been brought \nforth by the Finance Committee is a series of small steps. It has \ngotten us well into the journey. It has not gotten us to the end, but \nit has gotten us down the road by giving seniors more choices and more \nopportunities in the way they purchase their health care.\n  At the same time that the Finance Committee has made significant \nstrides in the area of Medicare by making Choice care available to them \nin the Choice care plan which I introduced, it is also contained in the \ntax resolution which will be coming forward later in the week, a \nsignificant incentive to increase retirement savings. I congratulate, \nagain, and thank Senator Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nfor including so many of the ideas and initiatives which\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nI was able to participate in pulling together as chairman of the \nRetirement Task Force. I also want to particularly thank Senator Bob \nGraham and other members of the bipartisan working group for their \naggressiveness in promoting pension reform which will promote savings.\n  Some months ago, I was asked by Majority Leader Trent Lott to chair \nthe Republican task force on retirement security, and in that capacity \nI worked with Senator Roth and the rest of the task force to develop a \npackage of proposals introduced a week ago as Senate bill S. 883.\n  I will not use this time here to describe again the dire \ncircumstances of this Nation with respect to retirement savings. When \nwe introduced S. 883, we detailed the vast gap between our Nation's \nretirement income and the inadequate amount of funding we are currently \nputting aside to meet those retirement needs. Approximately $7 trillion \nof unfunded liability sits in our different retirement accounts. I am \nvery pleased to note that no fewer than 13 of the provisions, 13 of the \nprovisions of S. 883 have been included in some form in this budget \nreconciliation package. While many of them are small or technical \ncorrections without significant revenue impacts, enacting these reforms \nwill do much to improve the prospects for expanding pension coverage \nand retirement savings.\n  Because time is limited, let me list only a few of the reforms that \nhave come to be included in this package which I think are positive for \nencouraging people to save for their retirement.\n  This budget reconciliation package includes the first title of the \nWISE bill, S. 260. This part of the WISE bill--the WISE bill being a \nbill directed at giving more equity to women in the area of being able \nto save for their retirement--strengthens the homemaker IRA. I, \npersonally, have placed a higher priority on this provision than on any \nother of our task force savings initiatives, so I am particularly \npleased to see it was included. This provision received the active \nsupport of a bipartisan group of Senators, including, most notably, \nSenator Carol Moseley-Braun from the other side of the aisle.\n  This provision, Mr. President, will sever the link between the \nhomemaker's ability to make a fully tax deductible contribution to IRA \nand allow her to make that contribution whether or not her husband or \nher spouse who is in the workplace has a pension plan. This is an \nimportant provision not only because it will stimulate additional \nsavings but because it will enable homemakers, especially women, to \ngenerate additional savings in their own name. It is about time we do \nthat. I especially want to congratulate, of course, Senator Roth, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, who has been a tireless advocate for \nthis idea.\n  This reconciliation bill also will gradually raise the income limits \non the tax deductible contributions to IRA's. Our Republican task force \nendorsed the Roth-Breaux legislation that would have completely phased \nout the income limits so that every American will be eligible to fully \ndeduct their IRA contributions. I believe that Finance Committee \nChairman Roth exerted every effort to achieve as much as he could in \nthis area, and I am pleased he included at least a version of the \nlanguage from the task force bill, gradually phasing up the income \nlimits, doubling them by the year 2004. This will do a tremendous \namount to spur savings in our marketplace and as people head toward \nretirement.\n  This budget reconciliation package also includes the backloaded IRA, \nan important new option in retirement savings in which the \ncontributions are not tax deductible and the tax advantages come up \nupon withdrawal. This expands the capacity of individuals to take \nadvantage of retirement incentives in a way that works best for them. \nIt also limits the revenue loss in the short term from IRA expansion, \nbecause the contributions today will be taxed when they are made. I \nknow many individuals will wish to use this alternative backloaded-IRA \nstructure, and thus this will be an important incentive for additional \nlong-term savings.\n\n  Mr. President, one thing we must do as a nation is simply make it \neasier and more convenient for people to save. The fact is that if we \ndo not do this, we as a nation are going to face bankruptcy as a result \nof the costs of our pension systems as the postwar baby-boom generation \nfully retires in the year 2010 and beyond. One reason why the thrift \nsavings plan worked so well for Federal employees is that it has the \nfeature of automatic deduction from one's payroll, automatic \ninvestment, automatic savings. I am pleased that the Finance Committee \nhas also included the provision to allow for automatic payroll \ndeductions into IRA accounts. This will also stimulate additional \nretirement savings simply by making IRA investment easier.\n  I am also pleased this reconciliation package recognizes we must \ncontinue to do more to stimulate retirement savings not only through \nindividual savings but also through employer-provided pensions. I have \nlong been troubled by the limitations that have been placed on employer \nfunding of future pension liabilities. Employers must fund these \nliabilities sooner or later, and it is good policy to put more of the \nfunding upfront to allow that funding to be invested and to use the \ncompounding interest to increase the investment and to assure an \nadequate amount of funds when people retire.\n  The reconciliation package picks up most of the provisions authored \nby the task force to raise the limits on full funding by 5 percent \nevery 2 years. I believe that our Nation's workers will be more secure \nby their pension benefits being funded more fully. This is a critical \npoint because so many of our pension benefits are underfunded. The \ncapacity of the employer to be able to fully fund the pension benefits \nat an earlier time in the cycle is critical to assure people will have \na pension when they retire.\n  Some of the technical changes made by this bill are very significant. \nThis reconciliation bill would exempt State and local government plans \nfrom the cumbersome nondiscrimination rules. This was a prime example \nof how many of our pension laws and regulations have been unduly \ncomplicated. Nondiscrimination rules were not created to apply to \nGovernment plans, where it is difficult to find exactly who the \nemployer is and thus to compare employer and employee benefits. This \ntype of commonsense change will make it easier for States and local \ngovernments to plan for functions around the country.\n  Another task force-endorsed reform picked up by the reconciliation \nbill will do much to help small business. Until now, the matching \ncontributions made by the self-employed were treated differently under \ntax law than the matching contributions made by employers. By \nstraightening out the discrepancy, we will remove another obstacle from \namong the many that deter small business owners from providing pension \ncoverage. As we all know, small business is where we most need to \nincrease participation in pension plans.\n  There is not time, Mr. President, to discuss every reform that was \ninserted into this reconciliation bill in the pension area. But I am \npleased that this bill draws from reform initiatives in a variety of \nareas. In the area of portability--I am talking now about the tax bill \ncoming to us after we complete the bill on spending--this bill will add \nextra protection to defined benefit plans that accept rollovers, \nprotecting them from disqualification if they do facilitate that kind \nof portability. Moreover, the bill includes a few provisions that will \nstreamline the paperwork process. The bill will facilitate the use of \nnew technologies to replace old paperwork filing, and also eliminate \nsome paperwork requirements that should no longer be required. Finally, \nvarious technical inconsistencies within the law will be eliminated if \nwe retain those provisions in conference.\n  Let me close by thanking Chairman Roth for his extraordinary effort \nand for his willingness to include so many provisions to promote \npension reform and Medicare Choice in both reconciliation bills, as \nwell as several other Finance Committee Senators, including Senators \nBob Graham, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Jim Jeffords, and others. \nAlthough I am not on the Finance Committee, I was certainly pleased to \nbe able to work with this group to advance efforts to increase \nretirement savings. Savings incentives are an effective and important \nuse of tax relief--one of the very best things that we can do with our \nopportunity\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nthis year to relieve the tax burden on American taxpayers. I do hope \nand expect that we can retain these critical provisions in these two \nbills.\n  Now let me express one area that I have concern about, and that is \nthe area of how we handle the Medicaid expansion, or the new program \nfor the purposes of assisting child health. I have read the bill. I \nunderstand that States have the right to choose between a capped grants \nprogram and the expansion of the Medicaid Program. It is not, however, \nclear to me what the requirements are relative to coverage, and how \ndemanding the Federal Government is going to be on each State as to how \nand what must be covered on each child. I would have serious \nreservations if we have created a new entitlement program. This would \nbe a mistake, at a time when we are trying to control the rate of \ngrowth of the Federal Government and growth of the most explosive side \nof the Federal Government, the entitlement accounts of this Government; \nit would be a serious error for us to embark on a new entitlement \nprogram.\n  It is not clear to me, after having read this, whether or not we have \ndone that. It is clear to me that there was an intention not to do \nthat. At least, in the language of the bill, and in the explanation of \nthe bill, statements were made that it was not the intention of the \ncommittee to move down the road of a new entitlement program. Whether \nor not the operable language in fact creates such an event, demanding \nthat certain action be taken, that certain expenditures be made and not \nfunding those, or creating a situation where people can come in and \ndemand those expenditures in a way that creates an entitlement or a \nmandatory program is not absolutely clear. As we go forward with this \ndebate, I hope we will get clarification on this point. Should it turn \nout that this is a new entitlement program, I hope we will change that, \neither here on the floor or in conference, so that the intent of the \nlanguage is clear, which is to create a grant program to benefit \nchildren and their health needs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the time being controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator would need time yielded to \nhim to speak, but could offer an amendment that would then be debated \nfor 2 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator need?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would need about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator be agreeable at a later date, in the \nstacking process, to rearrange the order of his amendment if the \nCommittee on Finance wants to have an amendment before it?\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely. I would agree to a unanimous consent to place \nmy amendment behind whatever amendments are offered by the chairman and \nranking members of the committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator also agree that it can be sequenced \nin a manner that helps the manager work this bill through? It won't \ntake a long time. But it may be second or third.\n  Mr. GREGG. As long as it is not eliminated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my intention to shortly offer an \namendment which is technical in nature but goes to one of the \nphilosophies of the Choice care issue. The Choice care, as presented in \nthis bill which is an excellent step forward in trying to make the \nMedicare system more viable, efficient, and most importantly more \neffective for our senior citizens, is a concept where seniors are going \nto be given an opportunity to go out in the marketplace and choose \nbetween the variety of different care providers.\n  Today under the Medicare system, basically seniors are limited to the \ntraditional Medicare and to a very limited HMO option. The traditional \nMedicare, of course, is a 1960's program designed to meet a 1950's \nmedical system structure. It is not current or effective for today. It \nis a cost-plus system, for all intents and purposes. It is \nextraordinarily inefficient, and it does not allow very much \nflexibility in the marketplace.\n  The pre-Medicare system, as is structured today for the delivery of \nits different options to seniors, is like driving a 1961 Chevrolet down \na highway in 1997 with the understanding that you are going to have to \ngo into the year 2000 still driving a 1961 car. Everything on the car \nhas been replaced. Very little of it works. It is blowing out a lot of \nsmoke. It is chugging along at 45 miles an hour top speed. It simply \nisn't working correctly.\n  So, in order to try to redress that, the committee has put in place a \nvery creative initiative in the area of Choice care, which essentially \nsays that seniors are now going to have the ability to go out in the \nmarketplace and choose between a variety of different health care \nproviders. That variety of health care providers could involve an HMO. \nIt could involve a PPO where a group of physicians get together. It can \nbe called a PSO, again, a group of physicians getting together. Or it \ncould involve some new way, I suspect, where hospital and doctors and \nsomebody else designs a new way of delivering services. But the \nservices they deliver must equal the benefits package which is \npresently under the Medicare system.\n  So seniors lose nothing in the definition of the size or nature of \ntheir benefits package. And it must equal the benefits package in the \narea of quality so that seniors lose nothing in the area of quality of \ntheir health care.\n  What they get is a marketplace which will come forward and compete \nfor the seniors' health care. What does that do? Well, as we have seen \nin the private sector, that will give the seniors a whole new variety \nof choices, a whole new panoply of choices, from which to choose the \nhealth care provider group that they want to give them Medicare.\n  They may get options coming at them which say, ``Here, we are going \nto give you the basic Medicare package, but we are going to also throw \nin eyeglass care. We are also going to throw in pharmaceutical care. It \nis not going to cost you any more, but we will put that in to try to \nattract you to our supplier of health care, to our HMO, to our PPO.''\n  So seniors are going to get more choices. Under this benefits \nstructure, as put forward in the reconciliation bill, new benefits can \nbe added on top of the benefits that are supplied by the basic Medicare \nplan. That is a given. That is an incentive that can be put in. But \nwhat is not allowed under this package, or what is specifically \ndisallowed, is the concept that a senior could pay less for the same \nbenefit package.\n  You have to remember here that what you are dealing with is the \nmarket system. So it is more than likely--in fact, it is expected--that \na variety of health care providers, as a result of being efficient, as \na result of cost-saving structures which they put in place, are going \nto be able to supply the health care basic benefits structure of the \nMedicare system to a senior citizen for less than what it costs today.\n  For example, we pay out $4,800 a year for health care benefit. \nInsurance pays about $4,800 a year for insurance for seniors. That is a \nvery high price, by the way. It is very likely that you are going to \nsee provider groups come forward at $4,300 a year. There is going to be \na $500 saving in that provider group.\n  Under this bill, the way the provider group adjusts for that is they \nmust put more benefits into the package. That is the only option they \nhave. They have to put in eyeglasses. They have to put in drug \nbenefits. That is a reasonable approach. Yes; to give the senior more \noptions at the same price for more health care types of health care. \nBut another option, of course, would be let's sell it to the senior for \nless. That is probably going to happen, too. You are going to probably \nsee some health care providers give the same package of options but be \nable to give it at less than $4,800. Under this bill as it is presently \nstructured, if that were to occur, the health care provider would get \nall the savings. There would not be any incentive for the health care \nprovider to turn some of that savings back to the\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\nGovernment or back to the senior citizen.\n  In the original Choice care plan that I drafted--I do not say this to \ntry to be too expansive about my own efforts--I believe was essentially \none of the cores from which this plan was put together, which is in the \nreconciliation bill. In my original health care plan, I had language \nwhich said, if a senior is able to purchase their health care--the same \npackage, the same benefit structure--from a health care provider, that \nhealth care provider cannot use that for selection. They cannot try to \npick and choose seniors. It must take all comers. If a senior is able \nto find a health care provider who is willing to charge less--and the \nquality must be maintained under the standards we have here--then the \nsenior, rather than having only the option of getting more benefits, \nwould also have the option of getting a return on the lower cost \npremium.\n  So, if you paid $4,800 for seniors' health care but you could \npurchase health care at say $4,300, there would be a $500 savings \nannually. We would take that $500 savings. And the health care provider \ncould as an option, rather than buying eyeglass care for the senior or \nbuying health prescription drugs for a senior, could say to the senior, \n``We are going to turn that $500 back to you.'' If the health care \nprovider decided to do that, then the senior, under my original bill, \nwould get to keep 75 percent of that and 25 percent goes back to the \nFederal Treasury.\n  That was the plan of the original bill.\n  This language of this bill says a Medicare Choice organization is not \nauthorized to provide cash or other monetary repayments as an \ninducement for enrollment. That makes it impossible for an incentive \nsystem to be put in place. Markets work on incentives, not only benefit \nincentives but money incentives.\n  Thus, I believe that subject to the limitations of what HCFA will put \non the provider, subject to the limitations that it has to be a quality \nsystem, subject to the limitations that it has to be a system which \nmeets a health care insurance plan that meets the basic Medicare \nrequirements of what must be covered, subject to the fact there cannot \nbe adverse selection, there is no disincentive, no downside to creating \na marketplace in force beyond added benefits of added cash, of the \npotential of refunding cash.\n  So, basically, I think this language is counterproductive to the \nbasic goal of Choice care, which is to create market forces not only on \nbehalf of the provider groups but within the senior community to go out \nand be cost-conscious purchasers. The whole idea of Choice care is to \ngive seniors more options to choose from and create a more efficient \nmarketplace, which will in turn create a lower cost of health care for \nthe basic benefits package of Medicare, or at least slow the rate of \ngrowth of the cost of that health care package.\n  That is the whole concept of Choice care. But if you take out of \nChoice care any financial incentive to save, if you say to seniors: \nYour only incentive to purchase another plan may be additional \nbenefits, which they may not need, then you have reduced dramatically \nthe marketplace forces. If you take out of the system any incentive for \nthe provider group to rebate those savings, then you have created an \natmosphere where provider groups may generate savings, but they will \nkeep them themselves. In that way, I think you skew the marketplace \nbecause in an open market when somebody is able to sell a product for \nless, they pass the benefit of that lower cost on to the consumer, and \nthat is what we are trying to do in the language of the original bill--\npass the benefit of the lower cost of health care on to the consumer.\n  So in order to address that, without putting in place the incentive \nsystem that I design in my bill--we are not suggesting that that \nincentive system should go in as I designed it. We are just suggesting \nthere should be the opportunity for HCFA and for the regulatory \nagencies to be able to look at incentive systems and not be barred from \nlooking at incentive systems, cash incentive systems, monetary \nincentive systems. In order to allow that to occur, we need to remove \nthis language. In order to make this Choice care more effective, a \npotentially more dynamic force to create more of a marketplace event \nwhere seniors are actually out there thinking, hey, I intend to look \naround and see how much I can buy insurance for, and one of the reasons \nI am looking around is while I might get better benefits, the second \nreason I am looking around is I may get it at less cost--in order to \ncreate that type of market dynamic, which is absolutely critical if you \nare going to have Choice care work effectively, you cannot have \nlanguage which says under no circumstances, even if HCFA were to find \nthat it would work, can you in any way create an incentive system that \ninvolves monetary consideration.\n  So this language, I believe, is counterproductive to the basic goal \nof Choice care. I think it should be noted as an aside here also that \nthe concept of Choice care is to make seniors more cost-conscious \npurchasers, but in doing that you have to remember that, yes, those \nseniors who are on the system today probably are not going to change. \nThey probably are not going to change their health care system. They \nhave been there. They have been in the system. They came out of the \n1950's and 1960's when they had a sole care provider. They are used to \nless health care. That is the way they are brought up, most of the \nseniors on the system today. So we are not really targeting the Choice \ncare concept at that group. What we are targeting the Choice care \nconcept at is the next generation of seniors coming into the system, \nthat generation which has already been through the health care \nexplosion of the late 1980's and early 1990's. A variety of health care \nproviders were made available to them, where HMO's became commonplace \nin the private sector and in the marketplace. These folks are going to \nbe familiar with the concept of a PPO, PSO, or HMO as a provider group, \nso they are going to be comfortable with going out and shopping around.\n  If we create a disincentive for them to do that by saying, well, if \nyou shop around, you do not get any of the benefits of shopping around \nother than some higher benefit package which you may not want to begin \nwith, then we will be undermining a culture which already exists. We \nwill be saying to people who are coming out of the private sector, \nhaving been used to shopping around--maybe they were in a cafeteria \nprogram where they actually got a refund of some of the costs of the \nlower cost health insurance since they purchased it. We are going to be \nsaying to those people, when you get into the public system, it is \nbasically a cost-plus system and you are not going to be able to get \nany of benefits of the thoughtful purchase of lower priced health care \nin relationship to your needs or in relationship to a one-size-fits-all \npackage.\n  So I do believe that to leave this language in not only undermines \none of the options that might make Choice care much more effective, but \nit undermines the natural, inherent attitude that is going to be coming \nwith this new generation of people who receive funds from Choice care, \nwho participate in Medicare, and who have been brought up in a \nmarketplace where Choice care is the typical type of health care \napproach.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 426\n\n  So, in light of that explanation, Mr. President, which I know the \nPresiding Officer was closely following, which I very much appreciate, \nI would send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 426.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 213 strike all of (d) and insert the following:\n       ``(d) Terms and Conditions of Imposing Premiums.--Each \n     Medicare Choice organization shall permit the payment of net \n     monthly premiums on a monthly basis and may terminate \n     election of individuals for a Medicare Choice plan for \n     failure to make premium payments only in accordance with \n     section 1851(g)(3)(B)(i).''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second \ndegree amendments be in order relative to the amendment which I just \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased by the work and cooperation \nthat was exhibited last week in the Senate Finance Committee. It was an \nencouraging display of bipartisanship--both sides of the aisle working \ntogether to craft a proposal that meets the guidelines of the budget \nagreement and achieves needed reforms in spending programs while \nprotecting America's vulnerable.\n  Out of this tremendous effort that went into the Finance Committee \nmarkup of the budget came two distinct themes that we would do well to \nkeep in mind as we take this issue up to the floor. First, that the \ntime has come, as President Clinton expressed in an earlier State of \nthe Union Address, to end big Government as we know it. This is no \nlonger an objective held by one side of the aisle over the other. It is \na necessity.\n  We are blessed with the greatest Nation on Earth. We have the most \nproductive citizens, the finest resources and materials, and we have \nthe ingenuity and spirit of enterprise. We realize, however, that our \nresources are finite and Government's role is limited. Yet, we are \nwilling, on both sides of the aisle, to make certain that Government \nefficiently and effectively provides for those with whom Government has \na contractual or moral obligation to provide. Medicare is contractual. \nMedicaid, when it serves the most vulnerable, particularly America's \nchildren, is moral. And these feelings are shared mutually by \nRepublicans on the committee as well as Democrats. This became \nobviously clear last week.\n  Second, we demonstrated the power of bipartisanship. I can safely say \nthat no one, but no one, on the Finance Committee got everything he or \nshe wanted. No one was completely satisfied with everything, as it is a \ncompromise between differing political philosophies and between deeply \nheld views. So while what we have passed and addressed on the floor \ntoday is not the budget package that any of us would have drafted, it \nrepresents a major step forward, a step forward that, through balancing \nthe budget, can help assure continued growth, jobs and opportunity.\n  As we worked on the committee to report out this budget, I was led by \ntwo primary goals. First, to implement the budget agreement in such a \nmanner that we not only balance the budget but that we do so in a \nmanner that preserves and strengthens the programs impacted. As I said \nduring the committee markup, ``It is not enough to reduce the cost of \nsuch critical programs as Medicare and Medicaid, but it must be done in \na way that provides better service to beneficiaries of these \nprograms.''\n  My second objective was to implement the budget agreement in a manner \nthat assured bipartisan support for the program. I believe we have \naccomplished both of these. What we offer today is a workable balance, \na critical balance that protects our most vulnerable populations while \naddressing necessary reforms in important entitlement programs.\n  Let me give some specifics. The largest program we concerned \nourselves with was, of course, Medicare. Much has been written and said \nabout the future of this program and the need to strengthen it for the \nlong term. We did this. We took a critical first step towards \naddressing the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program while at the \nsame time making certain that the program meets the needs and \nexpectations of its current beneficiaries. The changes we made in \nMedicare actually allow us to expand Medicare coverage for certain \nimportant preventive services including mammography, colorectal \nscreening, bone mass measurement and diabetes self-management. We are \nable to offer this expanded coverage and protect and preserve Medicare \nby incorporating choice and competition into the current program, and \nby slowing Medicare's rate of spending growth. Our measures will save \nMedicare from bankruptcy for another 10 years, while still increasing \nMedicare spending per beneficiary from $5,450 this year to $6,950 in \nthe year 2002.\n\n  In expanding choice in the Medicare Program, we have used the highly \nsuccessful Federal Employees Health Benefit Program as a model. Under \nour new Medicare Choice Program, seniors will have the opportunity to \nchoose from a variety of private health plan options and select the \nhealth care plan that best suits their needs and preferences. These \nchoices will include the whole range of health plan options available \nto the under-65 population--fee-for-service, varieties of managed care, \nand medical savings accounts. Through these options, seniors will be \nable to obtain important benefits, like prescription drugs, that are \nnot covered by traditional Medicare.\n  It is clear to see how these commonsense and, again, I want to say, \nthese bipartisan solutions will preserve and strengthen the program. We \nwere not content to stop there. The Finance Committee proposal calls \nfor a National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. This \nwill be a 15-member commission, established for 1 year, charged with \nmaking recommendations to Congress on actions necessary to ensure the \nlong-term fiscal health of the Medicare Program, something of great \nconcern to the ranking member, Pat Moynihan, and myself.\n  The Finance Committee report also creates a demonstration project \nwithin the Medicare Program for medical savings accounts. This \ndemonstration project will allow up to 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries \nto opt into an MSA program, a program that will allow them to choose a \nhigh-deductible Medicare Choice plan.\n  These changes to Medicare will result in a net savings of $115 \nbillion, savings\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nthat will not only help us meet the budget compromise but savings and \nreforms that will preserve the Medicare Program while ensuring that it \ncontinues to serve those who depend on it now. Again, these important \nreforms were made possible only through sincere bipartisan efforts, and \nit is my hope that such bipartisanship will continue as we address \nthese reforms on the floor.\n  Such bipartisanship also marks our treatment of Medicaid. Working \ntogether, we passed reforms that will control the growth of the \nprogram, resulting in a net savings of over $13 billion. For more than \na decade, there has been a constant tug of war between the Federal \nGovernment and the States over Medicaid, as each side has asserted its \nwill over the other. From the mid-1980's through the early 1990's, the \nFederal Government imposed mandates on the States and, in turn, the \nStates shifted costs to the Federal Government. The result was \ndevastating to all of our budgets as Medicaid routinely grew at a \ndouble-digit pace, reaching as high as a 29-percent increase in 1992. \nThis Finance Committee proposal signals an important change in the \nprogram.\n  Having said this, let me be clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. Under \nthis proposal, Medicaid spending will continue to grow. The Federal \ncommitment to Medicaid will grow from $99 billion in fiscal year 1997 \nto $140 billion in 2002. The President originally proposed $22 billion \nin savings in the Medicaid Program. We achieved approximately $14 \nbillion in savings.\n  The first part of our Medicaid reform is to give the Governors the \ntools they need to control this program. This will be able to move more \nindividuals into managed care without waiting years for waivers from \nthe Federal Government. They will be able to contract with selected \nproviders for service. The States will be able to ask families to take \nsome responsibility for the decisions they make when seeking health \ncare services.\n  In short, our plan gives the States many of the same tools that the \nprivate sector has in stretching health care dollars. The fact is, \nhealth care as a whole has changed, and the Medicaid Program needs to \ncatch up. Our proposal gives the States the tools necessary to act as \nmany large employers do, to get the greatest value for Medicaid \ndollars. So we are taking the important next step to move both the \nStates and the Federal Government out of the waiver process.\n  But we also want to ensure that as the old program requirements are \nreplaced, quality is still assured. As I have said, in addressing the \nMedicaid Program, we also provided many of the reforms requested by the \nbipartisan National Governors' Association. These include repealing the \nBoren amendment provision. The history of the Boren amendment is a \nclassic example of unintended consequences as it has been used to \nincrease the costs of the program, rather than control costs.\n  The Governors and the administration agree on the repeal of this \nprovision. It will take the providers and the States out of the Federal \ncourts and put them back at the contract negotiating table.\n  As we repeal the Boren amendment, we must be very careful that we do \nnot simply create a new round of lawsuits over what Congress means in \nterms of Medicaid payments to facilities.\n  Another major provision of our plan to control the growth of Medicaid \nis the reduction in spending on the Disproportionate Share Hospital \nProgram. This DSH Program provides funding for indigent individuals who \nare not enrolled in Medicaid. Under current law, DSH spending is \nprojected to increase from $10.3 billion in fiscal year 1998, to $13.6 \nbillion in 2002. In 1990, Federal and State DSH spending combined \ntotaled less than $1 billion, and in 1995, Federal and State DSH \npayments totaled nearly $19 billion.\n  Without reform, Federal DSH payments alone will total nearly $60 \nbillion over the next 5 years, and we need to exert some discipline in \nthis program.\n  This bill reforms the DSH Program through a combination of controls.\n  First, a State which spends less than 3 percent of its Medicaid \nProgram on DSH will be frozen at its 1995 level. For these States, \nthere will be no reduction, but also no growth.\n  Second, beginning in 1999, high-DSH States and low-DSH States will be \nreduced from their 1995 actual spending levels. A high-DSH State or a \nState that spends more than 12 percent of its Medicaid dollars on \nindigent hospital costs will be reduced from its 1995 spending levels \nfor inpatient hospitals only. It will not be allowed to count spending \non institutes for mental diseases. These high-DSH States will be \nreduced from 1995 spending by 14 percent in 1999 and by 20 percent in \nthe years thereafter.\n  Low-DSH States are those that spend less than 12 percent, but more \nthan 3 percent of the Medicaid dollars will be reduced from their 1995 \nspending by 2 percent in 1999. In the year 2000, they will be reduced 5 \npercent from the 1995 level. In 2001, the reduction will be 10 percent, \nand in 2002, it will be 15 percent.\n  As I mentioned, our proposal places restrictions on the States' \nability to fund their State mental health facilities with Federal \nfunds. Over the past few years, the States have shifted the cost of \nthese facilities to the Federal Government. As you check with your \nState, many will find huge increases in Federal costs associated with \nthese facilities. It is time to close this loophole.\n  Let me say that the President proposed $22 billion in savings from \nthe Medicaid Program. Two-thirds of these savings were to be realized \nout of the DSH Program and one-third from per capita caps. The savings \ntarget has been reduced, but the potential reforms for achieving these \nsavings are also limited.\n  I believe there is general agreement that through the DSH Program, \nthe use of DSH payments had been expanded well beyond the original \nintent. The DSH formula has been developed with consultation and in \nbipartisan cooperation. The formula has been carefully designed, based \non past problems in this program and with input from Members.\n  Concerning the steps which we take in this package to address \nchildren's health, let me begin by saying that we all share the same \ngoal of increasing access to health care for as many children as we \ncan. And it is clear that Members on both sides of the aisle are \ncommitted to finding an answer to the problem of uninsured children in \nthis country.\n  Of the 71 million children in the United States, more than 86 percent \nare covered by some type of health insurance; two-thirds are covered by \ninsurance through the private sector; 23 percent of all children in the \nUnited States under age 18 are covered by Medicaid, and another 3 \npercent are covered by other public insurance programs.\n  Of the 9.8 million children who are not insured, 2.9 million children \nlive in families with incomes above 200 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. Half of these children live in families with incomes of about \n300 percent of the Federal poverty level. Mr. President, 300 percent of \nthe poverty level is over $48,000 for a family of four. This tells us \nthat insurance coverage is more than an issue of family income. It is, \nin fact, a complex issue which does not yield easy to Washington-knows-\nbest solutions.\n\n  The proposal we offer today provides the States with a choice \nconcerning how they will expand coverage to more children. They can \nexpand their Medicaid coverage, or they can offer a package of benefits \nwhich is actuarially equivalent to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program.\n  Our intention is to build on the successes the States have been \nrealizing. This year, the States will be increasing coverage to more \nthan 800,000 children through initiatives proposed by the Governors.\n  We should learn from these initiatives and encourage the States to \ndevelop them. This proposal will allow the States to choose how best to \nextend coverage to children.\n  Expanding Medicaid is certainly a choice States have made. Thirty-\nnine States have expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and \nchildren beyond the Federal requirement, but States are also developing \nother strategies for increasing coverage of children as well. There are \nalready public-private partnerships in more than half the States.\n  There are successful programs, such as New York's Child Health Plus \nand\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\nFlorida's Healthy Kids. These innovative programs, and programs like \nthem, can grow with additional resources.\n  The Children's Health Initiative that we include in our committee \nproposal is a bold new approach to support the States in the drive to \nprovide coverage for more of our Nation's children. As I have said, the \nStates will be given a choice to expand coverage through the existing \nMedicaid Program or through a new initiative in which they can \nsubsidize private programs for children or provide a new benefit \npackage which is actuarially equivalent to what Federal employees \nreceive.\n  Under either choice, the Federal Government will provide the same \nmatching rates to the States. A State would pay the same rate as it \ndoes currently in the Medicaid Program. We recognize this may not be \nenough to encourage States to participate. Therefore, under this \nproposal, the Federal Government would send to the States an additional \nincentive bonus for each child who is covered in this new initiative. \nWe call this an enhanced match. The State will receive a 10-percent \nbonus for each new child they cover and 5 percent for a child who is \nalready covered under a State health program for children. These \nbonuses will be provided for children who are receiving health care \ncoverage from the State that is beyond Federal Government requirements \nfor Medicaid.\n  A critical component of this agreement is what type of health \ninsurance coverage is provided. Let me stress that this truly is \ninsurance. A State would be required to provide either its current \nMedicaid benefits package or one which is equal to what the children of \nFederal employees receive. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \nwill review these plans to ensure that they meet this test.\n  The welfare of our children was a critical component in the \nbipartisan plan we achieved in the Finance Committee. The result of our \nwork will be to cover more children and to provide them with real \nhealth insurance. Again, this children's health care initiative will \nbuild upon the leadership in the States. It passed the Senate Finance \nCommittee with strong bipartisan support, and I thank all the Members \nwho made a contribution to this special effort.\n  As you see, Mr. President, each of these reforms is necessary. \nTogether they meet the requirements and responsibilities that were \ngiven to us. During the next 5 years, we reduce deficit spending by \n$100 billion, including Medicare reductions of $115 billion, and net \nMedicaid reductions by $13.6 billion.\n  At the same time, we increase spending for children's health care in \nthis bill by $16 billion, SSI support for elderly and disabled \nimmigrants by $10.4 billion and welfare to work by $3 billion. We \nextend the solvency of the part A trust fund for Medicare for at least \n10 years, while introducing structural reform to give beneficiaries \nmore choice among competing health plans.\n\n  Our goal is to give the Medicare beneficiary the same choices that \nFederal employees have within our Federal health program, including the \ntraditional fee-for-service, and this is an excellent beginning.\n  We were able to produce such a strong bipartisan package because of \nthe spirit of cooperation shared by members of the Finance Committee. \nViews were solicited actively, from all members of the Finance \nCommittee. They were asked to submit in writing the recommendations as \nto how the budget agreement should be implemented, and their ideas were \nincorporated in the initial chairman's mark. Informal meetings were \nthen held to seek the further advice and recommendations from Members. \nThese, in turn, were incorporated into the proposal we address today.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I say with certainty that this \nproposal has substantial support on both sides of the political aisle \nand it is, again, my sincere hope that the spirit of bipartisanship \nthat existed within our committee will prevail as we move forward. I \nhope the objectives that guided us will remain those that carry us \nthrough the next few days as we consider this budget. I particularly \nexpress my sincere appreciation to Senator Moynihan for his leadership \nin this monumental effort, as well as my appreciation to all the \nmembers of the committee who reported this proposal out of the Finance \nCommittee unanimously. Senator Gramm provided invaluable leadership on \nthe Medicare Subcommittee, and I thank all the committee staff members \nwho worked around the clock day after day to ensure that the objectives \nwe were given to meet would be met in the most efficient and effective \nway possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like first to thank our revered \nchairman for his concise and comprehensive account of this epic \nlegislation. It comes to the floor from a unanimous Finance Committee.\n  These are the first substantive changes made in Medicare and Medicaid \nsince these measures were enacted a generation ago. I was present in \n1965. I am here in 1997. I so state, our problem --and it is a curious \nproblem in social policy, is that I am not sure we will be heard \nbecause we are not making enough noise. And we are not making enough \nnoise, Mr. President, for the simple reason that we are in agreement. \nWe have changed our minds about certain basic things. We have \nrecognized the events of the past generation that require us to do so.\n  We came into these programs little expecting how much they would come \nto take over in the Federal fisc at a time when medicine was just on \nthe verge of a great shift in its capacity, its ability to cure, to \ntreat, to heal. Fee for service was the only form of medicine available \nto most persons, not otherwise known, and Medicaid was thought to be a \nvery minor aside.\n  We reached a point where health care, partly because we have so much \nbetter health care, became hugely expensive. The chairman noted that in \n1992, Medicaid grew by 29 percent.\n  Mr. President, that means it doubles every 3 years, or more \naccurately, doubles every 30 months. You cannot sustain that. We are \ntherefore profoundly reforming the system, not so much returning it to \nan earlier good state, as bringing it forward to deal with the present \nrealities and possibilities offered by managed care and the general \nchange in medicine of recent years.\n  I say again, before there was agreement in these matters, we could \nhave had a markup in our committee that went on for 3 months, we could \nhave had rallies, speeches, petitions, filibusters, heavens knows what, \nbecause there was not in fact agreement. When agreement is arrived at, \nwhen there is consensus, the most extraordinary changes can take place \nin a seemingly everyday manner, without a voice raised or a single \ndissent. This is also particularly owed to the work of the Senator from \nTexas, who chairs the Subcommittee on Health, as the chairman observed, \nand whom I am happy to note is here on the floor. He found that \nagreement and he put it in place.\n  There are other things in the legislation. I do want to note that we \nhave added $8 billion for child health care in the form of insurance, \nfor a total in the two reconciliation bills of $24 billion. I can \nrecall the days when Wilbur Cohen assured us the whole program would \ncost $24 billion a year, and indeed for a while there it did. I think \nit should be clear that this was the work of Senator Hatch, who cares \nso very much about this matter. Equally, Senator Rockefeller was able \nto bring about an increase in the moneys that will be available to low-\nincome families as part of the child tax credit in combination with the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  Senator Bob Kerrey, who does not intend that things should always be \ndone the way they always have been done--save perhaps in the U.S. \nNavy--proposed, and we agreed, that the time had come to begin to ask \nhigher income persons to pay a higher premium to get this insurance, \nwhich they do not have to take. It is optional, but which if they can \nafford to pay something more like the original anticipated \ncontribution, well then, they ought to. That is just good sense. I \nthink this will be understood by the Senate and in time by our \ncolleagues in the House. We also move the Medicare eligibility age from \nage 65 to 67, bringing it into conformity with Social Security.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think it has to be said--and I know the \nchairman\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\nwill agree with me--that we did miss an opportunity of lasting \nconsequence for Federal finance this year by failing to take action on \nhow we measure the cost of living.\n  Our chairman has been an outspoken advocate of developing an accurate \ncost-of-living index, which we do not now have. We have cost-of-living \nindexes all over the place. You find them in the Department of Labor, \nthe Department of Commerce, and the Health Care Financing \nAdministration.\n  But we had agreement, from an initiative taken in the Finance \nCommittee, to produce an adjustment to the Consumer Price Index--which \nis not cost of living--by 1.1 percentage points. It would have produced \n$1 trillion in 12 years, and it would have put the Social Security \ntrust funds in actuarial balance until the year 2052. This was in our \nhands, and it was let slip at the last moment. We blinked, and the \nopportunity is now history.\n\n  But part of that history is also that the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and the members of the Finance Committee--I do not speak for \nall of them; I certainly speak for myself--realized this should be \ndone. It is a correction that should be made. The sooner we do, the \nmore we will be able to address other problems that remain because, as \nthe chairman said, we have a series of measures here that ensure the \nviability of Medicare for 10 years. But we mean to be around more than \n10 years, and we will have to address this subject also.\n  Finally, there are exceptional measures in this bill to make \nprovision for teaching hospitals and medical schools. One of the \nunanticipated consequences, to use the chairman's phrase, the phrase of \nRobert K. Merton in 1935, I think, that the economic rationalization of \nhealth care has been that the teaching hospitals and medical schools, \nwhich necessarily must charge more for the care they provide because \nthey are teaching and training and do research, find themselves in an \nexposed situation which we can take care of from the gains we acquire \nin the course of rationalization. But if we do not, we shall find that \none of the unanticipated consequences is that we spoiled our medical \nschools at this moment in the great age of medical science. This bill \nprecisely addresses the matter in ways I think are constructive. And we \nwill look into the issue further in the commission which the chairman \nproposes.\n  It remains for me, sir, simply once again to congratulate our revered \nchairman. If you would so measure the quality of his achievement, \nobserve the silent awe which is now observed in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to join our distinguished colleague \nfrom New York in commending the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would suspend.\n  The Chair would like to know who yields time to the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to the distinguished Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to join our colleague from New York \nin commending our chairman of the Finance Committee for his excellent \nwork and leadership. I think it is a great testament to his leadership \nthat we have before us a bill that will spend less money on Medicare \nthan another bill we debated 2 years ago which was deemed to be a \npartisan effort which ruptured the bipartisan nature of our work on \nhealth care.\n  Today we have before us a bill that is superior in virtually every \nway to that bill. And this bill that is now before us passed the \nFinance Committee on a unanimous vote and was strongly supported and \npraised by every member of the Finance Committee.\n  I think it is a testament to the leadership and fairness of the \nchairman that we have achieved this goal. I can say, as a person who \nhas watched now many chairmen work, both in the House and the Senate, I \nhave never seen anybody be fairer to every single member of the \ncommittee from the most senior member to the most junior member than \nSenator Roth was.\n  I think it is a lesson to all of us. That is, when you have heavy \nlifting to do, if you give people an opportunity to speak their mind, \nto have a fair hearing for their ideas, in the end they are a lot more \nwilling to be part of that effort than if they feel you are trying to \nram it down their throat or treat them unfairly. We have all heard, \nfrom our teenage years, if you want me with you on the landing, you \nneed to have me there on the takeoff. But we often forget it in real \nlife. And I think our chairman has reminded us of it again here.\n  We have before us a very thick bill which is the composite of all of \nthe so-called reconciliation bills that are supposed to save money. I \nwant to note that there is only one bill in here that saves any real \nmoney, and that is the bill that we are talking about today, the bill \nthat came out of the Finance Committee.\n  Now, lest someone jump up and say the Commerce Committee saved money, \nwhat the Commerce Committee did was to sell spectrum, the right to \nbroadcast. We had the Agriculture Committee that was actually ordered \nto spend $1.5 billion, and remarkably they had no trouble doing it. But \nthe Finance Committee portion of the bill that is before us saves $100 \nbillion with a ``b'' dollars. And it does it in some of the most \nsensitive programs of the Federal Government. I want to talk very \nbriefly about some of these changes because they are important.\n  We are going to have a lot of debate here in the Senate tomorrow when \nwe start shooting real bullets and start having amendments offered \nabout Medicare. We are going to have questions about the need for long-\nterm reform. I am proud to say that the bill before us is the most \ndramatic reform of Medicare in the history of the program, and, in \nfact, if you combine all of the other reforms in Medicare that we have \nadopted in the last 32 years into one package, it is relatively \ninsignificant as compared to this bill.\n  I know there will be those who question the need for this dramatic \nreform, but I just want to remind my colleagues that over the next 10 \nyears Medicare will be a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal Treasury. \nIf you take all the money we collect in payroll taxes and you compare \nthat to how much money we are going to spend on Medicare over the next \n10 years, we are going to fail to pay for the program by a cumulative \ntotal of $1.6 trillion.\n  We have an unfunded liability in Medicare under the best of \ncircumstances. With all the right reforms, if they could be made and \ndone immediately, we still have an unfunded liability bigger than the \ncurrent inflation adjusted costs of winning World War II. We have \npromised Medicare to two succeeding generations and we have set no \nmoney aside to pay for those benefits. As the baby-boomer generation--\n79 million people strong--begins to go into retirement 11 years from \nnow, we are going to go from 5.9 workers to 3.9 workers to 2.2 workers \nper retiree, and the impact of it is going to be cataclysmic on the \nFederal budget.\n  That is why this bill is so important because it takes the first step \ntoward saving Medicare. I believe if we can save these reforms not just \nin the Senate but through the House and to the President with his \nsignature, that every Member of the Congress will be able to say of \nthis bill that they truly did something worthy of being remembered.\n  Now, let me outline some of the major components of the bill that I \nthink are important. First of all, this bill gives our seniors who \nqualify for Medicare a broad range of choices. Today they have two \nchoices. They can stay in the old fee-for-service Medicare policy or \nthey can go into a massive all-encompassing HMO. What we do is fill in \nall the areas in between by giving our seniors the same kind of \ncompetitive choices that are available in private medicine today. I \nthink this is a dramatic reform. I think it is a reform that is going \nto enhance the quality of health care. It is certainly going to expand \nfreedom. Since we know competition has an impact on health care costs \nbecause the competition of the last 8 years in the private sector has \ndriven the medical price index that measures inflation in medicine \nbelow the Consumer Price Index which measures the costs of all goods \nand services in the economy, we are confident that\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\nexpanded choice, expanded competition, and the efficiency that it will \nultimately bring will benefit every Medicare beneficiary and will \nbenefit the 110 million people that are paying Medicare taxes.\n  This is a very important reform. It is a reform that now, I think, we \ncan be proud to say, is virtually noncontroversial.\n  One thing we have done in the bill which I say that had it been left \nup to me I would not have done is we have transferred home health care \nout of the trust fund into general revenue. Those who have wanted to be \nunkind have said it is a phony reform; not only are they unkind, they \nare correct. In fact, when we initially debated this so-called reform I \nsaid that you can buy 10 years of solvency in Medicare by taking the \nfastest growing item in Medicare out of the trust fund and putting it \nin general revenue and not counting it as part of Medicare anymore as \npart of the part A trust fund. If that is real reform, I can save \nMedicare for 100 years by simply taking hospital care out of the trust \nfund and putting it into general revenue and not counting it as part A \nMedicare, but would anybody believe that I had done anything when I did \nit?\n  So, one part of this bill which was dictated by the budget agreement \nis the transfer of home health care. But there are two things that we \nhave done as part of this transfer which really represents an \naccounting gimmick, but two things we have done are real. No. 1, we are \ngoing to build over time 25 percent of the cost of home health care \ninto the Medicare premium that people pay for part B services or \nphysician services after retirement; and also for the first time in \nthis bill we have a $5 copayment for home health care. Now I know that \nthere will be an amendment offered and that people will scream and \nholler that this $5 copayment represents the end of the world. But I \nwant to remind my colleagues that home health care now spends more \nmoney than the National Institutes of Health. It now spends more money \nthan the space program. This is a massive uncontrolled program.\n  Some of you probably saw the big article in the Wall Street Journal \nabout how people have gotten out of the garbage collection business and \ngone into home health care and become instant millionaires, how \nfraudulent much of this program is in terms of people who were \nproviding services and overbilling and how the whole system is \ncompletely out of control. We are trying to begin to tighten up on that \nbut there is nothing that will be better for tightening up on it than \nasking for a small nominal payment so that people will look at the \ncost, so that people will make rational choices. So it is a small \ncopayment. But if we know anything about the world we live in, it is \nthat small costs affect behavior on a substantial basis.\n\n  We have very important long-term reform in this bill. The reform has \nalready been denounced by most of the major special interest groups in \nthe country that tend to speak out on these issues, and I want to talk \nabout the two long-term reforms. The first reform has to do with \nretirement age. I remind my colleagues that we changed the retirement \nage in 1983 for Social Security. I remind you of the circumstances. We \nwere on the verge of having Social Security go bankrupt. We were down \nto the point where we could not have sent out the July checks. We had a \ncommission that had not reached any kind of conclusion, and under the \nleadership of Ronald Reagan we were ultimately able to get a \nrecommendation to make some changes. The only real substantive change \nthat the commission made and Congress adopted was changing the \nretirement age. They set out to change the retirement age over a 35-\nyear period where, as we recognize that people are living longer, as we \nare healthier, as we are working longer, that ultimately Social \nSecurity had to change.\n  People forget that when Social Security went into effect in 1935 the \naverage American worker did not have a life expectancy that was high \nenough that they would ever receive any benefits from Social Security. \nIt was the exceptional person who lived longer than normal who ever got \na penny out of Social Security. Our lifetimes, thank God, have grown \ntremendously since 1935 due to improvements in public health, due to \nimprovements in medical care, due to improvements in nutrition, and due \nto the improvements that would come as income has risen with our strong \nfree-enterprise economy and we have all been able to do a better job \ntaking care of ourself and our children.\n  But we raised the retirement age to 67 for Social Security--that will \nbecome effective in the year 2027--but we did not raise the eligibility \ndate for Medicare. In this bill we make the conforming changes so that \nSocial Security and Medicare will again be brought together. What it \nmeans is for people who were born in 1960 and who are, therefore, 37 \nyears old today, they will know, with 30 years to plan for it, that \nthey are not going to qualify for Social Security and for Medicare \nuntil they are 67. So they have 30 years to plan for that change. In my \ncase, I was born in 1942. So I know that if this bill is adopted, along \nwith the changes that have already been made in Social Security, that I \nwill not be eligible to retire until I am 65 years and 10 months old. \nSo I have 11 years to adjust to the fact that under this bill I am \ngoing to be required and can expect to work 10 months longer.\n  Now, we have a lot of people who are saying that this is \nunreasonable, outrageous, that the end of the world is going to come as \na result of it, but this is the reality of the world we live in. We are \nhealthier, we are working longer, and we are living longer. So if this \nprogram that we all depend on is going to be there to serve us, this is \na change that needs to be made. I intend to defend it vigorously.\n  The second change that was made had to do with asking very high-\nincome retirees to pay the full cost of the voluntary part of this \nprogram. Some people will recall that the part A of the trust fund, the \nhospital part, you pay for during your working life by paying 2.9 \npercent of your wages into a trust fund, and that pay is for part A. \nActually it is a long way from paying for it but that is the system. \nThe part A section of Medicare which pays for hospital care, you do not \npay for while you are working, you pay 25 percent of the costs of the \npart B premium. When the program was started in 1965 it was going to be \n50 percent of the costs.\n  What we do under this bill is ask our high-income seniors, who as \nindividuals, make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year and as couples \nfrom $75,000 to $125,000, to phase up that part B premium from that 25 \npercent of the cost which is $526 a year to approximately $2,100 a year \nof costs, which is the full cost of that voluntary program.\n\n  Now, again, some people will say this is an outrage, but the plain \ntruth is this is a voluntary program. It is still a better buy than \nanybody can get in the marketplace. Nobody paid for this program during \ntheir working life. It makes no sense for my son in the labor market \nand 21 years old to be paying taxes to subsidize voluntary insurance \nfor a senior who is making $125,000 a year. It is just not right. This \nis a good Government program. I note that the savings from this higher \npart B premium for very high-income seniors and from the retirement age \nchange, that the savings from those two programs we do not even count \nthem in this bill. They are not counted for budget purposes. We are not \nusing them to balance the budget. We are not using them to fund tax \ncuts. We are simply doing them and dedicating all the savings to the \nMedicare trust fund to keep the system solvent. No one has ever done \nanything like this before in the name of trying to save Medicare.\n  Finally, we did have a provision that would have used the higher \ncosts for very high-income seniors as a deductible instead of as a \npayment. We have had so many questions raised about it that I have \ndecided, along with others, to go ahead and simply charge the premium \nand then do a study and a test of using the deductible instead of the \npremium. I will submit for the Record two letters, one from the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute and one from the Heritage Foundation, \nexplaining why doing it where we would raise the deductible instead of \nthe premium would be better and would save more money and would improve \nthe efficiency of the system. The logic which seems to escape many \npeople is that if I am a high-income retiree and I pay $1,577 more for \nan insurance policy, once I paid that, then the cost of medical care \nthat I would then buy with that policy is totally unchanged.\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\n  So all the Government did that helped Medicare was it got $1,577 out \nof my pocket and put it into the trust fund to help keep the program \nalive--good work, important work, but by doing it as a deductible, \nwhich I hope some day we can do when people understand it, you are \ngoing to get high income seniors who will be more cost conscious \nbecause they will be paying the first $2,100 as a deductible, and so \nthey will actually be consuming medical care more efficiently, getting \nout their bills and reading them, and reporting when somebody over \ncharges them. They will actually be shopping around for the best buy. \nThat is what we want people to do. But this whole idea is so important, \nI don't want a new idea to threaten it.\n  So I will submit these two letters for the Record. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The Heritage Foundation,\n\n                                                    June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I was delighted to hear that your \n     amendment concerning the Medicare Part B deductible was added \n     to the Finance Committee bill.\n       We have long argued, as you have, that raising the Part B \n     deductible for upper-income Americans is wise policy. \n     Moreover, given the choice between raising the deductible and \n     raising premiums, increasing the deductible makes far more \n     sense. While raising the premium for upper-income retirees, \n     like raising the deductible, would reduce the taxpayer-\n     financed subsidy now going to people who do not need it, \n     raising the deductible would have the added advantage of also \n     significantly changing patient incentives. That would lay the \n     groundwork for long term structural reform of Medicare.\n       I should add that the criticisms leveled at your amendment \n     are quite remarkable. At a time when Medicare is increasingly \n     incapable of promising continued service to lower-income \n     retirees, it seems incredible that some liberal members and \n     organizations are defending a huge subsidy to the rich. And \n     it is almost amusing to hear the claim that the amendment is \n     unworkable. We have been means-testing programs for the poor \n     for many years, but now we are told that designing an income-\n     adjusted Medicare deductible for the rich is beyond the \n     capability of the human mind.\n       Keep up the good work, Senator!\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Stuart Butler, Ph.D.,\n\n                                       Vice President, Director of\n     Domestic and Economic Policy Studies.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Enterprise Institute\n\n\n                                   for Public Policy Research,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I would like to congratulate the Senate \n     Finance Committee on its recent action to introduce income-\n     related deductibles into the Medicare program. In my personal \n     view, this proposed change is long overdue for the following \n     reasons:\n       The original Part B deductible was $50. After over 30 \n     years, it has only been allowed to increase to $100. If it \n     had been indexed to per capita health care costs, it would \n     today be about $1,200.\n       75 percent of Part B is now financed from general revenues. \n     This means that each Medicare recipient receives a subsidy \n     from other taxpayers of about $1,700 per year. It is highly \n     appropriate that higher income Medicare recipients pay a \n     higher portion of the cost of their insurance coverage.\n       The long-term reform of Medicare is not just a matter of \n     raising more revenue from payroll taxes or premiums. It will \n     require reforms that give recipients incentives to seek more \n     cost-effective providers when they need care and to avoid \n     using medical care unless it is actually needed. Higher \n     deductibles are a useful first step on the long road to \n     reform since they will give those with the greatest ability \n     to pay an incentive to use medical care more carefully. You \n     will not get these behavioral effects from higher premiums.\n       Since Medigap policies impose extra costs of approximately \n     $1,000 per beneficiary on the Medicare program and reduce the \n     behavioral effects of deductibles and co-payments, I urge the \n     Congress to investigate and eventually pass reforms affecting \n     the Medigap insurance market.\n       The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily \n     reflect the views of the American Enterprise Institute or any \n     of my colleagues.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                              Robert B. Helms,\n\n                                                 Resident Scholar,\n                                Director of Health Policy Studies.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to yield 20 minutes from the majority time for purposes of \nmaking remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, freedom is, and always has been, the \ngreat moving force of American history. It was freedom that inspired \npatriots to give their lives at Concord and Lexington. Freedom that \ncompelled American Rangers to scale the cliffs at Normandy. And freedom \nthat filled Ronald Reagan's heart in Berlin as he exhorted Mr. \nGorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''\n  Freedom. The essential ingredient of what Reagan called ``the \nAmerican purpose.'' At our highest and best, we Americans are believers \nin the ``blessings of liberty,'' the idea that ``all men are endowed by \ntheir Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' And these rights are \nnot America's alone, but extend to all those who would seek to know \nfreedom's warm embrace.\n  So today, from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic, the \nIron Curtain has lifted, and a wave of democracy has descended on the \nglobe. The ``simple, vivid, peaceable world'' of which John Cheever \nwrote is more a reality today than at any time in our history.\n  But evil knows no resting place. The cold war is over. And still how \nmany have yet to taste the fruit of freedom? For there is a regime in \nthe world today that runs against the tide of history; that denies \nliberty and human dignity to its people; a regime whose brutal \nrepression at home betrays its intentions abroad; a regime that aspires \nto superpower status.\n  I am speaking of Communist China. And I rise today to say, ``No \nmore.'' No more should we watch as China uses its illegitimate gains to \npurchase military hardware and weapons of mass destruction. No more \nshould we ignore Beijing's mercantilist trade policies that block U.S. \nproducts and destroy American jobs. No more should we accept a playing \nfield for our products that is not level. No more, Mr. President. No \nmore unconditional most-favored-nation status for Communist China.\n  My decision to oppose most-favored-nation status was not an easy one. \nIt was reached after countless meetings with foreign policy experts, \neconomists, and the CEO's of major corporations. To the businessmen \nwhose passion for the status quo was surprising, I posed many \nquestions.\n  Has China embraced the rule of law, put their regulations and laws in \nwriting, stopped subjecting them to differential application? No. Are \nher people more free? Well, not really. Is America more secure with \nChina selling weaponry to rogue nations and extending its own influence \nfar beyond appropriate levels into the South China Sea? Tragically, \nthose I questioned could only plead for more time. But time alone \ncannot heal these wounds. We must say: No more.\n  The truth is, America has dedicated over two decades to the policies \nof engagement, and the results have been far from compelling or \nconvincing. Less than 2 percent of United States exports went to China \nlast year. America sold more goods and services individually to \nBelgium, Brazil, and Singapore than to the People's Republic of China. \nMeanwhile, the United States took more than 30 percent of China's \nexports creating a $39.5 billion merchandise trade deficit. This \nrepresents a threefold increase since 1990. A 200-percent increase in \njust 6 years!\n\n  On Friday, more bad news. The Commerce Department reported that our \ntrade gap is widening--fully 41 percent higher in the first 4 months of \nthis year than in 1996. This led the Wall Street Journal to speculate \nthat China will soon have the largest deficit of any United States \ntrading partner, surpassing even Japan.\n  If our growing trade deficit has been the source of great attention, \nthe causal factors behind the inequity have gone all but ignored. At \ntheir core, they are twofold. The first element is the anti-American, \npredatory trade practices of the Chinese Government. The second is a \nUnited States-China policy that has been an abject failure,\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\na case study in what not to do. A United States policy that has, in \ntruth and reality, made Communist China America's most favored nation.\n  American access to the other Asian market is growing every day. The \nMongolian Government has aggressively sought United States investment, \nand soon will allow foreign ``stakes in infrastructure'' and the \npurchase of ``shares in privatized companies.'' In Taiwan, AT and GTE \nhave won stakes in cellular telephone licenses that will allow both to \nprovide telecommunications services to the Taiwanese.\n  China is the exception, erecting barriers to entry surpassed only by \nthe Great Wall itself. This begs the question: if United States \nproducts are good enough for Mongolia, Taiwan, and the other Asian \ndemocracies, developing and developed, why are they not good enough for \nCommunist China? And when will we have the courage to say, ``No more''?\n  Consider China's treatment of information technologies. The United \nStates tariff on cellular phones from China is 1.6 percent. China's \ntariff? Seven times as high. Chinese telephone answering machines: 1.6 \npercent. The tariff on United States firms? A whopping 50 percent, over \n25 times as high. Chinese-made computers: 2.7 percent. The import tax \non Silicon Valley? Almost six times as high. And the list goes on and \non and on.\n  In March, 39 countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and \nSouth Korea, signed the Information Technology Agreement which will \nphase out all tariffs on such products as semiconductors, computer \nhardware, and electronic components by century end. China's concession \nwas nowhere to be found. And yet, we rewarded China's belligerence by \nproviding the same access to our market as we do to those Asian \ncountries that have agreed to welcome our goods.\n  Now the administration and the ivory tower academicians like to whine \nabout how misleading the ``most-favored-nation'' designation is. ``If \nwe could only change the name,'' they wail, ``our China troubles would \nbe over.'' But if ever there were a country that deserved the label \n``most favored nation,'' it is Communist China. It is time for America \nto say, ``No more.''\n  Unfortunately, rather than sound a clarion trumpet for American \ngoods, the administration has hoisted the flag of defeat. Today, the \nUnited States allows China to slap punitively high tariffs on our goods \nwhile other countries are trying to treat us equitably. Australia, for \ninstance, has tariffs on United States goods that are roughly equal to \nAmerica's 4-percent rate. And yet, Australia's access to the United \nStates market is no better than China's.\n\n  In fact, the People's Republic of China is deriving more benefits \nfrom United States trade than even our closest trading partners. Mexico \nplaces tariff rates on American goods that are only 2 percent higher \nthan comparable United States rates. China's tariffs, however, are 19 \npercent higher. But again, Mexico and China enjoy virtually identical \naccess to the United States market. We are literally inviting China to \nbe involved in our market while China is slamming the door in the face \nof American business. China is truly ``America's most-favored-nation.''\n  This stems at least in part from the willingness of the United States \nto trade with China under a bilateral agreement that was signed in \n1979--a time when Jimmy Carter still called the White House home. The \nagreement predates the commercial availability of information \ntechnologies such as cellular phones and portable computers.\n  Madam President, this bilateral agreement is the first of a two-tier \ntest that all nonmarket economies must meet if they are to be extended \nmost-favored-nation status. The second deals with the emigration \nprovisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. There are currently 15 \nnonmarket economies, including China, that have technically complied \nwith this two-tier test in order to get MFN status.\n  All of the other 14 designees, however, have bilateral agreements \nthat were developed in the 1990's. In fact, every United States trading \npartner save China has trade agreements that were negotiated in the \nlast 7 years.\n  Only China operates with a favorable status of not having to comply \nwith a modern bilateral agreement. Only China enjoys this most favored \namong most-favored-nations position. It is this decades-old agreement \nthat is failing to safeguard our capacity to deal on a level playing \nfield with the Chinese. It is this agreement that is failing to allow \nfor free and unfettered trade.\n  Last Wednesday, Madam President, I asked Undersecretary of State for \nEconomic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, Stuart Eizenstat, to tell \nme why the administration has failed to hold the Chinese to the same \nstandards as other most-favored-nation designees by requiring a modern \nbilateral trade agreement. ``This is,'' Eizenstat said, ``one of the \nthings we are now negotiating.''\n  Madam President, ``now negotiating?'' A bilateral trade agreement is \na precursor to the extension of MFN. It was one of the basis upon which \nMFN is extended. It is a core requirement. Why is Congress being asked \nto renew most-favored-nation status before a modern bilateral trade \nagreement is in place? Why in the world is Congress being pushed to \nembrace an agreement that disadvantages U.S. products and ensures a \ntrade imbalance into the foreseeable future? China's preferential \nstatus coupled with her discriminatory conduct has improperly made the \nPRC a nation favored above all others, the most-favored among most-\nfavored nations.\n\n  Perhaps China's past and current transgressions could be overlooked \nif Beijing's ambitions were more humane. Instead, the hard currency \ncreated by China's trade surplus is being used to pursue a massive \nmilitary modernization program, nothing less than a blue-water navy, \nlong-range aircraft, and precision-guided munitions and missiles. The \nRussians alone have sold billions of dollars of military technology to \nthe Chinese. And, as Prof. Arthur Waldron notes, this includes ``cruise \nmissiles capable of defeating the anti-missile defenses of the U.S. \nNavy.''\n  These force-projection technologies are not about ``providing for the \ncommon defense.'' They are about providing an uncommon capacity to \nproject power--power all across Asia. They will threaten not just the \nAsian democracies, but also the sailors of the 7th Fleet who call the \nwaters of the South China Sea home.\n  I intend to address the emerging threat posed by Beijing's military \nbuild-up in the days and weeks ahead. I also plan to speak about an \nadministration policy that fails to defend what Thomas Paine called the \nrights of man, all but ignoring Beijing's cruel campaign of persecution \nand repression aimed at crushing internal dissent.\n\n  We will never tame the Chinese dragon--no more than we subdued the \nSoviet bear--with the policies of appeasement. The way to bring China \ninto the community of nations is to talk truthfully and forcefully \nabout the evils found there; challenge China to open her doors to the \ncommerce of the Western world; and maintain an American military \nsuperiority that makes peace not only possible but probable.\n  And to those who say this debate cannot be won, that the forces \namassed against us are too great, I take issue. ``Any spot is \ntenable,'' said John Kennedy, ``if men--brave men--will make it so.'' \nIt is time to turn retreat to advance; to fight for a new China policy \nsteeped in the principles of our old American Republic. Because truly \nfree trade can only exist between free peoples. And the Chinese who \nwatched treachery take hold in Tiananmen Square are most certainly not \nfree. It is time for America to say, ``No more.''\n  In 1946, Winston Churchill came to America to warn of the Soviet \nsubjugation of Eastern Europe. At the request of President Truman, he \nchose small Westminster College in Fulton, MO as the site where Britain \nwould pass the baton of Western leadership to ``the American \ndemocracy.''\n  In this most Churchillian of Churchill speeches--made famous by its \n``iron curtain'' coinage--he called America to her highest and best in \ndefense of freedom and the rights of man. And if I might beg the \nChair's indulgence, I would like to read a portion of the words he \noffered that warm and windy Tuesday a half century ago in Fulton, MO, \nmy home State.\n  Winston Churchill challenged the United States:\n  ``The United States,'' said Churchill, ``stands at this time at the \npinnacle of\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\nworld power. It is a solemn moment for the American democracy. For with \nthis primacy in power is joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the \nfuture. As you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of \nduty done, but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level \nof achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining * * * To \nreject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring us all the long \nreproaches of the aftertime.''\n  Madam President, Churchill's words are America's words. For ours is a \npassionate belief in human possibility, an abiding devotion to freedom. \n``Opportunity is here now, clear and shining.'' Let us not trade \nliberty for the false idol of foreign commerce. Let us not allow \nfreedom's song to die on our lips. ``For all sad words of tongue and \npen, the saddest are these: `It might have been.'

Mr. President, the House of Representatives votes \ntomorrow on whether or not to extend most-favored-nation trade status \nto China. In a more desirable world, revoking China's MFN status might \nbe less advisable than handling national security and human rights as \nwell as economic issues in more traditional ways. Unfortunately, the \nexperience of the last 3 or 4 years, in fact experience going back much \nfarther than that, has demonstrated that the administration's policy of \nconstructive engagement has failed. The constructive engagement policy \nhas in fact degenerated. We have seen conditions in China worsened \nannually.\n  The logic behind constructive engagement is, indeed, appealing. It \ngoes something like this. If we will expand trade with China, the \nresult will inevitably be political liberalization and ultimately an \nimprovement in the conditions of the Chinese people, there will be an \nexpansion of human rights opportunities, there will be less repression, \nthere will be less religious persecution, there will be a warmer and \nmore cordial relationship between China and the United States.\n  When I was first confronted with the issue of MFN upon my election to \nCongress in 1993, I was almost persuaded by that logic. In fact, I \nwanted to be persuaded by that logic, and I was looking for any \nindication that the policy of constructive engagement was, in fact, \nhaving the desired results and that, in fact, conditions were \nimproving, treatment of the Chinese people had improved, there was less \nrepression, and that trade, expanded trade, was in fact having that \nkind of result. Had there been any sign in the last 4 years that this \npolicy of constructive engagement was having the intended result, I \nwould be voting for MFN this year. Were I given the opportunity, I \nwould be supporting most-favored-nation trade status for China.\n  But the facts are very clear and the State Department's own report \nmakes it abundantly clear that conditions have deteriorated, that the \npolicy of linkage has not had the result that we all wanted it to have. \nSo it is argued that economic freedom frequently leads to political \nfreedom, and in fact it does frequently lead to political freedom. \nThere are examples in which that has happened. But in China's case, \nmarket economics has become nothing but an utilitarian exercise to \nensure the continuation of a totalitarian regime. They have seen if \nthey keep the iron grip upon the Chinese people, that a market economy \nwill help them accomplish that; that expanded trade, higher incomes, \neconomic opportunities for Chinese people--that makes it easier for \nthem to maintain an absolute repression of any kind of free expression \nwithin China.\n  Proponents of MFN say we all have the same goal, expanded human \nrights, we just have a different approach on how we best attain that. \nRussia is often pointed to, the old Soviet Union, where there was a \nlittle hole in the dike called perestroika and from that little hole in \nthe dike the floodgates opened and freedom could not be contained. But \nin China, perhaps they learned the lesson from the Russian experiment \nor from the Soviet Union's experience, for in China there has been no \nperestroika; there has been only repression.\n  There are, I believe, many flaws in the policy of constructive \nengagement. First and foremost, it has simply not improved the status \nof the Chinese people; it has worsened it. The administration's \ndecision not to consider human rights abuses when granting MFN status \nhas proven disastrous for the people of China. As they have been \nremoved from the threat of any repercussions in the trade relationship \nwith the United States, the Chinese Communist leaders have succeeded in \njailing or executing every last dissident in a country of over 1 \nbillion people, according to the State Department's own 1996 China \nreport. As we have turned a blind eye, the atrocities have escalated \nand the oppressive government has strengthened its hold on a full one-\nfifth of the world's population. The constructive engagement policy has \nproduced more persecutions of Christians,\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nmore forced abortions, more sterilizations of the mentally handicapped, \nmore incarcerations of political dissidents, and the near extinction of \nthe expression of any opinions contrary to those of the Communist \nregime.\n  I have on this chart, I think, a very clear illustration of the \nfailure of the constructive engagement policy. On the left of this \nchart we see a dramatic increase of trade with China, a less dramatic \nincrease of imports from the United States, and a very dramatic \nincrease in exports. We see, in a very graphic manner, while trade has \nincreased from 1987 to 1996, we have also seen that human rights abuses \nin China have increased almost in a parallel manner. Homeless \nchildren--in 1993 over 600,000, in 1997 almost three times as many \nhomeless children, homeless children being the result of those who are \nincarcerated and those who are executed. Religious persecution in \nChina--in 1993, 2.4 million believers, those people of faith \npersecuted. In 1997, 4 years later, under the policy of constructive \nengagement, 4.5 million, almost doubling.\n\n  So, while trade increased--the logic of constructive engagement would \nsay trade increasing, more trade opportunities will mean greater human \nrights and fewer abuses in China. Just the opposite has occurred.\n  Reeducation camps--in 1993, 200,000 were in these forced reeducation \nlabor camps; in 1997, over 5 million have been detained, according to \nAmnesty International and according to the Congressional Research \nService. I believe this in fact demonstrates that constructive \nengagement has been very destructive.\n  Second, this delinkage has also resulted in a loss of leverage with \nthe Chinese Government. I want to pause to read from an editorial that \nappeared in my hometown paper today, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. It \nsays:\n\n       But they may not realize that a carrot-and-stick approach \n     isn't likely to be effective if the carrot is always offered \n     and the stick is always withheld.\n\n  That has been the result of this delinkage policy. They would say, \nand they do say: Your words are empty because there is nothing to back \nthem up. Delinkage has not worked because, in effect, there has been no \nstick. So, is it any wonder that, in effect, we hear the Chinese \nGovernment say we don't care what you say because in the end we get \nwhat we want and we can continue to do what we please? Mr. President, \nthat delinkage has resulted in a loss of leverage is clearly evident in \nthat State Department report of 1996, in which they said, ``No \ndissidents were known to be active at the year's end.''\n  When most-favored-nation status reaches the point that it is no \nlonger conditioned, then it becomes absolutely meaningless. When we \nlook at China and our own State Department says by every measure \nconditions are worse, yet we say we are still going to extend most-\nfavored-nation trade status, then that annual exercise becomes nothing \nmore than an annual joke that we play in Congress, where we go through \nthe process, we go through the debate, all the time knowing most-\nfavored-nation trade status will be extended, MFN will be extended \nregardless of what conditions may have occurred within China.\n  In a flagrant act of intimidation, China effectively blockaded Taiwan \nduring a missile testing exercise off its coast in March of 1996. Many \nexamples could be given of where the Chinese Government acts with \nimpunity toward our Nation because our policy has been one of coddling.\n  Third, constructive engagement supposes a true free enterprise system \nin China and that system just does not exist. The logic behind \nconstructive engagement is flawed because it assumes that in fact they \nhave a free enterprise system. They do not have that. They have \nprotectionist trade policies, they have an enormous trade deficit with \nthe United States, and the People's Liberation Army controls many of \nthe industries in China. So the assumption is wrong and the policy is \nflawed.\n  Fourth, constructive engagement supposes a fair trade relationship \nthat does not exist. How can you have a fair trade relationship when \nthere are 5 million people in slave labor camps? Forced reeducation \ncamps, the old gulag in the Soviet Union, the concentration camps, \nthat's what they are, with prison industries. Though it is against the \nlaw, there is no way that we can totally detect what products are made \nin prison factories and what products are not. So there is no fair \ntrade relationship with China.\n  Then, fifth, constructive engagement ignores the military buildup in \nChina. If you reject everything else, the fact is we have a compelling \nnational security interest as we see China's defense budget growing. \nUnited States Ambassador to China James Sasser recently stated that \nfact. The Chinese themselves have announced an increase in that budget, \nwhich will bring total defense outlays to $10 billion and many believe \nit is closer to $40 billion. So I say, as you look at China's military \nbuildup, their willingness to export weapon components, chemical weapon \ncomponents, selling those weapon components to Iran, nuclear weapon \ntechnology to Pakistan, advanced jet aircraft to Russia and on and on, \nit is clear that our national security interest would say we ought not \nextend again most-favored-nation status to China.\n  Sixth, constructive engagement is flawed because it assumes that \ngentle treatment will elicit good behavior while firmness will result \nin escalating tensions. Let me say that again. The assumption is that \nif we will give to China gentle treatment, it will elicit good \nbehavior, but that if we dare to take a firm stand, it will escalate \ntensions. In an earlier day that philosophy was called appeasement, and \nit has never worked. It did not work in the days of Chamberlain, and it \nwill not work in our day. There is no greater example of it, perhaps, \nor image of it, at least, than when Vice President Gore toasted Premier \nLi Peng.\n  Arthur Waldron wrote in his essay ``How Not to Deal with China,'' he \nsaid:\n\n       China is involved in disputes around the full circumference \n     of its border, disputes which, like burners on a stove, \n     Beijing may turn up or down, but never turns off.\n\n  So they toy as we grant MFN. The logic behind this policy is flawed. \nI believe it deserves a vote of no confidence. I hope the Senate will \nhave the opportunity to cast that vote. China has created a dichotomy. \nThey say, on the one hand, give us trade. They say give us sales. They \nsay give us dollars. And on the other hand, they practice political \nrepression, slave labor, forced abortion and religious persecution. \nBetween those two statements there is the great wall of China: Yes, \nmarket economy, free trade, but political repression and slave labor. \nTo the extent that free markets lead to free minds, China, in \nrecognizing that, built a wall between. And, as we continue to grant \nmost-favored-nation status, we allow that wall to exist.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago, I was present, as many of my colleagues \nwere, at the dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the latest \nwar memorial on the Mall in Washington, DC. At the edge of the memorial \nis a low wall upon which is inscribed this reminder, I think a good \nreminder for all Senators, a good reminder for all our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives on this eve of the MFN vote. On that \nmemorial is inscribed these words: ``Freedom is not free.''\n  To those who would say that profits are the ultimate arbiter of \nAmerican policy, I say it is time that, once again, values and \nprinciples be the determinant of what our national policy is and what \nour trade policy should be. Freedom is not free.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa is to be recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6074-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6075-S6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, who yields me time?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be taken off the \nminority's time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years, I have been working hard \nto identify and combat fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare Program. \nStarting in 1990, when I took over as chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee that funds and has jurisdiction over the administrative \nfunding of Medicare, I began holding hearings, and I held several \nhearings through\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\nthose years, released report after report, documenting the unnecessary \nlosses to the Medicare Program. These losses are truly staggering. I \nhave taken the floor many times over the last several years to document \nthis for other Senators. The General Accounting Office estimates that \nup to 10 percent of Medicare payments could be lost to fraud, waste, \nand abuse. That adds up to about $18 billion a year.\n  The HHS inspector general just concluded a comprehensive audit of \nMedicare claims paid last year. It is the most comprehensive review of \nclaims ever made. They found that up to $23 billion of those payments, \nor about 14 percent, should not have been paid. This is last year, 1 \nyear. The HHS inspector general said that up to $23 billion should not \nhave been paid. So the problem may even be worse than we originally \nthought.\n  There are many components to this problem. Mr. President, if you can \ndream up a scam or a ripoff, it has probably already been tried in \nMedicare. We have uncovered losses due to out-and-out fraud--billing \nfor services that weren't administered, providers paying and receiving \nkickbacks, double billing. We now even have evidence that organized \ncrime has entered the Medicare fraud business. Clearly, there is a lot \nof criminal activity that is going on out there which is costing us \nbillions of dollars each year.\n  However, we found, with help from the GAO and inspector general, that \neven greater losses are due to waste and abuse. That's right, waste and \nabuse is even bigger than fraud in the Medicare Program, and those \nlosses are often directly due to or encouraged by wasteful Medicare \npayment policies and practices.\n  At long last, it appears that the bill before us will address some of \nthe most glaring problems. It would make changes that I have been \nadvocating since the beginning of this decade, changes, I might add, \nthat this body has previously defeated. I have offered amendments on \nthe floor in the past to provide for competitive bidding for Medicare, \njust like the Veterans Administration has, and I was not successful.\n  So now with the competitive bidding, plus a streamlining of \nMedicare's authority to pare back excessive payment rates, these two \nsteps can cut waste and save taxpayers billions of dollars. I commend \nSenator Graham of Florida for offering the amendment in committee on \ncompetitive bidding. He had cosponsored my proposals in the past. \nSenator Graham has done us all a great service for his action, and I \ncommend the full committee for adopting it and having it in the bill \nbefore us.\n  The need for these reforms could not be clearer. Let me just give you \nan idea of what I am talking about. Last year, I released a report \nprepared by my staff on waste in Medicare payments for medical \nsupplies. Remember the $500 toilet seats from the Pentagon of a decade \nor two decades ago? The good news is, the Pentagon isn't buying them \nanymore. The bad news is, Medicare is.\n  Our analysis of Medicare payments for a sample of medical supplies \nand equipment from saline solution to hospital beds reveals that \nMedicare is paying up to six times more for these items than other \nGovernment or private-sector entities. For just 18 items reviewed, \nMedicare could save over 50 percent, or up to $236 million this year. \nLet me repeat that. We reviewed 18 items--just 18--out of the tens of \nthousands that Medicare pays for. In just those, we could save $236 \nmillion this year if we paid the same rates in Medicare as we paid in \nthe Veterans' Administration. Same item.\n  If Medicare were just to pay wholesale rates offered to others around \nthe country, it could save $218 million this year. In fact, it was so \nbad, we found that if Medicare just went down to the local drugstore \nand paid retail rates, it could save $371 million over the next 7 \nyears; $371 million over 7 years if they just paid retail rates for the \n18 items that we looked at.\n  For example, we found that Medicare pays up to $182.80 to rent an air \nmattress, more than six times the wholesale price of $29.95, three \ntimes the price of $53.88.\n  Medicare is paying $99.35 for a simple commode chair that the VA is \nable to buy for $24.12.\n  Medicare is paying $7.90 for a bottle of sterile saline solution; the \nVA buys it for $2.38.\n  I have a chart here which just shows some of these items and the \npotential savings. Here is an irrigation syringe which Medicare is \npaying $2.93 for; the VA is paying $1.89.\n  Here is a walker. This is one of those plain walkers that elderly \npeople use. It has four legs on it. Medicare is paying $75.52 for them; \nthe Veterans' Administration is paying $25.40 for the same one, the \nexact same walker made by the same company.\n  A commode chair. You know what a commode chair is; if you can't get \nto the bathroom, you have it by your bed. Medicare is paying $99.35 for \nit; the same commode chair, identical, the Veterans' Administration is \npaying $24.12 for it.\n  Here is the sterile saline solution I talked about. Medicare is \npaying $7.90 for it; the same item, the Veterans Administration is \npaying $2.38 for it.\n  Why? Why would the Veterans' Administration pay $25.40 for a walker \nthat Medicare is paying $75 for? Same item, same town. Why? Because the \nVeterans' Administration is engaging in good old-fashioned competitive \nbidding. If you want to sell it, put out a bid for what you are selling \nit for, we will take the lowest bid. That is why Medicare pays bloated \nprices based on historical charges and the VA, which has much less \npurchasing power than Medicare, puts it out for both quality and cost \ncontrol. So the Veterans' Administration is able to save money, because \nthey use competitive bidding to assure it is getting the best rate \npossible.\n  Right now, under law, Medicare is prohibited--prohibited--from using \nthis measure. Medicare is prohibited from engaging in competitive \nbidding. But the bill before us now gives them that much-needed \nauthority. It doesn't mandate it. I think we ought to mandate it, but \nthe bill at least gives HCFA the authority to engage in competitive \nbidding.\n  In the hearings that I have held in the past, Mr. Vladeck, the \nAdministrator of HCFA, has testified that if given the authority, they \nwould use it. So I think this will be sufficient and will get the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to start engaging in competitive \nbidding.\n  Another important reform that is in this bill is the streamlining of \nMedicare's authority to reduce grossly excessive payment for items it \npurchases. It is called the inherent reasonableness authority. Under \ncurrent law, the authority is tortuous to complete. As a result, it has \nonly been used once.\n  Three years ago, we found that Medicare was paying up to $211 for a \nhome diabetes monitor. At that time, I sent a staff person of mine out \nto the local K-mart and bought the same item for $49.99 that Medicare \nwas paying $211 for.\n  After several hearings, we got Medicare to begin the process of using \ntheir authority, the authority that they call inherent reasonableness \nauthority. We got them to use that to reduce this gross overpayment for \nthese blood glucose monitors. It took them 2 full years to go through \nall of the hurdles set up in the law. They finally reduced the payment \nto around $50, and that alone is saving taxpayers $25 million over 5 \nyears. But it took 2 years just to get that done. That delay cost \ntaxpayers $10 million.\n  The bill before us includes a streamlining of this process that I \nhave been suggesting for years. It would allow Medicare to respond \nquickly when it finds that it is paying prices that are out of line \nwith what everyone else pays. So I am pleased that this finally is \nbefore this body, and I hope it is agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment that I will be asking to send to \nthe desk, after I give a brief explanation. They are changes that will \nhelp to reduce the massive losses due to waste, fraud, and abuse. All \nof these are based on reports and recommendations by the General \nAccounting Office and the inspector general of Health and Human \nServices. I don't believe it will be controversial to anyone, and I \nhope it will be accepted by the managers of the bill.\n  First of all, Mr. President, the first part of the amendment has to \ndo with improving information to beneficiaries. Under current law, \nbeneficiaries are sent a statement, an explanation of charges and \npayments. They are brief\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\nsummaries of the actual bills and payments. There are several \nshortcomings of these current statements that are sent to \nbeneficiaries. The first thing that you will notice, if you look at a \nstatement, it says in big bold letters: ``This is not a bill.''\n  So you are an elderly person, you get this, it says, ``This is not a \nbill.'' Hey, I get a lot of things in the mail that is not a bill. I'm \nnot going to worry about it. So many beneficiaries don't take the time \nto examine them for the mistakes. In addition, the statements do not \nprovide the number of the toll-free hot line operated by the Medicare \ncontractor to receive reports of errors or fraud or abuse. Finally, \nthere is no requirement that beneficiaries can get copies of complete \nitemized bills submitted by providers.\n  So what my amendment does is it requires that each explanation of \nbenefits sent to beneficiaries, including the statement, because \nbilling errors do occur and there is significant waste, fraud, and \nabuse, that the beneficiary should carefully review the statement for \nerrors or other questionable billings and report those to Medicare.\n  It also requires that the statement include the toll-free hotline \nnumber to report the suspected problems. These toll-free lines already \nexist. I am not setting anything up that does not exist. They already \nexist, but many seniors do not know about it. All I am saying is, the \nphone number ought to be put on the statement of benefits.\n  My amendment provides that a beneficiary may, if they request, be \nprovided an itemized bill within 30 days of their request when the \nbeneficiary suspects irregularities from having read the summary \nprovided to them.\n  My amendment also requires that any specific allegations of errors or \nother problems made by beneficiaries based on a review of the itemized \nbill be reviewed and any appropriate recoveries made for the trust \nfund.\n  Second, Mr. President, Medicare payments are supposed to be limited \nto those that are reasonable, necessary, and related to patient care. \nThat is the law, and those are the regulations. However, while most \nother Federal agencies specifically prohibit indirect cost allowances \nfor gifts, entertainment expenses, education costs for spouses and \ndependents, Medicare does not prohibit this.\n  In addition, Medicare does not explicitly prohibit indirect cost \nreimbursement for fines and other penalties imposed by Federal, State, \nor local governments on health care providers. As such, providers can \nescape a fine by simply charging them back to Medicare. Well, as \ndocumented by the General Accounting Office and the Office of Inspector \nGeneral, this lack of clarity in Medicare policy invites confusion and \nabuse.\n  For example, a report by the Office of Inspector General found that \nMedicare had been billed for a portion of the cost of a sailing regatta \nfor hospital employees, reimbursement for ballet tickets, reimbursement \nfor Tiffany crystal pitchers, reimbursement even for a trip to Italy to \ninspect a piece of art for an executive office.\n  This amendment explicitly prohibits Medicare reimbursement for \nindirect costs related to entertainment, gifts, donations, personal use \nof motor vehicles, costs for fines and penalties, and tuition for \nspouses or dependents of health care providers. In other words, it \nbrings it into line with other Federal law.\n  The next part of my amendment goes to the losses due to frequently \nabused items. Currently under the law, the Secretary may--may; does not \nsay ``shall''--may make a list of medical supply and equipment items \nthat she finds to be frequently subject to unnecessary utilization. In \nother words, you see something popping up all the time, it keeps being \nutilized, well, the Secretary may develop a list of suppliers found to \nhave business practices that result in a pattern of utilization.\n  So the Secretary's power is she may. The Secretary has failed to use \nthis authority, thereby missing potential for significant savings. I do \nnot mean to point at this Secretary. The Secretary before this one did \nnot use it either. And therein lies the problem.\n  My amendment simply changes the word ``may'' to ``shall'' and \nrequires the Secretary to develop the list of overutilized medical \nsupply items and questionable suppliers.\n  Lastly, in OBRA 1993, it provided for certain medical supplies, \nincluding surgical dressings, to be reimbursed based on a fee schedule. \nAs a result, providers must submit to fiscal intermediaries claims that \nitemize the specific supplies and quantities billed. However, this \nprovision does not apply to items billed by home health care agencies. \nSo since 1993, for certain medical supplies, like surgical dressings, \nreimbursed on a fee schedule, it does not apply to home health \nagencies.\n\n  Now, in addition, current law prohibits the Secretary--prohibits the \nSecretary--from using her inherent reasonableness authority to reduce \ngrossly excessive payment rates for surgical dressings. Why that was \nleft out we do not know, but it was left out.\n  The General Accounting Office has documented that these two \nexceptions to Medicare law result in considerable unnecessary losses. \nThey found, for example, that items as diverse as pacemakers were being \nbilled as medical supplies, and those claims were paid because Medicare \ndoes not know what specific items they are being billed for.\n  In addition, the GAO found that payments for surgical dressings could \nbe reduced by half if more reasonable prices were paid. For example, \nthey found that Medicare pays $2.32 for a gauze pad whose wholesale \nprice is 19 cents and that another Government agency buys for 4 cents, \nin this case the Veterans' Administration. Again, Medicare is paying \n$2.32 for a gauze pad; the VA is paying 4 cents for the same one.\n  My amendment would say the home health agencies would be required to \nsubmit to fiscal intermediaries claims that itemize the specific \nsupplies and the quantities billed for surgical dressings. All other \nproviders are currently required to do the same, but not home health \nagencies. Mine would just bring the home health agencies in under this \numbrella.\n  Finally, the loophole that for some reason is there that excludes \nsurgical dressings from the Secretary's inherent reasonableness \nauthority would be closed. She would have that authority to pay on a \nreasonable basis, to get that down to the same level that the Veterans' \nAdministration is paying.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be asking unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and lay down my amendment. We are now discussing \nit with the Finance Committee. I am hopeful it can be cleared without \nthe need for a vote in the next day or two.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 428\n\n        (Purpose: To reduce health care fraud, waste, and abuse)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the \npending amendment laid aside so that I may lay down my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I need you to further agree, if \nyou would please, that we can, with the assurance that your amendment \nwill be placed in a stacked order to leave us the range of offering the \ntwo major committee amendments first. They are going to be offered this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then we will stack them, and perhaps yours will be the \nthird or fourth. But you will get it in that manner.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that sufficient for you to understand the unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands the request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are working with the Finance Committee. What I \nsuggested I hope will be accepted in the next day or two.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You are going to work with them on that account, right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have you sent your amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes; I sent it to the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is time still reserved in opposition to it. We \nhave not yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands.\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will probably need a couple minutes, so let us leave \nit to the reservation time. And he has time, too.\n  Should the clerk report his amendment so it will be ready?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  Would that be agreeable?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That would be satisfactory, so long as it is \nunderstood, I say to the Senator, that it may be the fourth, fifth, but \nit will be in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 429\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the imposition of a \n               copayment for part B home health services)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment for \nmyself and Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 429.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 5362.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager.\n  As I understand the procedure that we are following now, amendments \nare being sent in and there will be an order that will be worked out by \nthe managers, both the Republican manager and the Democratic manager, \nso that there will be time so that Members will know when the vote will \nbe expected. As I understand from the previous discussions, there is \nthe best expectation it will be sometime either in the morning or in \nthe early afternoon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would not, in cooperating with the managers, \nobviously, take much additional time. I would like to be able to at \nleast preserve some time to allow for a brief comment. But I will \nfollow our leaders on these issues, and try to ensure we are able to \nmove in an expeditious way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Kennedy just yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My impression, with a brief observation, is that the \namendment is subject to a point of order. There is no intention at this \npoint in any discussion to in any way waive points of order against the \namendment if they lie.\n  Is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The points of order are not made by these \narrangements.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Kennedy, each amendment has an hour on \neach side, and I am not attempting to change that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. Good. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think tomorrow we will narrow it down.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will cooperate with the floor managers.\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We believe this is in order. But we will have an \nopportunity to address that issue at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment to strike \nthe new copayment for Medicare's home health patients. Without warning, \nthe Finance Committee has imposed a tax on America's seniors of nearly \n$5 billion in new copayments for part B home health services.\n  This cruel and unexpected provision, which was not debated or voted \non in the committee and is not necessary to meet the committee's \nreconciliation targets, will fall primarily on the oldest, poorest, and \nsickest Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Let me repeat that. The nearly $5 billion that is raised by this \nprovision is not necessary to meet the requirements of the budget \nagreement. Nonetheless, it was put into the agreement. Why? The best \nestimate is that those will be used for tax reductions, perhaps for the \nwealthier individuals.\n  I am sure that some in the Senate will justify to the American people \nthis change and the other dangerous proposals in this bill by claiming \nthey are needed to preserve Medicare for future generations. This could \nnot be further from the truth.\n  As I understand, the agreement worked out in the bipartisan budget \nnegotiations was to stabilize the Medicare trust fund for at least 10 \nyears and to establish a commission that will make recommendations to \npreserve Medicare for the future.\n  The proposal we are debating now does neither of these things. It \nestablishes a $5 copay that will affect the oldest, the sickest, and \nthe poorest senior citizens. This provision preys primarily on the \nelderly women who are dependent upon Medicare and the home health care \nsystem.\n  The assault on Medicaid that began last Congress is continuing with \nfull force. Congress should reject this just as we rejected it last \nyear. There is no rationalization, none whatsoever, for Congress to \nrush forward with ill-considered changes in Medicare under the thinly \nveiled pretext of balancing the Federal budget. None of these basic \nchanges in Medicare were part of the budget agreement.\n  It is the height of hypocrisy for those who voted against including \nthe Hatch-Kennedy children's health plan in the agreement last month to \nmake this assault on Medicare part of the agreement this month.\n  When we brought that measure up here, we were told that this is going \nto break the budget agreement, even though it is completely paid for. \nNow, we have before us a plan to collect $5 billion in copays from \nelderly widows and the poorest in our society. Under this proposal, we \nwould collect $5 billion that is not even necessary to meet the terms \nof the budget agreement.\n  In 1996, Mr. President, Medicare beneficiaries spent an average of \n$2,605 on health care. However, the sicker seniors spent $5,600 out of \ntheir own pockets for cost-sharing related only to Medicare coverage \nservices. Now the Senate Finance Committee is asking them to spend up \nto $760 more.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues are interested in increasing \ncost sharing because they feel it would lead to a reduction in \nutilization and, therefore, a reduction in Medicare spending. It is \nimportant to note, however, that cost-sharing is a blunt tool to \nexpress change. It may reduce utilization but the goal is to reduce \nunnecessary utilization. It is almost certain this policy will fail to \nmeet this objective.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that home health services were exempted \nfrom part B coinsurance in 1972 to encourage use of less costly \nnoninstitutionalized services. Reimposing a copayment will undermine \nthat effort. We removed cost-sharing requirements on home health care \nin 1972 specifically to reduce utilization, to the extent that we could \nin an appropriate health context, of services in acute hospitals and in \nhigh-cost medical delivery systems. We wanted to encourage the \nprovision of home health care, which provides very important services \nand does so less expensively than in acute care settings.\n  It was the belief at that time, and it is my belief now, that \nburdensome cost-sharing can seriously threaten the health of the frail \nelderly, particularly those who are hard pressed to make ends meet. \nImposing a $5 new copayment will reduce access for those who need the \nservices the most. If we are interested in reducing home health care \nutilization we ought to first look at ways to alter the behavior of \nproviders, as we have done in the bill's proposed payment reform, \nbefore forcing the sickest beneficiaries to pay more.\n  Mr. President, just a few moments ago we had some excellent \ncommentary from Marian Brown, an 82-year-old widow who lives \nindependently in Marlow Heights, MD. She has numerous health ailments \nand is confined to a wheelchair. She is treated three times a week by a \nhome health aide who tends to her physical troubles, spending 2 to 3 \nhours in her home on each visit. Her annual income is $6,786. She \nsimply cannot afford to spend an additional $15 a week, $60 a month, or \n$720 a year on copayments for these necessary visits. She spoke \narticulately and compellingly about what this particular proposal would \nmean to her. She has difficulty with her hip, but doctors do not want \nto operate because of a serious heart condition. Yet her hip prevents \nher from being able to move in and out of the bathtub. It prevents her \nfrom being able to wash her own feet.\n  She is a very proud individual who takes great delight in living \nwhere she does with her friends and associates, and has a great sense \nof joy about her and in her optimism about the future. She is not \nasking for very much. She is just saying, ``I can just about make ends \nmeet now, but, if you pass this copayment, I will have to give up \nstretching exercises to keep me from further disability, or the ability \nto be able to get out of bed and get dressed and cleaned up in a manner \nthat allows me to retain my sense of respect and dignity and self-value \nand joy, or cut back on prescription drugs or food or heating of my \napartment during the winter.'' She makes that case, Mr. President.\n  We have to ask ourselves what was the sense of urgency in this \nlegislation. Those funds were not even needed in terms of balancing the \nbudget. We ought to look at all the provisions--not only of this bill, \nwhich is the cutting of the spending programs--but also in the tax \nbill, to see who will benefit, where the pain is coming, where the \nfairness is.\n  I daresay I think those in the majority will be hard pressed at the \nend of the day to think that this kind of financial burden and \nanxiety--even though these are only $5 payments that the individual \nwill have to pay--that ought to be used to balance the budget. The \namendment that I offer, joined by Senator Wellstone, will give the \nopportunity for the Senate to go on record opposing this proposal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this new copayment will be an unfunded \nmandate on the States. I ask for the attention of our colleagues who \nare so concerned about unfunded mandates on the States. Medicare \nbeneficiaries who qualify for assistance from State Medicaid programs \nhave higher use of home health care services. In fact, the very \npoorest, who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, are twice as \nlikely as other Medicare beneficiaries to use the home health benefits. \nAs a result, State Medicaid programs will have to absorb the new \ncopayments for these beneficiaries.\n\n  CBO estimates, Mr. President, that the additional State and local \ncosts of home health copayment would amount to $700 million over the \nnext 5 years. I hope we are going to have the time and opportunity to \nhear the rationale and justification for this misguided proposal. \nStates are usually quite clear in their opposition to unfunded \nmandates.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is still one of the most successful social \nprograms ever enacted. It has brought health care and health security \nto tens of millions of senior citizens. We can deal with the financial \nproblems of Medicare but we must do it the right way, not the wrong \nway.\n  Our goal is to save Medicare, not destroy it. Our priority should be \nto keep the promise of medical and financial security for senior \ncitizens that Medicare provides. We are the guardians of that promise \nand we should oppose any schemes that violate it.\n  There is no question that Medicare will face serious challenges in \nthe next century as a result of the retirement of\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nthe baby-boom generation. Today there are nearly four adults of working \nage for every senior citizen. By the year 2030, that ratio will be down \nto two workers for every senior citizen. There is a right way and a \nwrong way to respond to that challenge, and the wrong way is to destroy \nthe program under the guise of saving it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to strike these unfair and unnecessary \nprovisions from the reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague from \nMassachusetts for being on the alert here. I worked very hard with my \ndistinguished chairman from the Budget Committee to try and assemble a \nconsensus agreement that we could all support, and suddenly now we are \noffered a change and that change says, ``Well, senior citizens who have \nhome health care pay $5.'' It sounds trivial almost, but Mr. President, \nwhen we have someone who needs sometimes two, sometimes three visits a \nday to keep them going, $100 a week, when the average for many of these \npeople, whose income is $15,000 a year or less--you get up to $3,000, \n$4,000, or $5,000 a year, that is torment. That takes away their very \nlife sustenance because they cannot afford the rent, they cannot afford \nthe heat, they cannot afford the nutrition.\n  On top of that, to impose this new burden, I say, Mr. President, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is always on the lookout for a balance in \nour society to try and provide equal service to those who need help--\nthe promise for the future, an education for their children--Senator \nKennedy is always there. In this case I must tell you, I heartily agree \nwith him.\n  The target group are people, usually women, 75 on balance in years, \nwith incomes of under $15,000. They are old, very often frail, sick \npeople who do not take home health care if they can get out of their \nhomes, if they have any mobility, if they have any opportunity to go \nvisit the doctor. These are often critical, life-sustaining services \nthat they need.\n  Some argue, Mr. President, that most people subject to this copayment \nwill not really pay because they have Medigap policies that cover \ncopayments and deductibles. That is misleading because a new copayment \nwould lead to increased Medigap premiums. So seniors would either have \nto pay the new copayment or their insurance bills would go up. Either \nway, the bottom line would be higher out-of-pocket costs. Already, \nseniors typically pay more than 20 percent of their income on these \ncosts.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, unfunded mandates, States \nwill have to come up with $700 million, I think is the figure the \nSenator used. This is not a particularly good way to get this bill back \non track, especially when we know immediately hereafter in the next \npart of the reconciliation we will be looking at tax relief for lots of \nfolks who do not need it, who can get by very comfortably without it, \nand here we are talking about $5 out of the pockets of the poverty \nstricken, typically those who need help, and whose only contact often \nwith the outside world is with these groups, and they want to charge \nthem $5 to have somebody come by.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Massachusetts and I support him. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could, and I see Senator Wellstone ready to speak \non this, but just before the Senator sits down, does the Senator \nunderstand what the Finance Committee was doing since this is a benefit \nthat comes from part B. They are using the deductible limit in A which \nis $760, which is a lot more, obviously, than part B which is just \n$100.\n  Here they are taking something which is basically a benefit, they are \ntying it to the higher deductible to make the seniors pay more. I find \nthat somewhat troublesome, as well. It is just a way of maneuvering the \nsystem.\n  I am just wondering if the Senator also is struck by the fact that \nStates are going to be involved in collecting this? Even in the poorest \nof the circumstances, they are going to have a requirement to do so. We \nwill not be helping any of the States to do it. We hear a great deal \nabout mandates around here, I would have thought this would be a matter \nof concern to some of those that were troubled by unfunded mandates.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is correct. The one thing that I found \nmost disturbing about the proposals that have come in the \nreconciliation is the fact that suddenly we are in to a whole new area \nhaving very little to do with the mission that we have set out for us, \nto get a balanced budget, to try at the same time to invest in \neducation, to try at the same time to make sure impoverished senior \ncitizens do not have to pay more as a result of the transfer of home \nhealth services to part B--all of those things.\n  Suddenly, now we are seeing that something might be called bait and \nswitch, where senior citizens are being told now, well, you may have to \npay a higher premium for your part B, your deductible may be going up, \nthat the most modest-income person would have to pay $5, perhaps to get \nan insulin shot or something like that. Five bucks, when you ain't got \nit, to put it crudely, is an awful lot of money. These people do not \nhave it. They do not have contact with the outside world. They are \nfrail, they are elderly. For God's sake, where is our conscience on \nthese things?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the statement that the Senator makes is \nenormously important, since he is the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. As I understand what he is saying, this was not part of the \nbudget agreement. We do not need that $5 billion to meet the terms of \nthe budget agreement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Also this was not voted on specifically in the Finance \nCommittee, and it is not necessary to balance the budget. It was added \non in the Finance Committee, as I understand, without even an up-or-\ndown vote, and here we are faced with the fact that millions of our \nseniors will be faced with this issue unless we move to strike it on \nthe floor.\n  Now, since I have the Senator's attention, am I correct in my \nunderstanding that $1.5 billion in premium assistance for low-income \nbeneficiaries was included in the agreement?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, that is true. That was designed originally to \npay, through Medicaid, for those who were up to 150 percent of poverty, \nany increase in premium that might occur.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So the agreement included $1.5 billion to offset that \nincreased premium, but it was not done under the Finance Committee's \nbill, am I correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So this bill has short-changed low-income senior \ncitizens $1.5 billion, and then asked them to pay $5 billion on top of \nthat. And then created an MSA demonstration, which is going to cost \nabout $400 million. We already have an MSA demonstration project.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Not for the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. My point exactly. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill created a \ndemonstration for those in the private market. We ought to first \nevaluate that proposal, on which we are already spending nearly $1.5 \nbillion, before doling out scarce Medicare funds in a wild experiment \nsure to benefit only insurance companies and the healthy and wealthy.\n  And then we are going to return to the days of balanced billing. \nCertain private plan options will allow doctors to overcharge, or \nbalance bill. We have, over a long period of time, prohibited Medicare \nproviders from balanced billing and encouraged them to take Medicare \npayment as payment in full. Releasing these important consumer \nprotections will undoubtably force seniors to pay more. It doesn't take \nany stretch of the imagination--and I ask my friend and colleague if he \nwould agree with me--to envision doctors moving out of Medicare to form \none of these private plans and invite their Medicare patients to ``come \ninto our program.'' Seniors will follow their doctors and find \nthemselves being overcharged in those circumstances. That is what \nhappened in the past. Is the Senator concerned about that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. They are going to have to pay additional funds \nfor services that, otherwise, they might not. And it's true that, in \nthe past, we have not permitted the so-called balanced billing, which \nsimply says the service was advertised or\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\ntalked about at this level and now it is at a higher level, so you are \ngoing to get a bill for it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Was that in the budget agreement? Balanced billing was \ndebated last year, in the last Congress here, and we were given \nassurances that it wasn't going to be part of the budget agreement when \nwe were talking then. I don't remember much discussion about that prior \nto the time that we voted on this issue here. I think that what is \nimportant here--we have not even talked about the issue of the part B \ndeductible and what that will mean to seniors and the additional out-\nof-pocket expenses they will have in that area--is that these \nprovisions are going to have a dramatic adverse impact on seniors, and \nit was not mandated in the budget agreement. This is all in \nanticipation of a commission that the bill sets up to try and review \nthe Medicare system for the future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may ask the Senator a question, this isn't, I \ntake it, your idea of a particularly good way to make reforms in \nsomething as complicated as Medicare, and I could not agree with you \nmore. This is fast-track legislation, which means--for those who are \nnot familiar with the terminology--that this is supposed to zip through \nthis place. This was not part of the consensus agreement we labored \nover for months in order to strike a budget agreement that could pass \nmuster and would be a consensus bill. This now is recommended by the \nFinance Committee in terms of their reconciliation on expenditures.\n  I have been a loyal trooper in defending the consensus agreement. But \nthis, in my view, is certainly outside the pale. I am not any happier \nthan the Senator is.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that. We will have a chance to address \nthese in accordance with the way the amendment process goes during the \nnext couple of days. I am very grateful for the Senator's comments \nbecause I think it is important, as we address these issues, not to \nconfuse what is necessary to preserve the financial integrity of the \nMedicare system--as this bill does for at least 10 years--with these \nother proposals that could destroy it. I daresay that those additional \ncosts to seniors will reflect themselves by the end of the week, along \nwith the additional tax relief for very wealthy individuals and \ncorporations.\n\n  I daresay I was so interested when my friend, the majority leader, \nwas talking about how the amendment that Senator Hatch and I offered to \nextend health insurance to children would be a budget buster because it \nis financed by an increase on the cigarette tax. And then the Finance \nCommittee, with his support, turned right around and offered a 20-cent \nper pack cigarette tax increase. It's only a small part of it, but it \nis amazing the way all of this is being proposed.\n  I thank my colleague and friend from New Jersey for his response. He \nhas been a leader in terms of responsible economic policy and has a \nchallenging position in representing our side through these \nnegotiations. We have great respect for someone who understands this \nprocess so well. I am grateful for his response. I thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Wellstone, also, for his strong support for this \nparticular amendment.\n  How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I am prepared to \nyield as much time as the Senator from Minnesota needs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think I have time on my own, is that correct, Mr. \nPresident, on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 33 \nmore minutes on his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see both the manager on his feet and also I have my \nfriend and colleague who wanted to speak. The floor manager is perhaps \nthe busiest person. I want to be accommodating to him. Otherwise, I \nwill yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to put this in a \nlittle bit of context. There was a piece today in the New York Times \nheadlined, ``Study Shows Tax Proposal Would Benefit the Wealthy.'' This \nis when we get to the tax part of the reconciliation bill.\n  I quote:\n\n       The changes in Federal tax and benefit policies now working \n     their way through Congress would eventually be worth \n     thousands of dollars a year to the 5 million wealthiest \n     families in America, while the 40 million families with the \n     lowest incomes would actually lose money, a new study shows.\n\n  This is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Their work, \ngenerally respected in academic circles, indicates that after-tax \nincomes of the richest 1 percent of Americans--those with incomes above \n$300,000 a year for a family of three--would ultimately be increased by \nan average of $27,000 a year.\n  ``Families of three with incomes below about $17,000 a year would end \nup with about $60 a year less than they have now.''\n  Mr. President, let me just say that, in this context, I know \ncolleagues worked very hard in the Finance Committee, and I also know \npeople were up very late, and we did not have a chance to study every \nparticular proposal. The copay for home health services makes no sense \nat all. This proposal is profoundly mistaken.\n  I am very proud to support Senator Kennedy's amendment. Sixty-six \npercent of the recipients of home health services are over the age of \n75; 43 percent of them have incomes under $10,000 a year; 66 percent \nare women and 33 percent live alone. As Senator Lautenberg pointed out, \na $5 copay may not sound like much to people who have pretty high \nincomes, and it may not sound like much to those of us in the Senate, \nbecause we earn a fair amount of income; but to people living on maybe \n$500 a month, and that's it, this $5 copay for a home health visit is \nreally worry about it. I am hoping that we will have very strong \nsupport here on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that part of the direction of where we are \nheading in health care--and I wish there had been more discussion. Part \nof the problem is that these reconciliation bills that are fast-tracked \ndon't give us much of an opportunity to really talk about policy and \nits impact on people's lives. Too much of the discussion is adding and \nsubtracting numbers. Too much of the discussion is statistics. I don't \nthink we are looking at some of these proposals--I am not saying all of \nthem--very carefully. To that extent, some of the things in this bill \nare a rush to recklessness, which I think this is.\n  Mr. President, if anything, we want to make sure that as many elderly \npeople as possible--or, for that matter, people with disabilities--can \nlive at home with dignity. That is what we are trying to do. And what \nwe are doing here is, we are saying to senior citizens--especially low-\nincome, and the income profile of elderly people is not that high--we \nare saying, you know, we are going to start charging a $5 copay. And \nfor a lot of these people, this isn't going to work. What is going to \nhappen is, they are not going to get the help they need; it is that \nsimple.\n  I don't think this amendment is about party strategy or taking shots \nat somebody. I don't think it is about any of that. This amendment \nspeaks to a policy discussion that I don't think we have had. I \nactually think that is part of the problem. I just think it is hard to \ndo that on these bills. But this particular proposal--on this provision \nthat was put in by the Finance Committee, I don't think there was an \nup-or-down vote. I think it was part of an overall chairman's mark. I \nthink it is profoundly mistaken. I just think it was a mistake. I don't \nthink this is the way we need to be generating revenue. This is not the \nplace where we want to make the cuts.\n  I could carry on, and I will later on by marshaling a lot of evidence \nabout the tax part, which I still think is way too tilted to those at \nthe top. But for right now, let me simply say, since we are talking \nabout Medicare, let me enter into a policy discussion and just say to \nall Senators--Democrats and Republicans alike--I hope there will be \nstrong support for this amendment that Senator Kennedy has introduced \nand that I am a cosponsor of. In this particular case, it is not a \nmatter of numbers. You are really talking about a provision or proposal \nthat could have a very, very negative impact on some of the most \nvulnerable citizens in this country. I don't think there is one Senator \nin here who wants to do that.\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\n  Now, if there are some alternatives and other proposals, fine. But \nthis was a mistake. We ought not to be doing this $5 copay on home \nhealth visits for very elderly people, most of them very vulnerable, \nmost of them very low-income.\n  So I rise to speak on behalf of this amendment. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor, and I hope we will get a tremendous amount of \nsupport for it tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I should note that the members of the \nFinance Committee who support the proposal that is here before us will \nbe here tomorrow to debate the issue.\n  Senator Roth is here now. I assume he will present his amendment and \nnot argue against the Kennedy amendment, but I assume in due course \nthere will be adequate opportunity to present the views.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would like to make a comment or two on the question----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the question of the Kennedy amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course I will yield whatever time the Senator \ndesires.\n  Mr. ROTH. The problem that has been faced in Medicare is the \nexplosion of costs in home health care. It has been going up something \nlike 30 percent a year. Obviously, that kind of increase cannot be \npermitted if we are going to salvage and strengthen the Medicare \nProgram.\n  Just let me point out that Medicare spending on home health services \nincreased most dramatically in the last decade. In 1989-90, it went up \n53 percent; 1990-91, it went up 44 percent; 1991-92, it went up 40 \npercent again; 1992-93, 30 percent; 1993-94, 30 percent; 1994-95, 19 \npercent. So, basically, it has been going up roughly 30 percent.\n  There has been an increase in beneficiaries using home health care. \nThere has been an increase in the number of visits per beneficiary. \nThere has been an increase in the number of agencies providing care. So \nthe payment system has not controlled the utilization of home care. \nThere is the reason that we have put this $5 copayment.\n  Let me point out that it is particularly important to understand that \nthose who are 100 percent of poverty or less will have this $5 fee paid \nby Medicaid. So those who are under poverty are protected.\n  And that is the idea of the program. We want those who are over 100 \npercent of poverty to be careful in their utilization. The program is \nthere. It is a good program. In many cases, it can save money because \nit is better to have home health care than to put a person into a \nhospital.\n  But the problem is that the costs have exploded. Somehow we have to \nmake sure that the beneficiaries are more careful in their utilization \nof this program. And that is the reason for this change.\n  Again, I want to stress the fact that those who are 100 percent of \npoverty or less will have this copayment of $5 paid by Medicaid. And \nthey will not be out of pocket. So they are protected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve 5 minutes of my time, and then I want to \nyield to Senator Roth if he is ready to offer the amendment.\n  Let me just make a couple of points. Obviously, the seniors in the \ncountry, and even the AARP--not specifically with reference to this $5 \ndeductible, but with reference to home health care--there was a general \nunderstanding that when we moved a part of home health care from the \ntrust fund to the part B, which is paid for by the general taxpayers, \nworking men and women with kids who do not have any insurance and \nnobody gives them any, when we moved it to the general fund and the \nratio of payment was 25 percent for seniors and 75 percent for the rest \nof the taxpayers, that in exchange for moving the home health care to \nthat part B, there would be some additional fee.\n  I am not arguing that every fee that was imposed--it seems like there \nwere two--that those were agreed upon, nor am I speaking for anyone \nwhose name I just used. But, obviously, the agreement contemplated that \nif we moved part of some or all of that home health care that was under \n100 days, it more likely belonged with a doctor instead of with the \nhospital, that there would be some additional premium paid into the \npart B, the 25 to 75 ratio that I have just described.\n\n  Second, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, raised $1.5 \nbillion on the agreement, and says that when the new fee is imposed we \nwill use $1.5 billion to accommodate the lower income seniors so they \nwon't be burdened by the new fee. I understand the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, when he offers a broad amendment in \nsome other areas, is going to take that $1.5 billion into cognizance \nand do something about rectifying what is clearly a misunderstanding \nand a shortcoming in the Finance Committee bill vis-a-vis the \nagreement.\n  With reference to the agreement that we worked out, it is clear that \nthere is no restriction on the Finance Committee or any other committee \nto do more than contemplated in the agreement. So we cannot look to the \nagreement every time a committee does something. What we do is we look \nat it to make sure they did at least as much as we asked. And, in the \ncase of the issue before us, I understand it was almost unanimous in \nthe committee.\n  You all can argue that as a committee later this evening or tomorrow. \nThis was not all Republicans. It was Republicans, and all the Democrats \nsupported the fact that something had to be done about these spiraling \ncosts of home health care. Am I somewhat correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would just point out that the Senator is absolutely \ncorrect. The proposal was adopted unanimously by the committee, both \nDemocrat and Republican. As I said, it was done in such a way as to try \nto make the beneficiaries be more careful in its utilization.\n  I would point out that the question was raised, why did we use the \n$760 limitation? The reason for that is that under part A, many people, \nafter being in a hospital for 3 days, will utilize home health care. \nThey do not pay the $5 fee, but instead they pay $760. So that was the \nceiling that was set under part A, and we carried that over to part B. \nThere the beneficiary pays $5 per visit but not in excess of $760.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might inquire for my own management \nreasons. I understand that the Senator is working on two amendments \nfrom the committee that he would like to get in today before we close. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct. We are waiting for certain figures from \nthe Congressional Budget Office. As soon as we have those, we expect to \nbe in a position to offer those amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might that be relatively soon?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is my understanding, I say to the distinguished \nchairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kennedy, I see, is still on the floor. I wonder \nif I might ask a question regarding some management aspects.\n  What we have been doing is, we haven't been finishing the debates on \nany of these amendments, and we are holding them until tomorrow and \nwill be stacking the amendments in managementwise sequence. I myself am \nvery desirous of leaving the Senate shortly and leaving it to Senator \nRoth to offer two additional amendments, and perhaps the Senator from \nMinnesota wanted to offer one more. And that would be all we would do \nthis evening.\n  How much more time would the Senator like to use this evening?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would just make a brief comment, maybe 5 or 7 minutes, \nperhaps.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senators respond that there has been \nan increase in the utilization of home health care. Well, it isn't the \npatient who says, ``Look, I want to go home instead of going to the \nhospital.'' The person that does that is the doctor.\n  If you have problems with overutilization, do something about the \nprovider but not the patient. The patient follows what the doctor \nrecommends. If the provider says either you have to go\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\nto the hospital or we can take care of this back home, it isn't the \npatient that is overutilizing. They are responding to options \nprescribed by the medical profession. So we shouldn't penalize our \nsenior citizens and our frail senior citizens for behavior they can't \nnecessarily modify.\n\n  There are those who say, ``Look, Medicaid will take care of the costs \nof the poorest seniors.'' That may be true, first of all, if the \nbeneficiaries know about the financial assistance. But we see many \npeople fall through the cracks because they are not aware of this \nassistance. Some estimates indicate that only 10 percent of eligible \nsenior citizens take advantage of this offer. And, basically, you are \ntalking about individuals whose income rests near $7,700. So, even if \nthose in poverty may be taken care of by Medicaid, what do we do about \nthe near poor?\n  What about the senior citizen whose income is $8,000? What about the \nsenior citizen whose income is $9,000, $10,000, $11,000, $12,000? We \nare asking them to pay up to $760 more this year, and the cap will rise \neach year according to the rise in the inpatient hospital deductible. \nFor what reason? It was never explained to us. It was never voted on.\n  With all respect to the deliberations of the Finance Committee, this \nwasn't even debated.\n  Here we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 5 o'clock, with an \nhour's debate on something that is going to affect millions of elderly, \nfrail senior citizens, many of whom are widows between 75 and 80 years \nold. Look at the profile of who is going to be affected by this.\n  It wasn't even discussed. We weren't voting and saying, ``Look, vote \nfor this because we are going to collect $5 on the frail elderly.'' To \nhelp pay for what? For a tax break.\n  We wouldn't be having this debate if it were not for the tax break \nfor wealthy individuals. The reason we are having this is because of \nthe next bill that we are going to consider provides tax breaks for \nwealthy individuals. The Finance Committee has said ``We need to \nsqueeze the elderly.'' Otherwise, we wouldn't have this debate.\n  No one was saying at the beginning of the session, we really have to \ngo out and stop our elderly from overutilizing health care services. No \none said, by God, one of the real problems we are facing in this \ncountry is to get those frail seniors to pay more so they won't use it. \nNo, no, no. That wasn't even talked about by the proponents of the \nbalanced budget.\n  Who are the people now that use the home health services? Sixty-six \npercent are over 75 years of age. Almost half of them have incomes \nbelow $10,000. Sixty-six percent are women, and 33 percent live alone.\n  So there you have it. You are talking about women 75 to 80 years old. \nYou are talking about those with incomes of $7,000, $8,000, $9,000, or \n$10,000, that need these home health services to stay out of the \nhospital. That saves our health care system a great deal.\n  This comes at the same time that the Finance Committee ignored \ninstructions to honor a clear commitment to provide $1.5 billion in \npremium assistance for low-income elderly.\n  Time is not going to erase this injustice. You can say that the clock \nwill be tolled at noontime on Wednesday, but it is not going to erase \nthe fact that in that bill tonight frail seniors are required to pay $5 \nbillion more, that the $1.5 billion to defray premiums for low-income \nseniors is nowhere to be found, and that the bill costs Medicare $400 \nmillion in trial MSA's.\n  This is where we are. This is where we come in order to have a \nbalanced budget? In order to have tax breaks of billions of dollars--\nbillions of dollars--just 3 days from now.\n  That is the dichotomy here. This is the light Republican effort. Last \nyear, we had the major Medicare cuts for major tax breaks and now we \nhave smaller cuts to see how much they can get away with. You only have \n20 hours on the floor of the Senate for this bill. The majority has \ndecided to see what it can get away with in this first bill, and then \nmove to provide the goodies later in the week.\n  This is a bad deal. This is a bad deal for senior citizens. It is a \nbad deal for parents. It is a bad deal for aunts and uncles. It is a \nbad deal for children. And at the end of the week, we are going to see \nthe distribution of these tax breaks going, again, to the upper \nincomes.\n  It is absolutely, fundamentally wrong, and we are not going to let \nthis go along without getting rollcall votes and having Members make a \njudgment and decision on those items so that they will hear it when \nthey go back to their constituents and the elderly people and answer to \nthem why they wanted to move ahead in that direction. It is wrong.\n  We will continue this debate tomorrow. Mr. President, I withhold the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself such time as I may take. I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia I will be brief so that he can \nbe recognized.\n  Again, I want to emphasize what the factual situation is. The fact is \nthat home health care has been exploding at roughly 30 percent a year \nor more, and this kind of increase in cost cannot be permitted if we \nare going to strengthen and preserve Medicare for the long term. So the \nproposal has been made to put a $5 copayment fee on each health care up \nto a limitation of $760, which is what is paid as a deductible under \npart A.\n  This matter was discussed and unanimously agreed to in the Finance \nCommittee by Republicans and Democrats alike. The reason it was agreed \nto is because it is important that these visits be available but they \nbe used prudently and not without consideration to the cost. That is \nthe reason we added it.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that those 100 percent under poverty will \nnot pay this $5 fee. It will be paid by Medicaid for them, so they are \nprotected. But again, in reforming and restructuring Medicare, we are \ntrying to do it in such a way that it strengthens and preserves the \nprogram for the long term. That in turn means it is essential that the \nutilization be done carefully, and that is what we seek to do and that \nis what the Finance Committee unanimously adopted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? Are you using the $5 billion for \nother Medicare benefits for our elderly? Are you saying we will use the \n$5 billion raised through the new copayment to try to help the elderly, \nfor example, on prescription drugs, foot care, dental care, or eye \ncare? Are we taking the $5 billion, which you say is a result of \noverutilization, and investing it in the elderly for their health care \nneeds, or are we taking the $5 billion and putting it aside to be used \nfor tax breaks?\n  Mr. ROTH. I point out to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nwe have added a number of preventive services for the sick. For \nexample, we now permit mammography testing to be made, colorectal \ntesting or screening; we also permit diabetes home care matching. So we \nhave added a number of things. But again, overall, we are trying to put \nthis program in such shape that it will survive in the long term. \nUnfortunately, in the area of home health care, the costs have \nexploded. Let me mention again that home health care in 1989-90 went up \n53 percent; 1990-91, it went up 44 percent; 1991-92, 40 percent; 1992-\n93, 30 percent; 30 percent again in 1993 and 1994; 19 percent in 1994 \nand 1995.\n\n  Let me point out further that other groups, such as the Commonwealth \nFund, support the idea of a $5 copay. In a report issued by the \nCommonwealth it says that ``this is a sensible approach which would \nmake beneficiaries sensitive to use but not form a barrier to care.''\n  I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we are going to have a statement \nby the Senator from West Virginia, but the point is that the preventive \nservices, which I commend, were included in the President's proposal \nand are paid for under the budget that had been submitted by the \nPresident.\n  So this investment, while I support it, does not quite jell, because \nthe preventive programs that have been mentioned now were already \nincluded prior to the creation of this new copayment.\n  Second, I did not think we were looking at the overall long-term \nchanges in\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nMedicare. We wanted to get the 10 years of solvency that had been \nsupported by the President and other Members of the Congress and then \ndeal with the long-term issues. I think if the Senator wanted to, we \ncould spend some time looking at the increase of home health care and \nthe decrease in hospitalization.\n  But the bottom line is patients go, by and large, in the health care \nsystem where the doctor tells them. If the doctor tells them, you need \nto get to that hospital tonight, by and large, patients go there. If \nthe doctor says, you need to have those services, by and large, the \npatients get them. When we are talking about individuals who have \nincomes of roughly $7,700 being told they can get an offset in the \nState. We know the number of children, for example, that fall under the \nMedicaid proposals that are not covered by Medicaid. And the seniors \nare facing the same thing.\n  So I just think that, let alone, as the chairman has pointed out, the \nvery poor can get some of this offset or will get it offset in terms of \nthe Medicaid that is requiring the States to collect it. We have heard \na great deal about putting additional burdens on the States, but it \nseems we are willing to do so as long as we get the additional funds \nfor the tax cuts.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his response, and I \nappreciate his courtesy in responding to these questions. I will be \nglad to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak out \nof order for not to exceed 10 minutes without the time being charged to \neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, press reports today from the annual economic \nsummit of the world's major industrial powers in Denver indicate that \nthere was pressure on the United States from some of our allies to make \nnew commitments to deep cutbacks on greenhouse gas emissions, \nspecifically, carbon dioxide emissions. It is unfortunate that some of \nour allies, including the French in particular, chose this forum to \nchange the terms of international dialogue on this issue. I commend \nPresident Clinton for resisting these surprising, new pressure tactics \nto shortcut the progress towards a reasonable solution at Kyoto and to \ntry to force the United States to endorse an immediate commitment to \nunworkable new goals, thereby, shredding the negotiating process. We \nand the French are both part of negotiations intended as a follow-up to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the so-\ncalled Rio Pact, signed in 1992, and approved by the Senate. The Rio \nPact called upon the industrialized nations to aim to reduce their \ngreenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000, a goal \nwhich will not be achieved by the U.S. or by most of the industrialized \nnations.\n  As a result of the failure of most of the industrialized world to \nmeet this voluntary commitment to reduce Carbon dioxide emissions, the \nparties met in Berlin in 1995 to discuss the future direction of the \ntreaty. In Berlin, the United States agreed that new commitments should \nbe binding upon the signatories, but the developing world was excluded \nfrom any new commitments. Unfortunately, excluding the developing \nworld, which will be the most important emitter of carbon dioxide \nemissions by the year 2015, exceeding the emissions of the OECD \nnations, was a mistake. The solution, if it is to be effective, must \ninclude all major emitting nations or it will fail to really get the \nproblem under control. More than that, the perceived unfairness of \nforcing limits on the economies of only some nations, but not others, \nwill cause political pressure to frustrate the approval and \nimplementation of any treaty that is signed in Kyoto this December. The \ntemptations of industries to flee from the U.S. for example, behind the \nsafe non-binding walls of Mexico, for instance, or other developing \nnations, will both frustrate the goals of a treaty and unfairly \npenalize the developed economies.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Hagel, and I authored a Sense of the Senate Resolution indicating \nthat it is imperative for the developing world to be parties to any \nbinding commitments made in Kyoto, that those so-called commitments \nshould demonstrate unequivocally an action program to approach this \nproblem in a realistic way, and that everyone should start with \naggressive efforts to act on those commitments immediately and not \nsettle for vague promises to return to future negotiations to get \nserious. While some countries have different levels of development, \neach must make unique and binding contributions of a kind consistent \nwith their industrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto \nto some manner of binding commitments which would begin at the same \ntime as the developed world with as aggressive and effective a schedule \nas possible given the gravity of the problem and the need for a fair \nsharing of the burden.\n  Mr. President, in Denver during the last two days, some nations put \npressure on the United States to agree to a whole new set of \ncommitments beyond those agreed to in Rio, beyond the target of \nstabilizing at 1990 levels by the year 2010. Those nations sought to \nget the U.S. to agree to a 15 percent reduction by 2010, a level of \nreduction which would have very serious impacts on major sectors of the \nU.S. economy. There were no discussions of bringing the developing \nworld into the play. I highly commend President Clinton for resisting \nthese surprising new pressures to deviate from the Kyoto track, and set \ntargets for very sharp new levels of reductions. Those nations should \nknow that the United States Senate stands strongly behind the President \nin resisting these pressures. Reductions must be fair, well-managed, \nwell-planned, and spread across the globe--spread across the globe. In \naddition, Mr. President, a wide-ranging new set of initiatives is \nneeded to harness technology, to engage in new crash research and \ndevelopment technologies to mitigate the carbon dioxide emissions from \nfossil fuel combustion, as well as new energy efficiency programs, and \ncooperative programs between the developed and developing world. We \nhave only begun to match the targets of carbon dioxide reductions and \nlimitations with our technological genius and to engage in pioneering a \nnew energy frontier type program aimed at using man's genius to tackle \nthis global problem from every conceivable angle.\n  I reiterate, Mr. President, that President Clinton is to be commended \nfor resisting the pressure for these sudden draconian commitments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from New \nMexico so much time as he needs to make his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nhis courtesy, as always.\n  Let me speak for a few moments on a motion, or amendment, that is \ngoing to be offered by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, and myself. This is a motion \nto strike one provision that is in this reconciliation bill which would \nchange the age at which senior citizens become eligible for Medicare. \nIt raises that age from 65 to 67. Our amendment would propose to strike \nthat provision from the reconciliation bill. In my view this is an \nunacceptable provision, it is very misguided, and one that we should \nnot continue to keep in this legislation if we send this legislation on \nthrough the legislative process.\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\n  Mr. President, there are no budgetary savings that would accrue as a \nresult of this provision until the year 2003, after the target date for \nreaching the balanced budget. I am informed that this section would \nfall under the Byrd rule, and for that reason a vote of 60 Senators or \nmore will be required to keep this provision in the bill, so I hope \nthat a substantial majority of the Senate will agree with us that this \nprovision should be stricken from the legislation.\n  Raising the eligibility age for Medicare, first of all, is not \nnecessary in order to balance the budget. The extra budget savings that \nthis provision might generate are not necessary to meet any of the \ntargets set by the budget negotiators in the earlier negotiation. While \nthis change is described as being something that was done in order to \nbring Medicare into line with Social Security changes that were earlier \nmade, there are obviously very real differences between Medicare and \nSocial Security. Social Security allows an individual to receive early \nretirement benefits at age 62. Unlike Social Security, Medicare does \nnot provide any other option for the retiree who wants to retire at age \n65. Either the person has insurance or they do not. To make this change \nin Medicare, I believe, would visit a real hardship on many seniors who \nhave planned for their entire careers to be able to retire at age 65 \nand to have Medicare available to them at that time. For us to make \nthis kind of change, even though there is a long period for the phase-\nin of the change, I think will be breaking faith with many of those \nAmericans and many of the people in my State.\n  Raising the eligibility age creates, also, the specter of a new group \nof uninsured Americans. We have spent much time in the previous \nCongress and in this Congress debating how we can cover more Americans \nwith health care insurance. We have too many Americans today--in my \nState we have way too many Americans--who do not have health care \ncoverage. We have talked about how to cover more children, how to cover \nmore working families, how to cover more seniors before they are \neligible for Medicare. This provision that we are going to propose to \nstrike from the reconciliation bill adds to that pool of uninsured \nAmericans who would be without health insurance at a very critical time \nin their careers. Essentially, it says to them that between the age of \n65, when they would normally expect to retire, and the age of 67, the \nresponsibility for health care will be theirs.\n  There are different groups of Americans and people have different \ncircumstances. There is a large group that has no health care coverage \nin their employment. This would provide that there is an additional 2-\nyear period in which they continue to have no health care coverage as \nthey approach their senior years. There is another group that has \nhealth care coverage but that health care coverage terminates at the \ntime they quit their jobs. That group, of course, would have the \nfinancial responsibility. They would have the choice to either go out \nand buy private health care coverage, which would be very expensive, to \ncover that interim period of 2 years, or they would have the choice, of \ncourse, of trying to get through that period without health care \ncoverage, either depending upon Medicaid or hoping against hope that \nthey do not get sick and do not need medical attention.\n\n  Of course there are others, I should point out, who have health care \ncoverage and whose employers have agreed to maintain that health care \ncoverage until they reach the eligible age for Medicare. Those \nindividuals, of course, would continue to have health care coverage \nunder their employer but the provision we are trying to strike here \nwould visit a hardship on the employers in that case. The provision \nwould have an immediate impact on employers right now, who provide \nhealth benefits to individuals until they reach the age for Medicare. \nCompanies are required today, under Financial Accounting Standard 106, \nto estimate their liabilities for all future retiree health benefits. \nCompanies determine the present value of their future liabilities for \nthose health benefits and have to report that. These figures are \nreported as part of the financial statements the companies make. All of \nthose liabilities would have to be rolled into those financial \nstatements immediately upon the adoption of this provision, if this \nprovision were to remain part of the reconciliation bill.\n  So the change that we are proposing here not only would visit a \nhardship on the employees, the senior citizens who are ready to retire \nor who have retired, it also visits a financial hardship on employers \nand constitutes, in many ways, an unfunded mandate on the private \nsector. I am sure that issue will be discussed to a great extent by the \nother sponsors of this legislation. A higher Medicare eligibility age \nwould actually create a disincentive for employers to hire or retain \nolder workers, and it would also create an additional incentive, \nperhaps, for them to cut back on health care benefits at an earlier \ntime.\n  Mr. President, we are in the period where employers are cutting back \non additional benefits that go with employment. That trend has \ncontinued, now, for some time. I do not think there is any doubt that \nit is a lower percentage. I have one figure here that the American \nAssociation for Retired Persons put out that in 1973, 71 percent of \nlarge employers covered early retirees with health care coverage. By \nlast year, that proportion was no longer 71 percent, it was down to 63 \npercent. Of course, that only applies to large employers. Most of the \nsmall employers in my State do not provide that coverage and most of \nthe employees in my State, accordingly, do not have that benefit.\n  Mr. President, I believe very strongly that we need to make necessary \nchanges in the structure of Medicare in order to keep it solvent as we \ngo forward. I support efforts to do that. I do not, though, believe it \nwould be appropriate for us to try to improve the solvency of Medicare \nby reducing the number of individuals who are eligible to receive \nMedicare, reducing the pool of individuals who are eligible to receive \nthose health benefits. This provision which we are trying to strike \nfrom the reconciliation bill has that exact effect. I hope very much \nthe Senate will agree with us on this proposed amendment to strike this \nprovision. I think this would substantially improve the legislation if \nwe did strike this provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when the vote is taken \non the amendment. As I understand that will be tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that five letters and a report \non this subject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1997.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: The National Association of \n     Manufacturers has been a strong supporter of the May \n     bipartisan balanced budget agreement and the subsequent House \n     Ways and Means Committee markup of proposals to preserve \n     Medicare's solvency to 2007. The proposal being considered by \n     the Senate Finance Committee is nearly identical with at \n     least one major exception: conforming the eligibility age for \n     Medicare with that for Social Security, which is scheduled to \n     rise from 65 to 67 beginning in 2003. No budgetary savings \n     would accrue until that time, well after the target date for \n     achieving a balanced budget.\n       Beyond the pending short-term fixes, Medicare's survival \n     depends on making long-term structural changes. Increasing \n     the eligibility age could well fall into that category and \n     should be studied along with other proposals by the Baby Boom \n     Generation Medicare Commission. Increasing the eligibility \n     age now would not contribute to a balanced budget, while it \n     would do harm to early retirees and employers who provide \n     retiree health coverage.\n       Medicare currently has no option for early access to a \n     reduced benefit and, thus, a shift in the eligibility age \n     would create a major shifting of medical costs from Medicare \n     to retirees. Only about one-third of Medicare enrollees have \n     employer-sponsored retiree medical coverage, largely through \n     jobs in manufacturing, which typically pay higher wages. \n     Persons without such coverage, typically in lower-wage \n     industries, would be particularly affected and least able to \n     cope with this delay in Medicare coverage.\n       On the employer side, companies now paying full medical \n     benefits prior to Medicare eligibility would have to continue \n     paying unreduced benefits for the duration of the age \n     increase. These companies would see an immediate increase in \n     their Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 106 liability. \n     Thus, while any increase in the Medicare-eligibility age may \n     not begin to take effect for several years, the impact on \n     companies' book value would be immediate.\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\n       Current proposals to increase the Medicare-eligibility age \n     contribute nothing to budget savings until 2003. Therefore, \n     we urge that this proposal be studied by the Baby Boom \n     Generation Medicare Commission with a focus on its effect on \n     early retirees, employers and the Medicare program. Should \n     such a change be recommended, the implementation date should \n     allow companies and individuals sufficient time to plan \n     accordingly for this program change.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jerry J. Jasinowski,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\nIncrease in Medicare Eligibility Age Should Be Deleted From the Budget \n                          Reconciliation Bill\n\n       Issue: A provision to increase the Medicare eligibility age \n     from 65 to 67 was included in the budget reconciliation bill \n     approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The provision is \n     identical to one which the Senate rejected during its \n     consideration of the 1995 balanced budget act. Removing the \n     provision from the current budget bill would have no scoring \n     consequences because the phase-in to the increased \n     eligibility age would not begin until 2003. However, there \n     would be an immediate adverse impact for employers which \n     provide health benefits until an individual becomes eligible \n     for Medicare. Shifting these costs from Medicare to private \n     coverage is likely to result in a reduction in health \n     benefits for active workers, retirees or both.\n       Discussion: The Senate bill provision would increase the \n     Medicare eligibility age over a 24 year period to conform it \n     to the revised Social Security age. The consequences of such \n     a long term change appropriately belong on the agenda of the \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, a panel \n     which would be established by both the House and Senate \n     budget reconciliation bills to make recommendations to \n     Congress on the changes that need to be made to prepare \n     Medicare for the demographic impact of the Baby Boom \n     generation.\n       The provision has no scoring consequences for the current \n     budget bill because the phase-in to the new eligibility age \n     would not begin until 2003, the year after the five-year \n     period of budget reconciliation bill. However, its effects on \n     private health coverage would be immediate. Employers must \n     comply with financial accounting standard (FAS) 106 which \n     requires companies to determine the present value of their \n     future liabilities for the health benefits provided to their \n     active workers and retirees. Increases in the Medicare \n     eligibility age would result in increased liabilities for \n     employer-sponsored coverage, including those firms which \n     agree to continue coverage for early retirees until they \n     become eligible for Medicare benefits. Because FAS 106 \n     standards require that companies must account for their \n     increased financial exposure immediately--even though the \n     increase in the eligibility age would take place over many \n     years--the impact to employers' bottom line would occur long \n     before the full phase-in period.\n       Shifts in health care costs from the federal government to \n     the private sector can have profound and unanticipated effect \n     and are very likely to result in lower coverage for active \n     workers, retirees or both. That is why any change in the \n     Medicare eligibility age must be carefully considered and \n     compared with other long term financial and structural \n     changes needed in Medicare to prepare the program for its \n     future beneficiaries.\n       Congress and the President reached an historic bipartisan \n     agreement to balance the budget by 2002 and expressly decided \n     that long term Medicare changes would be addressed only after \n     an expert panel provides much needed guidance on the best set \n     of choices to secure Medicare's future. Clearly, increasing \n     Medicare's eligibility age should be given the further \n     consideration that such a fundamental change deserves.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                        NYNEX,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: NYNEX urges you to delete the \n     Medicare eligibility retirement age increase from the Senate \n     Finance Committee's bill. As you know, a provision in the \n     Chairman's mark would increase the Medicare eligibility age \n     from 65 to 67. Besides public policy concerns about insurance \n     coverage for senior citizens, this provision would also have \n     a significant and immediate adverse financial impact on \n     NYNEX.\n       NYNEX provides health care coverage to its employees, \n     retirees and their dependents. Our retirees receive full \n     health care benefits at retirement and supplemental benefits \n     that are integrated with Medicare once they become eligible \n     for Medicare. Under the Finance Committee proposal, NYNEX \n     would ultimately be responsible for paying for the additional \n     two years of full benefits for its retirees.\n       There is also a more immediate concern. Companies are \n     required under Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 106 to \n     estimate their liabilities for all future retiree health \n     benefits and ``book'' (recognize on their financial \n     statements) the present value of these liabilities, net of \n     any assets dedicated to retiree health. This figure is \n     deducted from earnings. As a result, responsible companies \n     providing generous retiree health benefits will be penalized \n     and viewed as less profitable compared to their competitors \n     who do not provide retiree health benefits.\n       The impact of this legislation will be to discourage \n     companies like NYNEX from offering comprehensive retiree \n     health benefits to their employees.\n       Changes to the Medicare eligibility age should be \n     considered in the context of overall Medicare reform. It is \n     not necessary for the Finance Committee to adopt this \n     proposal to meet its budget reconciliation commitments, since \n     the proposal does not raise any revenue over the short-term.\n       Again, NYNEX urges you to delete the Medicare eligibility \n     age provision from the Finance Committee bill.

John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Jay Rockefeller: Bell Atlantic urges you to delete \n     the Medicare eligibility retirement age increase from the \n     Senate Finance Committee's bill. As you know, a provision in \n     the Chairman's ``mark'' would increase the Medicare \n     eligibility age from 65 to 67. Besides public policy concerns \n     about insurance coverage for senior citizens, this provision \n     would also have a significant and immediate adverse financial \n     impact on Bell Atlantic.\n       Bell Atlantic provides health care coverage to its \n     employees, retirees and their dependents. Our retirees \n     receive full health care benefits at retirement and \n     supplemental benefits that are integrated with Medicare once \n     they become eligible for Medicare. Under the Finance \n     Committee proposal, Bell Atlantic would ultimately be \n     responsible for paying for the additional two years of full \n     benefits for its retirees.\n       There is also a more immediate concern. Companies are \n     required under Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 106 to \n     estimate their liabilities for all future retiree health \n     benefits and ``book'' (recognize on their financial \n     statements) the present value of these liabilities, net of \n     any assets dedicated to retiree health. This figure is \n     deducted from earnings. As a result, responsible companies \n     providing generous retiree health benefits will be penalized \n     and viewed as less profitable compared in their competitors \n     who do not provide retiree health benefits.\n       The impact of this legislation will be to discourage \n     companies like Bell Atlantic from offering comprehensive \n     retiree health benefits to their employees.\n       Changes to Medicare eligibility age should be considered in \n     the context of overall Medicare reform. It is not necessary \n     for the Finance Committee to adopt this proposal to meet its \n     budget reconciliation commitments, since the proposal does \n     not raise any revenue over the short-term.\n       Again, Bell Atlantic urges you to delete the Medicare \n     eligibility age provision from the Finance Committee bill. \n     This issue should be considered in the context of \n     comprehensive reform to ensure all aspects of the issue, \n     including the concerns of employers providing retiree health \n     benefits, are addressed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dennis Bone,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Corporate Health\n\n\n                                               Care Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1997.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: We would like to bring to your attention \n     the concerns of our companies about a provision we believe is \n     included in the Senate Finance Committee Proposal for Budget \n     Reconciliation. This provision--to raise the Medicare \n     Eligibility Age--could have a serious effect on our corporate \n     liabilities and book value.\n       As you know, many companies today provide their retirees \n     with health benefits. In most plans, retirees receive full \n     benefits at any early retirement age and supplemental \n     benefits that are integrated with Medicare beginning at the \n     Medicare eligibility age. Under the Senate provision, \n     companies now paying full benefits prior to Medicare \n     eligibility would eventually have to continue paying the \n     unreduced benefits for two more years.\n       Companies are currently obligated under Financial \n     Accounting Standard (FAS)106 to estimate their liabilities \n     for all future retiree health benefits that may be paid to \n     active and retired workers, and ``book'' the present value of \n     these liabilities, net of any assets dedicated to retiree \n     health. These net liabilities, which are estimated today to \n     exceed $300 billion, must reflect all current law \n     requirements and existing plan provisions, even though \n     companies may be planning to make changes in their plan.\n       Even though the Senate's increase in the Medicare \n     Eligibility would not begin until 2003, and then would \n     proceed gradually over the next 24 years, the impact on \n     corporate book liabilities would be immediate. Under FAS106, \n     companies would have to re-estimate their future liabilities \n     and account for any addition to their liabilities as a result \n     of this change. The impact on FAS106 liabilities would vary \n     greatly depending on the type of plan and age of work force, \n     but would\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\n     range from a 5 to a 25 percent increase in FAS106 \n     liabilities.\n       This would create a serious financial and accounting \n     problem for companies currently operating retiree health \n     plans, and could cause many to move to limit or eliminate \n     their commitment to retirees. While there is some logic to \n     coordinating Medicare and Social Security retiree ages, we \n     ask that we take up this task after Budget Reconciliation is \n     completed and we have time to consider provisions to avoid \n     the FAS106 liability effects.\n       Since we do not believe this provision contributes to \n     meeting the Budget Reconciliation instructions to the \n     Committee, we urge you to drop this provision altogether.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ellen Goldstein,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: Today the Senate is scheduled to take up the \n     budget reconciliation legislation dealing with spending \n     reductions. The UAW strongly opposes this bill because it \n     incorporates a number of anti-worker, anti-senior provisions. \n     We urge you to support amendments to delete the objectionable \n     provisions; If they are not eliminated, we urge you to vote \n     against the bill on final passage.\n       This budget reconciliation legislation contains a massive \n     attack on the Medicare program that would be extremely \n     harmful for the elderly and for working men and women. In \n     particular, the UAW strongly opposes the provisions that \n     would; Increase the Medicare eligibility age to 67; this \n     provision would greatly increase the number of Americans \n     without health insurance coverage; it would also impose huge \n     new costs on those employers who currently provide pre-\n     Medicare retirees with health insurance coverage, and impose \n     additional pressure on these employers to drop this coverage; \n     means test the Medicare program by imposing drastic increases \n     in the Part B deductible for beneficiaries with higher \n     incomes; this provision would be extremely difficult to \n     administer, while raising relatively little revenue; in \n     addition, it unfairly penalizes seniors who are ill, and \n     would generate increased pressure to totally abandon the \n     social insurance nature of the Medicare program; impose a $5 \n     per visit copay for home health care visits; this provision \n     would impose enormous costs on seniors who depend on home \n     health care; and establish a dangerous pilot program for \n     100,000 Medical Savings Accounts, which would allow insurance \n     companies to engage in skimming practices that would threaten \n     to fragment the Medicare program.\n       Taken together, these provisions would undermine the social \n     insurance nature of the Medicare program, and would represent \n     the first step towards converting it into a welfare program \n     that would lack broad based political support. In addition, \n     these provisions would impose significant and unacceptable \n     new costs on many senior citizens. At the same time, the \n     budget legislation fails to provide adequate assistance to \n     low income seniors in paying their Part B premiums. It is \n     also important to note that the provisions increasing the \n     Medicare eligibility age and means testing the Part B premium \n     were approved without adequate public hearings and debate, \n     and are outside the scope of the budget agreement. For all of \n     these reasons, the UAW urges you to support amendments to \n     strike all of these objectionable Medicare provisions from \n     this reconciliation legislation.\n       The UAW also opposes the provision in this reconciliation \n     legislation that would overturn the federal court decision in \n     the Pennington case. This decision prohibited the states from \n     using accounting devices to make certain groups of workers, \n     especially part time employees, ineligible for unemployment \n     benefits. By overturning this decision, the reconciliation \n     legislation would reduce coverage under state unemployment \n     compensation programs by about six percent. We urge you to \n     support efforts to strike this provision from the budget \n     legislation so that laid off workers are not denied this \n     essential assistance.\n       The UAW also opposes the provisions in the reconciliation \n     legislation that would: allow Texas to privatize the \n     administration of its Medicaid and food stamp programs; this \n     represents a dangerous precedent that would allow private \n     companies to make decisions regarding the eligibility of \n     individuals for government benefits; establish an open-ended \n     block grant program to encourage the states to provide \n     expanded health insurance coverage to children; the funds \n     provided for this effort are inadequate; in addition, we \n     believe that the most cost effective way to provide health \n     insurance coverage to uninsured children would be by \n     expanding the Medicaid program; deny SSI coverage in the \n     future to elderly and disabled legal immigrants; this would \n     unfairly penalize extremely vulnerable populations who \n     genuinely need public assistance; and allow HHS to administer \n     the Welfare to Work program, while failing to emphasize the \n     importance of job training; we believe that this program can \n     be better administered by the Department of Labor; in \n     addition, the funds available under this program should be \n     made available for job training, which is critically \n     important to moving individuals off to welfare and into the \n     work force.\n       Lastly, the UAW strongly urges you to oppose any amendment \n     that would exempt individuals in workfare programs from \n     coverage under the minimum wage and other provisions of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act. As a matter of basic social \n     justice, we believe that all workers should be entitled to \n     these fundamental protections. We are also concerned that \n     this type of exception would undermine these protections for \n     other workers.\n       Accordingly, the UAW urges you to support amendments that \n     would eliminate the objectionable provisions discussed above, \n     and to oppose any amendments that would further undermine \n     protections for seniors and working men and women. Unless the \n     objectionable provisions are stricken from the legislation, \n     the UAW urges you to vote against this budget reconciliation \n     legislation on final passage.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this vital \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [From the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, June 20, \n                                 1997]\n\nIncrease in Medicare Eligibility Age Should Be Deleted From the Budget \n                          Reconciliation Bill\n\n       A provision to increase the Medicare eligibility age from \n     65 to 67 has been included in the budget reconciliation bill \n     approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The provision is \n     identical to one which the Senate rejected during its \n     consideration of the 1995 Balanced Budget Act. While removing \n     the provision from the current budget bill would have no \n     scoring consequences because the phase-in to the increased \n     eligibility age would not begin until 2003, if the provision \n     remains, there would be an immediate adverse impact on \n     employers who provide health benefits until an individual is \n     eligible for coverage under Medicare. Shifting these costs \n     from Medicare to private coverage is likely to result in a \n     reduction in health benefits for active workers, retirees or \n     both.\n       Any changes in the Medicare eligibility age must be \n     carefully considered and compared with other long term \n     financial and structural changes needed in Medicare to \n     prepare the program for its future beneficiaries and we \n     oppose including an eligibility age increase in the budget \n     package for the following reasons:\n       A Long-Term Agenda Issue. The Senate bill provision would \n     increase the Medicare eligibility age over a 24 year period. \n     The consequences of such a long term change more \n     appropriately belong on the agenda of the Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare, a panel which would be \n     established by both the House and Senate budget \n     reconciliation bills to make recommendations to Congress on \n     the changes that need to be made to prepare Medicare for the \n     demographic impact of the Baby Boom generation.\n       Immediate, Negative Effects on Employees. Because the \n     phase-in to the new eligibility age would not begin until \n     2003, the provision has no scoring consequences for the \n     current five-year budget reconciliation bill. However, \n     private health coverage would be affected immediately. \n     Employers must comply with financial accounting standards \n     (FAS) 106 which requires companies to determine the present \n     value of their future liabilities for the health benefits \n     provided to their active workers and retirees. Increases in \n     the Medicare eligibility age would result in increased \n     liabilities for employer-sponsored coverage, including those \n     firms which agree to continue coverage for early retirees \n     until they become eligible for Medicare benefits. Because FAS \n     106 standards require that companies must account for their \n     increased financial exposure immediately--even though the \n     increase in the eligibility age would take place over many \n     years--the impact to employers' bottom line would occur long \n     before the full phase-in period.\n       The Costly Effects of Cost Shifting. Shifts in health care \n     costs from the federal government to the private sector can \n     have profound and unanticipated effects and are very likely \n     to result in lower coverage for active workers, retirees or \n     both. In addition, the provision would leave many individuals \n     with a costly gap in health coverage until they turn 67 which \n     would further discourage companies from providing health \n     benefits to retirees.\n       Congress and the President reached an historic bipartisan \n     agreement to balance the budget by 2002 and expressly decided \n     that long term Medicare changes would be addressed only after \n     an expert panel provides much needed guidance on the best set \n     of choices to secure Medicare's future. Clearly, increasing \n     Medicare's eligibility age should be given the further \n     consideration that such a fundamental change deserves.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the Senator from Nebraska as much time as he \nneeds.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, I would like to praise the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and the ranking Democrat on the \nFinance Committee, Senator Moynihan, as well as the chairman and \nranking member on the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici and Senator \nLautenberg.\n  The bill we are debating right now makes a substantial contribution \nto deficit reduction. The goal of all this deliberation is to balance \nthe budget by the year 2002, the purpose of which is to enable us to \ncontinue with an economy that is growing and continue creating jobs and \ncontinue the prosperity that we are currently enjoying in the United \nStates.\n  I am saying all this because we will be debating all kinds of reasons \nwhy this bill is bad, and I think it is very important for us to begin \nby saying there is a purpose here.\n  We know Medicare is a very substantial program in terms of cost, and \nany attempt to balance the budget has to look at this program. Chairman \nRoth has done, I think, an exceptional job of producing a proposal that \nnot only contributes to deficit reduction, but does a number of other \nthings which I believe are very important.\n  First of all, one of the things this bill does, in addition to \ncontributing to deficit reduction, is there are a number of provisions \nthat Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan put in this bill that directly \naffect our capacity in rural America to get good health care. That has \nbeen a bit of a problem. There are a number of issues we have \nidentified over the years, and Chairman Roth has made some changes in \nlaw in this bill that will benefit those of us who represent rural \nStates. I would like to list some of those provisions.\n  First, rural hospitals and physicians will be able to form their own \nnetworks, independent of larger managed care companies, and contract \ndirectly with Medicare on a capitated basis. These provider-responsive \norganizations would not only provide competition, but they will enable \nus to increase coverage and increase health care delivery in the rural \nareas.\n  Second, the proposal is one that will increase managed care payments \nin rural areas. The increase in payments will be detailed during the \ncourse of this debate, but it is critical, if we are going to get \nmanaged care in rural areas, that the payments be increased, and \nChairman Roth has made certain in this bill that happens.\n  Third, it creates a single designation for small rural limited \nservice hospitals that would be paid on a reasonable-cost basis. This \nnew authority will include the current--called EACH/RPCH--demonstration \nhospitals. Once again, we have been asked by rural hospitals and rural \nproviders for this provision. Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan have \nincluded it in their bill, and for those of us who represent rural \nStates, we are going to be able to say, correctly so, that this law is \ngoing to make it more likely that we are going to get good care in the \nrural community.\n  Next, it allows sole community hospitals to opt for a fourth payment \noption based upon the costs from fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995. \nIt is a detail that I will not go into at length here today, but again \non the ground at the community level this will make a tremendous \ndifference in most States where rural health care shortages are a \nproblem.\n  Next, it reinstates the Medicare dependent hospital program through \n2002. This means that hospitals with less than 100 beds and where 60 \npercent or more of the discharge is paid for by Medicare will be paid \non the same basis as sole community hospitals. It is a very important \nprovision. There are lots of hospitals in Nebraska sort of hanging on \nthe edge with fewer than 100 beds. This will give them a fighting \nchance to survive.\n  Last, it allows rural referral centers greater flexibility to receive \npayments based on rates for the nearest germane area.\n  Mr. President, I just say again that this provision is one last thing \nin the bill that will enable us to say that in addition to eliminating \nthis deficit that has plagued us for so many years, this proposal will \nincrease the likelihood that managed care and good health care will \nreach the rural area. I thank Chairman Roth and I thank Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg. It is a terribly \nimportant provision for those of us who represent rural States.\n  Second, and I will not go at length in describing this, this bill \ngrants authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to bring \nmore competition into this system. Competition in my judgment will not \nsolve all of the problems, but it is a tremendously useful tool to \nbring costs out of the system. It is more likely to get it done in an \nefficacious fashion. Again, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan have \nincluded this in the mark. And I believe it represents substantial \nreform and important reform in the Medicare system.\n  Third, this committee, the Finance Committee, again under Senator \nRoths's and Senator Moynihan's leadership, has paid attention to the \nunique problems that low-income Medicare beneficiaries face. And it can \nbe a tremendously difficult problem.\n  It is relatively easy for us to get caught up in all the numbers and \npresume that all we are doing is trying to find numbers savings. But \nfor an individual out there at the community level, Medicare really can \nbe a lifesaver.\n  I have a woman in Omaha, NE, that I pulled from our file, we are \nworking with at the moment, that faces some problems, a very common \nsituation. A widow on Medicare, she has $610 a month in Social \nSecurity. She has $182 in rent subsidized through section 8. Her \nutilities and phone are $55 a month. Her Medicare part B is $43 a \nmonth. She has a Medigap cost on top of that. By the time she is done, \nshe has $4,000 left over for everything, for food, clothing, and other \nexpenses. It does not take much in the way of prescription drugs and \nadditional costs for health care for her to find herself with almost no \nmoney left over.\n  So this mark, for those of us concerned about low-income people, \ncontinues the dual eligibility system for Medicare and Medicaid. It \ncontinues both the SLMB and the QMB Programs that enables lower-income \npeople to get payment. And I believe the managers' amendment will make \nit more likely that the SLMB Program will enable low-income people to \nfind themselves able to accommodate the increases in premiums that will \noccur as a consequence of the shift of some home-based coverage from \npart A to part B.\n  Though I would argue there is still some room for improvement, this \nbill represents a good-faith effort to acknowledge that there are low-\nincome beneficiaries out there who are faced with different problems \nthan higher-income beneficiaries.\n  There is still one out of seven Americans over the age of 65 who live \nin poverty. Medicare and Social Security reduces the rate of poverty \nfrom 50 percent to about 12 percent in the country. But still, for \nthose 12 percent, life can be quite difficult. And I assure you, \nChairman Roth and Senator Moynihan have paid attention to that problem \nand, I think, have enabled us to say that we have at least tried to \nmake certain that low-income beneficiaries are given full \nconsideration.\n  The next thing that I would like to spend most of my time talking \nabout is, this mark, this piece of legislation does acknowledge, as \nwell, that we have long-term problems, that we cannot stick our heads \nin the sand and ignore that the Medicare Program not only promises to \nmake payments for the next 5 and for the next 10 years but it promises \nto make payments for the long-term as well, promises to make payments \nespecially for that baby-boom generation that will begin to retire in \n2010, 2011, depending upon when you mark the generation. It is either \n1945 to 1965 or 1946 to 1965. In that 20-year period, about 2010 to \n2030, under current forecasts, even as we have adjusted the program--I \nnote there will be some that try to knock out the increase in the \neligibility age. There will be some that try to knock out the income-\nrelated test on part B, the copayment on home health, the $5 fee on\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\nhome health, and make compelling arguments. But you can only make those \narguments persuasive if you ignore where this program is going.\n\n  Mr. President, the current cost of Medicare represents about 10 \npercent of this budget. And from 2010 to 2030, Medicare costs will go \nfrom about 10 percent to 35 percent of the budget. That is the kind of \ngrowth that we see out in the future. It is a demographic problem. And \nwhen you move the eligibility age from 65 to 67, in order to bring it \ninto line with where Social Security is going, we are making and \nrecommending an adjustment that takes into account where this program \nis going, what the future looks like out there.\n  I acknowledge that there are problems when you move the eligibility \nage for people who are between the ages of 60 and 66 or 67. There is a \nproblem. This legislation has in it not only a commission, but in law \nwe recommend that the commission consider doing what Kerrey-Danforth \nrecommended, which is to allow seniors between the ages of 62 and \neligibility age to be able to buy into the Medicare Program. I think it \nis the sort of thing that we are going to have to consider whether we \nadjust the eligibility age or not.\n  But I will give this evening--I suspect I am going to have plenty of \nopportunity to argue this when the amendment is offered to strike it on \nthe eligibility age--I give this evening one set of facts. Between the \nyears 2010 and 2030, the number of people in the work force will grow \nby 5 million, a 5-million-person increase between 2010 and 2030. But \nthe number of people who are retiring who will be eligible for payments \nwill increase by 22 million. That is a problem, Mr. President, that we \nface with our program. And we can either ignore it and say we do not \nwant to make change or we can acknowledge, in order to preserve and \nprotect Medicare for the long term, these kinds of changes will be \nnecessary.\n  The change does not impact anyone over the age of 58 today and does \nnot fully impact anyone over the age of 36. I say that because I have \nalready seen interviews given to current Medicare beneficiaries, people \nwho are 65, people who are 70, receiving Medicare that are \nbeneficiaries today, and the question is put to them, ``What do you \nthink about moving the eligibility age?'' as if it is going to affect \nthem. And very often again they will find themselves concerned about \nlosing their Medicare, about whether or not they are going to be paying \nmore for their Medicare. And there is a presumption made that this \nchange is going to have an impact on them.\n  Mr. President, this movement of the eligibility age is one of the \neasiest. Right along with that, a change that I believe should be made \nis to bring a new accounting to the cost of living index. We debated it \nearlier on in the year. We were not able to get it. Some objected to \nthe so-called ``politicization'' of the CPI. The CPI was imposed in \n1973 for political reasons.\n  I want a good formula, a good calculation. Unfortunately, we were not \nable to get that because we ended up being opposed both on the left and \non the right. But these are the kinds of changes that are necessary to \naccommodate demographics.\n  There was a piece in the New York Times Sunday magazine yesterday. I \nthink it was Ben Wattenberg that made a couple of suggestions. And if \nMembers want to bring that kind of suggestion to the floor, why it will \nbe an interesting debate. He suggested that we change our tax and our \nspending laws to encourage Americans to have more babies or we open our \nborders and accept more people in the United States as immigrants, \ntrying to increase the number of workers per retiree.\n  Or one can walk to the floor if they choose to and propose a tax \nincrease. Many people who have honestly evaluated this program have \nsuggested that all we need to do is increase the payroll tax just a \nlittle bit and that will solve the problem.\n  Mr. President, I intend in this debate to repeatedly point out to \ncolleagues that the tax-cut provisions in this bill addresses the \nincome tax. It does not address what is for many Americans the largest \ntax of all, and that is the payroll tax.\n  And I have been in Nebraska many times in townhall meetings and \ntalked about this movement of the eligibility age and the income-\nrelated test on part B, which is also in the chairman's mark. And very \noften it provokes a big debate. And some do not like it.\n  I say, let me just ask the audience, How many of you would support \nincreasing the payroll tax? And it is rare where you will find more \nthan one or two people holding up their hand, Mr. President. And the \nreason is, that for a family of four in Nebraska, earning $34,000 a \nyear, husband, wife, two children, they will pay $2,719 in Federal \nincome tax; they will pay $5,358 in payroll taxes, $4,300 of which is \nFICA and $1,000 of which is the Medicare tax. Mr. President, that is \nalmost twice as much in payroll taxes.\n  One of the reasons that we find people say to us that this system has \nto be fixed with these kinds of changes is that they acknowledge that \nthis payroll tax is taking a substantial bite out of the income of the \nworking families of America.\n  So the bill has a change in the eligibility age. I defend it \nstrongly. I intend to come down when the amendment is offered to strike \nand explain at greater length why those who are arguing to strike it \nwill not help strengthen this program. I intend to argue as well, by \nthe way, that I, having studied this a long time, believe long term it \nis going to be difficult for us to maintain Medicare and Medicaid, the \nVA, and the income-tax deductions as intact programs.\n\n  I think it is going to be difficult for us to not, at some time, \nrelatively soon, begin to examine once more whether or not we should \nchange the law and change the way people become eligible.\n  It is very revealing when you talk about moving the eligibility age, \nMr. President. The law says if you have reached the age of 65 in \nAmerica you are eligible for Medicare. If you can prove you are poor, \nunder the law, the law says you are eligible for Medicaid. If you get \nblown up in a war, as I did, the law says you are entitled to the VA \nsystem. If you work for the right employer, the law says you can get a \nsubsidy through the income tax system. If you work for the Government \nvery often, the law says you also have a right to health care.\n  Mr. President, I believe, though it may seem counterintuitive for \nthose of us who have been worried about the growing cost of the \nmandatory programs and entitlements and that interest, that we need to \nconsider rewriting the social contract for Federal health care and \nestablishing a simplified eligibility. If you are an American or legal \nresident, you pay according to your capacity to pay. Everybody has to \npay the true cost of health care.\n  We ought to allow competition to control the cost. And we ought to \nallow consumers to get far more information about what the health care \nsystem is both doing for them and sometimes doing to them.\n  I think it is very difficult for me to stand here and say that we can \npreserve Medicare as an intact program unless some demographic change \noccurs between now and 2010.\n  I believe it is inescapable you look at these kinds of choices, \notherwise you are basically going to prolong the due date and at some \npoint we are going to be facing choices that are far more difficult \nthan the choices that are being presented by the committee in this \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, another change that we have in this proposal is a \nchange that says that we are going to make the Medicare part B more \nprogressive than it currently is by asking Americans who have higher \nincomes to pay more, to be subsidized less, in short, by Americans with \nlower income for that part B premium.\n  Initially, Senator Gramm of Texas and I, who worked on this proposal, \nhad an offering that we would use the deductible as a basis for change, \nin short, that we were going to try to affect utilization. It got a bit \nconfusing. And as a result of that confusion, both he and I have agreed \nto change it so that it will be an adjustment in the part B premium for \nAmericans under $50,000 a year. They will not be affected at all. \nRoughly 94 percent of beneficiaries are somewhere in that range. It \ndoes not fully affect any individual under $100,000. We phase the \nsubsidy out over $100,000 for an individual and $125,000 for a couple.\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\n  I appreciate the sacred nature of Medicare, but nowhere do I find it \npersuasive that we ought to ask people with lower incomes to subsidize \npeople of higher incomes. Very often the people of lower incomes do not \neven have health insurance. They are struggling to pay the cost of \nhealth care themselves out of pocket, and part of their taxes--again, \nthe larger share of their taxes coming from payroll taxes being \ndelivered to pay the health care of individuals with a capacity to be \nable to take care of themselves.\n  I do not believe this challenges the Medicare system. I do not \nbelieve it is a slippery slope to destroying Medicare. I believe it is \nconsistent with what Medicare attempts to do, which is to say that the \nmarket will not provide insurance for all of our citizens, that we have \nto, on a progressive basis, write a law that enables us to do that. \nThis change will make the system more progressive, not less. I \nemphasize that.\n  For all those who will come to the floor and argue that this package \nis not sufficiently progressive, they will find themselves, in my \njudgment, turning their arguments inside out in proposing this test of \nincome on part B. How can you defend a change, a simple change at a \nrelatively high income, Mr. President, $100,000 for an individual and \n$125,000 for a couple? Mr. President, this is a substantial first-step \nchange, once again, to acknowledge that we have a long-term problem \nwith Medicare, and we are going to have to begin to make more difficult \nchoices if we want to arrive out there in the future and say we have \nsolved future problems as well.\n  Very importantly, under this change, we did not do it for budgetary \nreasons. Neither the move of the eligibility age nor the change in part \nB premiums has been done in order to generate budget savings. Indeed, \nthe revenue that we get from the part B premium will go into the health \ninsurance trust fund, strengthening the health insurance trust fund. We \nhave not had it scored. We are not using it to pay for other things. We \nare using it to strengthen the Medicare Program and, as I say, to make \nthe program more progressive.\n  Mr. President, finally, as we go through this debate, I intend to \nrepeatedly come to the floor and call to my colleagues' attention \nanother terrifying fact. People come and they will argue, well, in 1965 \nwhen we passed Medicare, we intended the following--and whatever it is \nthat the colleague wants to offer in opposition to either moving the \neligible age or in opposition to putting an income test on part B, will \nsuggest there was something in 1965 that caused us to say we would do \nsomething and never come back and change it. There have been lots of \nchanges that have occurred since 1965.\n  I will in the midst of the debate have plenty of opportunity to go \nthrough many of those changes that I think dictate that we change the \nprogram again. The one that is the most impressive of all is that in \n1965, 30 percent of the Federal budget went to mandatory programs. That \nis entitlement programs plus net interest, and 70 percent of our budget \nwent to discretionary spending. Mr. President, in the year 2002, when \nthis budget agreement ends, we will have exactly the opposite--70 \npercent will be mandatory spending and 30 percent will go to \ndiscretionary. It does not stop there. It will continue to grow until \n100 percent of the budget is mandatory, until we have converted the \nFederal Government into an ATM machine, collecting taxes and merely \ntransferring back out.\n  Mr. President, for all those who care about investing in our future, \nwho want to invest more in education, who are concerned about \nproductivity, we have all kinds of other things we believe this Nation \nneeds to be addressing, unless we come to grips with the growing cost \nof mandatory programs, it will be impossible for us to do all the \nthings that most of us would like to do in order not only to make our \ncountry fair but also to make our country more prosperous and \nproductive.\n  I believe the legislation that Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan \nhave presented to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member, is a fair \nproposal. It will enable us to say we will balance the budget by the \nyear 2002. It is more progressive than the current law, taking greater \naccount both of low-income Americans as well as upper-income Americans' \ncapacity to pay. It is a terrific package that will enable us in rural \nAmerica to increase the quality of care that we see our citizens \ngetting. It moves more toward a competitive model, not only giving \nHealth and Human Services more power, but giving consumers more power \nby giving them the data and the information that they need to make \nchoices. There is substantial reform not just for budgetary reasons but \nfor the purpose of improving the quality of this program that has been \nso enormously beneficial for our country.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with the chairman and the \nranking member, Senator Moynihan, and I look forward to the opportunity \nof returning to the floor to debate some of the specific amendments \nthat are offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from New Jersey for yielding.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ann Marie \nMurphy of my staff be accorded privileges of the floor during debate on \nS. 947.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset I want to \nacknowledge the leadership role that has been played by my colleague, \nthe Senator from Nebraska, who preceded me on the floor. He is calling \non us as Members of the Senate and the House to face the reality that \nentitlement programs need reform. Senator Kerrey has oftentimes been a \nlonely voice in that effort. It is not altogether a popular position to \ntake and yet it is necessary. I admire him for his leadership and his \ncandor, and I think that we in the Senate should heed his advice that \nwe must resolve ourselves into the business of addressing the needs of \nthese entitlement programs--Social Security and Medicare in \nparticular--on a long-term basis.\n  What I am about to speak to today in no way should reflect on Senator \nKerrey's effort or the effort of others for meaningful reform with \nMedicare. But the issue which I address is one included in this \nreconciliation bill which I feel is fundamentally wrong and \nfundamentally unfair. It is a provision which is included in this bill \nwhich would over a period of time raise the eligible age for Medicare.\n  By way of background, many years ago we raised the eligibility age \nfor Social Security. The reason the people still think in terms of \nSocial Security eligibility at age 65 is that this change to age 67 \nwill be implemented during a transition period from the years 2003 to \n2027. It is a gradual change adding, over 24 years, 24 months before a \nperson can be eligible for Social Security. During the course of its \ndeliberations, the Senate Finance Committee entertained a motion by my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, to add an amendment which would \nincrease the eligible age for Medicare from 65 to 67. It is said in the \nreport of the Finance Committee--and I am sure this reflects the nature \nof the debate--that an attempt was being made to find some symmetry \nbetween the increase in eligibility age for Social Security and the \nincrease in eligible for Medicare. If there is any parallel or any \nsymmetry between these two programs it is only that they both serve \nelderly Americans, and there it ends. I think we should view this \nsuggestion of raising the eligible age for Medicare from 65 to 67 in \nthe context of the people who are affected.\n  This package that raises that age to 67 for Medicare literally \nreneges on our promise to provide Medicare to seniors at the age of 65. \nThere is no budgetary impact in this provision. There is no money to be \nsaved, because whatever is going to be saved, if it is ever \nimplemented, will not occur until the next century, far beyond the 5 \nyears when we measure the impact of this bill.\n  This change does not parallel the Social Security change which I \ndescribed. Individuals have the ability now to begin their Social \nSecurity benefits at age 62. Of course, those benefits are diminished, \nbut should a person reach that point in life and say, ``I'm ready to \nretire. I do not want to wait until 65. I have talked it over with my \nspouse.\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\n I'm going to retire at age 62.'' It is perfectly legal. They can do \nit. The Social Security benefits start flowing to their family based on \nwhat they have paid in.\n  There is no corresponding option for Medicare. Medicare begins at 65. \nUnless you are disabled and thereby qualify for Medicare, you cannot \ntouch this program until you are age 65.\n  Currently, 1.6 trillion individuals in America between the ages of 55 \nand 65 are uninsured. How do people find themselves in this \npredicament? Well, I bet you everyone listening, those viewing, can \nprobably think of someone in their family or a friend who reached that \nsituation. I have a situation in my own family, a person who had worked \nfor years and years for a major company and decided he would retire at \nage 60 and the company said, ``Well, here is your watch. Here is your \npackage of benefits. Good luck in your retirement.'' Within 12 months \nthey notified him there had been a change in the program, and no longer \nwould they offer health insurance to him as a retiree. His recourse? \nNone, zero, no place to turn. Age 60, retired, out of work, no health \ninsurance. Then the trouble began for him personally, heart problems, \nleading to serious heart surgery. He literally put his life savings \ninto his medical care and counted the days until he reached the age of \n65. He had been critical of a lot of ``big government'' and big \ngovernment programs, but now a big government program was coming to his \nrescue and his family's rescue. He finally made it and reached age 65 \nand reached eligibility.\n  Is this an isolated case of one person who did not have good luck \nwhen he retired? I am afraid not. A 1997 Commonwealth Fund study \nindicates in 1994 only 30 percent of retirees had health insurance from \na previous employer, compared with 44 percent in 1988. The trend, \nunfortunately, is in the direction of uninsured people at the age of 60 \nand beyond. Even coverage by larger employers has declined. In 1993, 71 \npercent of large employers provided coverage. But then again by 1996, \nthis figure had dropped to 63 percent. Many retirees, incidentally, do \nnot retire voluntarily and may not have much chance of future \nemployment. Private insurance for this group of seniors is very \nexpensive.\n\n  In my home State of Illinois, I checked in the city of Chicago, and \nthe average cost of health insurance for a healthy male age 60 to 64 is \n$6,520--healthy male. What if they had a preexisting condition, a \nserious medical condition? The cost goes up over $10,000 a year. You \nare retired, you are going fishing, you are taking it easy, all of a \nsudden, no health insurance. Where do you turn? You just had a \ndiagnosis that says you have a medical problem--$10,000 a year and you \nwait, counting the days until you are eligible for Medicare.\n  This bill does not help seniors. This bill does not help retirees. \nThis bill does not help working families, and this provision is totally \nunfair. If we lived in a country where everyone had health insurance, \nuniversal health coverage and you did not have to worry about whether \nyou lost it through changing a job or retirement, that is one thing, \nbut we do not live in that nation. We live in a country where any one \nof us with the loss of a job could be vulnerable to no health insurance \ncoverage, and the suggestion of the majority that we raise the \neligibility age for Medicare leaves more people vulnerable--vulnerable, \nof course, to the cost of health insurance if they can buy it.\n  That is why I oppose this provision and why I will make a point of \norder when I have concluded these remarks. I yield for debate only to \nmy colleague, Senator Reed.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding. I join him \nin my opposition to this provision in the bill. I also have great \nrespect and regard for Senator Kerrey, the primary sponsor of this \nprovision. He has courageously identified many issues with respect to \nMedicare and has provided great insight, but in this particular \nsituation I believe that to raise the eligible age for Medicare is \ngoing in exactly the wrong direction. It forgets why we created \nMedicare in the first place in the mid-1960s.\n  The overwhelming reality was that seniors at that age could not get \nhealth care. That is why the Government stepped in. Private insurance \ncompanies were unwilling to sell insurance to those people at any \nreasonable price. Many things have changed since the mid-1960s--the \ndemographics of our population, the efficacy of a health care program, \nthe longevity of our citizens--but one thing has not changed, and that \nis the unwillingness of private insurance to step in and provide \naffordable and accessible health insurance to seniors.\n  Today, 13 percent of the 21 million people aged 55 to 64 lack health \ninsurance, and by adopting this provision we will simply add to that \nnumber because, now, from age 65 to 66, they will not have access to \nthe Medicare system. Therefore, we have to, I think, maintain a \nsituation where the Medicare system begins at age 65.\n  Indeed, I hope that we will endeavor to try to develop programs that \nwould broaden the base of health care insurance for all Americans. It \nis quite disturbing to listen to the statistics cited by my colleague \nfrom Illinois, and to point out that many, many companies are now no \nlonger insuring, as a matter of routine, their employees and, \nconsequently, the percentage of insured Americans, particularly in the \nlater years of their work life, is declining. We would add to that \nprecipitous decline by adopting this particular amendment.\n  Indeed, also, we have to understand that the majority of Medicare \nbeneficiaries between the ages of 65 and 67, who would be affected by \nthis amendment, have incomes below $30,000. They certainly would not be \nin a position to pay a $10,000 a year private insurance premium, as is \nevident in some States, like Illinois. Often they are single, poor, \nunemployed. They would have no recourse. And this is not the way to fix \nthe Medicare system--by denying health care insurance to people, by \nessentially pushing them out of the system of health care with the idea \nthat we will somehow stabilize and increase the longevity of our health \ncare system.\n  There is another aspect of this that should be studied much more \ndeeply before we embark on such a change; that is, many employers have \nprovided health care benefits to their employees until they reach the \nMedicare age of eligibility. As a result, if we were to push back the \neligibility table, we would require corporations throughout this \ncountry to immediately recognize, because of accounting rules, an \nincrease in their liability, a significant increase in their liability. \nThis could force them to rethink their overall health care strategy to \naccelerate the decline of health care not only for seniors but for \nworking Americans, as companies simply say, ``we can't afford to \nshoulder this burden any longer.'' As a result, we also, I think, have \nto recognize the significant impact this would have on the application \nof health care insurance throughout our society. As one employer wrote \nto me, ``The impact of this legislation will be to discourage companies \nfrom offering comprehensive retiree health benefits to their \nemployees.''\n  I think we have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we reform \nMedicare. We all want to stabilize the system, to ensure solvency. We \ncan do that without adopting this amendment. To move away from a \nguarantee of health care for seniors, beginning at 65, is a retreat \nthat I don't think we should make and I don't think we have to make. \nTherefore, I join my colleague from Illinois in objecting to this \nprovision of the bill before us today. I thank the Senator and yield \nback my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, for \nhis remarks. I want to really follow up on one of his last points. I \nsay to Senator Reed, I have in my hand a letter signed by some 80 \nbusinesses and business organizations objecting to the increase in the \nMedicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. These are not just a few odds \nand ends when it comes to the business profile of America. We not only \nhave a letter signed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but also the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, companies like ARCO and Bell \nAtlantic, Chrysler Corp., Ford, General Motors, and the list goes on \nand on. Making the point my colleague from Rhode Island made, they have \nalready made a commitment to their employees and it is this: We will \nprotect you with health insurance as a member of our family, our \ncorporate family, after retirement until\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\nyou are eligible for Medicare. Now, if we raise the Medicare \neligibility 2 years, these companies having made that commitment have a \nnew liability that they had not anticipated. It is not only a cost but \na disincentive to these and other companies to make that kind of \npromise. That is the real world. For people to see the simple symmetry \nbetween Social Security and Medicare--oh, it is going to 67 by the year \n2027 on Social Security, and let's go to 67 for eligibility on \nMedicare--is to overlook the real world that people live in. The \nemployees who are faced with troubling medical conditions late in their \nlives who may not have health insurance coverage, who cannot afford to \nbuy it at that point in their lives, where are they? Who speaks for \nthem in this Chamber? Who will stand up and say that these people \ndeserve protection and coverage? Well, we have it today--at least \nbeginning at age 65.\n  I hope that, in the name of balancing the budget and having some \nbudget impact in the next century, we will not throw away a basic \ncommitment to those in our country who have worked so long and so hard. \nI will be making a point of order at this point in the debate, unless \nothers would like to speak.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield one more time. The fact is that \nthis will create a significant system impact. For example, private \ncompanies may change their insurance packages, et cetera. There is \nanother impact, also. In this country, sick people--and I hope in this \ncountry they will still get care someplace. As a result, without the \nMedicare Program, they will be thrust upon the hospitals for \nuncompensated care and thrust upon--if they are low-income citizens--\nMedicaid programs or special programs at the State level. So as we hope \nto save at the Federal level, we very well may generate other costs, \nand perhaps larger costs, at local-State levels and in other insurance \nprograms. So, essentially, our commitment to Medicare, I feel, should \nbe maintained. I, again, concur with the Senator and thank him for \nyielding me this time to further comment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague. Senator Barbara Boxer of California \nand Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa could not be here for this debate, but \nthey wanted to have their names joined in support of our effort.\n  In conclusion, I will say that my colleague from Rhode Island brings \nhome the conclusion to this debate; that is, if we shirk our \nresponsibilities to these working families, if we walk away from a \nMedicare promise of over three decades, we will end up with people in \nunfortunate circumstances, many of them sick, presenting themselves for \ncare without any health insurance, without Medicare. Of course, most \nhospitals and most health care providers in this country will do their \nbest to treat them anyway. Then the cost of that care will be borne by \neveryone, borne by those who pay into insurance and those Government \nprograms that insure, as well. Unfortunately, people wait until they \nare in acute and critical conditions before they come to a hospital \nunder those circumstances. Then the care is more costly, and many times \nthey sacrifice their health and their lives. In the name of balancing \nthe budget, let us not include a provision raising the eligibility for \nMedicare that creates such a disadvantage and such pain and suffering \nfor so many working families across America. This is not an idea whose \ntime has come. This is an idea that should be shelved until our \ncommission working on the future of Medicare can come up with sensible \nsuggestions that really reflect the reality of the world that many \nseniors face today.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I understand that before I make my \npoint of order I must ask that all pending amendments be laid aside. I \nmake that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that section 5611 \nof the bill, S. 947, contains provision that produces no change in \noutlays or revenues during the required period of time and therefore \nviolates section 313 (b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 (c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the point of order, \nand ask that debate on the waiver be postponed until tomorrow following \nany votes ordered for tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nSenator's motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill before us today \nseeks to raise the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67. If we \nallow this increase to remain in the bill, we will be breaking a \ncompact made with millions of future beneficiaries. For 32 years, we \nhave said to working Americans ``pay into this program and we will \nprovide you with health security at age 65.'' During the drafting of \nthis bill, however, this promise was callously and capriciously cast \naside.\n  Proponents will claim that they are merely conforming the eligibility \nage for Medicare to that of its sister program, Social Security. Yet, \nthe manner in which we are approaching this change and the final \noutcome differ dramatically and dangerously.\n  First, it is important to note that the change in the age of \neligibility for Social Security, which begins to rise in 2003, was \nenacted in 1983. Therefore, individuals affected by the Social Security \nchange will have had a minimum of 20 years to adjust their retirement \nplanning. By changing Medicare at this late date, we are giving future \nbeneficiaries only 6 years notice to absorb in their retirement \nplanning a change that could eat up a significant portion of their \nretirement income, should they actually be able to purchase insurance. \nIt could also bankrupt them, if they are forced to go without insurance \nand suffer a devastating illness.\n  Second, under Social Security, individuals will still be able to \nreceive reduced benefits at age 62, the age of early retirement, if \nthey choose to retire before they are eligible for full benefits. Under \nthis proposal, however, senior citizens will be unable to receive any \nMedicare benefits until they reach the new age of eligibility.\n  A delay in eligibility for Medicare could throw millions of senior \ncitizens into the ranks of the uninsured. Unless we are willing to \nenact simultaneous insurance reforms to guarantee access to affordable \nand comprehensive coverage for this group, these senior citizens will \nbe forced to forgo health security in their retirement.\n  In 1992, employer-related retiree health plans paid for only 6 \npercent of health expenditures for persons over age 65. There is no \nreason to expect this number to increase. In fact, many employers are \nnow reducing or canceling retiree health coverage for both early \nretirees and Medicare-eligible retirees. According to one study, in \n1988, 62 percent of firms offered retiree coverage to those under age \n65, and 55 percent offered benefits to those eligible for Medicare. In \njust 4 years, by 1992, the numbers of firms offering retiree health \ncoverage had dropped nearly 10 percent in both categories--to 52 and 46 \npercent, respectively.\n  Members of the Corporate Health Care Coalition have ominously issued \na warning that this provision could hasten the loss of employer-\nsponsored coverage. In a letter of June 16, 1997, they state that \nraising the eligibility age ``. . . could cause many [companies] to \nmove to limit or eliminate their commitment to retirees.''\n  It is difficult to know why the Finance Committee proposed this step, \nsince it does not contribute a single penny toward their reconciliation \ninstructions. A change of this magnitude deserves careful study and \nplanning. The age of eligibility is precisely the type of issue that \nought to be considered by the National Bipartisan Commission on the \nFuture of Medicare, which this bill will create. To change the age of \neligibility suddenly, on the\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\nspur of the moment, on this reconciliation bill, is an unwise, \nunfortunate, and unnecessary attack on all senior citizens.\n  The provision also violates the Byrd rule because it does not affect \nspending within the budget window. We eliminated this proposal 2 years \nago, and Senator Durbin's point of order should strike it from the bill \nagain.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support removing the \nprovision on the increase in Medicare eligibility. I would like to see \nthat removed. This provision, as we all know, calls for increasing the \neligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67.\n  Throughout our negotiations on the bipartisan budget agreement, there \nwas no serious discussion--none--of increasing the eligibility age for \nMedicare. And, if there was, even the most casual discussion didn't \nwind up in the bill. So it wasn't believed in the contentious review \nthat it would be appropriate. Nor has this issue been the subject of \nhearings or serious debate in the 105th Congress. There is nothing in \nthe budget resolution that calls for dealing with the issue, as I said.\n  Nevertheless, the bill before us would increase the eligibility age \nfor Medicare and would do so without protecting the seniors aged 65 and \n66 to make sure that they will have access to affordable health \ninsurance as they age. Typically corporations now have men aged 65 to \noffer retirement in many cases, and that is the vulnerable age. If \nthere is an illness that befalls someone or they run into economic \ndifferences during that period of time, that is a very harmful \nexperience. I think it would be a serious mistake to do that without \nmaking certain that the those aged 65 and 66 are protected.\n  Before going further, I want to acknowledge that the Senators who are \nresponsible for this proposal are trying in good faith to confront the \nlong-term problems facing the Medicare Program. They deserve real \ncredit for that. I, too, would like to have a comprehensive review on \nMedicare.\n  I think we have made a good first step back when we finally had the \npolicy behind the development. That was to add years of solvency to the \nMedicare Program while we engaged in a comprehensive review. So this is \nnot the time, frankly, nor the place on our agenda to do that. So I \ndisagree with their approach.\n  My concern is that if we simply exclude 65- and 66-year-olds from \nMedicare, what do these folks do? At that age private health insurance \ncan be prohibitively expensive, if it is available at all. Without \nMedicare, these people may have nowhere else to turn.\n  Mr. President, I point out that more and more businesses are dropping \nhealth insurance coverage for their retirees. The trend has been \naccelerating in recent years, and it may well continue into the future.\n  I know lots of people who face retirement who want to engage in a \nbusiness or continue to work productively. But in almost no case can \nthey be assured that they are going to get private health insurance to \ntake them over if they wanted to go beyond Medicare protection. So \nprivate insurance doesn't look like it is a real course for those in \nthat 65-66 category.\n  It is a frightening prospect. I have never heard so many \nconversations from people about their concerns about health insurance. \nIt is a continuing subject. Notice that in job opportunities very often \nthe health insurance discussion is no longer one that is available. \nLots of small companies can't afford to provide it, and they don't.\n  So people are worried about the prospect of bankruptcies as a result \nof a catastrophic illness, about being put out on a limb and not \ngetting the coverage that they need. We know that hospital services in \nthis area are expensive. We also know that there has been a major \nchange in the psychology of our society; that is, people in their \nsixties no longer expect to be put out to pasture. They can do lots of \ngood things. Take it from an expert here, they can do lots of good \nthings. And they want to know that their health is protected.\n  So it is a scenario that could face millions of Americans if we are \nnot careful.\n  If the Congress decides, Mr. President, that the Medicare eligibility \nage should be changed, there are ways to protect senior citizens in the \nprocess. Some have suggested allowing uncovered seniors to pay a \nreasonable premium in return for Medicare coverage. Others have \nsuggested subsidizing private insurance or other options.\n  I am not advocating any single program at this point. My focus is \nthat we should not pull the rug out from millions of Americans without \nensuring that they have at least a basic safety net.\n  I also believe that a fast-track reconciliation bill is the wrong \nvehicle to be considering a fundamental change like this. For those who \nare not familiar with our terminology, ``fast track'' means get it \ndone, try to zip it through the place--not undercover but to try to get \nit done. The reconciliation bill is one that kind of commands an \nenforcement mechanism for achieving the objectives that we set out for \nourselves--in this case the balanced budget by the year 2002, to try to \nextend the solvency of Medicare, take care of legal immigrants who \nare here, to provide insurance coverage for children that are not \nensured.\n\n  Those are the missions that we encompass in this bill. They were \nnegotiated over a long period of time--several months. They were very \ndifficult negotiations--difficult not because we were at each other's \nthroat but because we tried to deal with reason and thought and arrived \nat a consensus that would take care of most of the needs that we \nprovide for our citizens, including a massive infusion into our \neducation programs to provide young people with opportunities for the \nfuture, and again to protect senior citizens who are perhaps \nimpoverished and can't afford increased premiums. Suddenly this is a \nnew factor introduced from the Finance Committee which is an amendment \nto the basic bill.\n  In addition to the limit on amendments to the reconciliation, it \nwould be very difficult even for Senators to consider fully various \noptions.\n  The proponents of rating the eligibility age in this bill argue that \nwe must act now to give Americans adequate notice about a change that \nis coming in the future. However, I would note that this bill includes \na commission to look at the long-term issues involving the Medicare \nProgram. The commission is required to report within 1 year of this \nbill's enactment. If the commission determines that a delay in the \neligibility age is required, Americans will have plenty of notice about \nthat possibility to be able to respond with their community and with \ntheir organizations. They will be able to send in considered opinions. \nI think we must do that.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will support the effort to remove this \nprovision from the reconciliation bill. It would be wrong to leave \nolder Americans without health care coverage. We certainly shouldn't do \nso on something that is going to move as rapidly as this is without an \nopportunity for having adequate public input and a full debate.\n  So, Mr. President, again I salute the effort of those who are \noffering the change because they think that it is essential for the \nsolvency and for the long-term survival of Medicare. But, on the other \nhand, if it is that important and that crucial, then we ought to make \nsure that we allow enough time and allow enough review to make certain \nthat the step we are going to choose is the correct one.\n  Mr. President, I see nothing is going on at this moment. I therefore, \nnote the absence of a quorum, and I ask that it be charged to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past several months, I have been \ndeveloping legislation to dramatically reform the way Medicare pays for \nhome health services. This effort builds on my work in the Finance \nCommittee during 1995 where I strove to see a prospective payment \nsystem for home health services included in the Balanced Budget Act \nagreement.\n  The culmination of this year's efforts is a bill I introduced on June \n16, the Home Health Care Prospective Payment Act of 1997 (S. 913). The \nHome Health Care Prospective Payment Act is intended to achieve three \nprimary goals:\n  First, the bill will create incentives for providers to behave in a \nmore cost effective manner.\n  Second, it will help assure that the federal government achieves the \nnecessary savings it seeks in order to ensure the solvency of the \nMedicare program well into the next century.\n  And third, perhaps most importantly, my bill accomplishes these first \ntwo goals while protecting the quality and continuity of home health \ncare services for beneficiaries.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have been a strong supporter of home \nhealth care services ever since I came to this body. I have applauded \nchanges that have made it easier to treat Medicare patients in the most \ncost-effective setting. The changes we have made to the system have \nbenefited many patients who would otherwise have not received care. In \nother cases, these individuals would have had to wait until their \nhealth deteriorated to the point of having to be admitted to a \nhospital. This outcome was neither cost effective nor good health care \npolicy.\n  We have learned a great deal about Medicare reimbursement since we \npassed the prospective payment system [PPS] for hospitals in 1983. We \nnow know the value of a proper transition period so that providers will \nbe able to manage their operations toward a permanent system.\n  We also know that we can model a payment system that encourages \nproviders to manage costs and utilization better. We realize that \nmoving to a new reimbursement system is a massive undertaking. The \namount of data, time, and expense is enormous. It is especially \nimportant not to unnecessarily burden health care providers, \nGovernment, or patients with administrative requests.\n  My legislation proposes to begin a transition to a home health care \nPPS immediately, rather than waiting until fiscal year 2000. Instead of \nrelying on cost limits, we can begin using predetermined rates in an \ninitial PPS system during fiscal years 1998 and 1999.\n  The principle behind prospective payment is to shift the risk from \nthe Government to providers. This is done by rewarding providers for \nkeeping their costs below the rates--or having them absorb the loss if \ntheir costs are over the rates. Therefore, I propose we incorporate a \nlimited shared savings plan during the initial 2 years of the PPS to \nencourage more cost effective behavior by health care providers.\n  In addition, there needs to be greater sensitivity to the data \ndemands and consequences in our proposal. For example, there needs to \nbe some discretion for the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to designate a different base year for extraordinary \nsituations that may arise in a particular case. There are other \nproposals that may be considered that might be good ideas in and of \nthemselves. Some proposals, however, may impose data, time, or cost \ndemands that are unnecessarily burdensome to providers, patients, or \nthe Government--but may not be necessary for PPS implementation.\n  The changes I am proposing in my legislation are not new to the \nSenate, but merely reflect the information and legislative history we \nhave gained through our consideration of Medicare payment reforms. My \nlegislation will make home health care reform consistent with that \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues I ask unanimous \nconsent that a section-by-section analysis of S. 913 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Provides a short title and a table of contents.\n       Section 2. Provides that amendments made by the Act are to \n     the Social Security Act.\n       Section 3. Provides for the recapture of savings from the \n     temporary freeze on payments for home health payments from \n     1994 to 1996 in updating home health costs limits for FY 1998 \n     and subsequent years.\n       Section 4. Provides for the establishment of an initial \n     prospective payment system for home health services beginning \n     in FY 1998. Payments would be based on rates equal to the \n     lower of--\n       Costs determined under the current reimbursement system \n     (revised to limit costs to 105 percent of the median of visit \n     costs for freestanding home health agencies and eliminating \n     annual rate updates); or\n       An agency-specific per-beneficiary annual limit based on \n     1993 cost reports, multiplied by the agency's unduplicated \n     patient census.\n\n     Annual limits for new providers would be based on an average \n     of limits applied to other home health agencies. Incentive \n     payments would be available to agencies equal to 50 percent \n     of the amount by which its year end reasonable costs are \n     below its per-beneficiary annual limit.\n       Section 5. Provides for the establishment of a permanent \n     prospective payment system for home health services beginning \n     in FY 2000. Payments would cover all services included in the \n     Medicare home health benefit, including medical supplies. In \n     determining payment amounts, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services would be required to determine an appropriate \n     unit of home health service, to provide for adjustments based \n     on variations in the mix of services provided, and to assure \n     continued access to quality services. Payments would be \n     subject to annual adjustments based on the home health market \n     basket index. The Secretary would be authorized to develop a \n     payment provision for outliers based on unusual variations in \n     the type or amount of medically necessary services.\n       Initial payment rates for a permanent prospective payment \n     system would be required to be developed in a manner that \n     would assure the achievement of the scorable savings of the \n     act.\n       Section 6. Provides for home health services to be \n     reimbursed on the basis of the geographic location where the \n     service is furnished.\n       Section 7. Provides for the elimination of periodic interim \n     payments for home health services upon implementation of a \n     permanent prospective payment system.\n       Section 8. Provides for limiting Part A coverage of home \n     health services to the first 100 visits following a hospital \n     stay. Clarifies coverage of intermittent and part-time \n     nursing care. Provides for the exclusion of the costs of home \n     health services from the calculation of Part B monthly \n     premiums. Provides a new definition of the term \n     ``homebound''. Authorizes the Secretary to deny coverage of \n     home health services which are in excess of normative \n     standards for the frequency and duration of care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6094-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6094-S6095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on June 16, 1997, I introduced legislation, \nS. 914, proposing to revise the present system in which the Medicare \nProgram pays for services provided by skilled nursing facilities \n[SNF's]. This legislation builds on my work in the Finance Committee in \n1995 when the committee included a proposal I authored to implement a \nprospective payment system for nursing home payments.\n  As currently structured under Medicare, seniors receive up to 100 \ndays of skilled nursing facility services following a 3-day \nhospitalization stay. Currently, those services are reimbursed on a \ncost-plus basis. As Medicare has evolved, however, so have systems of \ncost-plus reimbursement.\n  For many years, I have worked with my colleagues in the Senate to \nprovide seniors with the services they need in a skilled nursing \nfacility setting. I have worked to modify the Medicare reimbursement \nmethodology in order to provide economic incentives to SNF providers to \nprovide the highest quality of care at a reasonable and affordable \nprice to the Medicare Program.\n  My legislation will accomplish that goal.\n  Congress initially began requiring prospective payments for skilled \nnursing facilities in the early 1980's. However, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration [HCFA] has not been able to identify an \nappropriate payment methodology, and how best to define the services \nprovided to seniors in a comprehensive way. Nevertheless, we have come \na long way since the mid 1980's in understanding the proper\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\nstructure of prospective payment systems. We are now on the verge of \nfundamentally revamping the current cost-plus payment system for these \nimportant services.\n  Let me briefly describe the key parts of my legislation.\n  First, during fiscal year 1998, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration will begin phase one of a per diem, prospective payment \nsystem [PPS] for skilled nursing facilities. Such payment would be \nbased on historical data regarding a particular facility's costs and \nservices provided. While it is expected that the new rate is an all-\ninclusive rate, encompassing routine costs, ancillary services, and \ncapital-related expenses, during the first year, HCFA is likely to \nadjust both the inclusion of ancillary services and capital costs only \nwhen they have sufficient data to adequately measure and quantify the \nlevel of those services.\n  It would be unfortunate for HCFA to put into effect a system that did \nnot adequately account for the medical services offered to residents \nwithin a skilled nursing home. I urge HCFA to implement and include all \nancillaries only when the data and the information are adequate.\n  Second, during the 4 four years the prospective payment system will \nevolve into a full PPS system where the services for an individual in a \nskilled nursing facility bed will be adjusted for their medical and \nnursing needs. This legislation calls on HCFA to develop a case-mix \nmethodology that adequately reflects the medical needs of each patient. \nI have heard from many experts that the current case mix methodology \ndoes not adequately reflect certain medical needs of many skilled \nnursing home patients. It is my intention that the case-mix methodology \nbe current and reflect all services provided.\n  And third, once this system is in place, it will provide the right \nkind of economic incentives so that providers will seek all services \nmedically necessary. The Medicare Program will not be in a situation of \noverpaying for such services; it will provide a competitive balance so \nthat all skilled nursing services, regardless of whether they are \nhospital SNF beds or freestanding SNF beds, will have comparable \nincentives to provide high quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n  It is extremely important that we change the existing and limited \nincentives in the Medicare system so that providers will offer services \nin the most cost-effective way. Hospitals are already under a PPS \nsystem; physicians are reimbursed on a predetermined rate as well. This \napproach is now the next important step in our continuing effort to \nensure appropriate fiscal responsibility by the Federal Government \nwhile also ensuring that seniors have access to the important health \nbenefits offered under the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I have prepared a \nsection-by-section summary of my bill and I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Establishes a prospective payment system for skilled \n     nursing facility (SNF) services and provides for consolidated \n     billing of Part B services provided to residents of such \n     facilities.\n       Subsection (a): Provides for the establishment of a \n     prospective payment system for services covered by the \n     Medicare skilled nursing facility benefit, including routine \n     service, ancillary services (except diagnostic services), and \n     related capital costs, beginning with cost reporting periods \n     starting on or after July 1, 1998. Payment would be based \n     on per diem rates established by the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services.\n       Provides a four-year transition period for shifting the \n     calculation of payments rates from facility-specific historic \n     cost data to average national or regional costs. During the \n     first year of the new system, payments would be based on \n     facility-specific per diem rates. For the second through \n     fourth years, payments would be based on a blend of facility-\n     specific and federal rates. In the fifth year and thereafter, \n     payments would be based exclusively on federal per diem \n     rates.\n       Payments to new facilities would be based on federal per \n     diem rates.\n       Federal per diem rates would be determined by the Secretary \n     on the basis of 1995 cost data for all SNF settings and would \n     include an estimate of amounts that would be payable under \n     Part B for services furnished to SNF residents. Rates would \n     be adjusted by variations in wage levels and case mix and \n     could be computed separately for urban and rural areas based \n     on national or regional classification. Rates would be \n     updated annually by the skilled nursing facility market \n     basket index.\n       Federal payment rates would be applied to individual \n     facilities subject to adjustments for case mix and geographic \n     variations in labor costs. A method of making adjustments \n     based on case mix variations would be required to be \n     developed by the Secretary in the form of a regulation \n     subject to public notice and comment.\n       SNFs would be required to provide to the Secretary with \n     resident assessment data as may be necessary to develop and \n     implement per diem rates.\n       The Secretary would be required to develop an appropriate \n     method of applying a prospective payment system to Medicare \n     low volume SNFs and swing bed hospitals.\n       Subsection (b): Provides for consolidated billing of most \n     Part B services furnished to residents of a skilled nursing \n     facility, including services provided by other entities under \n     arrangement. Claims for such services would be required to be \n     submitted directly by the SNF and include a code or codes \n     identifying the items or services delivered. Payment would be \n     made to the SNF based on the Part B payment methodology (such \n     as fee schedules) applicable to the particular item or \n     service. Facilities would be permitted to reassign such \n     payments when the item or service was furnished by another \n     entity. Payments for therapy services would be required to \n     reflect the new salary equivalency guidelines for physical, \n     occupational, and respiratory therapy and speech-language \n     pathology after such guidelines are finalized through the \n     regulatory process.\n       The Secretary would be required to establish a medical \n     review process to examine the effects of the changes made by \n     the Act on the quality of skilled nursing facility furnished \n     to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6094-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6095-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6095-S6096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR FISCAL YEAR 1995--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 47\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As provided by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (Public \nLaw 92-463; 5 U.S.C., App. 2, 6(c)), I am submitting my third Annual \nReport on Federal Advisory Committees, covering fiscal year 1995.\n  Consistent with my commitment to create a more responsive government, \nthe executive branch continues to implement my policy of maintaining \nthe number of advisory committees within the ceiling of 534 required by \nExecutive Order 12838 of February 10, 1993. As a result, my \nAdministration held the number of discretionary advisory committees \n(established under general congressional authorizations) to 512, or 36 \npercent fewer than the 801 committees in existence at the time I took \noffice.\n  During fiscal year 1995, executive departments and agencies expanded \ntheir efforts to coordinate the implementation of Federal programs with \nState, local, and tribal governments. To facilitate these important \nefforts, my Administration worked with the Congress to pass the \n``Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995'' (Public Law 104-4), which I \nsigned into law on March 22, 1995. The Act provides for an exclusion \nfrom the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) for interactions between \nFederal officials and their intergovernmental partners while acting in \ntheir official capacities. This action will directly support our joint \nefforts to strengthen accountability for program results at the local \nlevel.\n  Through the advisory committee planning process required by Executive \nOrder 12838, departments and agencies have worked to minimize the \nnumber of advisory committees specifically mandated by statute. There \nwere 407 such groups in existence at the end of fiscal year 1995, \nrepresenting a 7 percent decrease over the 439 at the beginning of my \nAdministration.

A bill to provide for equal protection of the law and to \nprohibit discrimination and preferential treatment on the basis of \nrace, color, national origin, or sex in Federal actions, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n\n\n                      THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce the \nintroduction of the Civil Rights Act of 1997. President Clinton has \nasked for a national dialog on the issue of race in America. I applaud \nhis efforts and welcome this opportunity.\n  Any discussion of race must begin with the basic principle that all \nare created equal. In fact, the Constitution, our Nation's most \ncherished document, mandates that all individuals receive the equal \nprotection of the laws.\n  No one in our history understood the principle of equality better \nthan the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Reverend King spoke \neloquently about a time when people would be judged by the ``content of \ntheir character'' and not the ``color of their skin.'' He, like so many \nof us do today, prayed for America to become a colorblind society.\n  This fundamental principle of equality is the foundation for the \nCivil Rights Act of 1997, which declares that: the Federal Government \nshall not discriminate against or grant a preference to any individual \nor group based on race, color, national origin, or sex.\n  The Federal Government must lead by example. We must promote a nation \nwhere our citizens are seen as individuals and not as mere members of a \ngroup. We must declare that the immutable traits of race and sex will \nnot be relevant in Federal contracting and employment. Simply put, the \nFederal Government should not decide who gets the contract or who gets \nthe job based on race and gender.\n\n\n            No Winners in a World of Government Preferences\n\n  Throughout our nation's long history, we have established that \ncertain immutable traits should be irrelevant in life. Yet, in direct \ndefiance of this principle, the Federal Government has engineered \npolicies and programs to award valuable Federal dollars, jobs, and \ncontracts to individuals based on the immutable traits of race and \ngender. In fact, last summer, the Congressional Research Service found \nthat the Federal Government runs approximately 160 race and gender \npreference programs.\n  These preference practices and programs serve to divide, rather than \nunite. There are no winners in a world of government-sponsored set-\nasides and quotas.\n  First, Government preferences harm the very ones it seeks to help. \nMinorities who receive affirmative action preferences are often \nstigmatized and stereotyped. And, the stigma doesn't stop with those \nwho receive the preferences. The cloud also unfairly hovers over the \nheads of all the other minorities whose accomplishments are not based \non their race or gender, but purely on merit. All of this serves to \nreinforce group stereotypes at a time when we so desperately need to \nmove beyond division.\n\n  Second, every time the Government grants a preference to one person \nbased on race or gender, it discriminates against another based on race \nand gender. Discrimination by any other name is still discrimination. \nAnd, it still strikes at the very heart and soul of the person being \ndiscriminated against.\n  Let me put a face on this discrimination, as reported recently in the \nWall Street Journal:\n\n       Michelle Doe is a 16-year-old girl and a straight-A student \n     from a humble background in Corpus Christi, TX. She decided \n     that she wanted to go to summer camp. The camp was called \n     Camp Planet Earth, and was funded by the Federal Government's \n     National Science Foundation.\n       Michelle applied and became a finalist. Her hopes were \n     dashed, however, during the interview stage where it became \n     clear that she wasn't eligible for the camp. Why wasn't she \n     eligible? Was it her grades? No, she was a straight-A \n     student. Was it her application form? Did she forget to \n     answer a question on her application? No.\n       Michelle was denied the opportunity to go summer camp \n     because of her race. You see, ``the program was for \n     `minorities' only,'' and Michelle was not a minority.\n\n  In the words of the Wall Street Journal, ``[w]hen Michelle went \nlooking for some productive way to spend her summer, she soon \ndiscovered that the government divides people according to skin \ncolor.''\n  Third, race and gender preferences create a downward spiral of \ndivision and animosity in our national melting pot. Government \npreferences put individuals into little group boxes and then pit them \nagainst each other. African-Americans against Hispanic-Americans \nagainst Asian-Americans against Caucasian-Americans.\n  Some have even gone so far to calculate the amount of money that one \nrace owes to another. For example--and I promise that I'm not making \nthis up--Richard America, a lecturer at the\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\nGeorgetown University School of Business, has written a book that he \ncalls, ``Paying the Social Debt: What White America Owes Black \nAmerica.'' According to the Washington Post, Mr. America has estimated \nthat ``White America Owes Black America'' five to ten trillion dollars.\n  With all due respect to Mr. America, I cannot imagine a mentality \nthat is more un-American. Our Nation cannot survive and thrive with \nthis type of ledger sheet mentality. Justice Scalia summed up this \npoint very poignantly in Adarand, and I quote:\n\n       Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial \n     discrimination should be made whole; but under our \n     Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor \n     or debtor race. * * * In the eyes of the government, we are \n     just one race here. It is American.\n\n\n Courts and the American People Understand the Danger and Divisiveness \n                         of Racial Preferences\n\n  The courts and the American people understand the danger and \ndivisiveness of racial preferences.\n  First and foremost, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial \npreferences deserve the most exacting and strict scrutiny. In the \nlandmark case of Adarand, the Court ruled that racial preferences will \nbe allowed to stand only where they meet a compelling government \ninterest that is narrowly tailored to redress specific past \ndiscrimination.\n  Just this month, the district court in Adarand ruled that the Federal \nhighway construction program at issue in that case did not meet the \nSupreme Court's strict scrutiny standard and, thus, violated of the \nequal protection clause.\n  Second, lower courts, including the third, fourth, and fifth \ncircuits, have recently struck down affirmative action programs. \nAdditionally, a panel of the ninth circuit has upheld the decision of \nthe California voters to ban preferences in California State \ngovernment.\n  Last, and most importantly, the American people understand that \npreferences forever defer the dream of a colorblind society. Public \nopinion polls show that large majorities of Americans oppose racial \npreferences, including a large percentage of minorities. For example, a \nrecent Washington Post-ABC News survey showed that not even a majority \nof African-Americans favor preferences.\n  A recent Zogby poll asked Americans about their view of this \nlegislation. The question asked ``Would you support a federal law to \nban discrimination and preferential treatment in the government?'' An \noverwhelming 83 percent of Americans stated that they would support \nsuch a law, including 79 percent of African-Americans.\n  The American people and the courts understand this issue and I am \nhopeful that the Congress and the President will understand this issue \nas well as they do.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The President said over the weekend that he wants to ``break down the \nbarriers in our lives, our minds, and our hearts.'' The President must \nrealize that the Federal Government has to take the lead in removing \nthese barriers. He must realize what the American people know--that \nis--race and gender preferences serve only to raise barriers and to \nwiden the breach.\n  I firmly believe that, in a matter of years, we will look back upon \nour Government's current race and gender preferences and shake our \nheads and wonder how we could have ever allowed such discriminatory and \ndivisive practices to occur for so long. The Civil Rights Act of 1997 \nis the next step in our Nation's struggle to overcome discrimination \nand to achieve unity as a nation of individual Americans, not groups.\n  We must provide genuine opportunities to all disadvantaged \nindividuals, regardless of race or gender. These opportunities can \nbecome a reality through a comprehensive empowerment strategy that \nincludes: strict enforcement of the laws against discrimination, court-\nordered remedial action for victims of specific acts of discrimination, \nand targeted outreach and recruiting efforts to encourage all qualified \nminorities to apply for Federal employment and contracts. We must also: \nimprove our education system through competition and school choice, \nprovide economic opportunities through reduced regulatory and tax \nburdens, move more and more persons from the welfare roll to the \npayroll, and finally, make the streets safer for every American child.\n  I would like to close today by quoting Ward Connerly, who so \nvaliantly led the fight in California to end discrimatory preferences. \nIn his recent letter to the President, Mr. Connerly wrote:\n\n       For the American experiment with democracy to succeed and \n     for every American to have an equal chance to compete to \n     fulfill our dreams, it will be necessary for the factory \n     worker, the bus driver, the police officer, the fire \n     official, the secretary, and all other Americans to embrace \n     the principle of equality and to believe fervently in the \n     proposition that ``race has no place in American life or \n     law.''\n\n  I also want to say a special word of gratitude to Senators Hatch, \nKyl, and Sessions for their co-sponsorship of this civil rights \nlegislation. Their leadership and integrity will be invaluable in our \nfight for all Americans to be treated as equal in the eyes of the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution \n     guarantee that all individuals are entitled to equal \n     protection of the laws, regardless of race, color, national \n     origin, or sex;\n       (2) the Supreme Court, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. \n     Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), recently affirmed that this \n     guarantee of equality applies to Federal actions;\n       (3) the Federal Government currently conducts over 150 \n     programs, including contracting programs, that grant \n     preferences based on race, color, national origin, or sex; \n     and\n       (4) the Federal Government also grants preferences in \n     employment based on race, color, national origin, or sex.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for \n     equal protection of the laws and to prohibit discrimination \n     and preferential treatment in the Federal Government on the \n     basis of race, color, national origin, or sex.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENTIAL \n                   TREATMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the \n     Federal Government nor any officer, employee, or agent of the \n     Federal Government shall--\n       (1) intentionally discriminate against, or grant a \n     preference to, any person or group based in whole or in part \n     on race, color, national origin, or sex, in connection with--\n       (A) a Federal contract or subcontract;\n       (B) Federal employment; or\n       (C) any other federally conducted program or activity; or\n       (2) require or encourage a Federal contractor or \n     subcontractor, or the recipient of a license or financial \n     assistance, to discriminate intentionally against, or grant a \n     preference to, any person or group based in whole or in part \n     on race, color, national origin, or sex, in connection with \n     any Federal contract or subcontract or Federal license or \n     financial assistance.\n\n     SEC. 4. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PERMITTED.\n\n       This Act does not prohibit or limit any effort by the \n     Federal Government or any officer, employee, or agent of the \n     Federal Government--\n       (1) to encourage businesses owned by women and minorities \n     to bid for Federal contracts or subcontracts, to recruit \n     qualified women and minorities into an applicant pool for \n     Federal employment, or to encourage participation by \n     qualified women and minorities in any other federally \n     conducted program or activity, if such recruitment or \n     encouragement does not involve granting a preference, based \n     in whole or in part on race, color, national origin, or sex, \n     in selecting any person for the relevant employment, contract \n     or subcontract, benefit, opportunity, or program; or\n       (2) to require or encourage any Federal contractor, \n     subcontractor, or recipient of a Federal license or Federal \n     financial assistance to recruit qualified women and \n     minorities into an applicant pool for employment, or to \n     encourage businesses owned by women and minorities to bid for \n     Federal contracts or subcontracts, if such requirement or \n     encouragement does not involve granting a preference, based \n     in whole or in part on race, color, national origin, or sex, \n     in selecting any individual for the relevant employment, \n     contract or subcontract, benefit, opportunity, or program.\n\n     SEC. 5.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the following definitions apply:\n       (1) Federal government.--The term ``Federal Government'' \n     means executive and legislative branches of the Government of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Preference.--The term ``preference'' means an advantage \n     of any kind, and includes a quota, set-aside, numerical goal, \n     timetable, or other numerical objective.\n       (3) Historically black college or university.--The term \n     ``historically Black college or university'' means a part B \n     institution, as defined in section 322(2) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061(2)).\n\n                 The Civil Rights Act of 1997--Summary\n\n       The Civil Rights Act of 1997 is designed to bring the \n     Federal Government into compliance with the Equal Protection \n     Clause of the United States Constitution, and to ensure that \n     the federal government treats all people equally, without \n     regard to their race or sex.\n       The bill contains two main operative provisions:\n       (1). Prohibits the Federal Government from discriminating \n     against, or granting preferences to, individuals based in \n     whole or in part on race, color, national origin, or sex, in \n     connection with federal contracts, employment, or other \n     programs or activities.\n       (2). Prohibits the Federal Government from requiring or \n     encouraging federal contractors, subcontractors, licensees, \n     or recipients of federal assistance, to discriminate, or \n     grant preferences to individuals on the basis of their race, \n     color, national origin, or sex.\n       The Act defines ``preference'' as ``an advantage of any \n     kind'' including quotas, set-asides, goals, timetables, and \n     other numerical objectives.\n       The bill expressly protects the Federal Government's \n     ability to engage in outreach, recruiting, and marketing \n     efforts--the original form of affirmative action.\n       The bill maintains the full range of judicial remedies \n     currently available to proven individual victims of race or \n     sex discrimination.\n       The bill contains exemptions for historically Black \n     colleges and universities, Indian tribes, and for sex-based \n     bona fide occupational qualifications that are already exempt \n     under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or applied in \n     the Armed Forces.\n       The Act requires the heads of each department or agency to \n     modify all existing policies and regulations to comply with \n     the Act and report to the Senate and House Judiciary \n     Committees the results of the modification.\n       The Act is limited to Federal Government actions and would \n     not affect voluntary programs adopted by State and local \n     governments, or private sector entities.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last year, I stated on the Senate floor \nthat ``our country stands at a crossroads on the path it travels in \nrelations among the different races and ethnic groups that make up the \nAmerican people. Down one path is the way of mutual understanding and \ngoodwill; the way of equal opportunity for individuals; the way of \nseriously and persistently addressing our various social problems as \nAmerica's problems. * * * Down the other path is the way of mutual \nsuspicion, fear, ill will, and indifference; the way of group rights \nand group preferences.''\n  I am proud to stand today with my colleagues in the House and the \nSenate, and others who have worked so hard for the cause of equal \nopportunity, to announce the introduction of the Civil Rights Act of \n1997. The act represents our best efforts to recommit the Nation to the \nideal of equal opportunity for every American--to emphasize that we \nmust resist the temptation to define the Nation's problems in narrow \nracial terms, and rather must roll up our sleeves and begin the hard \nwork of dealing with our problems as Americans, and as fellow human \nbeings.\n  Of course, our critics will imply that those of us who today reject \ndivisive racial preferences and distinctions do so because we \nunderestimate the social, economic, and discriminatory obstacles some \nAmericans face. President Clinton, for example, told his audience in \nSan Diego last week that ``[t]he vast majority of [Californians who \nsupported that state's Proposition 209] did it with a conviction that \ndiscrimination and isolation are no longer barriers to achievement.'' \nBut that is just plain wrong.\n  To the contrary, last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee we heard \nfrom a panel of ordinary citizens who movingly told us of their \nexperiences with discrimination in America. Among them was a Chinese-\nAmerican mother from San Francisco, Charlene Loen, who told us how her \nyoung son Patrick was denied admission to an elite public magnet \nschool, Lowell High School, because he is Chinese. The school \ndistrict's efforts to ensure diversity among its students led it to \nemploy a system of racial preference that had the effect of capping \nChinese enrollment in many of its schools, forcing Chinese children to \nscore much higher on entrance exams than children of other races. At \nvirtually every public school Ms. Loen approached, she was first asked \nwhether Patrick was Chinese, and when learning that he was, would \ninform Ms. Loen that Patrick need not apply. The Chinese quota was in \neffect full. Ladies and gentlemen, that is not the promise of America.\n  There should be no question that discrimination indeed continues to \ndeny opportunities to too many Americans. At the Judiciary Committee's \nrecent hearing we heard from black Americans, white Americans, Asian-\nAmericans, and even a victim of an outrageous hate crime. But the \nquestion that we all must answer is whether one American's racial \nsuffering should be valued above another's. It is a question that will \nonly become more complicated and more urgent as our population grows \never more diverse.\n  As we in the Judiciary Committee now know, when we prefer individuals \nof one race, we must by definition discriminate against individuals of \nanother. But America's great social divide can never be crossed until \nwe begin the work of building a bridge of racial reconciliation. By \nsaying today, with the introduction of this act, that the Federal \nGovernment stands for the principle that racial discrimination in all \nits forms is wrong, we hope to take a small step forward on the path to \nhealing the Nation's racial wounds by recognizing that every American \nis equal before the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMarlene ``Molly'' Burke of Rutland, VT. After 40 years of dedicated \nservice to the teachers and students of Vermont, Molly has decided to \nretire.\n  Molly began her distinguished career, inspired by her father, in 1956 \nat Pittsford High School when she was 22 years old. After a summer \nabroad, she taught at Essex Junction High School for a short while, \nthen moved to Proctor High in 1959. In 1964, she began teaching at my \nalma matter, Rutland High, where she remained for three decades. Molly \ntaught history in the classroom, however her interaction with her \nstudents did not end in the classroom. Molly coached cheerleading, and \ndirected class plays as well. Her commitment to excellence and \ndedication to the students beyond normal classroom hours is in the \nfinest tradition of Vermont's educational system.\n  It was in recognition of her excellence that the Vermont teachers \nelected Molly president of the State chapter of the National Education \nAssociation in 1989. She moved to Montpelier where she headed the \nlargest teachers union in Vermont because she believes that people \nshould be treated fairly and equally and she made enormous efforts to \nimprove the working conditions within all of Vermont's schools.\n  Molly Burke embodies what all educators should strive to achieve. \nOnce again, I would like to extend my thanks for her service to Vermont \nand best wishes in her retirement.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article from June 2, 1997, in the \nRutland Daily Herald be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, June 2, 1997]\n\n                             Goodbye, Molly\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Here in history class, Rutland High teacher Marlene Burke \n     is relating the story of a seemingly hapless rookie \n     instructor of 40 years ago.\n       Miss Reichelt, age 22, taught English, math and social \n     studies, coached cheerleading, directed class plays, snuck \n     short afternoon naps and spent long nights marking papers and \n     lesson plans, all for $8,000 a year.\n       Miss Reichelt, barely afloat by June, decided to bail out. \n     Escaping to Europe, she capped her summer with a startling \n     revelation:\n       She was born to teach.\n       Burke laughs at the punch line. Before she married, she was \n     Miss Reichelt. She gave the classroom another chance. It, in \n     return, gave her a career.\n       Burke has taught history for four decades, three of them at \n     Rutland High. Colleagues elected her president of the state's \n     7,000-member teachers union three times from 1989 to 1995. \n     She now heads the association's 200-member local arm.\n       Call her The Unsinkable Molly Burke. But exactly 40 years \n     after first leaving the classroom, the teacher has decided to \n     do it again.\n       She's retiring.\n       ``I love what I do,'' she says, ``but I think it's time.''\n       Burke's career was inspired by her father, a German \n     immigrant who believed in the American dream.\n       ``He said with education you can do everything, without it \n     you can do nothing,'' she recalls.\n       Burke entered public school after graduating from the \n     parochial St. Michael's High School in Montpelier and Trinity \n     College in Burlington. She started teaching Sept. 4, 1956 at \n     Pittsford High, long since replaced by Otter Valley union \n     High in neighboring Brandon.\n       Students couldn't pronounce ``Miss Reichelt,'' so she wrote \n     a few hints on the chalkboard:\n       Rye (like bread)\n       Kelt (like felt)\n       They worked too well.\n       ``Some of them would spell it Ryekelt.''\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n       Miss Reichelt returned from Europe to teach at Essex \n     Junction High before marrying Robert Burke and moving to \n     Proctor High in 1959 and Rutland High in 1964.\n       Make that the ``old'' Rutland High. Burke taught at the \n     Library Avenue campus until 1989, when Vermont teachers \n     elected her president of their chapter of the National \n     Education Association. Moving to Montpelier, she headed the \n     state's largest teachers union for six years.\n       ``Working conditions are big issues with teachers,'' she \n     says. ``I believe people need to be treated fairly and \n     honestly.''\n       (U.S. Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., confirmed the union's \n     influence in an impromptu comment last week: ``Teachers can \n     really move things if they get together--Molly Burke can tell \n     you that.'')\n       When Burke returned to Rutland High in 1995, her colleagues \n     had moved to an $8.7 million facility on Stratton Road.\n       Times had changed from her days at Pittsford High, where \n     her old classroom featured a bulletin board.\n       ``I used to try to change it at least twice a year.''\n       Burke's new classroom has a bulletin board--and a computer \n     with e-mail, a telephone with answering machine, a television \n     with video-cassette recorder.\n       ``The good old days.'' she concludes, ``were terrible.''\n       Burke may teach the past, but she touts progress. She likes \n     today's longer class periods. Today's collaborative contract \n     negotiations. And, an occasional nose ring or tongue stud \n     aside, today's students.\n       ``They say kinds have changed--they really haven't. Kids \n     are kids. There were kids who misbehaved then, there are kids \n     who misbehave now. Most of them are good.''\n       Burke teaches a 130-year period of American history from \n     the end of the Civil War to the end of the Cold War. For her, \n     the last half isn't a lecture, it's her life.\n       ``I remember exactly where I was when Kennedy was \n     assassinated, when the space shuttle Challenger blew up . . . \n     I try to give the kids the facts, and then bring in the \n     emotions because I lived through it. I think it brings it \n     alive.''\n       And sparks questions. Take a recent lesson on the Vietnam \n     War.\n       ``One of my 16-year-olds said, You were alive then? You \n     were teaching school?' I could have been talking about the \n     Peloponnesian War.''\n       That happens right up to Reagan's election in 1980--the \n     year most of her juniors were born.\n       ``I always say, `You remember when . . .' Of course, they \n     don't.''\n       That's why students must study.\n       ``If you don't learn from history, you're condemned to \n     repeat it.'' she says, paraphrasing the famous quote.\n       Several of Burke's past students are parents of her present \n     students. Alumni also sign her paycheck. Michael Dick, class \n     of 1966, is president of the School Board. David Wolk, class \n     of 1971, is school superintendent.\n       Although graduates always recognize her, she doesn't always \n     recognize them.\n       ``You had one history teacher for a year,'' she replies. \n     ``You forget I had 120 students a day.''\n       They also forget she has a life outside the classroom. \n     Burke recalls shopping with her son and daughter when a \n     student approached.\n       ``She said, `Whose are these?' She never thought of me as \n     anything but a woman in a room teaching history.''\n       (Let alone a grandmother to a 2-year-old boy.)\n       Retirement will bring the former Miss Reichelt full circle.\n       ``I want to go to Europe,'' she says, ``and out West, and \n     ski in the middle of the week, and not get up at 6 o'clock.''\n       Once more she won't be teaching history.\n       ``I'll be living it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6101-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AHEPA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nAmerican Hellenic Educational Progressive Association [AHEPA], which is \ncelebrating its 75th anniversary this year. The AHEPA, whose mission is \nin part, ``To promote good fellowship, and endow its members with a \nspirit of altruism, common understanding, mutual benevolence, and \nhelpfulness to their fellow man,'' is an important organization with a \nstrong chapter, district 10, located in my home State of Michigan.\n  In 1922, the AHEPA was formed in response to antiimmigrant sentiments \ndirected toward United States immigrants of Greek descent. The AHEPA's \nprimary goal was to help newly arrived Greeks become United States \ncitizens and to share in the civic life of our country. To do so, the \nAHEPA formed schools which taught English and the principles of \nAmerican government to new immigrants. In the process, the AHEPA also \nhoped to educate all Americans about the significant heritage and \ncontributions immigrants of Greek descent add to the American \ncommunity.\n  Today, the AHEPA is an international organization with chapters in \nAustralia, the Bahamas, Canada, and Greece, as well as the United \nStates. There are more than 1,000 chapters in North America alone, \ncomprised of more than 60,000 members. The AHEPA promotes goodwill and \npositive relations between these countries by providing significant \nfinancial resources to a number of civic-improvement programs. These \ninclude charities, scholarships and other educational programs, \ncultural activities, athletic programs, local Greek communities and the \nchurch, and patriotic activities. Membership is not limited to people \nof Greek descent, although most members do share that ancestry.\n  The AHEPA has counted many notable political leaders as members, \nincluding former Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and \nformer Vice Presidents Hubert Humphrey and Spiro Agnew. Several Members \nof this body are or were members of AHEPA, including my good friend \nfrom Maryland, Paul Sarbanes, and a man we all deeply miss, the late \nPaul Tsongas from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive \nAssociation is truly a remarkable organization. Born out of the need to \nhelp new Greek immigrants assimilate into American culture, today the \nAHEPA encourages all of us to aspire to great things, to help those in \nneed and to strengthen channels of communication between cultures. I \nknow my colleagues will join me in saluting the men and women of the \nAHEPA and its auxiliaries for 75 years of commitment and \ndedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6102-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6102-S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FLOODING BRINGS TRAGEDIES TO IDAHO\n\n Mr. CRAIG.

As the natural disaster rages through \nIdaho, as the communities band together, as we strive to save lives and \nproperty, we now must struggle with the reality that these men lost \ntheir lives, and CWO Shellby Wurthrich, with A Company, 1st-183 \nAviation Battalion Army National Guard of Boise, is still fighting for \nhis life.\n  These distinguished men had served their State and communities \nbefore. Major Baxter, a full time Guardsman, received many decorations, \nincluding the State of Idaho Emergency Ribbon in support of the Fire \nSuppression in 1994. Lieutenant Neal, a cattleman, received amongst his \nnumerous decorations, the Army Commendation Medal, Army's Achievement \nMedal, National Defense Service Medal, and twice Army Reserve Component \nMedal. He was also airborne qualified.\n  A neighbor who saw the crash, without fear for her life, Ms. Sherry \nLang, risked her own life to rescue Chief Warrant Officer Wurthrich \nbefore the helicopter exploded into flames. The heroism she displayed \nexemplifies the spirit of a community pulling together.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Wurthrich, recipient of the Army Commendation \nMedal, Army's Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, twice, \nArmy Reserve Component Medal, and many other decorations, is today \nbeing transferred to a burn treatment center in Utah. We pray for his \nstrength during his recovery and ask everyone to remember him in the \nweeks and months to come.\n  As we mourn for the deceased, we mourn our loss and we sympathize \nwith the sorrow of the bereaved. We search for the good things to \nremember as solace. Most of the richness of the human experience is in \nwhat is handed down from one to another--not things of wood and stone, \nbut memories of what they did or said or felt.\n  We must remember and emulate these individuals for the best of their \nlives. As National Guardsmen, they sought out opportunities to \nsafeguard and help the people of Idaho, in times of disasters and \ndistress. With every mission, they risked of danger and injury. \nUltimately, they gave their lives in helping their neighbors and their \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\n  This is why Idaho mourns their deaths and grieves with their families \nand understand their loss, for it is our loss, too. We will remember \nthem and their heroic efforts. Life ends, but memories live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/23/senate-section/article/S6102-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 950\n\n  Mr. ROTH.
