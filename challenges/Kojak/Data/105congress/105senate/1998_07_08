Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2676, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 2676, an act to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to restructure and reform \n     the Internal Revenue Service, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if my colleagues' July Fourth recess was \nanything like mine, then they heard a great deal from their \nconstituents concerning the bill that we bring to the floor today. The \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 is \nlegislation that not only has the interests but the support of \nAmericans everywhere, and with good reason.\n  For far too long, the Internal Revenue Service has been allowed to \nconsolidate immense power without the counterbalance of accountability. \nFor far too long, the agency has been allowed to operate in darkness, \nhiding behind section 6103 authority, using authority granted them by \nCongress to, in some cases, bludgeon taxpayers.\n  Last summer, the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, \nfollowing an extensive review of the IRS, issued a report that called \nfor major changes to the agency.\n  In September, the Finance Committee held 3 days of hearings which \nidentified numerous additional problems and some terrible, even \nunconscionable taxpayer and IRS-employee abuses within the IRS.\n  Those hearings were followed by others which demonstrated clearly \nthat\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nthe Service was in need of serious reform. And we heard from taxpayers, \ntax collectors, tax practitioners. We heard from small business men and \nwomen. We heard from innocent spouses. And we listened to outrageous \nstories from innocent Americans who, for no valid reason, got caught in \nthe crosshairs of an organization that was driven by quotas and lacking \nin oversight.\n  Our outrage knew no partisan line. Colleagues on both sides of the \naisle were offended by many of the stories. To the witnesses--many of \nwhom testified without knowing what their efforts would bring--we \napologized as best we could. We said that we would press forward, and \nwe promised reform. That, Mr. President, is what we are delivering \ntoday.\n  This is the bipartisan conference agreement on a plan that will \neffectively change the way the Internal Revenue Service does business. \nIt represents the most comprehensive overhaul of the IRS ever enacted. \nIt combines the House and Senate bills and incorporates the many good \nsuggestions offered by the Agency's new Commissioner, Charles Rossotti.\n  Let me be clear on just how important Mr. Rossotti has been to our \nefforts. Following our Finance Committee hearings, he had courage \nenough to release a report that validated the concerns we raised. \nRather than try to throw up a wall or confuse issues, he made a \ncommitment to reform. Every step we have taken he has taken with us.\n  Commissioner Rossotti and I have met on many occasions, and he has \ntestified before our committee. We have attended taxpayer service days \ntogether. He has advocated a new management plan that could \nrevolutionize the way the Internal Revenue Service does business.\n  I am also grateful for the taxpayers and the many current and former \nIRS employees who came before our committee. These were courageous \nindividuals, and without them, there would be no reform. And they \nrepresent only a fraction of those who met with us, who wrote to us, \nwho called, and, in the process, moved our investigation forward. \nLikewise, I am grateful to my colleagues--Senator Moynihan, a defining \npresence in the Senate, if ever there was one. I am grateful to \nSenators Charles Grassley and Bob Kerrey and their efforts on the \nNational Restructuring Commission.\n  Working with Congressman Portman, and others, they got the ball \nrolling early on, and were leaders in this effort. I thank Chairman \nBill Archer for the work he did on the Ways and Means Committee, for \nthe spirit of cooperation he brought to the conference, and for the \nsuccess he had two weeks ago in getting this legislation approved \noverwhelmingly in the House.\n  Now, the time has come, Mr. President, to pass it here--legislation \nthat will open the door to real restructuring and reform of what can \nonly be considered the most powerful agency in the United States \ngovernment.\n  This legislation is built on four principles:\n  The first principle is to establish independent oversight of the \nagency to prevent abuses against taxpayers and against employees. One \nof the major concerns we heard throughout our oversight initiative was \nthat the taxpayers who get caught in the IRS hall of mirrors have no \nplace to turn that is truly independent and structured to represent \ntheir concerns. This legislation requires the agency to establish an \nindependent Office of Appeals--one that may not be influenced by tax \ncollection employees or auditors.\n  Appeals officers will be made available in every state, and they will \nbe better able to work with taxpayers who proceed through the appeals \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, agency employees made it clear that there is no \ndependable and consistent mechanism in place to represent taxpayer \ninterests. Just as this bill will give the appeals process greater \nindependence, it will also make the Office of Taxpayer Advocate as well \nas local problem resolution officers more independent.\n  In the future, the Secretary of Treasury, rather than the \nCommissioner will appoint the National Taxpayer Advocate. And the \nTaxpayer Advocate will be just that. Criteria to fill this position \nwill include that the Advocate must not be an IRS employee two years \nbefore and five years after holding this position. In addition, this \nbill provides the Advocate with greater ability to issue an assistance \norder to help taxpayers.\n  To ensure that independent review and accountability become part of \nthe IRS culture--top to bottom--our legislation creates a nine-member \nIRS Oversight Board--a board composed of six experts from various \nprofessional fields in the private sector, the Commissioner, the \nSecretary of Treasury, and a full-time Federal employee, or a \nrepresentative of employees. This board will be independent of \ninfluence from management and the senior executive corps. It will be \nable to monitor and hold managers and executives accountable for their \nactions, and the actions of their employees.\n  Under our legislation, the Oversight Board will have broad \nresponsibility and will ensure that the IRS has procedures in place to \ncarry out its mission. I anticipate that the Board will be able to nip \nproblems in the bud so that the IRS will not have to endure \nembarrassing Congressional hearings that expose systemic problems that \nshould have been identified and addressed.\n  These measures will go a long way toward protecting taxpayers and IRS \npersonnel. To further protect IRS employees, this legislation creates a \nnew Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. We heard far too \noften in our hearings that the current IRS Office of Chief Inspector \ndoes not have sufficient independence to adequately fulfill its \nobligation. Likewise, the current Treasury Inspector General lacks \nresources and has experienced problems of its own in providing seamless \noversight of the agency.\n  The new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will have greater \nindependence than the IRS Chief Inspector.\n  This provision is supported by Secretary Rubin and Commissioner \nRossotti, and it will create a structure where the new Treasury IG for \nTax Administration will not allow oversight to fall through the cracks. \nThis new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will provide independent \ninvestigations of alleged IRS employee misconduct without management \ninterference.\n  The new Treasury IG will also respond in a timely manner to requests \nto investigate or audit made by the Commissioner or the IRS Oversight \nBoard.\n  Now, these measures will go a long way toward combating the \nintimidating culture that witnesses testified exists within the agency. \nThey will provide independent protections and promote an agency that \nthe public trusts--an agency that the employees can be proud of.\n  The second principle incorporated in this legislation is to hold IRS \nemployees accountable for their actions and to reward those who treat \nthe taxpayer fairly. One of the problems we discovered in our hearings \nis that the Commissioner did not have the kind of authority that is \nnecessary to streamline management and remove managers who contaminate \nthe culture of the agency. Additionally, we found that the Commissioner \ndoes not have sufficient authority to hire those who will work toward \nmaking the kinds of changes that are necessary.\n  This legislation changes that. It provides the Commissioner the tools \nhe needs to hire top-flight managers who are experts in their field. It \ngives the Commissioner the wherewithal to transform the agency's work \nforce by providing bonuses and other incentives, and to sufficiently \ndiscipline employees whose inappropriate actions harm the image and \neffectiveness of the agency.\n  This bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if it is proven \nthat the employee willfully failed to obtain required authorization to \nseize a taxpayer's property, committed perjury material to a taxpayer's \nmatter, or falsified or destroyed documents to conceal the employee's \nmistakes with respect to a taxpayer's case. It allows terminations to \ntake place if an IRS employee engages in abuses or egregious \nmisconduct.\n  Conditions for which an employee can be dismissed include, but are \nnot limited to, assaulting or battering a taxpayer or other IRS \nemployee, violating the civil rights of a taxpayer or other IRS \nemployee, or breaking the law, regulations, or IRS policies for the \npurpose of retaliating or harassing a\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\ntaxpayer or other IRS employee. Our legislation also allows an employee \nto be fired for willfully misusing section 6103 authority to conceal \ninformation from Congress.\n  As I have said before, an environment that allows employees guilty of \nthese kinds of behaviors to continue to work within the system is not \nacceptable to me, the Finance Committee, or to the American people. We \nhave heard enough excuses. The time has come for change. And this \nlegislation allows needed changes to take place.\n  The third principle advocated by this legislation is to ensure that \ntaxpayers are protected, that they have due process during collections \nactivities. This includes requiring the IRS to obtain court approval \nbefore seizing a home.\n  It also ensures that the burden of proof be lifted off the shoulders \nof the taxpayer when it's appropriate and placed on the agency. It \nallows necessary and long-overdue reforms to the interest and penalty \nsystem. This will guard taxpayers against the outrageous and often \noverbearing financial liability that occurs when the agency moves too \nslowly.\n  With this legislation, the burden of proof is shifted to the IRS if \nthe taxpayer maintains records, cooperates with the agency, and \nprovides credible evidence to the court. In addition, the IRS will have \nthe burden of proving a taxpayer's income if it uses arbitrary \nstatistics to determine that income.\n  Another major taxpayer protection in this legislation is our \nprovision to strengthen innocent spouse relief. Some of the most tragic \nstories our committee heard concerned innocent spouses whose lives have \nbeen ruined by the unrelenting pursuit of IRS collections officers.\n  This legislation allows divorced or separated spouses to elect to \nlimit their liability for a tax deficiency to the amount of the tax \nthat is attributable to their income. In this way, they will not be \nheld liable for income earned by their spouse. Beyond expanding \ninnocent spouse relief, this legislation allows the Secretary of the \nTreasury to provide equitable relief if innocent spouse relief is \notherwise unavailable. It makes relief retroactive to help those \ninnocent spouses who are still being hounded by the IRS.\n  Let me say, however, that relief will not be available in cases of \nfraud, or if the IRS proves the taxpayer claiming innocent spouse \nrelief had actual knowledge of an item giving rise to the tax \nliability.\n  Beyond this, with this legislation, we make necessary and important \nchanges to how penalties and interest are applied. In order to prevent \nIRS employees from arbitrarily using penalties as leverage against \ntaxpayers, this bill requires non-computer determined penalties to be \napproved by management.\n  Furthermore, each notice to taxpayers which includes a penalty or \ninterest must specify how the amount was calculated. If a taxpayer \nenters into an installment agreement, the monthly failure-to-pay-\npenalty is cut in half.\n  Under this bill, if the IRS does not provide a notice of deficiency--\nor other form of notification of the specific amount of taxes due--\nwithin eighteen months after a return is timely filed, then interest \nand penalties will be suspended until the taxpayer is actually \nnotified.\n  This eighteen month period will be reduced to twelve months in the \nyear 2004, as the agency improves its ability to notify taxpayers of \ntheir deficiencies. In this way it is the IRS, not the taxpayer, who \nbears the burden of IRS delay.\n  These enhanced rights are meant to protect honest taxpayers. We do \nnot excuse those who evade their responsibility or cheat on their \nincome tax returns. The protections contained in this legislation \nexclude the failure to file, failure to pay, and penalties related to \nfraud.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the fourth principle this legislation \nadvances is to provide the Commissioner the tools necessary to take the \nIRS into the 21st century. It directs Commissioner Rossotti to \neliminate the current national office, regional office and district \noffice structure of the IRS.\n  It gives him the authority to replace these antiquated management \nmodels with operating units that will directly serve particular groups \nof taxpayers, better meeting their needs and making the agency much \nmore efficient and user-friendly. As I have said before, Commissioner \nRossotti should be complimented on his tremendous work and managerial \nskills. His plan to restructure the agency is as bold as it is \nnecessary, and this legislation gives him the authority he needs to \nmove forward.\n  And moving forward is what this legislation is all about--to usher \nthe IRS into a new era of accountability--to provide taxpayers with the \nprotections they deserve--to bring efficiency and modern management to \nan organizational structure that dates back to before the industrial \nage. With this legislation, we bring a promise of hope to honest \ntaxpayers and hard-working employees who have waited far too long. We \nbring responsibility and greater openness.\n  We focus on the need for service and fairness. With this legislation, \nCommissioner Rossotti will be able to transform the IRS, make it more \neffective and intolerant of corruption and abuse of power.\n  I appreciate all the work that has gone into this bill--for the many \nhours and weekends given by Senators, Congressmen, and staff. \nParticularly, I want to thank Frank Polk, Mark Prater, Tom Roesser, \nMark Patterson, Nick Giordano, and our committee investigators.\n  I want to thank Lindy Paull, and the staff on the Joint Tax \nCommittee--Barry Wold, Mel Schwarz, Cecily Rock and Mike Udell. Again, \nI am grateful to Senator Moynihan--for his leadership and dedication to \nthis cause. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwho stood firm for legislation with teeth--who, in seeking change, \ndemanded real change--real reforms. That's what we offer today. I am \nproud of this bill. Americans have every reason to celebrate. They have \nlet their desire be known, and, Mr. President, they have been heard.\n\n\n                     Sec. 1101-IRS Oversight Board\n\n  Mr. President, there has been substantial debate on whether a \nTreasury employees union representative should have a designated seat \non the IRS Oversight Board. I agree with many of my colleagues that a \nrepresentative of IRS employees should not be provided a position on \nthe IRS Oversight Board because such member would be subject to a \nsubstantial conflict of interest. I did not include an IRS employee \nrepresentative on the IRS Oversight Board in my original chairman's \nmark. However, the members of the Finance Committee voted to include an \nIRS employees representative on the board and to waive the criminal \nconflict of interest laws for this particular board member. Amendments \nto these provisions were considered by the full Senate and defeated.\n  During conference negotiations, the Department of Justice opined that \n``The employee-representative restriction in the bill would \nimpermissiby limit the President's appointment power in violation of \nthe Constitution.'' The Department of Justice suggested alternative \nlanguage to avoid the Constitutional problem. In response to the \nConstitutional problems raised by the Department of Justice, the \nconferees agreed that one member of the IRS Oversight Board shall be a \nfull time Federal employee or a representative of employees. The \nconferees also incorporated Justice's recommendation that this board \nmember receive the same compensation as other board members who are not \ngovernment employees. The Department of Justice also recommended that \nthe employee representative should not be exempt from the conflict of \ninterest laws. As a compromise, the conferees agreed to delete the \nprovision which would exempt the employee representative from the \nconflict of interest laws. However, at the time of nominating this \nparticular board member, the President could seek a waiver of the \ncriminal conflict of interest laws to the extent such waiver is \nnecessary to allow such member to participate in the decisions of the \nBoard.\n  Waiving criminal conflict of interest laws for one person is a very \nserious matter and should not be taken lightly. As such, the bill \nrequires the President to submit a written intent of waiver along with \nthe actual waiver language to the Senate with the nomination of such \nmember. I anticipate that the President would seriously consider the \nramifications of nonminating\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\nan individual with inherent conflicts of interests. If, in the \nPresident's judgment, such an individual must be on the IRS Oversight \nBoard, the President must submit a written statement of intent to waive \nthe criminal conflict of interest laws. To be effective, the waiver \nmust be provided verbatim with the nomination of such individual.\n\n  While I would have preferred the language in my original chairman's \nmark, this conference agreement addresses the competing concerns of my \ncolleagues as well as the Constitutional problems raised by the \nAdministration.\n  In September 1997 and April 1998, the Finance Committee held several \ndays of oversight hearings regarding IRS practices and procedures. \nThese eye-opening hearing revealed improper and inappropriate IRS \npractices and in some situations violation of the law. I, along with \nthose taxpayers who watched the hearings, was shocked and deeply \ntroubled with the practices of the IRS. I believe that proper oversight \nby Congress and the Administration should have reduced or even \nprevented such activity from occurring. One of the most important \nfunctions of the IRS Oversight Board is to prevent taxpayer abuse. The \nOversight Board must have access to information that will enable the \nboard to reveal problems, bring problems to the attention of the \nCommissioner to address, and inform Congress if the Commissioner does \nnot address problems. The Oversight Board should have ``big picture'' \noversight authority over law enforcement activity, including \nexaminations, collection activity, and criminal investigations. \nTaxpayers must be protected from improper and/or illegal activity. \nHopefully, the Oversight Board, rather than a congressional committee, \nwill nip problems in the bud and keep the IRS on a straight course.\n\n\n              Sec. 1102--Commissioner and Other Officials\n\n  The bill alters the reporting relationship between the IRS Chief \nCounsel and the Treasury General Counsel. The bill requires the IRS \nChief Counsel to report directly to the Commissioner except for the \nextremely limited situations where an issue relates solely to tax \npolicy. It is intended that ``tax policy'' would be limited to \nrecommendations relating to tax legislation and the drafting of \ntreaties. The Chief Counsel will report to both the Commissioner and to \nthe Treasury General Counsel with respect to tax litigation and legal \nadvice or interpretation of the tax law not relating solely to tax \npolicy. In the rare circumstance where there is a dispute between the \nCommissioner and the Treasury General Counsel, the matter must be \nsubmitted to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary for resolution. The \nCommissioner, as the client, must be able to make a decision based upon \nthe legal advice provided by the Chief Counsel. Neither the Treasury \nGeneral Counsel nor any other Treasury official (other than the \nSecretary or Deputy Secretary) may overrule the Commissioner's \ndecisions. The Secretary or Deputy Secretary may not delegate this \nauthority to someone else. For example, the Commissioner should be able \nto decide whether to proceed with a litigation matter or recommend that \na case be appealed. If the Treasury General Counsel disagrees, then the \nissue should be resolved only by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. \nFurthermore, the Commissioner should have the ability to interpret the \ntax law and issue guidance in various forms. The Commissioner should be \nable to expeditiously issue guidance including regulations, revenue \nruling and revenue procedures, technical advice and other similar \nmemoranda, private letter rulings and other published guidance. Once \nagain, if there is a disagreement between the Commissioner and the \nTreasury General Counsel, the issue must be resolved by the Secretary \nor the Deputy Secretary.\n\n\n      sec. 1103--treasury inspector general for tax administration\n\n  The bill transfers the IRS Office of Chief Inspector's function to a \nnew Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration which will \nprovide more effective and efficient oversight over the IRS. The \ncurrent system in which the Treasury Inspector General, with its \nlimited resources and tax expertise, attempted to provide oversight \nalong with the IRS Office of Chief Inspector which some believed lacked \nsufficient independence from management, simply did not provide \nadequate and independent oversight. I was appalled with the current \nsystem which allowed issues to fall through the cracks, included little \nor no ability to follow up on issues, or even to timely investigate \nmedia allegations of outrageous taxpayer abuse.\n  The time has come to provide a new, credible Treasury Inspector \nGeneral for Tax Administration which has the resources and expertise to \nindependently audit and investigate problems within the IRS. Coupled \nwith the IRS Oversight Board and a new more independent National \nTaxpayer Advocate, this provision in the bill will provide yet another \ncheck on the bureaucracy within the IRS to ensure that taxpayers and \ntheir problems don't slip through the cracks. While the vast majority \nof IRS employees are honest, hardworking, and law-abiding, enhanced \noversight will help ensure that taxpayers are treated properly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in the first instance to thank \nour revered chairman, Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nwho brings this measure to the floor with the unanimous vote of the \nFinance Committee. From the first, ours has been, under his direction, \na nonpartisan effort to deal with a nonpartisan issue of the first \norder of consequence. We are equally, in turn, grateful for the work of \nthe National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. \nSenators Kerrey and Grassley of our committee and Congressmen Portman \nand Coyne from the House side contributed significantly to shaping the \nconcept of the Internal Revenue Service as a customer-based agency, as \nthey put it.\n  I believe, sir, that we have done this. We have done it with the aid \nand the cooperation and the participation of Chairman Bill Archer and \nranking member Charles B. Rangel of the Committee on Ways and Means in \nthe House, who worked with us on the committee of conference. Senator \nRoth was chairman. And the result before you is an exceptional piece of \nlegislation--and not an everyday event.\n\n  The Internal Revenue Service became a permanent part of our \ngovernment in 1862 as part of the Civil War Income Tax Act, which was \nsigned into law July 1, 1862, by President Abraham Lincoln. That was \nalmost a century and a half ago. Yet it was not until just last \nSeptember that the full Finance Committee of the Senate exercised its \noversight jurisdiction to ask, how is this enterprise working and where \nis it going? The hearing illustrated the need for changes at the IRS \nand encouraged the thinking on the subject which has produced the \nmeasure we bring before you today.\n  As evidence of the process already underway by the unanimous \nconfirmation of this body, Mr. Charles O. Rossotti became the \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue. This was a stroke of administrative \ninspiration by Secretary Rubin, who went out into the private sector \nlooking not for a tax lawyer--an honorable profession; normally the \nCommissioners of the IRS have been tax lawyers--but instead for an \nadministrator. He found the head of a large company that specialized in \ninformation services of a wide variety, and who was prepared to do this \nas a public service and not to continue in the line that has been of a \nparticular profession, the practice of tax law.\n  We have established an IRS oversight board of six private persons, \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, and the representative of the IRS \nemployees, and finally the Commissioner of the IRS itself. The board \nwill be responsible for setting the strategic direction and goals of \nthe agency, while the Commissioner will continue to manage day-to-day \noperations. The Finance Committee--and then the Senate--specifically \nvoted to include the Secretary and employee representative on the \nboard.\n  The conference agreement, which maintained this arrangement, passed \nthe House by a vote of 402 to 8. With the Secretary of the Treasury on \nthe board, the board will know things it cannot otherwise learn. The \nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury is a world figure. His presence on the \nboard gives it stature within the Government and with the public. The \nfear was that otherwise it would lapse into a sort of advisory mode \nthat would fail to serve the objectives of this ``reform and \nrestructuring'' legislation.\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\n  We are pleased that the agreement maintains the position on the board \nfor a representative of the IRS employees. The representative will be \nable to work cooperatively on the inside rather than working in \nopposition from the outside.\n  An ongoing problem is how to attract top executives to a government \nactivity which has its counterpart in the private sector where \ncompensation--if I may use that term--is often very high, if not indeed \nexorbitant, because the amounts of money involved are very large.\n  So to recognize the disparity between government and private sector \nsalary structures, the conference agreement adopted the Senate \nprovision authorizing the appointment by the Commissioner of up to 40 \npersons to critical positions for 4-year terms with an annual \ncompensation equivalent to the pay of the Vice President of the United \nStates; that is to say, currently $175,400. These will be persons \nchosen for their particular skills. They will be there for a 4-year \nperiod. They will be departing the private sector for an interval of \npublic service at something approaching the salaries they normally \nenjoy.\n  Other provisions will permit the establishment of a new performance \nmanagement system focused on individual accountability, and allow for \nthe creation of an incentive award system bringing the IRS into \ncontemporary management modes--out of the model of the civil service \nthat was developed a century ago when we set up the Civil Service \nCommission, again establishing grades for employees with salaries that \nwere low, but careers that were guaranteed for life. That effort was \nvery controversial at that time. I can record that two Senators from \nNew York State resigned from the Senate when the newly elected \nPresident appointed a collector of customs in the port of New York of \nwhom they did not approve. One was Roscoe Conkling; the other, Thomas \nP. Platt. Mr. Conkling was no friend of civil service reform and once \nobserved that when Dr. Johnson declared patriotism to be the last \nrefuge of a scoundrel, he underestimated the potential of reform.\n\n  And yet reform didn't come about, a century passed, and we found that \nthe system had not the internal energies to change itself, to adapt to \nnew technologies and new management modes. We hope the IRS will with \nthese new arrangements--the infusion of new people, and a clear \nunderstanding that we expect the system to be open, innovative, and \n``user friendly,'' in the term the chairman frequently used in our \nhearings. And we shall see.\n  There are several other measures, Mr. President. I should point out \nthat the conferees were heroic in their determination not to include \nall manner of extraneous or narrowly-applicable provisions, as is often \nthe case in a tax bill but is not the case, with very few exceptions, \nin ours.\n  There are two provisions in the conference report, however, that are \nof special interest to the Senator from New York. The first adopts the \nSenate provision for a complexity analysis requirement. It requires the \nstaff of the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide an analysis of the \ncomplexity and administrative issues associated with tax legislation \nreported by the Finance Committee and Ways and Means Committee. The \nprovision is intended to provide notice, prior to floor consideration, \nabout provisions that have widespread applicability and may be unduly \nburdensome for taxpayers to understand and comply with, or difficult \nfor the IRS to interpret and administer, or both.\n  I might interject that when this was before us in the Finance \nCommittee, the distinguished chief of staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation said that she looked forward to this, but that she was fearful \nas to whether the joint committee could begin this complicated effort \nso long as it was burdened with the task of determining which items in \ntax legislation were subject to the line-item veto, a detailed and \nexhaustive analysis of every tax bill, which was a new responsibility \nfor the joint committee. I am happy to say, in the weeks since that \nexchange took place, the Supreme Court has dutifully and properly \ndeclared the line-item veto to be unconstitutional. So one of the \nunintended consequences--I cannot imagine the Court had this very much \nin mind--is that the joint committee is now in a position to begin a \ntype of analysis which is new to American legislation.\n  We are in the practice of having an increasingly complex Tax Code. \nThere can surely be no question that we are dealing with the problems \nthat we found in the Internal Revenue Service because the Internal \nRevenue Service has to administer a Tax Code that is frequently \nincomprehensible. An almost priestly hierarchy understands its meanings \nand can work them through the tax courts and such like. But to the \npublic and, too, the Congress, they are often simply incomprehensible.\n  I remember standing on this floor a year and a half ago with an 800-\npage tax bill, Mr. President, and that was the only copy of the tax \nbill on the Senate floor, which we were about to vote for 92-8. A copy \nprovided to the distinguished chairman had been promptly appropriated \nby the Budget Committee to see if there were any budget points of \norder, and so the one copy was here on this desk, and Senators on both \nsides of the aisle would come up and ask whether a provision they had \nan interest in was in the bill, and I would say, ``I hope in good \nspirit I can find out, but what will you pay me?'' Indeed, there was no \nother way for the Senator to learn. And this is not an unusual event.\n  I am going to say this not once but twice because we have to start \nattending to our own behavior in these matters. I was one of the \nparticipants in the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This was a \nwonderful, collegial experience led by our good friend and former \ncolleague, Senator Packwood, along with Senator Chafee, Senator \nDanforth, a ``core group,'' as we called ourselves, of about six of us. \nWe would meet for coffee at 8 o'clock every morning in Senator \nPackwood's office, and it would be my job, rather as the dean in a \ncathedral, to provide a reading for the morning. I would make sure I \ngot the Wall Street Journal early, and without a great deal of effort I \nwould find the advertisements where you would see a little classified \nad which would say, ``Rocky Mountain sheep, guaranteed losses.'' And \nthe Wall Street Journal would tell you how you would be certain to lose \nmoney in such a manner that the code would eventually reward you for \nyour losses, which is an interesting game to play if you are interested \nin C notes but not a very productive form of economic activity.\n  Well, we cleaned up that Tax Code. We brought the rates down from, \noh, half a dozen income tax rates to 28 percent and 15 percent--two \nrates. We did ``base broadening'' as the term was; more and more income \nbecame subject to taxation, so the rates of taxation could be lowered. \nAnd when it was all over, to our surprise and rather to the \nconsternation of the tax bar, you might say, we had, indeed, produced a \nfairly simple and comprehensible Tax Code. That was 1986--1986, Mr. \nPresident.\n  What you have before you, sir, what we have in the Senate before us--\nand my revered chairman will know this better than anyone else \npresent--we have the 65th public law to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nsince the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We have passed 65 tax bills. That \ncomes to about six a year. If you were assigned that task, you would \nsay it would be impossible to achieve; it would be asking too much of \nour staffs and our Members. But we have done this heroic, if absurd, \ntask, and it has to be said again that simplification is the essence of \njustice and efficiency in the code. We are a large, complex economy, an \ninternational economy. We are not going to have a simple code, but \nthere is no reason we should have an incomprehensible one, particularly \nwhen the complexities often reflect the influence of special interest \nin the code.\n  In this regard, not many weeks ago we heard testimony from one of our \nNation's most distinguished and accomplished economists, Murray \nWeidenbaum, who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \nin the administration of President Reagan. I served with him in the \nadministration of President Nixon. At that time he took it upon himself \nto explain and popularize the idea of revenue sharing--get Federal \nrevenue out to cities and States, let them decide\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\nhow to spend it, and reduce the dependency on administrative judgments, \ndecisions, and statutes here in Washington. That was a very fine idea \nwhich we lost to the budget deficits of the 1980s.\n  But Murray Weidenbaum made a powerful point, coming from a powerful \nmind. He said, if you spend all your income, the American Tax Code is \nsimple. You just fill out a one-page form: I made $50,000 last year, \nspent $50,000; I made $100,000, I made $100 million--God in heaven \nknows there are some who do--but I spent it all, and my taxes are as \nfollows. It is only when you begin to save that the Tax Code gets \ncomplicated.\n  Of course, our largest economic question right now is the rate of \nsavings in the American economy. The fact that we have large trade \ndeficits basically reflects that we are importing capital. We have the \nlowest savings rate of any industrial country in the world--or any \nprime industrial country of which I am aware. It is quite striking. I \nwould not argue this is the principal factor, but it is the fact that \nif you save money you can get in trouble with the Internal Revenue \nCode. Whatever else, that should not be the case. It is the case.\n  I think the complexity analysis, particularly if it is directed with \nthis kind of issue in mind, has the potential of a very important \ninnovation in the development of tax legislation. Don't expect it to \nchange anything in the next 3 or 4 years, but in 20 years' time we \nmight find that this small provision in this large legislation had \nlarge consequences.\n  One other item. In the interval since this legislation was agreed to, \nthe majority and minority leaders have created a special committee on \nthe year 2000 problem, with a hurry-up reporting date. But during the \nFinance Committee's consideration of the bill, Commissioner Rossotti \nspecifically noted, in a six-page letter, that some of the changes the \nchairman has described in such admirable detail would overburden the \nIRS's ongoing efforts to upgrade its computers to allow for the century \ndate change. In time we came to see the need for the effective-date \nchanges he recommended--and Secretary Rubin reinforced this in a \ntypically succinct one-page letter. We have, in the main, accommodated \nthe Commissioner in this regard. I think this is probably the first \nstatutory recognition of the year 2000 problem, which we are going to \nknow a lot more about in very short order.\n  Now, briefly, a few matters of concern. Contrary to the unanimous \nopposition of the tax profession, this legislation includes a provision \nthat shifts the burden of proof in civil cases from the taxpayer to the \nIRS. We all live in the real world and no one on the surface would ever \nthink it right that the burden of proof be on a taxpayer, not the \nGovernment. But reality can be different. Four former IRS \nCommissioners, who appeared on a bipartisan panel before the committee, \ntestified that shifting the burden of proof would cause more harm than \ngood to the taxpayer. Similar sentiment was expressed by dozens of \nprofessors of tax law. Their concern is that this provision will result \nin more intrusive IRS audits, create additional complexity and \nlitigation, and create confusion for taxpayers and the IRS as to when \nan issue needs to be resolved in court and when the burden has shifted. \nI recognize the political popularity of the provision, but I fear it \nmay actually prove to work against the taxpayer. Be warned--persons who \nhave the best reason to be impartial in their judgment have said this \nis not going to help, it is going to make things yet more difficult.\n  Another provision certain to cause confusion and to lead to \nadditional litigation with the IRS is the expansion of the privilege of \nconfidentiality to tax advice furnished by accountants. This new \nprivilege may be asserted in noncriminal tax proceedings before the IRS \nand in Federal courts. However, like the current attorney-client \nprivilege, information disclosed for the purposes of preparing a new \ntax form is not privileged and the conference agreement precludes \napplication of the expanded privilege to written communications to a \ncorporation ``in connection with the promotion of the direct or \nindirect participation of such corporations in any tax shelter.'' This \nis a right that most taxpayers will never be eligible to assert, and \nmany will be surprised to learn about its limitations.\n  One provision that the bill does not include, and should, is the \ncorrection of a drafting error in the 1997 act which gives a windfall \nto the few estates in this country with a value of more than $17 \nmillion. It costs nothing to fix, and the joint committee estimates \nthat the failure to correct this error would cost taxpayers $900 \nmillion in the next 10 years. The Senate bill fixed it. But somehow the \nconferees could not reach agreement.\n  Finally, Mr. President, and possibly most important, I direct the \nSenate's attention to a modest, but hugely significant, semantic \ntriumph that has been included in this legislation.\n  Section 5003 of the conference agreement replaces in U.S. trade law \nthe confusing 17th century phrase ``most-favored nation,'' which begins \nwith the French phrase ``la nation la plus favorisee.''\n  We now replace that term with the plain American term ``normal trade \nrelations.'' This relieves the President and the Congress of the burden \nof having to ask, why is this typically not-very-popular country being \nmade a most-favored nation?\n  Why, for example, is there now a dispute about whether Vietnam should \nbe given most-favored-nation status? Of course, it is not most-favored \nnation; it simply means you get the same treatment that the most-\nfavored nation, some other nation most favored, gets. It is antique \nusage that immediately confuses everyone involved, and now we will be \nable to say we propose ``normal trade relations.'' It is plain English \nand avoids the needless misunderstandings that have accompanied that \nother term.\n  I do not want to overburden the Senate with detail, but the most-\nfavored-nation concept is well over 700 years old. It has been traced \nby historians to a clause in the treaty of November 8, 1226, in which \nFrederick II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, conceded to the city of \nMarseilles the privileges previously granted to the citizens of Pisa \nand Genoa. Not greater privileges, but merely the same.\n  The term itself is perhaps a little more recent. The first use that \nwe can come across specifically is in the treaty of 1659 between France \nand Spain, which guaranteed that the subjects of each sovereign, while \nin the realm of the other, would be treated as the most-favored nation. \nAgain, the phrase ``le plus favorablement,'' or in modern French, ``la \nnation la plus favorisee''--having the same rights as were granted the \nEnglish and the Dutch.\n  In the main, the usage has become counterproductive. It confuses the \npublic as to what is being proposed. I think it is fair to say \nsometimes it confuses the Congress as well, and we are well to be rid \nof it. I think it is past time and, if I may say, this is a matter that \nthe Finance Committee has had in mind for some while. The distinguished \nand revered chairman and I introduced legislation last year for this \npurpose, and now we see it about to become law.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy, and I have said my \npiece on the matter. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from Nebraska wish to speak?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am prepared to proceed.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am going to speak about 10 minutes. Will that be an \ninconvenience to the Senator, or does he have to get somewhere?\n  Mr. KERREY. One of the things I want to do, and I will be pleased to \nstep aside for 10 minutes, I want to engage in a short colloquy with \nthe distinguished Senator from New York on this bill. I will try to be \nas brief as possible and then yield back to the Senator. I have a \nlonger statement I will make on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. One of the things the Senator from New York has \nreferenced--and I will later in my remarks praise both he and the \nchairman of this committee for what they have done in bringing this \nlegislation to the floor--one of the things the Senator referenced in \nhis comments was the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Indeed, this bill, it should \nbe noted by colleagues,\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\namends that act. So this would be the, I guess, the 65th tax bill we \nhave passed since 1986.\n  I wonder if the Senator from New York can engage briefly in a \ndiscussion for the benefit of the Senator from New Hampshire and for \nthose who happen to be watching this debate. One of the things that we \nstruggle to do as citizens is to understand what it is that the \ngovernment is doing and why.\n  Under our constitutional authorities as a Congress we have a whole \nrange of things we are charged with doing. One of the most difficult \nthings we are charged with doing, once we have decided we are going to \nhave a government of any kind at all, is we have to collect taxes and \nwhat to use those taxes for and we then have to decide who is going to \npay the taxes, and we write the law accordingly. We then distribute the \nmoney to the various agencies of government that we previously created.\n  I wonder if the Senator from New York, with his understanding of the \nrest of the world, can talk a little bit about how much we take for \ngranted our capacity to voluntarily collect. We have a voluntary system \nof tax collection, unlike many other nations on Earth.\n  I know right now one of the most difficult problems, for example, \nthat the newly democratic Russia is facing is their capacity to collect \ntax revenues in sometimes a not-so-voluntary fashion.\n  I wonder if the Senator can talk a little bit about the \nconstitutional issues of us raising the taxes to pay for the government \nand the importance of our being able to maintain a voluntary system of \ntax collection.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I certainly will. I will be succinct, because nothing \ncould be more clear.\n  The United States is blessed with a citizenry that pays its taxes on \ntime and in full. There are exceptions, but we do it voluntarily. \nTechnically, we self-assess; we decide ourselves what we owe the \ngovernment. The rate of compliance is very high.\n  Up until just recently, and it is just beginning to change, for \nexample, in the United Kingdom, which we associate with and we think of \nas a free society, and it certainly is, the subjects of the queen did \nnot decide how much taxes he or she owed; the queen decided. They were \nsent a bill. You are free to contest it in court, and you can contest \nit in court the rest of your life, but you still have to pay the bill.\n  So the idea of complexity in this system, making it so difficult to \nknow what it is you owe jeopardizes a precious institution, which is \nthe faith of the public in the good intentions and performance of the \ngovernment itself. That, I think, was one of the reasons the Kerrey \nCommission called for the reforms that are in this legislation of the \nIRS. You can have an openness and a sense that things are on the level \nhere and government is doing the right thing.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator for delaying his exit from the floor. \nI appreciate very much that reference.\n  Mr. President, I believe this piece of legislation goes to the heart \nof our capacity to maintain government of, by and for the people. Our \nrepublican form of government is at risk if people feel they are not \ngetting a fair shake with this voluntary system of collection.\n  Congressman Portman and I cochaired this restructuring commission. We \nnoted U.S. tax collection is the most efficient in the world. Less than \nhalf of a percent of the total revenues collected is in cost. In the \nface of mounting criticism, problems, it seems to me it is very \nimportant to make certain that as we write the laws that will determine \nhow this money is collected, that we not throw the proverbial baby out \nwith the bathwater. We have problems, and this legislation attempts to \ncorrect the problems. But underneath these problems is a relatively \nefficient system of collecting taxes that enables the citizens to fund \ntheir Government, and in a relatively efficient fashion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Indeed.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join with what I am sure will be \nnumerous Senators in congratulating the Senator from Delaware and the \nSenator from New York and the Committee on Finance for bringing forward \nthis exceptionally good bill which is truly timely.\n  Many of us, as we have tried to help folks out in our States, have \nrun into situations where people have been treated in ways which can \nonly be described as abusive by the Internal Revenue Service, where the \nInternal Revenue Service has gone way beyond the appropriate action for \nthe purposes of collecting the revenues of the country and has treated \nAmerican citizens in a way that you might expect were they to be living \nin a police state instead of in a democracy.\n  In my experience, probably one of the worst cases I have ever seen of \nGovernment excesses involves a family known as Barron in New Hampshire. \nThat family, unfortunately, got into some tax trouble, failed to pay \nits taxes, and the IRS, in an appropriate way, attempted to collect \nthose taxes--at least appropriately at the beginning. But then it got \ncarried away. And as a result of getting carried away, it put that \nfamily through an extraordinary trauma, to a point where Mr. Barron \nended up committing suicide. And his wife, Shirley Barron, who is now \nresponsible for the family, found herself in a situation which was \nbeyond all reason, which was untenable and which was horrible.\n  A lien had been put on her house. Her children's bank accounts had \nbeen taken. Her bank accounts had been taken. The IRS was even making \nit impossible for her to pay her electric fee, her utility fees. This \nall occurred after a time period when they thought they had reached an \nagreement with the Internal Revenue Service. They thought an \nunderstanding had been reached, and, in fact, an understanding had been \nreached. Then the IRS, in a manner which can only be called bait and \nswitch, backed out of that agreement and assessed them with even more \npenalties and interest. And on an original tax bill which was, I \nbelieve, somewhere in the vicinity of $20,000 or $40,000, they ended up \nwith an obligation, according to the Internal Revenue Service, of \nmultiple hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  It was a situation which was so horrendously handled that it \nliterally drove Mr. Barron to commit suicide, destroyed the lives of \nthis family. And it has become a cause celebre in New Hampshire, and to \nsome degree nationally. It would be terrible in and of itself, because \nthere is really nothing we can do as a Government to correct what \nhappened to Mrs. Barron and the treatment she received. Her life has \nbeen irreparably harmed, and her family will always suffer as a result \nof this.\n  It would be terrible enough if it were the only instance of this type \nof situation occurring, but as we saw from the hearings which the \nSenate Finance Committee held under Chairman Roth, it was not the only \ninstance. Regrettably, on too many occasions the Internal Revenue \nService has acted in this almost malicious but certainly abusive way.\n  This does not mean that the Internal Revenue Service is populated \nwith people who wish to treat American citizens, taxpayers, in a manner \nthat is totally inappropriate. No. In fact, just the opposite. The \nInternal Revenue Service is filled with good and conscientious people, \nin my opinion; but there are bad apples.\n  More importantly than that, the Service has created an atmosphere, a \nway of management, a culture, which has allowed the excesses to proceed \nin the actions against taxpayers which are beyond the pale of \nreasonableness to become commonplace, through the lack of management \nand, in my opinion, due to lack of structure, both legal and \nmanagerial. So this bill attempts to correct that.\n  The most important thing it does, or one of the most important things \nit does, is it shifts the burden of proof, gets us back to where we \nshould have been to begin with, which is to presume that the taxpayer \nis innocent rather than presuming that the taxpayer is guilty until the \ntaxpayer has proven himself or herself innocent. That is very \nimportant, so that the taxpayer goes in at least on some level of a \nplaying field which has some levelness to it versus a playing field \nwhich was radically tilted against the taxpayer under the present \nstructure.\n  In addition, the bill protects the innocent spouse. In so many \ninstances, the spouse is a part of the familial activity as being part \nof a family; signs\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\nthe return without a great deal of knowledge of what is in that return, \nsometimes without any great knowledge of what is in that return, but \nsigns it and then finds out later on, as was the case in Mrs. Barron's \nsituation, that action has been taken that was inappropriate and \nliability exists. And when the spouse who is responsible disappears, as \na result of divorce, or in this case as a result of death, the innocent \nspouse ends up with an obligation which is totally inappropriate. So \nthe protection of the innocent spouse is absolutely critical and a \nvery, very good part of this bill.\n  In addition, the bill takes what I think is a critical step in the \narea of managing the Internal Revenue Service's procedures because it \nlimits the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to assess interest \nand penalties in a manner which uses the interest and penalties to \nbasically force settlements on the taxpayer, even when the taxpayer \nfeels they did not owe the obligation.\n  There is no question but that the basic collection process at the \nInternal Revenue Service proceeds with, in many instances, running up \nthe interest and penalty obligations so when they get into negotiations \nwith the taxpayer, even if the taxpayer knows they do not owe the \ntaxes, the utility of proceeding becomes so expensive, it becomes so \nimpossible to ever want to proceed in a manner which would put you at \nrisk for the interest and penalties which have been run up that you end \nup paying the underlying tax and negotiating out the interest and \npenalties. That is a collection process which, regrettably, has become \nthe modus operandi of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  This bill puts some limitation on that by limiting the ability of the \nInternal Revenue Service to run those interest and penalties up if they \nhave not notified the taxpayer within a timely manner--18 months \ninitially, 12 months as time goes out--that an obligation is due or \nthey perceive that an obligation is due. This is an extremely important \nchange in the collection process. In addition, the bill provides much \nbetter services to the taxpayer, which is critical.\n  Thus, I am extremely supportive of this effort. I say this. It does \nnot resolve the problem. The problem goes to the basic law. The fact is \nthat we have created a tax law which is so complex, so convoluted, such \na mishmash of regulations and cross-purpose legislation, that it \nbecomes basically unenforceable because it is not comprehendible.\n  After finishing law school, I went back to school for 3 years and got \na graduate degree in tax policy with an LL.M. I have to say, I do not \nfill out my own tax return because it is simply too complex. Now, if I \ncannot do it, how can somebody who is just working every day and trying \nto make ends meet be able to do it? Obviously, they cannot.\n  And what we see in the collection atmosphere is that the Internal \nRevenue agents, regrettably, because of the complexity in many \ninstances, do not understand it because it is not understandable.\n  So the law itself is a basic problem here, and we simply have to \nreform the law if we really want to correct this problem. We have to go \nto a much simpler law, a fairer law, something that can be managed in a \nway that is comprehendible to people who are working every day and \ntrying to fill out their return, who don't happen to be specialists.\n  As an interim step, as an effort to try to correct what is basically \na law that is not enforceable effectively but is being enforced in a \nmanner which in many cases is abusive--as an interim step, this bill \nmakes great progress. Thus, I congratulate the committee for their \nefforts. I hope it will not be looked at as the end of the process but \nwill be looked at as a step in the process to reforming our tax laws so \nthat they can be administered in a way which will regain the confidence \nof the American people that they are fair and that they are reasonable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as many other Members \nhave, to speak in favor of the IRS reform bill that is before the \nSenate. As the Senator from New Hampshire indicated, I want to take \njust a little bit of a different approach. We talk about this as one of \nthe steps in the changes that do need to be made.\n  I do come to the floor to express my support for the package. The \nagency, of course, has basically run roughshod over American taxpayers \nfor too long. This is the first significant reform in this agency in \nover four decades.\n  Congress should do more of this kind of oversight. It seems to me in \nthis whole business of funding the Government, this whole business of \nappropriations, that we need to find a way to have more time for \noversight. That is why I am supporting and continue to support a \nbiennial budget in the appropriations process, so we would have off \nyears to do this kind of thing for many other agencies.\n  Basically, I guess my point is that this is an important part of the \nRepublican agenda, of our agenda, to do things about taxes. No. 1, of \ncourse, is to have tax reduction. I think American families deserve \nthat. I think it is good for the economy. It has to do with having less \nGovernment and a smaller Government. IRS reform is part of it, and this \nis a great step in that direction.\n  Certainly, the third point is simplification of the Tax Code. I \nthink, also, that is a necessary element before we find satisfaction \nwith our Tax Code.\n  So, reducing taxes, IRS reform, and simplification comprise a three-\npronged agenda, one which I support. Last year we made some progress in \nterms of reducing taxes, reduced them in capital gains, reduced estate \ntaxes, installed a $500-per-child tax credit, expanded IRAs, and passed \nother important small business tax reductions.\n  I would like to go forward in that area, and I hope we shall. Further \nreducing capital gains, eliminating estate taxes, reducing and \neliminating the marriage tax penalty are areas in which we can make \nprogress.\n  This year we will reform IRS, the Federal agency that has interaction \nwith more Americans than any other agency. I salute Senator Roth and \nthe Senator from New York and members of the Finance Committee for \nholding fast against the initial White House reluctance and opposition \nto reforms in this agency. His hearings, the committee's hearings, \nbrought to light many unbelievable abuses of taxpayers by this agency.\n  This reform package, then, increases the oversight on IRS, holds IRS \nemployees more accountable, makes IRS a more service-friendly agency, \nputs the law on the side of the taxpayer, has some very key provisions: \nTaxpayer confidentiality, extends the attorney-client privilege to \naccountants, reverses the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, \nguarantees 30 days to request a hearing of disputes, gives new powers \nto the taxpayers who petition the courts to contest decisions, and \nreforms the management of the IRS.\n  These are all good things.\n  The third part of our agenda, which is still there and I believe is \nof paramount importance if we are to really change the tax atmosphere: \nI think we have to address the basic underlying Tax Code. Hopefully, \nthat will take place in the next year or two. We plan to significantly \nreform the Tax Code and to eliminate the complexity that is now there. \nThere seems to be some misunderstanding about one of the proposals now \nwhich would terminate the current Tax Code in the year 2001. It does \nnot eliminate the Tax Code, it simply gives a time certain in which a \nnew Tax Code needs to be devised.\n  The IRS is responsible for creating many of the problems the \ntaxpayers have, but Congress needs to bear the burden of fixing the \ncurrent Tax Code. There are 17,000 pages of inherently confusing data \nthat need to be changed. Taxpayers spend $200 billion and 5.4 billion \nhours to comply with the tax law. The IRS employs over 100,000 people, \nmore than five times the number of the FBI. After 80 years of abuses by \nlawmakers, lobbyists, and special interests, the tax system is unfair, \ncomplex, it is costly and punishes work, savings, and investment.\n  Certainly there is a great opportunity for basic recodification of \nthe Tax Code. I support plans, of course, that have the basic elements \nof fairness, of simplicity, reducing the overall tax burden.\n  It is interesting, as you go about in your State, my State of \nWyoming, and\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\nask how many people like the Tax Code the way it is now, nobody \nresponds, of course. Then you say: What do you want to do about it? Do \nyou like sales tax? Do you like flat tax? Do you like consumption tax? \nBut we haven't come, yet, to a consensus on what the replacement ought \nto be. That is the challenge before us.\n  I am pleased we are about to pass this historic bill, complete the \nsecond part of a three-pronged tax agenda. I hope soon we will move to \nfinish the job and fundamentally reform the Tax Code.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non IRS reform.\n  What I would like to do is very briefly give a summary of the two \nphilosophical approaches that were initially embodied in the debate, \nwhy I believe we chose the better of the two, and then I will outline \nthe few issues in the bill that I feel very strongly about.\n  First of all, when we started learning of IRS abuses--something that \nmost of our offices heard about from constituents from the very \nbeginning of our congressional service--and then when we saw it in its \nrawest form in testimony before the Finance Committee, I think there \nwere two basic approaches or responses people had. I think one view was \nthat people at the IRS had become insensitive, that there was something \nwrong with them, and that what we needed was a massive effort to try to \nsensitize people in the IRS. I have to say, that is the \nadministration's initial viewpoint. It was as if they thought we could \nsolve the problem simply by hiring every sociologist in the country and \nhave them sit down individually with IRS employees and encourage them \nto be good people.\n  My own view, and the view that I believe dominates this bill, was a \nview that by and large, with a few notable exceptions, there was \nnothing wrong with people who work with the IRS. They are ordinary \npeople. They have families. They own dogs. They are pretty much like \nus. The problem is, as the ancient Greeks observed, power corrupts. In \nthe Internal Revenue Service, you have an agency of government that has \ntremendous power. As compared to the criminal justice system, for \nexample, the IRS in its dealings with us on tax matters is literally \nthe police, the investigator, the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury. \nAnd as a result of the fact that the IRS has so much unchecked power, \nthat created an environment in which abuse occurred.\n  What bothered me most in listening to the testimony was not that you \nhad people do bad things. We know that even good people sometimes do \nbad things. We know smart people sometimes do dumb things. But what \nalarmed me about the testimony over and over was the fact that nothing \nbad happened to bad people, that when people did bad things in the IRS, \nthey were seldom, if ever, punished. And when people did good things \nlike trying to raise the level of awareness in the IRS that abuses were \noccurring, often bad things happened to them.\n  That convinced me and, I believe, convinced the majority of the \nmembers of the Finance Committee, and ultimately the majority of \nMembers of both Houses of Congress, that the system needed changing, \nthat we had a system that reinforced bad behavior, and what we, of \ncourse, want is a system that reinforces good behavior.\n  I don't know what we are going to get from the oversight board we \nhave established. I hope it will be productive. I certainly am \nsupportive of it. I am not sure how well that approach will work, but \nthere is a secondary approach in the bill that I am convinced will \nwork, and that is an approach that really aims to curb this unbridled \npower.\n  The first change we made in the bill, which I think is vitally \nimportant, is we shift the burden of proof from the individual taxpayer \nto the Internal Revenue Service. We do that not only on income taxes, \nbut we do it on estate taxes. I believe this is a very important \nchange. Now, critics of this change said that only the taxpayer knows \nthe facts, only the taxpayer has real access to the records, and so if \nyou shift the burden of proof, the taxpayer will have an incentive to \ndestroy records.\n  I think we came up with an excellent compromise in this area, and \nthat compromise is that if taxpayers keep records that a prudent person \ncould be expected to keep, if they turn those records over to the \nInternal Revenue Service on a timely basis, at that point the burden of \nproof shifts. I believe that this is a vitally important provision. It \nis a provision of the bill that basically guarantees honest taxpayers \nthe same rights that criminals have in the criminal justice system. I \nthink this is a major step in the right direction.\n  The next change that I believe will change the relationship between \nthe tax collector and the taxpayer is a provision that is basically a \nversion of loser-pay. This is an important principle, it seems to me. I \nwould personally like to see it throughout our legal system. I have \nalways been amazed that the British had the best legal system in the \nworld and one of the poorest health care systems in the world, but we \nare interested in adopting their health care system and not their legal \nsystem. But the brilliance of their system, which actually dates back \nto ancient Greece, is that if you bring a lawsuit and lose, you have to \npay the costs--costs incurred by the court, costs incurred by the \ndefendant in defending their rights.\n  Now, we have a variant of that in this bill, and I think it is a very \nimportant provision. What this bill says is, if you are audited by the \nInternal Revenue Service, and you end up in a running dispute with \nthem, and in the process you are forced to hire attorneys and to hire \naccountants to defend yourself, at the end of the process, if it is \nfound that you did not violate the law, then the Internal Revenue \nService is liable for the costs you incurred in hiring lawyers and \naccountants and defending yourself. I believe that by shifting the \nburden of proof and expanding the loser pays concept, that the rights \nof the taxpayer--the honest taxpayer--will be strengthened because it \nwill change the behavior of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  In a related provision, we have language in the bill where, if you \noffer to settle with the Internal Revenue Service and offer to make a \npayment to them and they refuse to accept that payment, and instead \nthey take the taxpayer to court, if at the end of the day the court \nrules that you owe the amount you offered, or less--not counting \ninterest and penalties that might have been imposed by the Internal \nRevenue Service in the interim--then the IRS again becomes liable for \npayment of the cost of legal and accounting expenses incurred from the \npoint that you made the offer to settle until the final judgment was \nreached in the court of law. It seems to me that is another vitally \nimportant change.\n  The third and, I believe, final major section of the bill has to do \nwith the flexibility of the Internal Revenue Service hiring people. \nUnder our current system, basically, you have to be in the Internal \nRevenue Service for 25 years to have a major supervisory, decision-\nmaking post. One of the things we have done in this bill is waive a \nnumber of the general procedures under civil service. We are allowing \nthe Internal Revenue Service to go outside the system and bring in \nprivate expertise--some on a permanent basis, some on a temporary \nbasis--and in the process, we are bringing in new people with private \nexperience, many of whom will go back into the private sector. The net \nresult, I believe, will be a more efficient and basically a more \nbalanced Internal Revenue Service.\n  Finally, related to this third issue is the whole issue of people who \nviolate the law and people who behave in ways that you can, under no \ncircumstance, justify, nor should you ever tolerate in a government \nagency--or any other entity, for that matter. What we have done in this \nbill is not only given the new IRS chief flexibility in hiring new \npeople from the outside, including very highly skilled and highly \ncompensated individuals, but we have also given the Internal Revenue \nService Director the ability to fire people--to fire people for a list \nof violations, and in the process strengthen his power to hold the \nagency accountable to the taxpayer.\n  So I want to congratulate Senator Roth for his leadership on this \nbill. The major provisions of the bill relating to the burden of proof \nand to the loser-pay provision were provisions\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nthat the chairman insisted on and made part of this bill. They are \ndramatic changes. I want to congratulate Senator Moynihan as well as \nSenator Kerrey and Senator Grassley who served on the commission whose \nrecommendations we built on in developing this legislation and did \nadopt many of its proposals. I think we have put together a good bill \nthat will shift the burden of proof, that will force the IRS to pay \nwhen it is wrong, that enhances the ability to hire and fire--hire on \nthe basis of competence, fire on the basis of incompetence, and on the \nbasis of illegal or reprehensible behavior. I think it is a good bill.\n  I simply want to say this: Anybody who sat through all those hearings \nthat we had in Finance--and I did--had to be convinced that the time \nhad come for a fundamental change in the relationship between the \ntaxpayer in this country and the agency that is charged with collecting \ntaxes. We needed substantial changes that enhanced the power and \nstanding of the taxpayer and that diminished the unbridled power of the \nInternal Revenue Service. I believe this bill achieves those goals. \nNobody claims this solves every problem in the country. Nobody claims \nthis makes our Tax Code any more decipherable. Nobody would claim that \nevery problem is solved. But this is a major step forward.\n  I am strongly in favor of this bill, and I hope we can follow this \nbill next year with an effort to reform the Tax Code, to make it \nsimpler and fairer. I think everyone believes that would be an \nimprovement. The trick, obviously, is to make it happen. But I \ncongratulate those that have been involved in the bill. I am proud to \nsupport it. I think it is certainly one of the highlights of this \nCongress and recent years, and I am glad to have been a small part of \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I also rise in support of the conference \nreport, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998. I would like to begin my comments with high praise for the \nChairman of the Finance Committee, both for calling the hearings last \nfall and again this year, and for his efforts every step of the way to \nmake certain that this was a responsible bill, a balanced bill, and a \nbill that reflected the high values of the American people. I \nappreciate very much his leadership, as well as the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan. The chairman, I think \nconducted the hearings in a very responsible way and in a way that \nenabled the American people to see that the laws governing the IRS were \nin urgent need of changing. It simply would not have happened without \nSenator Roth's diligence and willingness to bring to the American \npeople's attention many of the problems that they saw last fall and \nagain this year.\n\n  Mr. President, representative democracy is a very difficult system. \nWe all know it. We all view it to be the best. With all of its faults, \nit still is the best system around. But it is a difficult system, \nbecause the people themselves have to decide what they want their laws \nto be. We, as their representatives, have to reflect their wishes and \ndesires. But at the end of the day, you have to write a law and decide \nwhich words they ought to be. What goes into those laws very often is \nan attempt to resolve conflicts.\n  This piece of legislation I believe is in an area of government that \nin many ways is the most difficult of all. I would put law enforcement \nclosely behind it as being both the most important and the most \ndifficult. You always have conflicts between law enforcement and the \ndesire for public safety, which is an overriding concern in the desire \nto protect individual rights. It is always there. It will never end. It \nis a never-ending battle. It is a never-ending argument. It is a never-\nending struggle to try to resolve those conflicts.\n  Likewise, when it comes to paying for government--and all of us, I \npresume, are careful in how we spend the taxpayers' money--many of us \nare of the view that government itself needs to be watched very \ncarefully, in an attempt, especially at the Federal level, to reduce it \nas much as possible so that taxpayers get to keep as much of their \nmoney as possible. The bottom line is, we are going to have some \ngovernment.\n  I was very struck watching President Jiang Zemin in China. I didn't \nsee any demonstrators over in China. And the reason is, they don't have \na law protecting them. They don't have government of, by, and for the \npeople. That is a law that protects, but it also costs us money.\n  We have to decide how we are going to organize our police force, fire \ndepartment, and all the rest of it. When, at the Federal level we \ndecide we want an Army, a Navy, an Air Force, and a Marine Corps, which \nwe authorized not too long ago for the defense of this Nation, we have \nto decide how we are going to collect the money. So we write a law that \nnot only decides how that money is going to be collected but we write a \nlaw that authorizes the collection agency--in this case, the IRS.\n  I begin with those basics because sometimes I hear people describe \nthe IRS as if it is a Sears & Roebuck or a private-sector operation. It \nis not. It is a creation of law. If you wanted to get rid of the IRS \ncompletely--I have heard some people argue that--you could come down \nhere and offer an amendment to abolish the IRS. The IRS needs a law. \nThe IRS--and in its current form, for those who are in the private \nsector and used to working with private-sector organizations--the IRS \nhas a board of directors composed of 535 Members of Congress, 100 in \nthe Senate and 435 in the House. Again, it is important to understand \nthat.\n  We come--all of us--with different views, different ideas. The \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair represents the good people of \nArkansas. I represent the good people of Nebraska. The chairman of the \ncommittee so responsible for this legislation represents the good \npeople of Delaware. We come with a variety of ideas in the way that we \nwant the IRS to be governed. We bring those ideas typically forcefully \nto the floor, or to our respective committees, to try to get things \ndone.\n  I say that because sometimes those ideas are in conflict. Sometimes \nat the very moment we are calling for tax simplification, we are voting \n``aye'' on something that makes the code more complicated. As the \ndistinguished Senator from New York said, this piece of legislation \namends the 1986 act, which itself was called, I think, the Tax \nSimplification Act of 1986. It was enacted before I arrived in the \nSenate. Fortunately, I could blame all of the problems that thing \ncreated on those who voted for it. But that legislation has been \namended 64 times, and each time, typically, it makes the code a bit \nmore complicated.\n  We talk about wanting the IRS to do a better job of collecting \nrevenue. It doesn't take long, after they have been trained and get up \nto speed, before the private sector puts an offer on the table to try \nto pull the good people away, hire them away. Sometimes the IRS says, \n``We want to modernize so as to have good computer operating systems.'' \nSometimes we fail to appropriate the money that they need to get the \njob done.\n  All of this, and more besides, describes the difficulty of writing a \nlaw that enables the IRS to do the things that the American people \nwant, which is to collect the amount of money that is owed in a \nvoluntary fashion and to create an environment so that those who are \nwilling to pay in a voluntary fashion--those who are volunteering to \npay their fair share--get the answer to the question, ``How much do I \nowe?'' in as efficient a way as possible and get their taxes paid in as \nefficient a way as possible with the least amount of cost and \nharassment on their side, while still preserving the power of the IRS \nto go after individuals who are not willing to voluntarily comply, \ndon't want to pay their fair share, and who, I think it is fair to say, \nburden those who are voluntarily complying by withholding their fair \nshare.\n  So the IRS restructuring legislation is an attempt to improve the \nlaw. I believe it does that in a number of very, very significant ways. \nI would like to describe a few of those for my colleagues. Indeed, at \nthe press conference, after the conference work was done, I heard a \nnumber of people in the press ask--and I have been asked as well in \nNebraska--``How will we notice the changes in this law? How will the\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\nchanges be noticed by me, a taxpayer who has a relationship with the \nIRS?'' I would like to identify a few of those.\n  First, the law that creates governance for the IRS has been \ndramatically changed. It has been changed in the executive branch side. \nBut it also has been changed in the legislative branch side.\n  It must be noted, I think, in fairness, that we first started \nnoticing problems with the IRS a half-dozen years ago when the tax \nsystem modernization program that we had appropriated money for wasn't \nfunctioning very well. The GAO was requested to do an examination. The \nGAO came back and said that as much as $3 billion had been wasted. At \nthe time, I had the high honor of serving on the Appropriations \nCommittee under Chairman Byrd and the ranking Republican, Senator \nHatfield. Our Subcommittee on Treasury-Postal Appropriations tried to \nfence the money for a couple of years. We tried to work with the IRS to \nfigure out some way to make this work better.\n  In 1995, what Senator Shelby and I were going to do was withhold the \nmoney entirely. We took an alternative course to create in 1995 this \nrestructuring commission that Congressman Portman and I had the high \nhonor to be cochairs of in 1996 and 1997. We were just one of six \ncommittees, and still are, that the IRS had to report to. They had to \ncome to the Appropriations Committee, the Finance Committee, and they \ngo to the Governmental Affairs Committee. And they had to go to all \nthree of their counterparts on the House side. They are required under \nlaw to go to each one of those.\n  What the GAO reported--both at that time and later to the \nrestructuring commission--was that you need to reorganize that, that \nyou are not going to be able to make good investments in computers and \noperating systems and the software for those computers. You will make a \nmistake when you spend the taxpayers' money unless you get to a point \nin some environment where there is a shared agreement on how that money \nis to be spent: What is the purpose? What is the goal? Where is it that \nyou are trying to go?\n  This legislation creates on the executive branch side a new board of \ngovernance which the President appoints. They have a considerable \namount of power and independence. These individuals will come from the \nprivate sector with a variety of different experiences to be able to \nassist the Commissioner in making a decision about what kinds of \nmanagement objectives and what kinds of computer systems and software \nsystems are going to be in place. But that board will have the \nopportunity as well under this legislation to meet with a single \ncommittee on an annual basis to review IRS operations and management.\n  So the appropriators, the Finance Committee, and the Governmental \nAffairs people, in both the House and the Senate, will be meeting with \nthis board of directors in reaching agreement. It is much more likely \nin this kind of environment--whatever plan the IRS comes up with and \nthe Commissioner comes up with--that the Congress will support that \nplan, and support that plan on a consistent basis.\n  This governing board is also much more likely to provide taxpayers \nwith a sense that the IRS is more directly accountable to them. There \nwill be an opportunity for citizens to go to that board, and it is much \nmore likely that we in our offices will be able to follow up on cases \nthat are brought to our attention.\n  So the governance board on the executive branch under this law and \nthe change in governance on the legislative branch are the first things \nthat I believe taxpayers are going to see. They are going to see better \ndecisions and more consistent support being provided for those \ndecisions as a consequence of the changes in this law. They were very \ncontroversial for a long period of time. The administration reached \nagreement with the Congress on what those provisions were going to be. \nBut I believe every single taxpayer is going to see a benefit as a \nconsequence of improved governance and improved decisionmaking being \nmade by the Commissioner of the IRS.\n  The second big area where people are going to notice a change is the \nnew management powers and authorities that are granted to the \nCommissioner.\n  First of all, under law, the Commissioner will be able to serve a \nfull 5-year term. Over the past, I think, 5 years now, we have had \nthree different Commissioners. There has been substantial turnover and \ndifficulty as a consequence of maintaining continuity. And the \nmaintenance of continuity is a very important objective of this \nlegislation. The IRS Commissioner not only will have the power to make \nmanagement decisions in an affirmative way by providing incentives for \npeople to perform and rewarding them when they do perform but new \nauthorities to terminate employees who are not performing up to the \nhighest standards of the American people and the American taxpayer.\n  In addition, the Commissioner is not only given authority but \ndirected to change the way we manage the IRS from the current system, \nwhich is a district and regional geographical organization, to \nfunctional lines of governance. Every single taxpayer is going to \nnotice that change, Mr. President, not this year but certainly over the \nnext 2 or 3 years. Our taxpayers are going to say it is an awful lot \neasier now that the Commissioner has organized the IRS by individual \ntaxpayers, by corporate taxpayers small, by corporate taxpayers big, \nand by nonprofits. It is going to be a lot more likely that the \nCommissioner is going to be able to give each one of those entities the \ncontinuity of service they are asking for.\n  As individuals move from one part of the country to another, they \nfind themselves in a different region, in a different district. It is \nmuch more likely that the Commissioner is going to be coming to the \nCongress saying: Here are some changes we could make to decrease the \ncost of compliance and make it easier for larger taxpayers, for smaller \ntaxpayers, for individual taxpayers--much more likely when we organize \naround functional lines.\n  And with the increased authority under the law the Commissioner will \nhave, it is much more likely that every single taxpayer will say: It \nhas gotten much easier for me to pay my taxes. They may still think \nthey are too high. They may still say: It should be a consumption tax \nor some other way of paying my taxes, but it has gotten easier; I have \ngotten the information more quickly; there is an operating system here, \na computer system here, an information system here, that has made it \neasier for me to acquire the information if I have a complaint or \ndiscrepancy.\n  And you hear it all the time. Somebody calls up and says: I am making \n$10,000 a year; I got a bill for $140,000; it's ridiculous; something \nis wrong. I call up my IRS office. They don't have the ability to \nreassure me that a mistake has been made. It takes months and months \nand months.\n  With this new governance structure, with this new authority, we are \nproviding the Commissioner what I think every single Senator and every \nsingle Representative is going to hear citizens saying: I am able to \ncall up and get an immediate change. If I have a change of address and \nmy refund check hasn't arrived, it is going to be much more likely I am \ngoing to get immediate attention, same-day attention, to that and \nshorten the amount of time that is required to get the problem \nresolved.\n  Mr. President, not only do taxpayers save money because the IRS will \nspend less money, but the taxpayers themselves downstream will save a \nlot more money, not having to chase around and solve the problem.\n  The third big area is in taxpayer rights, and there are a lot of \nchanges. I am just going to list a few of them. The chairman talked \nextensively about the burden of proof shift. I think it is a reasonable \ncompromise, although there is still some cause for concern. If we find \nourselves with some problems as a consequence of this provision, which \nI don't think we will, Congress can always make some modifications. It \nshifts the burden of proof in all forms of income at the Tax Court. \nThere are changes in the way taxpayers' proceedings are handled at the \nIRS, including such issues as to how costs are awarded and apportioned, \ncivil damages if the IRS is negligent.\n  One of the things we are trying to do all the way through the rights \nprovision is make certain that when the IRS sends out a collection \nnotice, they are going after a taxpayer for doing something, that they \nhave relatively high\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\ncertainty the taxpayer has done something wrong. The burden is on them \nto make a judgment with this new law, because if we find that the IRS \nhas been negligent, the IRS has done something wrong, under these new \nprovisions the IRS can be held not only responsible but liable for \npayment to the taxpayer--much more likely, as a consequence, taxpayers \nare going to see fewer collection notices that are sent out when no \ncollection is warranted.\n  There is relief for innocent spouses, changes in interest and \npenalty, new protections under audit, new disclosure requirements to \ntaxpayers--extremely important provisions, Mr. President. The taxpayer \nvery often just doesn't get the information, doesn't know what is going \non. As a consequence, they are not able to make a judgment about how \nmuch they owe.\n  There are provisions in the bill to create low-income clinics, a very \nimportant provision as well. We all know that the higher your income, \nthe more likely it is you are going to have somebody do your taxes for \nyou. With all the tax simplification and complexity issues that we \nhear, as income gets more complicated, it is more and more likely as a \nresult that your income is going to be higher and more likely that \nsomebody else is going to do your tax return for you. But for that \nlower-income American, these low-income clinics are going to be, I \nthink, an extremely important part of our overall effort to make \ncertain that all Americans say, whether it is the IRS or the FBI or the \nUSDA or whatever it is, it is still Government of, by, and for the \npeople. And the law has to be on the side of all Americans, not just \nthose of higher incomes but on the side of middle-income Americans and \nlower-income Americans. And I think this low-income clinic provision is \na very important part of it.\n  In addition, under the rights provision, the IRS will be required to \ncatalog complaints it can bring to Congress, and we can sort out and \nsee if there are any repetitive problems here and make judgments about \nwhether or not, as a result of those repetitive problems, we need to \nmake further changes in the law.\n  The fourth big area is the area of simplicity. The distinguished \nSenator from New York commented on that at length. I would only point \nout that I think, again, Members are going to hear taxpayers saying: \nWell, finally we have some things in there that help us deal with this \nproblem, estimated to be $100- to $200-billion a year, of costs to the \ntaxpayer to comply with the current code.\n  Now, it has to be said, as long as you tax income, it is going to be \ninvasive. That is my own belief. If you tax income, it is almost going \nto be true that it is going to feel invasive if you are in an audit \nsituation. This law will give taxpayers, I think, some new evidence \nthat we are getting the word out on simplification.\n  First of all, for the first time under law, the Commissioner is \nempowered to make comments and to be there when laws are being written. \nRight now, you will have to search your memory bank, and I think in \nvain, to find a time when you have ever heard an IRS Commissioner say: \nGreat idea, Mr. President; great idea, Senator Blowhard--for some new \ntax break--but here is what it is going to cost the taxpayer to comply.\n  We heard in the restructuring commission examples, and we filed them \nas a part of our index, of situations where provisions in the code cost \nfar more to enforce than they generate in revenue. The cost to the \ntaxpayer and the cost to the IRS to collect the money is greater than \nthe benefit measured in the amount of money that is collected.\n  So in addition to putting the Tax Commissioner at the table and \ngiving him authority to comment, as the distinguished Senator from New \nYork mentioned earlier, there is a new simplicity analysis that will be \ndone and prepared so we can judge whether or not an idea that we have \nis going to either increase or decrease the cost to the American people \nto comply.\n  There are new provisions, next, Mr. President, in the area of the \nTaxpayer Advocate, making the advocate more independent, making the \nAdvocate more likely to help in the resolution of problems--a very \nimportant section. And I think every single taxpayer who has a problem \nwith the IRS is going to see that this new Taxpayer Advocate is more \nlikely under this new law to be able to help resolve in an expeditious \nfashion any complaint or problem they have.\n  Last, Mr. President, in the section dealing with electronic filing, \nthose of us who have spent some time on this believe, No. 1, that if \nyou are trying to reduce the cost, the most important thing is to \nreduce the number of errors. In the electronic world, there is less \nthan half of 1 percent errors. In the paper world, it is 20 to 25 \npercent errors being made both by the IRS and the individuals who are \nfilling out the forms. The electronic world offers us a tremendous \nopportunity to decrease the cost to comply for both the taxpayer and \nthe IRS.\n  The language of this bill says that the IRS would encourage private \nsector competition. Again, I must say I think it is very important that \nCongress pay attention to this. Though I want the IRS to be able to \noffer services to the American taxpayer, I want to make certain that \nthere is vigorous competition out in the private sector for the \ndelivery of these services.\n  All in all, I believe this piece of legislation represents a good-\nfaith effort on the part of Members of this body and the House to do \nsomething that is extremely difficult, and that is to write the laws \ngoverning the collection of our taxes in a way that resolves all the \nvarious conflicts that you have when you are trying to write any piece \nof legislation dealing with something where you are simultaneously \ntrying to make it easy for taxpayers to comply and make it difficult \nfor people who are not willing to comply to live outside the letter, \nthe spirit, and the intent of the law.\n  I close with what I said at the beginning. I have high praise for \nChairman Roth for his good work, his balance, and his determination to \nfinally get this done. I have high praise as well for Senator Grassley, \nwho served on the restructuring commission, for Congressman Portman, \nwho was my chairman, as well as Congressman Cardin and the senior \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee.\n  I look forward to final passage, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, America is a great country. It is not \nperfect, but it is a great country. It is a country where the voice of \nthe people is usually heard. That is what this is all about today. The \nAmerican public, for some time, has been upset about the way their tax \ncollector has been handling a very important aspect of the business of \nthis country. Today we are dealing with something that is very \nimportant to the American people.\n  I also must say that this IRS restructuring and reform bill would not \nhave been possible but for the senior Senator from Nebraska. The senior \nSenator from Nebraska has worked long and hard on this issue. Even \nbefore this legislation was introduced, as he has just briefly \noutlined, when he was a member of the Appropriations Committee and a \nmember of the subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the IRS, he \nstarted this legislation. It seems it was only yesterday, even though \nit was much longer. It was last year that Senators Grassley, Kerrey, \nand I stood to introduce this legislation.\n  When we introduced this legislation, we didn't have a lot of people \nwho wanted to help us. There was a sparse group of people from the \nSenate supporting us--Senator Kerrey, from Nebraska, Senator Pryor, \nfrom Arkansas, and Senator Grassley, from Iowa. But I commend and \napplaud the Senator from Nebraska for his vision and, most of all, for \nhis tenacity on this legislation. I am glad we are finally at a point \nnow where we can pass this because this IRS restructuring and reform \nbill is important.\n  Mr. President, when I first came to the Congress, I came with the \nfeeling that something had to be done about the IRS. I was elected in \n1982. During that period of time, the State of Nevada was going through \nsome very difficult times with the Internal Revenue Service. The reason \nfor that is that the resort industry had been in a battle that had gone \non for several decades as to whether people in the gambling business, \nwhen they received a gratuity from somebody who was playing cards\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\nor dice, could treat that gratuity as a gift, or whether it was taxable \nby the Internal Revenue Service.\n  This battle was taken to the court structure and the courts \ndetermined that this was taxable income. It took several decades to do \nthis. After the decision was made by the courts, many of the people in \nthe resort field owed money to the IRS. They acknowledged their debt, \nand made arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service, saying I owe \n$20,000 or I owe $4,000, whatever the amount might be, and they would \nrepay it at whatever rate they could work out with the IRS agent, for \nexample, $200 a month or $600 a month. The problem was, the IRS would \nkeep reneging on their deals. A new IRS agent would come along and say, \n``You are not going to pay $200 a month, you have to pay $400 a \nmonth.'' They would say, ``We already made an arrangement with you to \npay at $200 a month.'' The IRS agent would say, ``I'm a new agent; I \nwill make the deal with you that I think is appropriate.''\n  This went on and on. The people in the resort business had their \nproperty seized and their bank accounts levied. It was a very chaotic \nsituation. As a result of this experience, when I came to the Congress, \nI introduced a bill in the House called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n  On the day I introduced that legislation, I appeared on the ``Charlie \nRose'' show. At that time, Charlie Rose came on at 2 o clock in the \nmorning. I thought the legislation I introduced had impact only on the \npeople of the State of Nevada. I was surprised, amazed, and impressed \nto learn that it was not only a Nevada problem. After I appeared on \nthis TV program that aired at 2 a.m., I came to the office the next day \nand to find hundreds of telegrams. The phone wouldn't stop ringing. \nThis problem was a problem throughout our country, not just in the \nState of Nevada. All over the country the IRS had not been treating \npeople appropriately.\n  I was not able to move the legislation in the House for various \nreasons. The chairman of the subcommittee in the House liked the IRS \nmore than he liked my legislation. I was elected in 1986 to the Senate. \nMy maiden speech in the Senate related to the same Taxpayer Bill of \nRights that I introduced in the House and that I said I was going to \nintroduce here. Very fortunately for me, and I hope for the country--I \nfeel confident that is true--presiding over the Senate that day was the \nsubcommittee chair of the Finance Committee subcommittee that had \njurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Service, David Pryor, from \nArkansas. Senator Pryor sent a note to me by a page, after I finished \nmy speech, saying: I like what you have said. I want to work with you \non this.\n\n  Also, that same day, Charles Grassley, a Republican Senator from \nIowa, made contact with me saying: I want to work with you on the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights. So I had two very senior Members of the Senate \nwho wanted to work with a brand new Senator's legislation that we now \ncall the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. We conducted hearings and we learned \nsome amazing things.\n  I would relate to the chairman of the Finance Committee, even back \nthen we had some very courageous people who were the beginning of some \nof the people who came forward in the latest round of hearings relating \nto the IRS restructuring reform bill. For example, we had one IRS \nemployee from Los Angeles who put his job at risk, because the IRS \ntestified that they did not promote people on the basis of how much \nmoney they collected. This IRS employee came in and said, ``That's not \ntrue.'' He said, ``In our office there were big glass windows in the \ninner offices and there were big pieces of paper there saying: `Seizure \nfever, catch it.' '' That was a message to all the IRS agents that they \nshould go out and seize all the property they could. That would get \nthem promotions. We therefore outlawed promotions on the basis of how \nmuch money was collected and we outlawed quotas.\n  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights passed, and on November 10, 1988, \nPresident Ronald Reagan signed into law the Taxpayer Bill of Rights \nthat I had written. But I acknowledge I could not have gotten that done \nwithout the tremendous support from Senators Pryor and Grassley. They \nwere champions. They were on the Finance Committee, and they were the \nones who were responsible for working with me and moving that \nlegislation.\n  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, signed by President Reagan, really did \ncreate new rights that taxpayers had never had before. For the first \ntime in the history of the country, the taxpayer was put on a more \nequal footing with the tax collector. Note I say ``on a more equal \nfooting with the tax collector.'' The tax collector still had some \nserious advantages. Because of that, Senators Pryor, Grassley, and I \nmoved forward with the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2.\n  We had some difficulty with that. It was vetoed on a couple of \ndifferent occasions, not because of the substantive nature of our bill, \nbut because it was part of a tax bill. It was part of partisan \nwrangling which took place here, and President Bush vetoed the bill \ntwice. Included in that bill was our Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2.\n  However, in July of 1996, we achieved a crucial milestone on the road \nto IRS reform when President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Bill of Rights \n2 as Public Law 104-168.\n  I underline and underscore, President Bush did not oppose our bill \nwhen he vetoed the tax bill. I repeat, it was part of an overall tax \nproblem that caused him to veto the whole tax package. So we had \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights 1 and 2. They both did things to help the \ntaxpayer versus the tax collector.\n  I served as an appointed member, by then-Leader George Mitchell, on \nthe Entitlement Commission. I served there with Senator Kerrey and \nothers. I came to the realization at that time that the IRS, even \nthough we had Taxpayer Bill of Rights 1 and 2, still needed significant \nwork, principally because of how much money it cost the American \ntaxpayer and the government to collect the taxes. It was estimated \nduring the entitlement hearings that it cost about $500 billion a year \njust to collect the income tax of this country.\n  In the autumn of 1997, Senator Grassley, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska \nand I introduced the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997. I was \nhappy to join in that. Someone asked me in an interview, ``The \nPresident doesn't support this; why are you out on front on this?'' I \nsaid, ``I believe he is going to have to get out of the way or the \nsteamroller is going to run over him,'' and, in fact, that was true. \nWithin a few weeks, the President and many others joined in this \nlegislation which initially had very little support.\n  The bill we introduced was referred to the Ways and Means Committee, \nand the chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate, the senior \nSenator from Delaware--I say through the Chair to my friend, the \nchairman of the committee, as a matter of information, are you the \nsenior Senator from Delaware? Yes, he is. Both Senators have served a \nlong time, and I wasn't certain which one was the senior member.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee, the senior Senator from \nDelaware, held some hearings that I thought were very probative, very \nimportant to get the American people behind this legislation. The \nwitnesses were carefully chosen. I thought the timing of those hearings \nwas very good to add impetus to this legislation.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton challenged the \nCongress to pass the IRS reform bill as its first order of business. I \nam glad it is one of the things that we have worked on very quickly.\n  This bill has been outlined on several occasions today. It shifts the \nburden of proof; it expands IRS authority to award administration and \nlitigation costs; it expands current law to allow taxpayers to sue the \nFederal Government; it requires the IRS to fire an employee for \nmisconduct relating to the employee's official duties; it creates an \noversight board to watch over IRS administration, management and \nconduct; and it does something that I think is so important--it creates \nconfidentiality between the tax preparer and the taxpayer. I think that \nis very important.\n  The bill also contains a provision addressing the meals tax. As a \nmatter of good-faith bargaining between an employer and employee, if \nthey say that an employee should have a meal on the premises, that meal \nis not going to be taxed by the IRS.\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n  Also, there is something I call the ``rewards for rats'' program, \nwhere private citizens are encouraged to turn in those who they believe \nare not paying their fair share of taxes. The IRS is directed to \nexamine the conduct of this program. It is important to find ways to \nprevent such things from taking place.\n  It also does very important work related to an innocent spouses. The \nother issues that are covered here have been elaborated upon in some \ndetail, but innocent spouse status I want to talk about a little bit.\n  My daughter--I have one daughter and four boys--my daughter had a \nwonderful teacher. She was a second grade teacher who had moved from \nthe Midwest to the Las Vegas area and had recently gone through a \ndivorce. Her husband had been a bank officer, and had embezzled huge \namounts of money. Totally unaware of this was the second grade \nschoolteacher in Las Vegas.\n  The fact of the matter is, though, the IRS--and I won't talk about \nthe woman's name--were relentless in going after this woman's wages. \nShe was a schoolteacher. She had no money other than her limited salary \nfrom teaching, and they just harassed and badgered this poor soul \nunbelievably. At the time I said, some day I hope I have an opportunity \nto prevent further acts against people like Mrs.--I won't mention her \nname. And we are doing that today.\n  In the future, innocent spouses will have an opportunity to explain \ntheir situation as innocent spouses. This is important legislation. Why \nshould somebody who steals huge amounts of money from a bank, as in \nthis example, shift the burden of proof to an innocent spouse? It is \nnot fair, and this legislation will solve that problem.\n\n  I believe Congress works best when it works together. This \nlegislation is bipartisan legislation. This legislation is a testimony \nto the power of bipartisanship and how we need to act together to focus \non the problems that relate to the American public.\n  This legislation is legislation the American public wants. It is \nlegislation in which this Congress has joined together in a bipartisan \nfashion under the leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee. \nI am a member of the other party from this Senator, but I say publicly \nthat under his leadership, this legislation has moved along to a point \nwhere we are now passing a bill.\n  I am sure the senior Senator from Delaware has many things that he is \nproud of having done in his long legislative career, but I hope today's \nresolution of this very important issue will be near the top of his \nlegislative list of accomplishments. I am very happy with having worked \nwith him, with the senior Senator from Nebraska, and with Senator \nGrassley from Iowa, to the point that the legislation which we \nintroduced a year or so ago is now going to become law. I also want to \nrecognize the essential role played by my good friend the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan.\n  I, again think this legislation is reflective of how our country \nworks when the people of this country speak out loud enough for us to \nget the message. We have gotten the message. Hopefully, we have \nanswered the concerns of the American public. I am confident that we \nhave.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada and I have had the \noccasion to work together on a number of things. I appreciate his early \nsupport, not just of this piece of legislation, but his early support \nfor changing laws giving taxpayers more rights when dealing with the \nInternal Revenue Service. This is just a continuation of Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights 1 and 2 with which I know the Senator from Nevada was very \nmuch involved.\n  I also thank him for bringing to our attention this issue of meals \ndeductibility. That was a judgment that was being made by the Treasury \nDepartment. I understand it is one of those situations that sort of \nmakes sense if all you are doing is pushing a pencil and trying to make \nyour numbers and the law come together. Had he not brought that to our \nattention, we would have had one more example, one more situation where \nthe Code becomes enormously complicated, enormously burdensome. What \nhappens is, people just lose confidence in their government. They say, \n``How could you do something so stupid?''\n  I appreciate him bringing it to our attention. It had not been \nbrought to our attention. Not only would the people of Nevada have been \nup in arms about it, but I say throughout the country. I say to my \nfriend from Nevada there would have been an awful lot of people \nknocking on our doors talking to us about ``How could you do something \nthat required people of average means to reach even farther to try to \nstay on the right side of the law?'' I was happy to assist in this \nmatter, but I assisted not just to help the people of Nevada who have \nsuch able leadership in the Senator from Nevada, but I believe \neverybody from the United States of America is going to benefit as a \nconsequence of that change.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me preface my \ncomments by joining the senior Senator from Nebraska in commending my \nsenior Senator from Nevada for his untiring efforts for taxpayers not \nonly in Nevada, but across the country, in terms of his efforts on the \nearlier variations of the bill of rights and the strong support of the \nlegislation that we are debating today and that will be signed into law \nvery shortly by the President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning as a member of the \nSenate Finance Committee to offer my strong support for this historic \nlegislation. It has been a long time coming. It has been a difficult \nprocess, but it is clear that the American people will benefit greatly \nas a result of this legislation which will soon be signed into law by \nthe President.\n  None of us really enjoy paying our taxes. But the vast majority of \nAmericans do make a good-faith effort to pay their fair share. And \nwhile the IRS will never be popular, the legislation that we will soon \nvote on will go a long way in providing fairness to taxpayers in their \ndealings with the IRS and will assist Commissioner Rossotti to meet his \ngoals of making the IRS a more efficient and customer-oriented service.\n  Mr. President, the American tax system is essentially one of \nvoluntary compliance. And implicit in that relationship is a sense on \nthe part of the taxpayer that he or she is receiving fair treatment. To \nthe extent that that perception is diminished, it undermines the public \nconfidence in our system, it reduces the level of tax compliance, and \nit creates problems for those of us who do comply with this system and \nwho will be paying a disproportionate share, larger than our fair \nburden, for those who do not.\n  So it is a responsibility of the Congress to make sure, in its \noversight capacity and the laws which we enact, that the IRS operate in \na fair, evenhanded way in dealing with the taxpayer. And I must say, as \na result of the hearings that the chairman of the committee held, the \nabuses that were pointed out, in several instances, are rampant. And I \nwill comment on those in just a moment.\n  I think it is fair to put this in some perspective as well, and that \nis that the great majority of employees of the IRS are really very \ndedicated public servants. They try to do their very best in performing \nthe duties that they have. Much of the criticism that is directed \nagainst them properly ought to be directed against us. It is the \nCongress that enacts the code, and it is by every standard \nextraordinarily complicated, complex. Each year that we seek to make \nimprovements to the code, at the same time it is also fair to say that \nwe add additional complexity to it.\n  That having been said, that their job, being the IRS and the \nemployees of that Service have a very difficult job, there is \nabsolutely no excuse for the kind of conduct that we saw evidenced in \nthe hearings that the chairman had this year and last year. That is \ntotally unacceptable conduct. I believe that several of the reforms \nthat are addressed here in this legislation will help to alleviate \nthose kinds of conditions.\n  In addition to the obvious problems that were pointed out in the \nhearings, other problems are a bit more subtle, but they are also \ndamaging to the taxpayer. And that is poor and inefficient\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\nmanagement, inadequate and outdated computer systems, or the corporate \nculture that we saw much evidence of--the view of the taxpayer as the \nadversary instead of the customer. That has been deeply entrenched.\n  One example that comes to mind is the quota system. There had been an \nattempt, in previous legislation, to send clear, unmistakable direction \nto the IRS that a quota system is not to be employed. A quota system \nforces the revenue agent to look at a taxpayer who comes into his or \nher office, not as a customer who has a problem that needs to be dealt \nwith, but as a quota, that is that he or she is to be viewed as an \nindividual from which that revenue agent must collect a certain amount \nof dollars, much like a traffic cop who is told by his or her boss that \nsome 15 or 20 tickets must be issued each day. And that is what creates \nthis adversarial system.\n\n  We thought that we had eliminated that practice and that abuse. But \nno sooner had the chairman convened the hearings last fall that I \nreceived in my office, from an employee in the IRS office in Las Vegas, \nan internal document that gave every appearance of being a quota. Those \nin charge asserted that it was not a quota, but in point of fact, \nclearly, the revenue agent was given the impression that each \nindividual was to be assessed a certain amount of money in terms of \nadditional tax to be brought in. And clearly implicit in that direction \nwas the fact that that employee's future and career prospects with the \nInternal Revenue Service would be judged based upon his or her \nperformance. Hence, this confrontational relationship that I described \ncontinued to be deeply ingrained as part of this culture.\n  Now, those are not easy things to root out. I must say that \nCommissioner Rossotti and the interim director, in response to \nquestions that I raised during the course of those hearings, reaffirmed \nthe policy that no quota system would exist and that the practice which \nhad been conducted in Las Vegas, and perhaps other district offices as \nwell, was not to be continued. And to the best of my knowledge, there \nhas been no indication that it has.\n  However, I do think that one of the fundamental changes made in this \npiece of legislation--the creation of a citizen oversight board, \ninvolving six members from the private sector--can be very helpful in \nmonitoring the kinds of activity which comes to our attention as \nMembers of Congress and, hopefully, will be helpful in eliminating that \npractice. Although it does not have the pizzazz of some of the other \nprovisions, I believe the power that we invest in the new Commissioner \nto make changes at the top level of management will also have some far-\nreaching consequences.\n  It is clear that those who are steeped in this corporate culture, \nthis deeply ingrained practice that I and others who have spoken on \nthis issue have described, simply are unable to make that change, that \nthe frame of mind that allows that to continue has been such a part of \nthe daily operational conduct of the agency that in some instances at \nthe top level individuals simply have to be replaced.\n  I think it is important to point out that in Commissioner Rossotti we \nhave the first Commissioner whose background is not tax accounting law, \nbut he is an individual who is a businessman, not a lawyer, who has \ncommitted to provide the kind of management reforms that we need to \nchange that corporate culture. So the powers that we give him to make \nthose kinds of changes, which no previous Commissioner has had, I think \nwill help to send a very powerful message at the top that this is not \nbusiness as usual and that we want not only a more efficient and a more \nresponsive agency, but we want an agency that eliminates the kinds of \nabuses that were provided during the course of the hearings.\n  Some years back the Congress intended to provide an ombudsman, as it \nwas initially called, later a Taxpayer Advocate, to represent the \nindividual. Those intentions, I think, were well conceived. Indeed, in \ntheir implementation, I think an effort was made to create such a \nposition. But in point of fact, individuals who were chosen to serve in \nthis capacity came directly from the IRS, returned to the IRS, and \nbecause that individual's ultimate career plan in the IRS could be \nimpacted by his or her performance as a Taxpayer Advocate, the Taxpayer \nAdvocate Office did not achieve its desired purpose to provide \nindependent representation and advocacy on behalf of the taxpayer.\n  I believe in the legislation that will be signed into law, as a \nproduct of this bill, that we have created that kind of independence by \nmaking it clear that this is not an individual who can come directly \nfrom the IRS and immediately, upon completion of his or her tenure in \nthe Office of Independent Advocate, once again continue a career path \nwithin the IRS. That independence, in fact, as well as perception, I \nthink, will provide invaluable help to America's taxpayers.\n\n  Much criticism is directed at the agency and much is warranted. Let \nme comment, in the interest of balance, on something that the agency \nhas done an excellent job in doing and that is the implementation of \ntelefiling. It is a paperless tax filing system. In 1997, nearly 5 \nmillion taxpayers took advantage of that by simply picking up their \ntelephone and filing their return. Its calculation is done on the other \nend. It is paperless. It is fast. Those taxpayers who have a refund \ncoming to them will receive that refund much more quickly than in the \nprocess in which one files a paper return that is processed. It also is \nless cumbersome for the IRS in terms of the paperwork which has been \ngenerated, thousands and thousands of different forms and millions and \nmillions of returns. So it helps us achieve the goal of efficiency in \nterms of the IRS' response.\n  I am pleased to note in 1998, nearly 6 million taxpayers took \nadvantage of the telefiling. That is an increase of nearly 27 percent. \nIndeed, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The potential is \nsignificantly greater. Other types of electronic filing have also been \ndeveloped. In 1997, we had about 14 million who filed electronically. \nIn 1998, some 18 million. That is 28 percent. That also provides for a \nfaster evaluation of the return, provides less opportunity for errors, \nfor misdirected paperwork, and I think will be extremely helpful in \nproviding the standard of service to which the American taxpayer is \nentitled.\n  Among the more significant things, dramatically significant, is a \nshift in the burden of proof for taxpayers and small businesses when \ntheir dispute with the IRS reaches the Tax Court level. That shifts the \nburden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS. That will be another \nsignificant change. Perhaps if there is any one change that more \ndramatically signals what we are trying to accomplish in this \nlegislation in trying to provide fairness to the American people who \nare attempting to comply with a very complicated tax system, this is an \nindicator.\n  Having practiced law in years past, I am not unmindful of a situation \nwhich innocent spouses are frequently victimized by the conduct of \ntheir spouses, oftentimes in the context of separation or divorce, in \nwhich the spouse involved in business is involved in either concealing \nor fraudulently filing a return, that return is jointly signed by the \nother spouse who has no involvement in the business and no culpability. \nThe offending or culpable spouse is no longer available and the IRS \nturns to the innocent spouse. By any fair standard, that is conduct we \nshould not endorse. An innocent spouse truly not involved, not \nculpable, should not be victimized by the conduct of his or her spouse. \nThis legislation provides expanded benefits and protection for the \ninnocent spouse.\n  In addition, we do several other things. That is, we provide for \nadditional authority to award litigation costs to taxpayers who prevail \nin court disputes with the IRS. It costs a great deal of money to \nengage counsel. Most American taxpayers are not in the position to \nafford that kind of expense. It is only fair when that taxpayer \nprevails that, indeed, the cost of the litigation be recovered in favor \nof the taxpayer. We send a very strong message that the kind of \nmisconduct which was much in evidence during the hearings last year and \nthis year is not to be tolerated. We say to the American taxpayer, to \nthose who have been victimized by such conduct, that a cause of action \nfor civil damages based on claims of negligence by IRS employees will \nnow be available to such taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\n  We improve taxpayers' rights during audits, collections, including \nprohibiting the IRS from seizing residences for deficiencies of under \n$5,000 and prohibiting the IRS from seizing a residence without a court \norder, increasing the availability of taxpayer assistance, reducing \npenalties for taxpayers making good-faith efforts. I think this might \nrequire an additional word of embellishment.\n  For those taxpayers who for whatever reason have failed to pay their \nfull amount of taxes due, who are on a schedule of payment, only to \nfind that the compounding effect of penalties and fines makes it \nvirtually impossible for them ever to reduce the amount of principal \nthat is the original amount they failed to pay, nothing could be more \nfrustrating, nothing could be more discouraging, and it is a \ndisincentive to those taxpayers who say, look, I recognize I owe the \nmoney, but I don't have it all. Establish a schedule of payments so I \ncan make my payments. We heard testimony of people who had paid for \nextended periods of time and after having made such payments really had \nnot reduced their principal; if at all, very minimally. This \nlegislation addresses such an issue, and I think will be an incentive \nand encouragement for taxpayers to, indeed, begin making payments and \nto see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.\n  Greater disclosure and notice to taxpayers, including details of the \ncomputations of any penalties and interest due; more detailed \nexplanations of the entire audit and collection process in the first \ndeficiency notice; disclosure of taxpayers' rights at interviews with \nthe IRS; disclosure of the criteria for examination--all part of the \nprocess to make one's visit to the IRS less of a mysterious and \nfrightful experience, but to provide the taxpayer a broader \nunderstanding of the circumstances that bring him or her to the \noffice--rationale for the deficiency, for any that is assessed, what \nthat taxpayers' rights are in terms of responding.\n  In sum, Mr. President, all of these provisions should result in a \nmore efficient and friendly IRS in the future.\n  I want to commend the chairman of our committee with whom I have had \nthe great pleasure of working in this Congress as a newly appointed \nmember to the Senate Finance Committee, the ranking member, the senior \nSenator from New York, and my colleague who sits to my right, the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Grassley and others, who have \nlabored in the vineyards for many years to provide fairness to the \nCode. It has taken us a long time. I freely acknowledge that some of us \nhave been frustrated and thought this ought to have been done last \nyear, but there can be no doubt that our work product that will \nultimately be signed into law will be a vast improvement for the \nAmerican taxpayer, and it does enjoy the imprimatur of bipartisan \neffort and support.\n  Finally, I will address an issue that has been of concern for \nliterally tens of thousands of Nevadans who work in the hotel industry \nin our State. It is not a provision that is confined or limited to \nNevada only because the practice in the hotel industry not only in my \nown State but across America is to provide for the convenience of the \nemployee, by the employer, a meal at the business location. For more \ndecades than I can remember, that benefit has been provided and it has \nbeen viewed as a nontaxable benefit. That is to say that the meal is \nprovided and that there is no tax liability attached to that benefit \nthat the employee must pay as a result of receiving that meal at the \nemployer's expense, on the job, at the employer's place of business.\n  A year ago, a decision of the Tax Court astounded most of us who are \nfamiliar with the practice and created a situation that would be \nmonstrously unfair to literally tens of thousands of taxpayers in my \nown State where this issue was widely publicized, but would have the \npotential of affecting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of employees \nin every State in the Union. Not only would it be unfair to those \nemployees who no longer would receive that benefit--and there would \nhave been hundreds of thousands, as I say, across the country--but it \nwould have created the anomaly that some employees in some occupational \ncategories may continue to receive the benefit, their coworkers who \nworked alongside them in a different capacity would not have received \nthat benefit, thereby creating an inherent morale problem within the \nworkforce and a nightmare for employers to administer. That decision \nsent a shockwave throughout the hotel industry in my State, and \nemployees were much concerned.\n\n  The consequence of the Tax Court's decision, uncorrected, would have \nimposed several hundreds of dollars of additional tax liability each \nyear. We are not talking about those who are part of a senior executive \nclass, whose salaries are six figures or greater. By and large, we are \ntalking about people who tend to be at the bottom end of the pay scale \nin the hotel industry--those who are porters and maids and in other \ncategories. So hundreds of dollars, for them, had a major impact.\n  I am pleased to say that as a result of the bipartisan support and \nthe efforts of Nevada's delegation and the leadership on both the Ways \nand Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and several of \nour colleagues who served as conferees--I acknowledge that the senior \nSenator from Nebraska and the senior Senator from Louisiana who, in \naddition to the chairman and ranking member on our side, were extremely \nhelpful--that consequence is not going to be visited upon the tens of \nthousands of employees in my own State and the hundreds of thousands \nelsewhere.\n  In effect, a provision that is incorporated in this conference report \nwill reverse the Tax Court's decision and will continue a practice that \nwas established in terms of fairness and equity and will allow those \nemployees to continue to receive those benefits without the additional \ntax consequences that the court decision would have imposed upon such \nemployees. I want to publicly acknowledge all who were involved in \nhelping to make that provision part of this provision.\n  So, finally, Mr. President, this will not make this code a perfect \ncode. I suspect that this will not be the end of our endeavors to \nprovide additional ways in which we can provide fairness to the \nAmerican taxpayers. But, hopefully, as a consequence of this \nlegislation, the word will come from this Congress to the American \npeople that we heard the complaints, we understand their legitimacy, we \nrecognize that in a system such as our own, in which the compliance is \nessentially voluntary, we have an obligation to make sure that those \nwho are trying to comply with the provisions of our complex Tax Code \nare treated fairly and, when problems are called to our attention, we \nwill correct them.\n  Again, I salute our colleagues who worked on this. I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee for their \ncourtesies in hearing the concerns that I and other members of the \ncommittee brought.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. I want to take \nthis opportunity to commend Senator Roth for the outstanding work he \nhas done on this legislation. As a new Senator, I was impressed with \nthe hearings that Senator Roth conducted and which have galvanized this \ninstitution to move on something that was a compelling need. They were \ndramatic hearings not because they were highly choreographed or because \nthere was sophisticated promotion; they were dramatic because of the \nimpact and the gripping nature of the stories that were told to the \ncommittee and to the American people.\n  I think our country and this institution owe a great debt of \ngratitude to the Senator from Delaware for the role that he has played \nin calling the attention of the American people to the abuses. It \nbecame evident during the course of both sets of hearings that these \nstories were not isolated incidents but were all too typical, as we \nfound from the response of the American people in calling our offices \nall over Capitol Hill about similar incidents that had occurred.\n  I want to take just a moment to praise my predecessor in the U.S. \nSenate, the former senior Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor. Senator \nReid\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\nspoke of his role in taxpayer rights in the past. I think that the work \nSenator Pryor did as a Senator from Arkansas has helped to lay the \ngroundwork for the step that we are taking as a body today. I want to \nexpress my appreciation on behalf of the people of Arkansas and on \nbehalf of taxpayers across this country for Senator Pryor's unfailing \nefforts and untiring efforts to provide protections for the taxpayers \nof this country. And although the Taxpayer Bill of Rights was not the \nultimate solution, and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 was not signed \ninto law, it helped to call our attention to it and to galvanize the \nAmerican people to push for this action. I want to pay my highest \nregards to Senator Pryor, who I know is pleased with the action that \nthe U.S. Senate is taking today.\n  I think the protection provisions in this legislation will take a big \nstep toward assuring the American people that we are still on their \nside and that the tax system of this country is not stacked against \nthem. We should remind ourselves of the things that this does not do. \nIt would be, I think, a shame if this legislation were to be the \nrelease on the pressure that has built up over the years to demand \ncomprehensive tax reform. This is an essential step, and it moves the \nball in the right direction. It does not simplify the code. The code is \nstill a labyrinth of confusion, incomprehensible to many people, tax \npreparers, and to many in the IRS themselves. It does not provide the \nlower rates the American people deserve, and it does not eliminate \ninequities in the code, like the marriage penalty and the exorbitant \nestate tax rates. I know Senator Roth will continue to push for \ncomprehensive tax reform for the taxpayers of this country.\n\n  I believe that one way we can do that is to set a sunset date, a date \ncertain in which this Tax Code will be eliminated and we will require \nourselves to take action in providing comprehensive tax reform, a lower \ntax rate, a fairer Tax Code for the American people. We may disagree on \nthat, but it is imperative that this be one more step in moving toward \nwhat is essential, which is comprehensive tax reform for the American \npeople.\n  I will conclude with a statement that President Clinton made during \nhis recent trip to China, in which he addressed the students at Beijing \nUniversity and spoke to them about the nature of freedom, about our \nheritage of freedom in this country. I believe that what he said--and \nsaid eloquently--applies to the ongoing debate about IRS reform and \nrestructuring and making the Tax Code of this country fairer for the \nAmerican people. He said:\n\n       In America, we tend to view freedom as the freedom from \n     Government abuse or from Government control. That is our \n     heritage. Our founders came here to escape the monarchy in \n     England.\n\n  Then he said this:\n\n       Sometimes freedom requires affirmative steps by Government.\n\n  I simply say that this legislation, which Senator Roth has led the \nway on, is an affirmative step that this Government must take to ensure \nthat the American people truly enjoy the fruits of freedom, which is \nour legacy and heritage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the IRS \nReform Act, which is now on the floor. This is indeed, in my opinion, a \nvery historic day. Never before in the history of the Internal Revenue \nService have we ever had legislation that brought about massive changes \nto an institution that is not thought of too well by the American \npeople. This legislation goes far beyond anything that Congress has \never done in trying to reform the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I want to join with others in commending a couple of people for the \nwork they have done, particularly the chairman of our committee, the \ndistinguished Senator Roth, who chaired the hearings, which really woke \nup a number of Members of Congress to the massive problems that were \nout there. It was really very moving to hear American citizens come in \nand actually tell about their experiences and the abuses they had \nsuffered as a result of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I would, I think, fairly and properly add, however, that the vast \nmajority of the people who both work for and work at the IRS are good, \nhonest, decent citizens of this country, who are very loyal to what \nAmerica stands for and respect the rights of taxpayers in this country. \nBut as in any institution, whether it be government or private, there \nare abuses. What the hearings were able to do was to lay out in a \npublic forum the problems with the current bureaucracy that represents \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  I want to commend, in addition to Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan for \nthe work he has been doing, and I think Senator Hutchinson was proper \nin pointing out also the work done by a former Member of this body who \nused to sit right about over there on the Democratic side, a member of \nthe Democratic leadership, David Pryor. He is not with us today, he is \nresiding in Arkansas, but he is with us in spirit in the sense that we \nare discussing today something that he started a long, long time ago \nwith his Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n  Long before the Roth hearings, David Pryor was working on this \nparticular problem in bringing our attention to the defects that the \nIRS had. He always stood up for the individual taxpayers of America. I \nknow that wherever he is in Arkansas, or wherever today, he is \njustifiably proud of the work that is being done today because he led \nthe way in that area.\n  The final person is Senator Kerrey in this body from the great State \nof Nebraska who chaired an IRS reform commission. As one who chairs a \ncommission right now, I know how difficult it is to try to get people \nto agree and make recommendations on how to reform legislation. Many \ntimes a commission has so many experts on it that it is difficult to \nget any kind of consensus about change. But Senator Kerrey led the way \nin getting a commission to focus in on this problem and help produce \nlegislation and recommendations. Without his work on the committee \nitself this product would not be in the good shape that it is in today.\n  I am reminded of the old stories, which are repeated in Louisiana. \nYou have various versions of this. One of them heard is about the two \ngreatest lies ever told. The first one is people who say, ``I am from \nthe Federal Government. I am here to help you.'' Of course, the second \ngreatest lie could be just about anything that you want to add to it. \nAnd I have heard various variations, which I would not care to repeat \non the floor of the Senate. But the first one is, ``I am from the \nFederal Government. I am here to help you.''\n  It is true in a sense that people have a great deal of mistrust in \nmany institutions of government. That is unfortunate. When most people \nthink of the Internal Revenue Service, they do not think of the word \n``service.'' They think of fear, they think of intimidation, they think \nof threats, and they think of all sorts of things, none of which are \nvery good. The last thing they think of is service.\n  This legislation today will go a long way to restoring service to the \nInternal Revenue Service and letting that agency of our government know \nthat their principal function is to serve the people of this country. \nThey work for the taxpayers--not the other way around. The taxpayers in \nLouisiana should know this is a major improvement in how that agency is \ngoing to have to operate in the future, so that no longer if you get a \nletter from the Internal Revenue Service should there be a fear of \nopening it. No longer if you get a call to come down and meet with \nsomeone from the IRS should you be intimidated about having to fulfill \nthat request.\n  Some have advocated: ``Just abolish the agency.'' That is a good \nheadline. That will get you 15 seconds of fame perhaps. But is it \nresponsible? No. Is saying, ``We are going to abolish the Tax Code; and \ndon't worry, sometime in the future we may replace it with something we \nhope might be better than we have now,'' responsible? How do you buy a \nhouse if you do not know what the Tax Code is going to be? How do you \nmake a business investment if you do not know what the tax laws are \ngoing to be in 12 months? While it is very simple to say, ``Let's \nabolish everything and hopefully one day we will replace it with \nsomething that will be better than we have today,'' I question whether \nthat is the responsible thing to do. It is much easier to, as they say,\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nkick down the barn than it is to construct a new one.\n  But what we are trying to do with the Roth legislation and people who \nput this package together is to say we want to repair what is broken. \nWe want to reform what needs reform. We want to tell the American \ntaxpayers there will be predictability in how and when and how much tax \nthey legally owe to run the government functions that are important to \nthis country.\n\n  This legislation accomplishes what I think is incredibly the most \nmassive change in the IRS that we have ever had since the agency was \ncreated--to restore service, to restore confidence, to restore fairness \nto the American people when they have to deal with their government, \nwhich hopefully will treat them in a fashion that makes all of us much \nprouder of the work that we have done with this legislation.\n  Let me just make a comment about one particular aspect of the \nlegislation which I think is important.\n  The government, it is clear, has thousands of lawyers working for the \nIRS on behalf of the government--when a taxpayer is called upon, and it \nis said that they are deficient in some kind of a way--to represent the \ngovernment's interests. Now, under this legislation we will have a \ntaxpayer advocate who will now be called the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate. We have done more than just change the name. We have changed \nthe functions. Taxpayers should know that they will have someone who \nwill be on their side when they have a problem to discuss with the \nIRS--someone who will represent their interests, and not just represent \nthe interests of the government against them, but represent their \ninterests before their own government. I think that is incredibly \nimportant.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate will be appointed by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, but only after consulting with the Commissioner of the \nIRS and the new IRS oversight board.\n  It is very important to further point out that the Advocate would \nhave to have experience in customer service representing customers--not \nrepresenting just the government. You will have a requirement that he \nalso--or she--has to have experience in tax law and have experience \nrepresenting individual taxpayers. You would think you would not have \nto spell that out. But we have to make sure that person who is going to \nbe in that position has experience representing individual taxpayers, \nhas a knowledge of the tax law of this country, and also has background \nin customer service, also getting back to the point that this is a \nservice organization of our government.\n  I think it is particularly important to ensure their independence--\nthat we have also required in this legislation that the Taxpayer \nAdvocate cannot have been an IRS employee within 2 years of his or her \nappointment, and must agree not to work for the IRS for 5 years after \nserving in this position. Why is that important? I think it is pretty \nobvious--to ensure their independence. We just do not want to pull \nsomeone out of the IRS and have them serve in this position \nrepresenting taxpayers knowing that one day they will go right back to \nthe IRS, or to have a career in the IRS and have that mindset guiding \nwhat they do representing the individual taxpayers. No. We have done \njust the opposite. We say that the Taxpayer Advocate has to have \nexperience in representing the taxpayer and have experience in customer \nrelations and not be an employee of the IRS, and not go to the IRS \nwithin 5 years after they leave this job.\n  What that will ensure is that we will have a National Taxpayer \nAdvocate who will be truly interested representing the individual \ntaxpayer, so that taxpayer will know that there is someone on his or \nher side for a change when they have to present their case.\n  I also point out that people believe lots of Americans are audited. \nThat is not true. It is not true at all. Less than 2 percent of the \npeople in the country are ever audited by the IRS. Ninety-eight percent \nof the people, plus--more than 98 percent--file their taxes, pay their \ntaxes, maybe get a refund, and maybe have to owe something. But that is \nit. Ninety-eight percent plus of the people in this country are never \naudited, and abide by the law. Less than 2 percent ever have a problem \nwith having to be audited. But when a person falls into that situation, \nunder the new IRS service they will be assured of the fact that there \nwill be an advocate who will stand by their side and represent their \ninterests, and not just be an IRS employee, saying, ``Don't worry, we \nwill take care of you.''\n  This is a major part of the reform that we will be voting on today.\n  I would just say that this is monumental change. It is important. I \nthink everyone who has worked and contributed to this effort, of which \nthere have been many, would conclude with me that when we work in a \nbipartisan fashion we produce good results. And that is what we are \nvoting on today--good legislation for all of America.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, our passage today of the IRS \nrestructuring bill is a tribute to the dogged and determined efforts of \nFinance Committee Chairman Roth. This reform effort originated with the \nreport of the bipartisan National Commission on Restructuring the \nInternal Revenue Service, filed just over a year ago. It was given \nfurther impetus by the historic Finance Committee IRS oversight \nhearings held last year. Those hearings were the first comprehensive \noversight hearings ever undertaken by the Finance Committee. They \nshowed us how miserable the lives of average, law-abiding taxpayers \ncould be when they ran afoul of a tax collection agency that was at \nbest uncaring, and at worst abusive. Many taxpayers' suffering was \nprolonged; their cases got lost in an IRS black hole and took years to \nresolve. These oversight hearings really struck a nerve with the \npublic, which flooded our offices, and the Finance Committee, with \nfurther complaints of abuse, mistreatment, and inattention. There were \nwidespread calls for IRS reform. This public response not only led to \nfurther oversight hearings, but it also showed that any reform effort \nneeded to be comprehensive, addressing a range of issues broader than \nthose that surfaced during our oversight hearings. To his credit, \nChairman Roth resisted calls for a quick fix, adopting instead a \nmethodical, thoughtful approach to reform.\n\n  The result represents the most comprehensive reform of the Internal \nRevenue Service in more than 45 years. This bill contains over 50 new \ntaxpayer rights, leveling the playing field for taxpayers. It calls for \nan innovative oversight board. It assures that Congress will no longer \nshirk from oversight responsibilities. It calls for innocent spouse \nrelief for taxpayers, usually women, who were the unknowing victims of \nformer spouses that underpaid their taxes.\n  There are three aspects of this bill that I believe are especially \nsignificant and on which I want to focus my remarks. The first is the \nnew organizational structure at the IRS. Until now, the IRS has been \nadministered by the Commissioner and his or her subordinates, many of \nwhom have spent their entire career at the IRS. Since World War II, \nevery commissioner has been a tax lawyer. Last year, Commissioner \nCharles Rossotti, a non-attorney, skilled in the areas of information \nmanagement and familiar with the problems inherent in running a large \norganization, took the reins. With over 100,000 employees, the IRS \npresents a significant management challenge. Effectively managing an \nagency the size of the IRS requires skills other than those necessary \nfor tax law enforcement. With a fresh viewpoint, Commissioner Rossotti \nhas already made some proposals for reform that look promising. He has \nproposed to restructure the agency on a functional, rather than \ngeographic, basis. This will allow functional units of the IRS to \ndevelop in-depth expertise in specific aspects of tax law and to \nprovide more efficient service. The re-structuring bill builds on this \nfresh point of view, directing the Commissioner to implement an \norganizational structure with units serving particular groups of \ntaxpayers with similar needs.\n  Further, this legislation bill will assure that the IRS continues to \nbenefit from fresh ideas. Administration of the IRS will be \nsupplemented by new nine-member board, responsible for oversight of \nadministration, management, conduct, direction of the IRS, as well as \nadministration and execution of the tax laws. The majority of the board\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\nwill be outsiders with expertise in such areas as customer service and \nmanagement of large service organizations. These outsiders, not wedded \nto the current way of doing things, will be able to offer valuable \ninput on new ways of doing business and will provide an important link \nto expertise from the private sector. To my knowledge, this type of \npublic-private management partnership is unprecedented.\n  An IRS employee representative is also on the oversight board. The \npresence of an employee representative on the board generated a \nsubstantial amount of controversy. In my view, inclusion of this \nrepresentative will be key to the success of any future reform efforts. \nReforming the IRS is not going to work unless it enjoys the support and \nunderstanding of those charged with carrying out the reforms. The \nemployee representative's input will be very valuable, enabling board \nmembers unfamiliar with the day-to-day IRS operations better assess the \nimpact and workability of reform proposals.\n  Another aspect of this act that I think is particularly important is \nits emphasis on quicker and fairer dispute resolution. Taxpayers I have \ntalked to are really bothered by the length of time it takes to resolve \nproblems at the IRS. While cases await resolution, interest and \npenalties on unpaid taxes continue to accumulate. Frequently, the \namount of interest due on unpaid taxes ends up exceeding the amount of \ntaxes themselves. This bill contains several provisions that should \nmake dispute resolution faster and more efficient. First, it provides \nthat if the IRS doesn't contact taxpayers within a year after they file \ntheir returns, interest and penalties will not continue to accrue until \nthe IRS sends the taxpayer a notice that additional taxes are due.\n  Second, the bill mandates that the Commissioner's restructuring of \nthe IRS include an independent appeals function. This appeals unit is \nintended to provide a place for taxpayers to turn when they disagree \nwith the determination of front-line employees. A truly independent \nappeals unit will assure that someone takes a fresh look at taxpayers' \ncases, rather than merely rubber-stamping the earlier determination.\n  This legislation also broadens the powers of the IRS Taxpayer \nAdvocate. This will be especially important to taxpayers who find \nthemselves facing immediate and serious harm as the result of actions \ntaken by the IRS. In cases of hardship, the Taxpayer Advocate can \nintervene to issue taxpayer assistance orders, requiring the IRS to \nrelease seized property or otherwise refrain from taking action that \ncould result in a significant hardship. The definition of ``significant \nhardship'' is expanded. This should make taxpayer assistance orders \nmore widely available. In addition, the bill provides that persons \nappointed to the post of Taxpayer Advocate must agree not to accept \nemployment with the IRS during the five-year period following their \ntenure. This will assure that they won't hesitate to overturn IRS \nactions out of concern about offending future bosses or co-workers.\n  These provisions represent important steps to cut down on the time it \ntakes to resolve disputes. In addition, the bill provides for informal \nTax Court proceedings in certain types of small cases, giving more \ntaxpayers, usually without lawyers, a greater opportunity to resolve \ndisputes that cannot be resolved administratively. Expanded criteria \nfor installment agreements and offers-in-compromise should mean that \nmore taxpayers will be able to take advantage of those settlement \ntools.\n  The last aspect on which I want to comment is the role that Congress \nwill play in these reforms. With more frequent Congressional oversight, \nperhaps a bill of this scope might never have been necessary. With more \noversight, we in Congress might better to be able to identify and \naddress problems when they first arise. This bill imposes oversight \nresponsibilities on Congress. It will assure that the Committees of \nCongress with jurisdiction over the IRS will hold an oversight hearing \nat least once a year.\n  In addition, this measure requires that when Congress passes a tax \nbill, it must consider the practical consequences of tax law changes. \nOur tax system is built on the principles of self-reporting and self-\nassessment. Luckily, we have relatively high compliance rates from \nindividual taxpayers. The increasing complexity of our tax laws, \nhowever, threatens to undermine voluntary compliance. The more complex \nthe law becomes, the more difficult we make it for taxpayers to comply. \nThe bill provides that IRS should comment on the administrability of \ntax law amendments when they are under consideration by the tax-writing \ncommittees. The IRS must also submit an annual report on sources of \ncomplexity in administering the tax code. Finally, the bill requires \ncommittee reports to include an analysis by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation of complexity and administrability issues. When we considered \nthe tax law proposals in the Taxpayer Reform Act of 1997, it would have \nbeen helpful to know how those proposals would translate into new \nrecord keeping and paperwork requirements for taxpayers. This analysis \nwill be a helpful, welcome addition to the legislative process.\n  I suspect that nothing we do will make the IRS loved, but this bill \nmakes it a kinder and gentler agency. It will be an agency guided by \nprinciples of fairness, rather than the bottom line and an agency held \naccountable for its actions, no longer out of control. Any organization \nthe size of the IRS is going to experience some problems, and adoption \nof this conference report isn't going to solve every problem in our tax \ncollection process. Still, it is our obligation here in Congress to see \nthat those problems are minimized to the largest degree possible. This \nbill marks the beginning of fundamental structural changes at the IRS; \nit changes the way the IRS does business. It also provides important \nnew protections for taxpayers embroiled in a dispute with the IRS. Most \ntaxpayers pay their taxes and never again hear from the IRS. These \ntaxpayers may not appreciate any immediate consequences of the new \ntaxpayer protections. All of us, however, should benefit from a more \nefficient and effective tax collection process that I hope will result \nfrom the sweeping reforms we initiate today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe in the order I was the next to \nspeak, but our colleague from Utah has a committee hearing to chair, \nand so I would ask that he be recognized next, reserving my right to \nspeak after Senator Hatch, in the hopes that my colleague from Montana \ncould be recognized after my remarks so we maintain the balance of \nspeakers on either side of the aisle. I also ask unanimous consent that \nfor the duration of the consideration of this conference report Mr. \nJason McNamara, Ms. Catharine Cyr, Mr. Brian O'Hara, and Mr. Michael \nMagidson of my staff be accorded floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for allowing me to \nmake my remarks ahead of his. It is very accommodative and I appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. President, today we will cast one of the most important votes of \nthe 105th Congress. Today, we vote to enhance the power of the \nindividual taxpayer and to reduce the opportunity for abuse by an arm \nof the federal government. We will vote on the conference report to \nH.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998. This legislation is a tremendous leap forward in enhancing the \ncredibility and effectiveness of the IRS.\n  But Mr. President, this bill is about more than just changing the way \none federal agency works. This bill is about reflecting American values \nand priorities; it is about remembering who the federal government is \nhere to serve and what it is here to do.\n  Of all the powers bestowed upon a government, the power of taxation \nis the one most open to abuse. As the agency responsible for \nimplementing and enforcing the tax laws that we here in Congress pass, \nno other agency touches the lives of American citizens more completely \nthan the IRS.\n  I believe that Americans understand and appreciate that they have to \npay taxes. Without their tax dollars, there would be no national \ndefense; no Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid; no environmental \nprotections; no assistance\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\nfor education or job training; no national parks, food inspection, or \nfunds for highways and bridges.\n  But, everywhere I go in Utah, I hear from my constituents about their \nfrustrations. My office receives numerous letters each month detailing \ntaxpayer interactions with the IRS. It seems that everyone has had, or \nknows someone who has had, a bad experience with the IRS. This adds to \nthe impression of the IRS as an unfeeling, impersonal machine that will \nrun roughshod over anyone in its way.\n  I, myself, have seen abuses at the hands of the IRS. One of the \nreasons I ran for the U.S. Senate over twenty years ago was because of \nthe abuses I saw. As an attorney, I had occasion to represent taxpayers \nagainst the IRS. The treatment these taxpayers received appalled me--\nand that was twenty years ago. The stories have not changed all that \nmuch over the years; in fact, they seem to be occurring more and more \nfrequently.\n  The stories range from small annoyances such as unanswered phones or \nlong periods of time spent on hold to shocking abuses such as \nunwarranted seizures of assets or criminal investigations being based \non false information for the purpose of personal revenge. It is small \nwonder that the taxpayers are scared and frustrated. These stories \nillustrate a disturbing trend. They are dramatic reminders of the \nfailure of Congress to exercise adequate oversight over a powerful \nfederal agency.\n  I have been here long enough to know that we are never going to be \nable to achieve a system where people do not get frustrated about \npaying their taxes--both the process of paying taxes and the amounts. \nLet's face it: paying taxes is not something we will ever enjoy doing.\n  We must, however, achieve a system of collection that is efficient, \nfair, and, above all, honest. While not perfect, the conference report \nbefore us today moves us a long way toward a better system.\n  During our oversight hearings and through letters to my office, I \nhave heard several horror stories from taxpayers, innocent spouses, IRS \nemployees, and those who have been the subjects of criminal raids and \ninvestigations. While these are the minority of the cases dealt with by \nthe IRS, they still illustrate the nature of the abuses occurring.\n  We are not talking about appropriate enforcement of the law. We are \ntalking about heavy-handed abuses of enforcement powers. At best, such \ntactics are counterproductive; at worst, it is reprehensible behavior \nby big government. It must stop.\n  The conference report before us is a comprehensive approach to \nreforming the IRS. No one provision can stand alone as the silver \nbullet that brought down the bear. Taken as a whole, however, this \nlegislation provides a strong foundation for a new IRS by changing the \nway the IRS operates and interacts with individual taxpayers.\n  The bill before us today gives the IRS Commissioner great flexibility \nto carry out a fundamental reorganization of the agency. But, it also \nplaces the IRS under an independent, mostly private sector board to \noversee the big picture of operations at the agency. Through this \nboard, the American taxpayer will now have a focused advocate examining \nthe operations of the IRS and input into the way the agency runs. These \nare two very important elements to creating a new culture at the IRS: \nresponsible leadership and accountability.\n  I commend the new Commissioner for the steps he has taken so far to \nrectify these problems at the IRS, and I encourage him to keep going. \nAnd, I hope he will not feel constrained by ``business as usual'' \nattitudes among those who have an interest in maintaining the current \nmethods. I hope the new Commissioner will shake the dead wood out of \nthe trees.\n  But, Mr. Rossotti needs to know that Congress will hold him and the \nagency accountable. And, our expectations--and the expectations of the \nAmerican people--are not hard to fathom.\n  We do not expect tax delinquents or cheats to go undetected or \nunpenalized. But, we do expect the IRS to enforce our tax laws \nappropriately. We expect the IRS to assist taxpayers to understand and \ncomply with complicated laws and regulations. We expect taxpayers to be \ntreated courteously. We expect taxpayers' questions to be answered \npromptly and their returns processes efficiently. And, we expect any \npenalties to fit the crime.\n  Today, we will vote on a bill that takes a leap forward in \neradicating a culture that has allowed corruption and abuse to occur \nover and over again and to taint the efforts of honorable IRS \nemployees. There has been a lot of talk about changing the IRS into a \nservice-oriented agency, and the bill before us goes a long way towards \ndoing just that. We cannot stop there, however.\n  While customer service is an important part of the equation, we must \ngo further and address taxpayer rights. The conference report removes \ntaxpayers from the reach of IRS excesses by instituting over 70 new \nrights and protections. The way the taxpayer deals with the IRS, \nindividual IRS employees, and the courts will be changed.\n  The conference report shifts the burden of proof in selected \nsituations off of the taxpayer and onto the IRS. It also ensures that \ncompromise is more accessible to taxpayers by making offers-in-\ncompromise and installment agreements easier to achieve and the terms \nof these agreements more flexible.\n  The conference report also contains some much-needed assistance for \ninnocent spouses. The understatement thresholds are lowered and it is \nnow easier for taxpayers to receive innocent spouse protections. In \naddition, limited proportional liability will now be available to a \nspouse who is legally separated and living apart for at least one year \nfrom the person with whom a taxpayer originally filed a joint return.\n  Interest and penalty accrual will be suspended after a year in some \ncases when the IRS fails to notify a taxpayer of a liability for \nadditional taxes within 18 months of filing a tax return. This period \nwill be shortened to within one year of filing the tax return after the \nyear 2004.\n  The conference report also makes significant changes to the Taxpayer \nAdvocate's Office to ensure that it will be an empowered and \nindependent voice for the taxpayers.\n  A long list of procedural due process safeguards are also provided in \nreaction to IRS collection abuses. These include a 30-day period to \nappeal before liens and levies are put into place, early referral to a \nstrengthened and more independent appeals division, and implementation \nof fair debt collection practices.\n  The conference report increases congressional accountability for the \nperformance of the IRS through provisions such as streamlined \ncongressional oversight and an independent voice for the IRS in the \ntax-writing process.\n  This legislation also contains legislative incentives for tax law \nsimplification by requiring a tax complexity analysis for new \nlegislation.\n  In this vein, the conference report goes one step further and \nsimplifies one of the most embarrassingly complex computations for \ntoday's taxpayers by retroactively reducing the holding period to \nqualify for the preferential capital gains tax rate from 18 months to \n12 months. This provision not only simplifies the process, it also \nreduces capital gains taxes and encourages further investment.\n  The legislation before us today will fundamentally change how the IRS \nworks. It is a necessary and bold set of initiatives. But, we cannot \njust declare victory and bask in the glow of a job well done. We must \nremember how we got to this point in the first place.\n  The IRS was not born evil, and it is not an inherently bad \norganization. Rather, it has suffered from decades of neglect and \ninadequate oversight. Once we have set the agency on the road to \nrecovery and given it the tools it needs to move forward, we must \ncontinue to guide it and ensure that the agency continues down the \nright road. Passage of this bill does not mean we can pat ourselves on \nthe back and tell ourselves what a great job we did.\n  We must continue to exercise our oversight responsibility. We must \nhave continued hearings, reviews, and cooperation. We must remain \nvigilant in our search for areas where further reform is needed and \nways to simplify the tax code. Left alone, any entity with power and \nauthority will lose its way. Without continued oversight and \ncooperation, we will soon see this debate repeated on the Senate floor.\n  This legislation can be summed up in one word--accountability. For \ntoo\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\nlong, the IRS and its employees have operated in an environment with \nlittle or no accountability. This bill changes all that. The \nlegislation before us makes individual IRS employees accountable for \ntheir actions. It makes management more accountable for the treatment \ngiven taxpayers and other employees. Finally, it makes the agency as a \nwhole more accountable to the Congress and the American taxpayer.\n  This debate has focused largely on the negative--and there is plenty \nof negative to focus on. But, we must also put these abuses and \nmisdeeds in perspective. I believe that they are the exception and not \nthe rule. Just as a vast majority of the taxpayers are honestly trying \nto comply with the tax code, the vast majority of IRS employees are \nhonest and hard working individuals doing their best in a very \ndifficult and unpopular job.\n  Yes, abuses do occur, and we must reform the system to prevent \nimproper activities. At the same time, we must make sure that we \nacknowledge those employees who are doing their jobs with competence \nand integrity. I have to look only as far as my own state of Utah to \nfind numerous examples of this type of employee.\n  I'd like to take a moment to recognize the exemplary work of several \nIRS employees in the Ogden, Utah, office of the IRS. I daresay that my \ncolleagues could find IRS personnel in their states who share this \ndedication to service.\n  Milt Flinders has worked with the IRS for 26 years, 13 of them as a \nmanager. He currently has 20 IRS employees working under his \nsupervision. Mr. Flinders has great management skills, and has a well-\nknown reputation for being fair both to IRS employees and to the \ntaxpayers with whom he comes in contact.\n\n  Avon Wales has worked with the IRS for 20 years. She currently works \nas an office collection representative/revenue officer aide. Ms. Wales \nis a very conscientious employee who makes sure she knows the relevant \nrules and procedures regarding each case she works on. She treats \ntaxpayers with kindness and patience, often putting in hours at a time \nwith an individual taxpayer who is confused about the rules or needs \nadditional assistance.\n  Susan Vail, a revenue officer, has worked with the IRS for 31 years. \nShe makes sure she stays current with the complex laws and procedures \nsurrounding the collection of taxes--no easy task there. She is fair \nand evenhanded in her dealings with taxpayers. She gets positive marks \nfrom her supervisors and other IRS employees, but, perhaps most \nimportantly from taxpayers themselves who have worked with her.\n  These three, and other employees like them, are the reason that most \ntaxpayers today, even if frustrated by the forms and irritated with the \namount of their tax bill, continue to comply with our voluntary tax \ncollection system. Thank goodness for these employees.\n  Is this conference report perfect? No. There are some things I would \nlike to see changed. For example, I have some serious concerns about \nthe creation of an accountant-client privilege in this context. I am \nconcerned that we are using the Internal Revenue Code to effectively \namend the Federal Rules of Evidence. We have a clear procedure for \namending these rules already set out. Changing these rules is no simple \nmatter. It should only be done through careful, deliberate evaluation \nof the change and the effect it will have on the judicial system. It \nshould only be done with input from the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States and others.\n  Despite these misgivings, I want to reiterate the importance of the \nbill before us today. The IRS touches more taxpayers in more aspects of \ntheir lives than probably any other agency. The American taxpayers have \nevery right to expect a higher level of professionalism, customer \nservice, and fair treatment from an agency charged with enforcing the \nlaw in an area as important and pervasive as is the area of taxation.\n  The conference report before us stays true to the ultimate goal of \nthe IRS reform legislation--it protects both the honest taxpayer trying \nto comply with our complex tax laws and those honest employees \nstruggling to enforce an almost incomprehensible set of tax laws with \nintegrity. This conference report takes on and accomplishes the \ndifficult task of striking the right balance between granting taxpayers \nthe experience of paying taxes without abusive treatment while \nproviding the tools necessary to fund the Government.\n  There is no question that we have come a long way, with this bill, to \nresolve many of the conflicts and problems that do exist between \ntaxpayers and those who serve the taxpayers at the IRS. This bill makes \ngigantic steps forward, to try to make the system more fair. I think we \non the Finance Committee and those on the Ways and Means Committee in \nthe House have certainly all worked very hard to get this done.\n  In particular, I commend Senators Roth and Moynihan, Representatives \nArcher and Rangel, and my colleagues on the IRS Conference Committee \nfor the hard work they put into crafting the conference report before \nus today. I was proud to add my name to the conference report as a \nconferee. I wholeheartedly support its passage and urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  This is the right thing to do. Once we have this done, then, it seems \nto me, Democrats and Republicans have to get together to see if we can \nsimplify our tax system in whatever way is best in the interests of the \ntaxpayers of America. This is only step one, but it is an important \nstep. It is a step that will make a lot of difference in people's \nlives. It is a step that will make this system much more fair than it \nhas been in the past.\n  But it is only the first step. If we can get together and come up \nwith a way of simplifying the Tax Code so everybody can fill out their \nown tax forms, for the most part, and also make it more fair to \neverybody in America, then I think in the end we will have done things \nthat no other group of people in the history of our country would have \ndone. I know we have colleagues here on both committees, the Finance \nCommittee and the Ways and Means Committee, who have the capacity to do \nthis, both on the Democrat side and on the Republican side. I call on \nall our colleagues to do that, whether it be by a flat tax, a value-\nadded tax, a sales tax, or any other of a number of approaches. We have \nto look into this and get this code so it is not the monstrosity that \nwe all know it to be today.\n  Having said this, I thank again my dear colleague from Florida for \nhis kindness and also my colleague from Montana. I appreciate their \ndeferring to me so I could make these few remarks. I really appreciate \nit. Thanks very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to my \ncolleague and good friend from Utah for his kind remarks, as well as \nfor his excellent analysis of this legislation. I join him in the same \nenthusiastic reform of the Internal Revenue Service and see this as an \nimportant chapter in a longer book which will soon bring us to the \npages of simplification of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does mark a new era for the Internal \nRevenue Service. The hearings that we had disclosed some of the culture \nof the IRS as it has operated in the past. We focused on how to change \nthat cultural orientation. Let me just mention three areas that we \nuncovered.\n  One was typical of many large organizations, public or private, and \nthat is a loss of focus on the mission and a tendency to become too \ninternal in the way in which issues were reviewed. That tendency to \nbecome incestuous, to answer questions based on what is in the best \ninterests of the organization rather than what is in the best interests \nof the customers--in this case, the taxpayers served by the \norganization--is, unfortunately, a typical transformation and a \ntransformation which we found that the IRS had succumbed to. The new \nIRS will begin to analyze issues from the perspective of their \ncustomers, the American taxpayers, and, with that new reorientation, \nwill become more effective in carrying out its mission and will be seen \nby the taxpayers as being less intrusive in their lives.\n  A second aspect of the old IRS was its evaluation of employees based \non how much money was collected. This is analogous to a police \ndepartment which requires its officers to issue so many parking tickets \nor speeding tickets per day. It changes the priorities, it\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\nchanges the perspective, it changes the public respect of the \norganization. I am pleased that the new IRS will evaluate employees \nbased on how they deal with taxpayers as well as on their collection \nefforts.\n  A third factor in the old IRS was the tendency to threaten taxpayers \nwith enforcement action if they didn't agree to extend terms of payment \nor enter into other measures that would make tax collection easier for \nthe IRS. We had an example of this recently, in which the IRS--and I \ncommend them for having come forward with this--became aware that there \nwere threats being made to taxpayers who already had entered into a \nmultiyear installment payment, where a portion of that installment \npayment would be beyond the statute of limitations, beyond the reach of \nthe IRS. Taxpayers in that circumstance were being threatened that, if \nthey did not agree to waive the statute of limitations, they would be \nsubjected to immediate cancellation of their installment agreement and \nrequired to make full payment at that time.\n  The IRS had uncovered that there were approximately 22,000 instances \nof that improper threat and are in the process of notification. I am \npleased to say on June 29 of this year, in Tampa, FL, the first actual \ncheck of over $1,500 was paid to a taxpayer as a refund because of the \nconsequences of such a threat.\n  Mr. Carl Junstrom, who was the taxpayer receiving that refund, has \nbecome a hero of American taxpayers because of his efforts to overcome \nthe travails to which he was subjected and now has become a symbol that \nindividual taxpayers can prevail in their own cases and can benefit \nmany thousands of others.\n  One of the significant parts of this reform effort is that it was a \ngrassroots-up effort. It was an effort that didn't start by Washington \ntelling American taxpayers what their problems with the IRS were, but \nrather listening, understanding, and then being willing to act on what \nwe had heard.\n  This is in the best tradition of democracy. Many of these individual \nissues came to the attention of the IRS and to congressional offices \nthrough taxpayers who had specific problems with the IRS, and they \nbrought them to the attention of a taxpayer advocate in the IRS or to \ntheir Member of Congress.\n  That kind of information began to accumulate, and it was seen that \nthe problems were not specific and focused, but rather began to \ndisclose a pattern of IRS problems, a pattern of needs for taxpayers to \nhave a new relationship with their tax collection agency.\n  Those individual taxpayer concerns then became the focus of hearings \nthat were held by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and \nMeans Committee. Some of those were held here in Washington; others \nwere held across the Nation. In January of this year, I participated in \nsuch a hearing with Congresswoman Karen Thurman in Orlando, FL, in \nwhich we heard, again, some of the specifics of taxpayer concerns which \nhad previously been the subject of specific constituent complaints. Let \nme just mention a couple of those.\n  Karen Andreasen, from Hillsborough County, FL, when filing for \ndivorce discovered that her soon-to-be ex-husband had failed to file \ntax returns for 1993 and 1994. She then found that the IRS, having \nlaunched its case against her ex-husband, swiftly turned its attention \nto her. Tax liens were placed on her home; the bank holding her \nmortgage threatened her with foreclosure.\n  A separation or divorce is painful enough for both of the parties and \nthe children and others who are affected, without suddenly realizing--\nlike Karen Andreasen, a spouse who had placed confidence in her ex-\nhusband and signed joint returns--they are subject to a deficit of \nthousands of dollars in back taxes on income they never earned and on \ntax returns that they never understood.\n  Congress has now recognized the problem of Karen Andreasen and, in \nthis legislation, we have provided that divorced or separated spouses \ncan elect to be responsible for only their proportionate share of the \ntaxes.\n  We have also liberalized the circumstances under which other \ntaxpayers may obtain innocent-spouse relief, and we have made this \nretroactive to currently opened cases so that Karen Andreasen and \nthousands of other spouses like her will be able to get the benefit of \nthese new provisions.\n  Thomas Jones was a decorated Naval veteran from Clearwater, FL. His \nbusiness partner absconded with the company's payroll taxes. Mr. Jones \ndid what a responsible citizen should do: He notified the authorities. \nIRS initially thanked him for his assistance, then proceeded to hold \nhim 100 percent responsible for the partnership debt. Under pressure \nand unable to afford legal representation, Mr. Jones elected a monthly \npayment plan.\n  When I met with him at an IRS reform hearing in Orlando, he told me \nthat he was bankrupt. Interest and penalties were piling up at a \nstaggering $2,000 a month. Twice during his 13-year-long fight, Thomas \nhad offered to compromise with the IRS, but was summarily rejected by \nthe same collection agent who a few days earlier had been bugging him \nfor additional money.\n  Good news. Thomas Jones may be the last taxpayer to suffer from such \nunfair conflict of interest, because this reform legislation expands \nthe authority of the IRS to accept offers of compromise and guarantees \nto Americans an independent third party review of their offers and \ncompromise. This will prevent the same IRS division from serving as \nprosecutor, judge, jury and executioner.\n  Mr. President, those are just two examples of Americans with specific \nproblems who now have contributed to relief for themselves and for \nthousands of current and future taxpayers.\n  There are some lessons in this experience which I think we in \nCongress need to understand, appreciate and absorb into our future \nactions.\n  First, much of our success, in addition to taking advantage of the \nexperiences of individual Americans, was the result of an IRS reform \ncommission which was established 2 years ago. I applaud Senator \nGrassley, who is with us this afternoon, and Senator Bob Kerrey, for \nthe work they did on that IRS reform commission. That gave to us the \nbasis of thoughtful recommendations and analyses which substantially \naccelerated the work of the Congress and the effectiveness of that \nwork.\n\n  This indicates to me that we need to commit ourselves as a Congress \nto ongoing oversight of the IRS; that we can't wait until there is an \noccasional commission formed to review this matter; that we must have \nan ongoing responsibility to see that this agency does not slip back \ninto the patterns of conduct that necessitated the legislation that we \nwill be adopting later today.\n  Second, we must recognize that this is but a chapter in the larger \nbook of how to make the Internal Revenue Code more understandable, more \nappropriate, more taxpayer friendly. I suggest that the next chapter, \nwhich will be simplification of the Tax Code, use some of these lessons \nthat we have just learned. That it, too, take advantage of the \nexperience of individual Americans in what they would like to see, \nbased on their own experience, in a more simplified tax structure for \nAmerica; that we look to the use of expert panels, such as the IRS \nreform commission, to help give us indepth advice and advance our \nability to engage in this next step of simplification of the Tax Code.\n  My own sense is that a third lesson learned is that Congress can make \nsubstantial steps if it does it in digestible increments. I suggest \nthat as we look at the Internal Revenue Code we ask the question: What \nare the building blocks of the Internal Revenue Code? How can we take \neach of these blocks in turn and systematically have it reviewed based \non taxpayer experience, based on expert review and then, finally, \ncongressional hearings and congressional action?\n  I believe if we take that digestible, incremental approach, in a \nreasonable period of time we will be able to say to the American people \nthat we have reformed not only the administration, but also the Tax \nCode itself, and reformed it in a way that will make it more \nunderstandable and more acceptable to the American taxpayer.\n  I conclude by applauding Senator Roth for his great leadership and \nSenator Moynihan in holding the hearings that first exposed the \nproblems of the IRS. I urge that we continue our active involvement as \nwe see that this legislation achieves its intended result and\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\nmove to the next chapter of simplification of the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  Mr. President, this is a happy day. I will, with enthusiasm, join \nwhat I am confident will be a large majority of my colleagues in voting \nfor this conference report which will move us substantially towards the \ngoal of an IRS Code that all Americans, that all those affected by its \nadministration, will feel prouder about as citizens and will make their \ntask of compliance with their tax responsibilities somewhat easier. \nThank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as all Members are aware, when a cloture \nmotion is filed in the Senate, the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture \nrule, require all first-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by \n1 p.m. the day before the cloture vote occurs.\n  Last evening, I filed cloture on the substitute amendment to the \nproduct liability bill. Realizing and observing how upset the \nDemocratic leader was when cloture was filed last night, I checked with \nthe desk as to exactly how many amendments had been filed to the \nproduct liability bill by our Democratic colleagues. To my dismay, \nearlier only two had been filed, but still a very small number, and \nonly 21 Democratic amendments have been filed, and it is almost 1 p.m., \nthe deadline time.\n  The Democratic leader stated last evening that many Members on his \nside of the aisle had amendments they wish to offer on this bill. And \nhe also stated, ``It is the right of all Senators to fulfill the \nfunctions of their responsibilities to offer amendments.'' Well, where \nare the amendments? And why have Members on the Democratic side of the \naisle chosen not to file amendments within the timeframe that is \noutlined under rule XXII?\n  Could it be that our colleagues had never been prepared to exercise \ntheir right to offer amendments when it comes to the legislation? \nInstead, have our colleagues on the other side of the aisle just \ndecided they would vote against cloture with the intention of never \nattempting to offer amendments that would have been intended, I am \nsure, to ``improve the bill,'' as Senator Daschle suggested?\n  Since there have only been 21 amendments filed, it seems to me that \nmaybe our Democratic colleagues are not serious about addressing this \nimportant issue which is, by the way, a bill that has been laboriously \nworked out. It is a compromise bill. Senator Gorton of Washington, \nSenator Rockefeller of West Virginia, have spent hours, days, months \nworking on this. And this legislation has been approved by the \nadministration, by the White House. They have indicated they would sign \nit. So why in the world would there not be a serious attempt here to \npass this legislation?\n  But having said all that, I am prepared to offer a consent agreement \nthat would extend the filing time for first-degree amendments until 5 \np.m. this afternoon, if that would help accommodate our colleagues on \nthe Democratic side or, for that matter, on the Republican side.\n  Therefore, I do now ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding rule \nXXII, that the filing deadline for the first-degree amendments with \nrespect to the product liability bill be extended to 5 p.m. this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I would like to speak a little bit about \nthe conference report that is before us, the IRS restructuring bill.\n  Today, the Senate reaches the end of a journey that has been 2 long \nyears in the making. It is actually a journey that began a couple years \nago when the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS was charged \nwith investigating the IRS' repeated failure to modernize its computer \nsystems. There are many stories of the IRS computer systems falling \ndown, crashing, systems not meshing; and essentially the commission \nfelt that it was their charge to try to find the answer to all these \nproblems.\n  It became very clear, Mr. President, as the commission began trying \nto find a solution to the computer problems, that it was just touching \nthe tip of the iceberg, that there are a lot more problems in the IRS \nthat had to be addressed; namely, the abuse of too many agents, too \nmany rogue agents, the insensitivity, too often, of its IRS employees \ntoward taxpayers. Frankly, it led the commission to dig much more \ndeeply into problems facing the IRS. Accordingly, the commission \nproceeded to look at other areas in addition to computers. The \ncommission probed various problems that the taxpayers face in our \ncountry.\n  Under the leadership of Senators Kerrey and Grassley and \nRepresentatives Portman and Coyne of the House, the commission, I \nthink, produced a series of very good recommendations that have become \nthe foundation of the bill before us.\n  Again, it was a restructuring commission. They spent a lot of time \nlooking at the problems of the IRS. They presented their \nrecommendations to the Congress, and essentially, the bill before the \nCongress today is the manifestation, the outgrowth of those \nrecommendations by the commission.\n  In addition, Mr. President, under the leadership of our chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Bill Roth, with his very extensive hearings, we \nwere able to draw out many more abuses, many more problems that our \nAmerican people were facing with the IRS. As a consequence, I think we \nhave a better bill. We were able to fine-tune some of those \nRestructuring Commission recommendations. In fact, we were able to add \na few more. So altogether, I do think it is a combination of very good \neffort on the part of both the commission and the conference. And I \nthink, Mr. President, that the result is going to turn out to be quite \ngood for the American people--not perfect, but certainly an \nimprovement.\n\n  Justice John Marshall once said, ``The power to tax involves the \npower to destroy.'' We all know that the corollary to that is that the \npower of the tax collector must be very carefully balanced, because the \ntax collector, him or herself, has inordinate power when he or she \ntries to collect taxes. Any tax collection agency must be strong enough \nto make sure that everyone is paying his or her fair share of taxes, \nbut not so powerful as to trample on the rights of ordinary citizens.\n  It is quite clear, through the testimony of our witnesses before our \ncommittee and comments from our constituents at home, that the IRS has \nlost that balance over the years.\n  Let me give you one example.\n  This is a plea for help from a constituent of mine in Montana. ``The \nproblem with the IRS started in 1997. John''--that is not this person's \nreal name--``and I''--in this case it is John's wife--``had just bought \na house. I was a semester away from graduating from college, and we \nthought the [failed] business [that we had] was behind us. The last \nweek in July 1997, I returned home after a day of working at my part-\ntime job to find a nasty note on my front door from [an agent] stating \nthat he had `tracked' us down and expected a phone call or [else] \naction would be taken. I promptly called him to find out [what was \ngoing on]. He was very rude and reluctant to give me any information, \n[saying he could not talk to me, did not want to talk to me\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\nbecause he was not talking to my husband].''\n  The long and the short of it is--and I am paraphrasing the letter \nhere--``. . . he began talking to me in a [very] degrading manner. He \nsaid, `. . . I expect to [get taxes] in full,' [and said it in a very \nrude way]. When I asked him to explain, he . . . [treated me like] a \ncriminal who was running [away] from the IRS.''\n  Continuing further, Mr. President, basically, the agent in this case \nput a lien on everything this person owned, also made many personal \ncomments. He obviously investigated the personal lives of these \ntaxpayers and basically was so rude and so arrogant as to performing \nalmost Gestapo tactics against my constituents. My constituent ends up, \nMr. President, in her letter by saying that very clearly the Government \nwas not working for the people, but rather was working against the \npeople.\n  I think this letter sums up the issue in a nutshell; that is, to make \nthe Government work much more for people, not against them, that is, \nput service back into the Internal Revenue Service instead of being \narrogant and degrading people as much as the Service has in the past.\n  Now, we certainly do not want to tie the IRS' hands so much that tax \ncheats are encouraged. The rest of us, as we all know, end up picking \nup the tab when someone else cheats. At the same time, we also can't \nhave the IRS harassing innocent citizens and assuming everyone is \nguilty the minute they walk into the door. We have to find that \nbalance. It is not an easy matter. I believe this legislation will help \nthe IRS find its way back to that balance.\n  What does it do? It creates a board made up chiefly of private \ncitizens, subject to the confirmation powers of the Senate, giving the \nSenate an opportunity to ask lots of questions of these new board \nmembers to see whether or not they fill the bill.\n  The board will also keep an eye on the IRS budget, report \nindependently to the Congress its recommendations on IRS budget \nmatters, and not have to go through the regular Government channels. \nThe board will focus on long-term goals. It will also make sure the \nService stays on track to meet these goals. It will also ferret out \nproblems to help the IRS itself find solutions.\n\n  The bill creates much more personnel flexibility, making it easier \nfor the new Commissioner, with his enthusiasm, who wants to get things \nshaped up, giving him flexibility to reward employees doing well. I \nthink this flexibility will help the IRS attract competent people, \npeople who are technically competent and management experts. You get \nwhat you pay for. If you want to get good people, you have to be able \nto pay them well and you have to give them the wherewithal to do the \njob right. There has not been sufficient flexibility to this point in \nthe IRS.\n  This bill also reorganizes the IRS, somewhat in the same vein as a \nmajor American company, IBM, was reorganized when IBM years ago \nrealized it was falling behind, that it was not serving customers, \ncustomers were not No. 1. It made dramatic changes. Mr. Rossotti was \npart of those changes at IBM, and we are hopeful some of the changes \nwill work here.\n  What are some examples? One major example: Currently, when a taxpayer \nhas a problem with the IRS and it involves several kinds of problems--\nsay, income tax or payroll tax or a corporate tax is involved--the \nagent who handles the case transfers all the files over to the person \nresponsible, say, for payroll taxes; if it is a corporate tax file, it \nis transferred to a corporate tax person; and if it is another problem, \nit is transferred to that person, essentially passing the buck. So when \nan individual taxpayer tries to find out what in the world is going on \nwith his file, sometimes the file is lost, the person he or she calls \ndoesn't know the answer to the question; it is just a mess.\n  How do we attempt to solve it? Essentially, the IRS now will be \ndivided into four separate divisions: One for small business, one for \nlarge corporations, a third for tax-exempt institutions, and a fourth \nfor individual taxpayers. Now, when you, a taxpayer, have a question \nfor the IRS, one person is in charge of your file--one person, more \naccountability. If you are a small business person, it is the small \nbusiness section; an individual taxpayer, the individual taxpayer \nsection--even though you may have questions involving different parts \nof the code. That should help reduce ``buck passing.''\n  The bill also adds important new taxpayer protections to help protect \ncitizens against arbitrary actions. There are penalty and interest \nprovisions suspended or reduced. Too often, the IRS has taken advantage \nof the penalty and the interest provisions in the law to browbeat \ntaxpayers. A number of due process requirements are created. For \nexample, legislation would require the IRS to give a delinquent \ntaxpayer 30 days' notice to request a hearing before property is \nseized. In addition, the IRS is required here to seize business \nproperty only as a last resort. That has not always been the case. It \nfurther prohibits the seizure of a personal residence without court \napproval. That is a major change.\n  The bill further makes it easier for an innocent spouse to get relief \nfrom tax debts that the guilty spouse may have accumulated. It shifts \nthe burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in court proceedings \nso long as the taxpayer keeps appropriate records and cooperates with \nthe agency.\n  I am not positive this is exactly tailored the way it should be. \nCurrently, in our judicial system, the burden of proof is on the \nGovernment when they bring an action against a citizen. That is the way \nit should be. Up to this point, that has not been the case with respect \nto our tax laws, the theory being that the taxpayer is the one who \nkeeps the books and records so the taxpayer should have the obligation \nto show that he or she should not have to pay the taxes the IRS is \nseeking. The burden of proof still is on, probably, the wrong place. We \nhave tried to find the right balance here. I hope this provision in the \nstatute works. Only time will tell. If there are problems, we will have \nto address them.\n\n  The bill further extends the attorney-client privilege in most cases \nto accountants and to others authorized to practice before the IRS. \nAgain, I am not sure how good an idea this is. It will make it more \ndifficult for major accounting firms to sign off as to the financial \nstatements of a company they are auditing. They may feel compromised \nbecause of this new provision. I hope this works. It may not. If not, \nwe will have to come back and revisit it as well.\n  Finally, the bill before the Senate takes a first step toward \naddressing what may be the biggest contributor to taxpayer problems \nwith our Tax Code; namely, all of us, Congress itself.\n  Witness after witness at our hearings complained about the complexity \nof the code. This bill requires that every tax bill in the future be \naccompanied by an analysis of whether it will further complicate the \ncode, how hard it will be for taxpayers to comply with new laws. As we \nstrive to achieve fairness in our code, we sacrifice simplicity. With \nthis bill, we will theoretically be able to more clearly understand the \nextent of that sacrifice. I hope this works.\n  We need to address the complexity of the code. I am not certain this \nwill work as well as it is cracked up to. This will only work if the \nCongress focuses with utmost intensity on this part of the change and \nfocuses on how proposed change adds to the complexity. I worry that \nthis will otherwise be window dressing, that the Service and the \nadministration, Treasury, IRS, Congress, might gloss over this \nprovision. It sounds good right now, but we will not follow up, do the \nhard work and heavy lifting, when the new provision is before us. It \nreally depends upon us. It is like the Pogo cartoon, ``I have met the \nenemy, and he is us.'' This will work, the anticomplexity provision, \nonly if we make it work. Time will tell.\n  This bill certainly clips the wings of IRS agents, but we all know \nthat clipping the Government's wings too closely presents its own \ndangers. The Service estimates that the so-called tax gap, which is the \nmeasure of how much legitimately owed tax is not being collected, is \nnow almost $200 billion a year. This amounts to more than $1,600 per \nyear for every tax return filed by the rest of us--$1,600 per return, \nfiled by the rest of us, is not being collected. Addressing this \nproblem, unfortunately, is not in this bill. That has been left to \nanother day.\n  I truly hope we have not done anything in this bill which will \nexacerbate\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nthe problem further, because this bill may be sending a message to some \nAmerican, ``Hey, the IRS' wings are getting clipped; I can get away \nwith more; I don't have to report everything so much.'' That is not the \nmessage of this bill. The message of this bill is, the Service will \ntreat individual taxpayers more like people and provide a service that \nit should be providing; that is, remembering that people are actually \nthe employers in this outfit and the IRS is the employee.\n  We have a second problem not addressed in this bill, and that is the \ntax gap. I hope that is addressed in the not too distant future because \nit is a problem that is mounting with each passing day. Partly it is \ncaused by the complexity in the code.\n  I am also concerned about how we pay for the lost revenues in this \nbill. I don't think it is the best result we could come up with. And I \nhave further concern that the bill's provision may result in extended \nlitigation, further slowing down our court system, because these are \nnew provisions; they have to be interpreted. Lawyers are going to try \nto put one spin on it; another lawyer, another spin. A lot of the \nproblems may end up in the courts.\n  I firmly believe we must not let another tax session go by without at \nleast the taxpayer protections in this bill. I am pleased to support \nthe conference report. I am pleased I can go back to my constituents, \nincluding the young lady who wrote that letter, to say: We have tried \nto fix your problem, we have gone a long way toward fixing your \nproblem; it is not perfect, but it goes a long, long way.\n  In the end, Mr. President, the effectiveness of these provisions \ndepends very much on the degree to which the White House, the \nadministration, the Treasury, and the Congress continue to oversee the \nIRS, continue to have hearings into the IRS' operations, praising them \nwhen they are doing a good job, criticizing them when they are doing a \nbad job.\n  We are here today, passing this legislation, in many respects because \nboth the administration and the Congress for way too many years have \nlet the IRS drift.\n  There has been virtually no oversight. Treasury hasn't paid much \nattention to the IRS. Congress hasn't paid much attention to the IRS. \nAs a consequence, they have kind of gone off in a direction that has \nnot been as praiseworthy as we would like. So it is up to us, the \npeople's representatives, to continue vigorous, aggressive oversight, \nif these provisions enacted today turn out to be as good as we all say \nthey are and hope them to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there are two people I would like to \nmention before I make my remarks. I commend the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, for improving this bill as it has made its way \nthrough the legislative process. Too often, I see bills deteriorate as \nthey are worked on by various subcommittees, committees, and on floors \nof the Houses of Congress. They sometimes deteriorate in the process to \na lesser bill than we originally sought. This piece of legislation \nstarted out as a product of the National Commission on the \nRestructuring of the IRS and, for the most part, the recommendations of \nthe commission were not changed as it went through the legislative \nprocess. But there were considerable additions made to this \nlegislation. Senator Roth needs to be complimented for making this a \nbetter bill as it is now in this conference report. Each step of the \nway it was improved, which is the result of the hearings that he had \nlast fall and in the spring of this year.\n  The second person that I compliment is not part of the legislative \nprocess, but is the new Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, \nMr. Charles O. Rossotti. He was appointed by the President last fall \nand confirmed and has been on the job now 8 or 9 months. I compliment \nhim because he has not waited for Congress to act before making much-\nneeded changes in the administration of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  What I sought when I wrote to President Clinton in December of 1996 \nwas to urge that the President appoint a nonlawyer to be IRS \nCommissioner--the first time that that has been done in four decades. I \nrecommended that it be somebody from the private sector, a nonlawyer, \nwho would know how to run an organization. This person would know how \nto make the IRS should be: oriented toward serving the taxpayers. I \ndidn't know that the President would take my suggestion so seriously. \nBut he did. He appointed Mr. Rossotti.\n  Mr. Rossotti comes from a very successful career in the private \nsector, having formed a corporation of his own, from a few employees to \nthousands of employees. He left that environment--a very successful \nbusiness--to serve the people of this country as IRS Commissioner. \nBeing successful, as he was, would not have happened if he had not \ntried to serve his customer. So having that attitude come into the IRS \nwill result in a breath of fresh air. It should make the IRS oriented \ntoward consumer satisfaction. I have hope that he his insight will help \nthe IRS respect the taxpayer, and as a result, it will make the \ncollection of taxes much more efficient as well.\n  Mr. Rossotti has not waited for Congress to act until he started to \ninstitute a lot of reforms. I say that he, from day one, started to \ncarry out the spirit of the commission's recommendations before they \nwere ever enacted into law. He needs to be complimented for doing that.\n  On the first day that the Restructuring Commission met in the fall of \n1996, various commission members were asked to tell what they thought \nwe ought to try to accomplish through the coming year's work. When they \ngot to me as one of the four congressional members of the commission, I \nsaid that I wanted to make sure that the IRS becomes more consumer \nfriendly. If it became more consumer friendly, the taxpayer would \nhonestly enjoy working with the Internal Revenue Service. I hope that \nis what this legislation does. Obviously, we won't know for several \nyears if that sort of reform has been brought about, but that was my \ngoal in the fall of 1996, and I think the commission's recommendations \ntended to go in that direction.\n\n  As I have complimented Chairman Roth, I think the bill has even gone \nbeyond our committee recommendations in that direction--ultimately, to \neliminate the culture of intimidation within the IRS and to make sure \nthat the IRS sets a standard for the taxpayers of this country. This \nbill will make the IRS deliver accurate information in a timely fashion \nand in a courteous way. In other words, this bill should make the IRS \ntreat the taxpayer exactly as the IRS expects the taxpayer to treat it. \nThe IRS expect prompt and accurate filing on April 15.\n  So today is a very proud day for me. It is a proud day for the U.S. \nSenate. Maybe it brings a little common sense to Washington nonsense as \nwell. Today, we declare a victory--a victory for the American taxpayer \nand for Congress. We have done something very good in this legislation. \nThis is Government serving the people at its finest. It is for causes \nsuch as this that I am in public service.\n  Let me explain why we did what this conference report does. I want to \ngive you an example to explain why we found it necessary to pass a bill \nthat comprehensively restructures and reforms the Internal Revenue \nService. One Christmas Day, maybe 5 or 6 years ago, as I sat around the \nChristmas tree opening presents with my family, the telephone rang. On \nsuch a glorious day of good cheer and hope, I answered my telephone in \nhigh spirits. The woman at the other end of the line, a constituent of \nmine, was in tears. Her husband was critically ill and the IRS was \ncoming after them for everything that they owned. I don't mean that \nthey were coming after them on Christmas Day, but it was Christmas Day \nthat this taxpayer of mine was bothered by this thought of dealing with \nthe IRS.\n  The taxpayer of mine owned very little, but the IRS was after it. She \nhad no idea what to do. She had nowhere else to turn. So on Christmas \nDay, that day of hope to us, she picked up the telephone and called me. \nI have my name listed in the telephone book, so I am easy to get ahold \nof. She called someone she had never met, someone she only knew by \nreputation. This woman was at the end of her rope and she had nowhere \nelse to turn. She didn't understand what was happening to her. She only \nknew that the IRS was\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nharassing her to pay the debt that she didn't know they had, and it was \nnot willing to work with her on that debt.\n  Let's think back to the hearings the Senate Finance Committee held in \nthe last year. We heard from victims of the IRS, about harassment and \nabout abuse. We heard from IRS employees about the culture of \nintimidation at the IRS, which results in taxpayer abuse and keeps good \nemployees from climbing the career ladder. These hearings touched a \nnerve with the American public, and they did so for a very good reason. \nWe all saw ourselves in those stories--either in the victim, or we knew \nthat it could have been us.\n  There are critics of this legislation. To the critics I say this: We \nhave different friends; we talk to different people. I am convinced \nthat the critics have never spoken to a taxpayer facing the loss of his \nhome, wondering where his family will sleep that night. They have never \nspoken with a woman who had IRS agents screaming and threatening her in \nfront of her family. They have never spoken with the average taxpayer \nwho works hard to make ends meet, pays his taxes on time and doesn't \nwant to spend his kids' college fund on attorneys to fight the IRS. \nThese are the people to whom I talk. These happen to be my \nconstituents. These are the people who send me to represent them. This \nbill is for those constituents of mine.\n  It is for the average American taxpayer, who is neither an accountant \nnor a lawyer. It is for the average American taxpayer who is not sure \nhow to navigate the system, but who wants to stand up for himself in \ntrue American fashion. It is for the IRS employee who wants integrity \nin his workplace and reward for a job well done.\n  This legislation is not a rash effort. It was not hatched overnight. \nRather, it is the product of years of study and work. Senator Kerrey \nand I were honored to serve on the National Commission on Restructuring \nthe Internal Revenue Service. In June, 1997 this commission released an \n80-page report of recommendations to radically restructure the IRS. \nThese recommendations were turned into legislation, which Senator \nKerrey and I introduced in the Senate, and Congressman Portman \nintroduced in the House.\n  There are many people who worked on the effort you see before you \ntoday. I have already complimented Senator Roth, the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for holding two series of important oversight \nhearings. These gave us further insight into the IRS and gave this \nlegislation the momentum it needed. He also has shown great leadership \nin strengthening the House-passed bill, and navigating it through the \nconference committee.\n  Senator D'Amato and Senator Graham should be thanked for their \nleadership to provide relief for innocent spouses. Senator Mack should \nbe thanked for his leadership in creating confidentiality between an \naccountant and his client. And, of course, my friends Senator Kerrey \nand Congressman Portman must be recognized for their untiring work, for \nendless hours on endless days, on the Restructuring Commission and this \nlegislation.\n  Let's talk about what this bill does. First, it provides oversight \nand it mandates accountability. It was Justice Louis Brandeis who said, \n``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the \nmost efficient policeman.'' This legislation provides sunlight and \nelectric light throughout the IRS.\n  First, this bill creates a new Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration within the Treasury Department. This new IG will be \ndedicated solely to oversight of the IRS. He or she will have all of \nthe powers and responsibilities given by the Inspector General statute. \nThis office will also assume most of the responsibilities now performed \nby the IRS' Inspection Service. This change moves the oversight \nfunction out of the IRS and into the Treasury Department where it can \nbe more impartial and effective.\n  This bill also requires that this Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration randomly audit IRS denials of public information \nrequests. I have found, and have heard from others, that the IRS \nsometimes hides improprieties by claiming the information is protected \nfor taxpayer confidentiality or law enforcement reasons. However, upon \nfurther investigation, it has been discovered that the redacted \ninformation has nothing to do with either taxpayer confidentiality or \nlaw enforcement. It simply admits IRS error and admits IRS error, and \nit gives them an opportunity to hide from public scrutiny. Claiming \ntaxpayer confidentiality or law enforcement as a reason to redact or \nfail to release information lets the IRS avoid oversight by Congress, \nthe press and the public.\n  To help guide this agency and keep it on track, this legislation also \ncreates an Oversight Board. This Board should be comprised mainly of \nmanagement experts, who will guide the IRS and keep it honest and well \nadministered.\n  In addition, this bill makes it easier to hold IRS agents accountable \nfor their actions--both good and bad. The bill makes it easier to fire \nbad IRS employees, and easier to reward outstanding IRS employees. It \nalso makes it easier to sue the IRS for the actions of its agents. It \nexpands the cause of action in civil court to permit up to $100,000 in \ncivil damages or harm caused by an officer or employee of the IRS who \nnegligently disregards the rules of that agency.\n  Another major achievement of this bill is that it increases taxpayer \nrights. As an author of the first two Taxpayer Bills of Rights, I am \nparticularly qualified to testify to the importance of this section of \nthe bill--the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, as we refer to it. This bill \nwill help even the playing field even more between the taxpayer--\nparticularly the average taxpayer who can't afford to spend a lot of \nmoney for counsel--and the IRS. It will help taxpayers to understand \nthe process. It will help put customer service back into the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n\n  Specifically, this legislation shifts the burden of proof from the \ntaxpayer to the IRS is many tax disputes. This bill also gives relief \nto innocent spouses. Innocent spouses are people who didn't take part \nin the tax shelter or tax planning that results in a tax assessment. \nTheir marriage has broken down and they are left with little except the \nIRS pounding on their door--the door of the innocent spouse. It is \nimportant that we collect tax when it is due, but also that we don't \ncollect money from people who are not at fault and who don't owe it.\n  Another important step--this bill increases the independence of the \nTaxpayer Advocate. The taxpayer advocate is renamed the National \nTaxpayer Advocate and the local problem resolution officers will become \nlocal taxpayer advocates. The local taxpayer advocates will report to \nthe National Taxpayer Advocate rather than to the district director to \navoid the intimidation that comes from such relationship with district \ndirectors.\n\n  This bill also gives the taxpayer relief from interest and penalties \nin some situations. For example, this bill suspends penalties while an \ninstallment agreement is in effect. It suspends the statute of \nlimitations to file for a refund during times of disability. It gives \ntaxpayers more due process rights before the IRS can levy or seize \nproperty, and makes it easier to contest the placement of a lien. And \nthe IRS can't seize a principle place of residence or a small business \nuntil it has exhausted all other payment options.\n  In addition, this legislation makes important strides towards \nempowering taxpayers. I sincerely believe that educating the taxpayer \nis half of the battle. Americans are generally strong, self-reliant \npeople. Letting them know their rights and responsibilities gives them \nthe ammunition to stand up for themselves. For example, this bill \nrequires the IRS to make extra effort to alert taxpayers to the joint \nand several liability incurred just by signing an income tax form. It \nrequires the IRS to rewrite Publication 1, which is called ``Your \nRights as a Taxpayer'' to more clearly inform taxpayers of their rights \nto be represented at interviews with the IRS, and if the taxpayer is \nrepresented, that the interview cannot proceed without the presence of \nthe taxpayer's representative unless the taxpayer consents. The IRS \nalso must include with the first letter of deficiency a description of \nthe entire process from examination through collection, including the \nassistance available to taxpayers from the taxpayer advocate at various \npoints in the process. And now any taxpayer in an installment agreement \nwill receive an annual statement of the initial balance owed,\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\nthe payments made during the year, and the remaining balance.\n  This bill also provides greater taxpayer protection during the audit \nprocess. It extends the attorney-client confidentiality privilege to \nsome communications between an accountant and a client. This bill makes \nit impossible for the IRS and the taxpayer to agree to extend the \nstatute of limitations on collection actions beyond 10 years unless \nthere is an installment agreement in place. Then the statute of \nlimitations can only be extended until the end of the installment \nagreement, plus 90 days.\n  Further, the IRS must always inform the taxpayer of his or her right \nto refuse to extend the statute of limitation and to limit an extension \nto specific issues.\n  These are just some important aspects of this legislation. I think it \nis landmark legislation, at least landmark for the last 45 years. I am \nproud to be a part of this effort. This legislation reflects hard work \nby so many of us. This effort will be rewarded by the sunlight that \nwill shine into the IRS, giving it the oversight that it needs and the \naccountability that the taxpayer deserves.\n  This is a great day. It will be a greater day if down the road a few \nyears I come to the conclusion that this legislation has effectively \neliminated the culture of intimidation within the IRS. Today this bill \nsets a standard for the IRS to treat the taxpayer the way they expect \nthe taxpayer to treat the IRS. In other words, this bill helps the \ntaxpayer get timely information, accurate information, and courteous \nservice--because that is what the IRS expects of the taxpayer on April \n15 each year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  I am pleased that we are finally completing action on one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation this body will act upon, and that is \nthe IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. This bill represents that \nfirst step toward restoring the confidence the American people have to \nhave in our voluntary system of tax compliance.\n  Since its creation in 1862, the Internal Revenue Service has grown to \nbecome one of the largest Federal agencies, employing some 100,000 \nworkers. In addition, it is an agency with massive responsibilities. In \njust 1997 alone, the IRS collected approximately $1.5 trillion and \nprocessed some 200 million tax returns. The revenues collected by the \nIRS are sufficient to fund the necessary activities of our Government. \nIn concept, it is one of the most civilized tax systems in the world.\n  But it is no secret that taxpayers have lost confidence in our tax \nsystem. The public has lost patience with abuses that for years have \nbeen all too common within the IRS. In the interest of fixing this \nsystem, Congress created the National Commission on Restructuring the \nIRS almost 2 years ago. This important commission, which was made up of \nsome 17 members and professional staff, examined the IRS for a year and \ndeveloped a comprehensive report on changes that were needed to \noverhaul it. The work of this commission required hundreds of hours of \nprivate sessions with both the public and private sector experts, \nacademics, and citizen groups to review IRS operations and services. \nThe commission met privately with over 500 individuals, including \nsenior level and frontline IRS employees across the country.\n  The work of this commission, which provided many of the \nrecommendations included in this legislation, was invaluable in getting \nus to where we are today. I applaud my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, and in particular Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, for the \nleadership they provided as members of the national commission. I also \nthank our chairman, Senator Roth, and ranking member Moynihan for \ntaking the next step and holding extensive hearings on this most \nimportant topic. Certainly without the hard work of these gentlemen we \nwould not be here today.\n  The lack of confidence felt by the American people was made all too \nobvious during the many hearings that were held by the Finance \nCommittee over the last 9 months. We heard from taxpayers, attorneys, \naccountants, and IRS employees who discussed their personal experiences \nwith the complexities and frustrations of the IRS. I was outraged--I \nthink we all were outraged--by the stories of armed raids on innocent \ntaxpayers' property, unauthorized and unnecessary audits of working-\nclass families, and excessive fees and penalties charged to taxpayers \nwho were trying to pay their tax bills in a timely and responsible \nmanner, and all sorts of other outrages.\n  The tales that were told at these hearings were appalling, but they \nwere nothing new to thousands of taxpayers who themselves have had to \nexperience it or know someone who has.\n  At one time in my legal career, back when I was an assistant U.S. \nattorney, I represented the Internal Revenue Service in its dealings \nwith taxpayers. It was back then, frankly, I learned in dealing with \nthe Internal Revenue Service the devil is in the details. I learned \nfirsthand you have to focus on details when it comes to any issue when \ndealing with a bureaucracy as large as the IRS. And that is why I am so \nproud of playing a role in this legislative response.\n\n  I believe the details of this legislation will make a difference, a \nreal difference. This bill attacks a big problem in sensible ways, and \nit brings much-needed change to the operation of the internal revenue \nsystem. It does it in ways that are fair, reasonable, and equitable for \nall taxpayers. It increases the protections and rights of American \ncitizens in regard to the Service and the system.\n  I am pleased that one particular amendment I promoted was included in \nthe bill. This provision will expand the ability of the taxpayer to \nrecover their costs when involved in defending themselves before the \nIRS and the taxpayer wins. I think this provision is essential to \nensuring that taxpayers are not forced to pay for IRS' mistakes.\n  There are other changes that I especially like. As the only woman on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I was particularly pleased that this \nlegislation includes some relief for innocent spouses. All too often \nwomen are stuck holding the bills of their ex-husbands, only then \nfinding out that their ex-spouse had not legally filed a tax return.\n  I was contacted by one of my constituents from Illinois who had been \ntold by the IRS that she could lose her new home, be prosecuted for \nincome tax evasion, and have her wages garnished if she refused to pay \na tax bill that was owed by her ex-husband due to a fraudulent tax \nreturn he had filed during their tumultuous marriage, even though she \nhad, in fact, signed it.\n  When she explained to the IRS that she had never been employed during \nthe course of the marriage and could put them in touch with her ex-\nhusband regarding that, the agent told her, ``What do we need him for? \nWe've got you.''\n  Well, this legislation will make certain that those kinds of abuses \nagainst innocent spouses will no longer occur. This bill ensures that \ncases such as this never happen again, hopefully, and that the IRS will \nbe encouraged to pursue both spouses and do the work that is needed to \nfind out who owes what.\n  It provides greater protection for women by giving them notice of \ntheir rights and their obligations up front before signing on to a \njoint tax return.\n  The other list of positive changes that this bill makes to the \ncurrent operation of the IRS, as well as the list of additional \ntaxpayer rights, is quite extensive. This bill will allow taxpayers to \nenjoy a greater ability to sue the Internal Revenue Service when the \nIRS blatantly and intentionally disregards the law. It has a provision \nthat will give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to provide up to \n$3 million annually in matching grants to assist low-income taxpayer \nclinics. There is a provision that will eliminate the penalty for \nfailure to pay taxes when a taxpayer is paying those taxes under an \ninstallment agreement, which has been a huge problem. People find \nthemselves with more penalties than they had to pay in underlying \ntaxes.\n  For those taxpayers who undergo an audit, the bill includes \nprocedures to ensure that due process is afforded to them. Also, with \nregard to seizures, before property is seized, there must be a process \nso that any lien, levy, or seizure will be approved by a supervisor.\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\n  Taxpayers will also be given greater access to installment payment \nagreements with the IRS, greater access to information about the \nappeals and collections process, and greater access to statements \nregarding payments and balance owed in installment agreements.\n  There is one other provision, Mr. President, that I am especially \nhappy to see in the bill, and that is the provision that extends the \nconfidentiality privilege to accountants in civil matters before the \nInternal Revenue Service. This provision, which some 78 percent of the \nAmerican taxpayers support, will give all taxpayers equal \nconfidentiality protections for their discussion, not just with their \nlawyers but also the federally authorized tax advisers. Low-income \ntaxpayers who often cannot afford attorneys will, therefore, be \nprovided the same privileges and benefits that other taxpayers have.\n  All of these changes are needed to amend the current operation of the \nIRS. The bill provides us with the historic opportunity to overhaul the \nInternal Revenue Service and transform it into an efficient, modern, \nand responsive agency. The IRS interacts with more citizens than any \nother Government agency or private sector business in America, and it \ncollects 95 percent of the revenue needed to fund our Government. The \nbill we have before us is a thorough bill and makes vital changes to \nevery aspect of the Internal Revenue Service's structure.\n  Mr. President, it is a sad reflection of the reality of our lack of \nconfidence that, much like this cartoon, many Americans do not believe \nthat this bill will cure what ails the system. I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer can see it. The IRS is here as Dracula in the coffin with a \nstake through his heart, asking his gnome, ``You took names?'' ``Of \ncourse''--while the Senate celebrates. A lot of people think while we \ntake the action we will take here, it is not going to really cure what \nails the IRS --that after the Congress has had its say, they fear the \nIRS will go back to the bad old ways that undermined its reputation in \nthe first place.\n  To that issue, I want to suggest to anyone listening that the answer \nlies, I think, in both cooperation and vigilance. We all need to work \ntogether to do our part to make sure that the accountability of the IRS \nremains assured. The Service has started to reform itself, and we have \nhigh hopes that the new Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, will actually be \nable to implement the management changes directed toward putting the \n``service'' back into the Internal Revenue Service, back into the IRS.\n  IRS employees, some of whom bravely stepped forward during the \nhearings to lament the state of affairs in the agency, can and must \nhelp with the healing and reconciliation of the Service with the \nAmerican people. The Congress today is beginning to do its part. Much \nmore needs to be done, to be sure. But because Congress, after all, is \nnot blameless in creating the confusion and the complications that \nprovided cover for excess and abuse, we need to take up tax \nsimplification with the same purpose as we have taken up tax \nadministration.\n  I am hopeful that the Finance Committee as a whole--or, if necessary, \nas a commission modeled on the Kerrey-Grassley commission--will take up \ntax simplification so the average citizen or small business will be \nable voluntarily to comply with our tax laws without incurring the huge \ntransaction costs just to pay people to interpret the law for them. Tax \nsimplification will also go a long way toward restoring confidence in \nour system of voluntary tax compliance.\n  In the final analysis, however, it will be the American people who do \nthe most to keep the IRS on the right track. Abraham Lincoln once said, \n``In this country, public opinion is all.'' He is right. The people got \nfed up with the abuse, and the Congress was moved to action. In this \nRepublic, in this democracy, the Government is, after all, all of us. \nAnd so the passage of this bill will really be a reflection of public \nopinion operating in classic fashion in this country. It is, therefore, \na victory that every citizen can and should celebrate. But keeping this \nvictory will require our eternal vigilance.\n  Again, I commend the chairman of the committee for the brilliant \nhearings that gave rise to this legislation and for the purposefulness \nwith which he has moved this bill to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of the conference \nreport to the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. Passage of this \nlegislation marks a monumental step in making the Internal Revenue \nService more responsible to ``We, the people,'' the American taxpayers.\n  As the hearings before the Senate Finance Committee demonstrated, the \nIRS has all too often in recent years taken an adversarial posture \nagainst taxpayers. We in the Senate heard reports about IRS employees \nwho were promoted based on the number of liens and collection actions \nagainst taxpayers. We heard stories about the IRS targeting low-income \nindividuals and small businesses for audits, since they often did not \nhave the resources to fight the IRS and are therefore forced to settle. \nWe were told about audits and investigations based purely on political \nmotives. We were informed of times the IRS had destroyed businesses, \nwhere they had wreaked havoc on private citizens' personal lives and \nseized assets based on accounting mistakes and clerical errors by the \nIRS itself. It is time these activities came to an end. This IRS reform \nbill will make the institution more service oriented and accountable to \n``We, the people.''\n  Through the newly created oversight board, the Service will receive \nthe direction and effective strategic planning it desperately needs. By \nshifting the burden of proof in factual tax disputes from the taxpayer \nto the IRS, this bill gives American taxpayers important procedural \nprotections that even criminal defendants have enjoyed in this country \nfor over 200 years. ``We, the people,'' will have due process before \nconfiscation of personal property. The taxpayer will know the charges \nand have the right of appeal.\n\n  By expanding the confidential communications to cover accountants and \nenrolled agents as well as attorneys, this reform bill gives taxpayers \ngreater freedom to seek tax advice from the tax adviser of their own \nchoosing.\n  In requiring the IRS to collect allegations and document cases of \nemployee misconduct and report this misconduct to Congress every year, \nthe IRS reform bill requires the IRS to investigate itself and answer \nto Congress for any misconduct of IRS employees.\n  This reform bill even simplifies the Tax Code by reducing the holding \nperiod for optimal capital gains treatment from 18 months to the \nstandard 12 months.\n  While the IRS reform bill does not provide all the solutions to our \ncountry's tax problems, it marks a significant chapter in bringing \ngreater accountability to our Federal tax collection agency and greater \nrespect for hard-working American taxpayers. The IRS reform bill moves \nus in the right direction, toward a system that is simpler and more \nfair for all Americans.\n  Yes, ``We, the people,'' have won a big one here. I congratulate \nChairman Roth and the Finance Committee. I also congratulate all the \nfolks who shared--even though they were living in fear of their own \nGovernment. I am glad we were able to take these steps and look forward \nto the results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to the IRS \nconference report. But before I do, one issue has just come to my \nattention that I want to mention. I have been told the IRS is \nchallenging the charitable contribution status of funds used to \npurchase a special stamp, a stamp that I sponsored along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Feinstein and Senator D'Amato, to fund breast \ncancer research. The IRS has now come along and challenged whether that \ncontribution is going to be deductible or not.\n  I can tell them it will be. I hope the IRS does not fight the \nCongress and the American people in their effort to fight breast \ncancer. It is a worthwhile charitable cause, and it should not even be \nquestioned. But I want to say to the IRS, if they continue to fight the \nbreast cancer initiative, I will offer a legislative rider to the \nTreasury appropriations bill that will clarify and override their \nobjections.\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\n  Turning to the bill before us, if ever there was an agency of the \nFederal Government that needed overhaul, it is the Internal Revenue \nService. For years the American people have been telling the Congress \nthat IRS was out of control, punishing taxpayers with crushing \npenalties and interest, and a nightmare of rules and regulations that \nno one understood, and that included the IRS. I held a hearing on IRS \nabuse in Raleigh, NC, last December. The stories I heard were \nabsolutely heartrending. If we had not known they were true, we could \nnot have believed them.\n  I introduced legislation to create a private citizens oversight board \nthat would rein in the IRS. I propose giving the oversight board \nauthority to cut through that impenetrable cloak of secrecy this agency \nhas been showing the public for years. I want the board to have access \nto Internal Revenue working documents. I am pleased to see that much of \nwhat had been proposed has been put into this conference report. \nChairman Roth deserves tremendous credit for putting this bill \ntogether.\n  The IRS reform bill will create a new oversight board of private \ncitizens.\n  The board will have authority to review the policies and practices of \nthe IRS. It will have access to documents which were previously \nshielded from the public and the Congress.\n  This new board will help root out the abuses that were highlighted in \nthe hearings that I held and the equally shocking hearings that the \nFinance Committee held. I don't think any of us were aware of what \nreally was going on within the IRS and its relationship with the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The bill will provide protection from excessive penalties and \ninterest and protect the spouse from tax cheats.\n  This is not the end but the beginning of fundamental reform of the \nIRS--reform and a change of attitude.\n  Make no mistake, many in the Internal Revenue Service will not be \nhappy with this bill, and they will either want to foot drag the \nchanges or alter them. But let me say that one great thing has happened \nto the IRS, and that is the new Commissioner, Mr. Charles Rossotti. He \nis going to bring a breath of fresh air to a very stale-air \norganization. He has experience in the private sector, and he is taking \nthis job at great personal sacrifice. He has spent a major part of his \ncareer in data processing and in the type of electronic data processing \nand handling that the IRS needs, but in which they are so woefully \ninadequate. In fact, they spent $3 billion for new equipment and found \nthat it did not work after they had spent the money.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee which overseas the IRS \nbudget, I intend to watch the IRS, and I will be there closely watching \nto see if they follow the reforms that this bill mandates. In \nparticular, I am going to watch the IRS union representative who was \nmade a member of the oversight board, despite my objections, as well as \nthe objections of Senator Roth and others. My message to the unions and \nto the union representative and the rest of the IRS personnel and \nbureaucracy is this: Do not oppose IRS reform, but accept and take it \nand get going with making it the law of the land. The Congress and the \nAmerican people have spoken, and this agency is going to be cleaned up \nwith or without your acquiescence. If you try to undermine these \nreforms, there will be more legislation and stricter legislation in \nfuture sessions of the Congress.\n  In summary, let me say to the IRS personnel and its representatives \nand the entire IRS bureaucracy that Congress is very closely observing \nthe actions and will be observing the actions of the IRS in how it \ndeals with the American people. Do not oppose us, support us, and we \nwill have a great revenue collection service. Do not go back to the old \nways, but move into the new law and do it with enthusiasm.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues a couple of \nissues that relate to this IRS conference report that is before us.\n  First of all, my colleague from North Carolina was conveying a \nmessage to labor. He was talking about the fact that he was going to be \nvery vigilant and he was going to be watching closely what happens with \nthe oversight board. I think we should be vigilant and pay attention to \nwhat happened in this conference committee.\n  I bring a couple of matters to the attention of my colleagues. I, \nfirst of all, will start out talking about veterans. I know that my \ncolleague from West Virginia, who has been such a powerful advocate for \nveterans, will also speak about this, and I understand my colleague \nfrom Washington will be on the floor later taking action, and I will be \npleased to join her.\n  Let me go through this very briefly. As the highway bill--called the \nISTEA or TEA-21 bill--moved to the House, and Members of the House \nwanted to add on more projects, the question was how to fund it. The \nway it was funded was to take an estimate from the Office of Management \nand Budget having to do with whether or not there would be compensation \nto veterans for illnesses caused by their addiction to tobacco. \nCigarettes were handed out like candy to veterans when they were in the \nservice.\n  The decision was made that veterans should not receive this \ncompensation. OMB said this would lead to a savings of about $17 \nbillion. I think CBO said more like $10 billion, but conferees used the \n$17 billion. That money, I say to my colleagues, if not going to direct \ncompensation for veterans, at the very least should go to veterans' \nhealth care.\n  I cannot even tell you how many calls we get in our Minnesota office \nfrom veterans. It is really shocking the number of veterans who fall \nbetween the cracks. We have an aging veterans population. We don't know \nwhat to do as more veterans reach the age of 85 or how they will be \ntaken care of in the veterans' health care system. We have Vietnam vets \nsuffering with PTSD who drop in our office who still need a lot of \nhelp. A third of the homeless people in this country are veterans, many \nstruggling with substance abuse, who need help. We have a VA health \ncare system that has been put on a flat-line budget that won't work. We \nare talking about whether or not we are going to live up to our \ncommitment to veterans.\n  There was a technical corrections bill to this highway bill. Senator \nRockefeller and I intended to have an amendment knocking out this $17 \nbillion transfer of funds that should be going to veterans and instead \nwas put into the highway bill. That is correct, I say to my colleagues, \nthat is exactly what happened. I didn't vote for the bill for that \nreason.\n  The majority leader did not want to afford us the opportunity to have \nan up-or-down vote on our amendment on the technical corrections bill. \nSo he took the technical corrections bill and had the conferees put \nthis into the IRS conference report. Therefore, we can't amend it.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues that this was outside the \nscope of conference, as I see it. I think Senator Murray and others \nwill have more to say about this.\n  Certainly, in this IRS reform bill that passed the Senate and the \nHouse, we didn't do this, but in the conference report, things were \nloaded on, and one of them was essentially this technical corrections \nbill that did not give us the opportunity to knock out this transfer--\nOMB says $17 billion; I think that is too high. That $17 billion either \nshould have gone directly into compensation for veterans, vis-a-vis \ntheir tobacco addiction, or at the very least should have gone into \nveterans' health care.\n  Therefore, questions should be raised about this conference report \nthat is before us. I say to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, the VA-HUD appropriations bill, of course, has been pulled. But \nthe first opportunity I get, I will be back with an amendment to knock \nout this provision that took $17 billion, or thereabouts, that should \nhave gone to veterans and instead put it into highway projects. We will \ncome back to this, and we will have an up-or-down vote. First point.\n  Second point. Boy, I will tell you, conference committees! I say to \nmy colleague from Wyoming, I used to teach political science classes. I \nhave to tell you. You know, I feel guilty. I need to refund tuition to \nstudents for\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\nthose 2 weeks I taught classes on the Congress. I was so off in terms \nof a lot of the decisionmaking.\n\n  I should have focused on the conference committees as the third House \nof the Congress, because these folks can do any number of different \nthings. And the thing that drives me crazy is you can have a situation \nwhere the Senate did not have a provision in the bill, the House did \nnot have a provision in the bill, and the conference committee just \nputs it in the bill. Then it comes back for an up-or-down vote. No \nopportunity to amend.\n  Or you can have a situation where the Senate and the House pass bills \nwith a provision in them and the conference takes it out. It is, I \nthink, the least accountable part of decisionmaking in the Congress.\n  Now, we have a couple of provisions of this bill that I think are \nworth talking about. One of them is a provision that was a drafting \nerror. I would like to include in the Record a piece by David Rosenbaum \nof the New York Times of June 24: ``A Mistake Prevails, as Certainly as \nDeath and Taxes.'' I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          A Mistake Prevails, as Certainly as Death and Taxes\n\n                        (By David E. Rosenbaum)\n\n       Washington, June 23--The tax code is chock full of benefits \n     for the wealthy. Most of them were put in on purpose. But \n     last year, one got in accidentally.\n       Now a powerful Congressman has used his influence to keep \n     on the books this tax break for rich people that no one \n     intended to be in the law in the first place.\n       The only beneficiaries of the mistake are the heirs of a \n     few hundred people who die each year and leave estates worth \n     more than $17 million. Each of those estates will be saved \n     more than $200,000 in taxes. The Government will lose an \n     estimated $880 million in revenue over the next decade.\n       After the mistake was caught, the Treasury Department and \n     the Senate took steps to correct it before it could be taken \n     advantage of.\n       But Representative Bill Archer, the chairman of the House \n     Ways and Means Committee, blocked them. At his insistence, a \n     House-Senate conference committee decided last week to keep \n     the tax break in the law. Mr. Archer says he prevented the \n     correction to express his fervent opposition to inheritance \n     taxes, which he calls ``death taxes.'' Mr. Archer, a \n     Republican, represents a district in Houston that is one of \n     the wealthiest in the country and presumably one of the \n     likeliest to have someone die and leave an estate worth more \n     than $17 million.\n       This all started when someone on Congress' technical staff \n     made a mistake in the drafting of the mammoth balanced budget \n     and tax cut law that Congress approved and President Clinton \n     signed last summer.\n       Such mistakes are common in big, complicated tax bills. \n     Several years ago, for instance, a measure dealing with tax \n     write-offs for race horses referred to ``houses'' instead of \n     ``horses.'' Normally the errors are repaired in what is known \n     as the technical-corrections section of the next tax bill to \n     go through Congress.\n       The 1997 tax law increased the amount in estates that is \n     exempt from Federal taxation. Under the old law, the first \n     $600,000 of an estate's value went untaxed. The new law \n     raised the excluded amount to $625,000 in 1998, to $650,000 \n     in 1999 and, in continued increments, to $1 million in 2006.\n       The exclusion is particularly important to heirs because \n     the estate tax rate is high, beginning at 18 percent and \n     rising to 55 percent on the taxable amount over $3 million.\n       The old law required the value of the exclusion to be \n     gradually eliminated, a process called a phase-out, on \n     estates worth more than $17,184,000.\n       According to the Internal Revenue Service, about 300 tax \n     returns were filed on estates worth more than $20 million in \n     1995, the last year for which statistics are available. \n     Because stock prices on average have doubled since then, it \n     is safe to assume that more such estates will be taxed this \n     year. But the total number should not be more than several \n     hundred.\n       Everyone agrees that the lawmakers who voted to increase \n     the exclusion intended to retain the phase-out. But somehow \n     in the drafting, that did not happen.\n       The error was quickly caught. A private tax lawyer \n     apparently spotted it and called it to the attention of the \n     Congressional tax staff. The tax staff recommended that it be \n     corrected, and tax specialists at the Treasury Department \n     agreed.\n       It looked like one of the dozens of mistakes that would be \n     routinely repaired in this year's technical corrections bill \n     before anyone's taxes could be affected. Indeed, the Senate \n     included a correction in its version of the bill. But in the \n     House, Mr. Archer balked. And when the measure--a small part \n     of the legislation to overhaul the IRS--got to conference, he \n     refused to budge.\n       Since no one in the Senate felt as strongly about \n     correcting the mistake as Mr. Archer felt about about letting \n     it go uncorrected, the conferees agreed last week to leave \n     the tax break in the law.\n       Mr. Archer explained his position in a letter he wrote this \n     month to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, \n     an organization representing small businesses that opposes \n     estate taxes but did not specifically lobby on the provision \n     in question.\n       ``While some might argue that the proposed change is a mere \n     correction of a drafting error made last year, I view it as \n     an increase in Federal death tax rates,'' Mr. Archer wrote.\n       The letter added: ``I believe we should reduce or eliminate \n     the unfair death tax. Accordingly, I cannot support any \n     change in law that would go in the opposite direction by \n     increasing death tax rates.''\n       Mr. Archer's spokesman, L. Ari Fleischer, said the \n     chairman's position well illustrated the importance in which \n     party controls Congress.\n       ``When the Democrats controlled Congress and drafting \n     errors worked against the taxpayers, the Democrats let them \n     stay in the law,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ``Now, when one works \n     against the Government and for the taxpayers, we're in no \n     rush to correct it.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Chairman Archer wanted to make sure that for those \nAmericans with estates worth more than $17 million, that we give them a \nspecial break. That is correct. Those Americans who are struggling with \nestates worth more than $17 million, they got, roughly speaking, an \nadditional $200,000 break by mistake in last year's budget bill. The \nSenate corrected that mistake, but the correction got taken out in this \nconference committee.\n  I hear my colleagues talk about IRS reform. How does that add up to \nreform? We have these Orwellian titles. We call everything ``reform.'' \nTo most people in the country, when they find out about it, they do not \nthink it is reform. We have paycheck protection that does not protect \nthe paycheck; we have the Family Friendly Workplace Act which isn't \nfriendly to the family; we have the TEAM Act which has nothing to do \nwith teamwork, so on and so forth. Now this is called reform, and we \ngive this break to folks with estates worth more than $17 million.\n  The second issue in the conference committee had to do with capital \ngains. I ask unanimous consent that a piece by Richard Stevenson of the \nNew York Times on June 24 called ``Break in Capital Gains Tax Is Added \nto I.R.S. Overhaul'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Break in Capital Gains Tax Is Added to I.R.S. Overhaul\n\n                       (By Richard W. Stevenson)\n\n       Washington, June 23--Congressional leaders agreed today on \n     a plan to give investors a break on capital gains taxes, \n     attaching the measure to an overhaul of the Internal Revenue \n     Service that appears headed toward speedy final passage.\n       The change, agreed to over several days of negotiations \n     among members of both parties, would reduce to 12 months from \n     18 months the period that investors must hold stocks, bonds \n     and other assets to qualify for the most favorable capital \n     gains tax rate. The change would be retroactive, effective \n     for all sales as of Jan. 1, 1998.\n       Although the 18-month holding period was created by last \n     year's tax law at the Clinton Administration's insistence in \n     an effort to reward long-term investment and discourage \n     speculation, Administration officials said tonight that they \n     expected the President to sign the new legislation after \n     final passage by both houses.\n       Republican leaders are trying to keep their tax-cutting \n     efforts in the limelight as they begin gearing up for the \n     Congressional elections this fall. So, now that they have won \n     agreement to reduce the holding period necessary for the most \n     favorable tax rate on capital gains, they plan to turn to \n     efforts to reduce the rate itself. Speaker Newt Gingrich will \n     propose on Wednesday that the top rate on capital gains be \n     reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent, adding the proposal to \n     an already lengthy tax-cutting wish list that Republicans \n     have yet to find the money to pay for.\n       The change to the capital gains holding period was one of a \n     number of issues settled today as House and Senate \n     negotiators reconciled the slightly differing versions of the \n     I.R.S. overhaul bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan \n     support by both chambers. Republican leaders said they \n     expected the final version of the bill to win passage in the \n     House this week and in the Senate next month.\n       The bill would set in motion the most sweeping overhaul of \n     the tax collection agency in four decades. It would create an \n     independent oversight board, provide taxpayers a range of new \n     legal protections in disputes with the I.R.S. and spur a \n     broad internal reorganization of the agency.\n       It was precisely the bill's broad bipartisan support, and \n     the likelihood that President Clinton would not dare veto it, \n     that emboldened Republicans to add the provision shortening \n     the capital gains holding period.\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n       The provision was proposed by Representative Bill Archer of \n     Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, \n     who early this year made the change a top legislative \n     priority. Mr. Archer said today that the measure would make \n     calculating capital gains taxes simpler for millions of \n     people who, as a result of the 1997 law, had to grapple this \n     year with a three-tier rate system that many taxpayers \n     complained was excessively complex.\n       But the change would also amount to a tax cut for people \n     who sold stocks or other assets after holding them between a \n     year and 18 months. Here is why:\n       Under last year's tax law, gains on investments held for 12 \n     months or less were taxed as ordinary income. Gains on \n     investments held from 12 to 18 months were also taxed as \n     ordinary income, although only to a maximum rate of 28 \n     percent. Gains on investments held more than 18 months were \n     taxed at a maximum rate of 20 percent, except for people in \n     the 15 percent income tax bracket, who faced a maximum \n     capital gains rate of 10 percent.\n       But if the agreement struck today becomes law, only gains \n     on investments held a year or less will be taxed as ordinary \n     income, while gains on investments held more than a year will \n     be subject to the 10 percent capital gains rate for people in \n     the 15 percent bracket and the 20 percent maximum capital \n     gains rate for everyone else.\n       The I.R.S. has not yet determined how many people paid the \n     intermediate rate--the rate on assets held between 12 and 18 \n     months--in calculating their taxes for 1997. For 1996, the \n     most recent year for which figures are available, 16.6 \n     million tax returns reported a capital gain.\n       Congressional aides said Mr. Archer's provision would cost \n     the Government about $2 billion over 10 years, by effectively \n     reducing the tax bill for people who sell investments after \n     holding them between 12 and 18 months.\n       Capital gains taxes have been debated by economists and \n     politicians for decades, and have been the source of bitter \n     political disputes between Democrats, who say cutting the \n     rates amounts to a giveaway to the rich, and Republicans, who \n     say that lower rates spur investment and help improve the \n     economy's long-term growth capacity.\n       In proposing a rate cut, Mr. Gingrich seems determined to \n     reopen that debate. Aides say he will argue that Congress has \n     more room to cut capital gains taxes than official revenue \n     estimates would suggest because Congress has consistently \n     underestimated how much revenue will flow into Government \n     coffers after a rate cut.\n       Many Republicans believe that capital gains are no longer \n     an issue only for the wealthy, given the wide-spread stock \n     holdings among the middle class. But Republicans have already \n     promised to push this year for a reduction in the so-called \n     marriage penalty, the anomaly in the tax code that yields a \n     higher tax bill for many two-income married couples than for \n     two single people with the same incomes. They are also \n     pressing for reductions in estate taxes.\n       But Mr. Clinton has signaled his opposition to any large-\n     scale tax cut this year. And Republicans are feuding among \n     themselves over how deeply they are willing to cut.\n       In all, the I.R.S. legislation will cost $13 billion over \n     10 years, mostly from revenue that the Government will not \n     collect because of the new rules protecting taxpayers from \n     aggressive collection action by the agency.\n       To help pay for the bill, House and Senate negotiators \n     agreed to a provision offered by Senator William V. Roth Jr. \n     of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \n     that will encourage some relatively wealthy elderly people to \n     shift savings from one form of individual retirement account \n     to another.\n       While the shift has long-term benefits to the individual, \n     it creates an immediate tax liability that will generate an \n     estimated $8 billion over 10 years. Democrats had strongly \n     opposed the provision, saying that by the second decade it \n     would start costing the Government billions of dollars a year \n     in lost revenue.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So now we have an addition, in the dark of night, \nwhere the conference committee sneaks in another indefensible tax cut \nto wealthy people. That was not the bill that passed out of the Senate. \nI do not think it was in the House version. But in the conference \ncommittee it was put in.\n  So, colleagues, I think there will be another effort on the floor, \nand I am pleased to join with my colleagues in doing this--with Senator \nDorgan and others--which will essentially say this is outside the scope \nof conference. It was not passed by either body and should not be in \nthere. We will have a ruling by the Chair, and maybe we will have an \nup-or-down vote.\n  But I just point out that while there are some very good things in \nthis piece of legislation--my colleague from Nebraska was one of the \nleaders in this effort with very, very good things that people around \nthe country appreciate. But then we go to the conference committee, and \nwe have a couple things that happen which are not democratic, with a \nsmall ``d,'' not accountable, not decisionmaking that I think makes a \nwhole lot of sense.\n  To the veterans, I say on the floor of the Senate: count on my \nsupport, working with Senator Rockefeller, working with Senator Murray, \nand working with others to, one way or another, try to knock out this \ntransfer of funding, however it is estimated, $17 billion or less, that \nshould be going to veterans in direct compensation or should be going \nto veterans' health care, as opposed to being put into the highway bill \nfor different projects.\n  And the second thing I want to bring to everyone's attention is cuts \nin capital gains for the wealthy, in the dark of night, added in the \nconference committee. And then finally the estate tax break--and I see \nmy colleague from Nebraska here--which was actually corrected in the \nSenate bill and then dropped in conference. So we had a correction \nwhich would not have given the break to these poor folks with estates \nworth $17 million and more. And it could have easily been put in the \nconference committee. That is what we did on the Senate side. But, no, \nit was dropped.\n  So, colleagues, we are going to, I think, have some debate and some \naction on the floor this afternoon on this. I will be pleased to join \nother colleagues on both of these questions. And before you start \ncalling this a reform bill, take a very close look at what was added to \nthis bill, or what was dropped from this bill, in the conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the remarks which he has \nmade.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, the agency we love to hate every April \n15. We write out those checks. It is our responsibility as citizens of \nthis country. But it hurts--all the money we send them. Then these \nhearings were held, and we found out that this agency, collecting \ntaxes, has been using heavy-handed tactics, sometimes with not the most \nbasic courtesy. We have a right to be upset, and because of that, \nCongress--the House and the Senate; Democrats and Republicans--and the \nPresident said, let us do something about it. And we set out to make \nsome rather significant changes in the way the Internal Revenue Service \ndoes business.\n  I am glad to see that happen. But I have to be a little bit wary of \nwhat the result might be. You see, in my home office in Springfield, \nIL, I received a phone call in the midst of this debate. And a \ngentleman said to one of my staffers, ``Thank goodness this Senate has \nfinally awakened to these thugs at the Internal Revenue Service. Their \nabusive conduct is just horrible. And now finally you're going to \nchange this system.'' And my staffer said, ``Have you had a personal \nexperience?'' ``Well, yes, I did,'' he said. ``And these people from \nthe Internal Revenue Service just hounded me and my family to no end.'' \nAnd he said, ``Thank goodness you're finally doing something about \nit.''\n  My staffer said, ``Was it a serious problem?'' ``Well,'' he said, \n``they made it out to be a serious problem.'' He said, ``I had a little \nproblem with reporting on my income tax.''\n  My staffer said, ``What was the problem?'' He said, ``Well, I failed \nto file my income tax return.'' My staffer said, ``You didn't file your \ntax return?'' He said, ``Well, that's right.'' And my staffer said, \n``Well, that can be serious.'' He said, ``Well, it was an oversight.'' \nMy staffer said, ``How many times have you failed to file a return?'' \nHe said, ``3 or 4 years,'' and added, ``You would think that was a \ncrime by the way these people act.'' Well, it is a crime.\n  I hope that those who are critical of the Internal Revenue Service \nunderstand that we still rely on them and give them an important \nresponsibility. The 99-plus percent of Americans who dutifully, \nwillfully, voluntarily file their income tax returns each year are \ncounting on the Internal Revenue Service making sure everybody else \ndoes, too. We are all part of the same American family. We all bear \nthis responsibility.\n  So as we talk about reforming this agency, let us not lose sight of \nthe bottom line. They have an important job to do to collect the money \nto provide for our national defense, education, highways, and so many \nother things on which we rely.\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\n  This bill went through a lot of different incarnations. I think the \nfinal bill, as it applies to the Internal Revenue Service, is a good \none because it makes some rather significant changes.\n  I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who \nwas just with me on the floor. They headed the IRS Restructuring \nCommission. And under their leadership, the IRS commission produced a \ncollection of very thoughtful recommendations, many of which are \nincluded in this conference report. Senators Roth and Moynihan have led \na real truly bipartisan effort to make the commission's recommendations \na reality.\n  I also commend the gentleman whose name was mentioned a moment ago, \nand that is the new IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti. His is not an \neasy job. He came from the private sector at great personal and \nfinancial sacrifice in the true spirit of public service to lead this \nimportant agency.\n  One of the first things that hit him between the eyes is the so-\ncalled Y2K problem, the computer problem that when we switch over in \nthe next century, will the computers get it right? Will they know we \nare going to the year 2000 and not the year 1900? It sounds so simple. \nWhen you look at all the computers in America and all the programs and \nlook at the Internal Revenue Service, you can understand that Mr. \nRossotti and most of the people at the IRS are consumed with the \nresponsibility of getting it right and making these computers \nunderstand we are headed to the 21st century and not to restart the \n20th century.\n  There are parts of this bill that, I think, are very positive. The \nrestructuring of the management and governance of the IRS so it \noperates more like the private sector--that certainly is a step in the \nright direction. The Commissioner asked for, and received, greater \nflexibility in managing his IRS workforce. We now make it easier for \ntaxpayers to file their returns electronically by extending the due \ndate for these returns from February 28 to March 31. The bill also \nrequires the Secretary to develop a procedure that will allow taxpayers \nto confirm their return without having to send in their signature.\n  We establish taxpayers' rights. As a practicing attorney before I was \nelected to the House of Representatives, I represented clients before \nthe Internal Revenue Service. That was no mean feat. It is one of the \nfew experiences in the law in America where you are guilty until proven \ninnocent, and we assembled the data necessary to prove our innocence \nand did our very best. I didn't understand the gravity of that \nchallenge until my own small business was audited in Springfield, IL, \nand then I went through it personally. I am glad to say we didn't have \ntax liability added to it as a result of the audit, but I learned first \nhand how daunting it is to challenge the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Our bill says the burden of proof will be on the IRS in disputes that \ncome up before the IRS Tax Court dealing with income, estate, and gift \ntaxes, provided the taxpayer is cooperating by providing access to \ninformation and documents related to the return. So that gives the \nindividual taxpayer, the business person, a little better chance of \nbeing treated fairly.\n  There was also a provision in the law which was brought out during \nthe course of the committee hearings which was very troubling. A lot of \ninnocent spouses who may have put their name on the tax return at the \nrequest of their husband or wife, not knowing the contents, found out \nin later years, even after a divorce, that if something was wrong in \nthat return, they, too, could have been held liable--in fact, \ncriminally liable in some instances. We have tried in this law to \ndefine ``innocent spouse'' in a way so that those who are truly \ninnocent do not bear that responsibility.\n  We ease interest and penalties. Currently, for example, if a taxpayer \nmakes an honest mistake--underline ``honest mistake''--it might be \nseveral years before the IRS discovers it. Even if it is an honest \nmistake, it makes sense for the IRS to impose a penalty just as any \nother business would if you were underpaying bills. What doesn't make \nsense is for the IRS to charge interest and penalties during the time \nin which the taxpayer is unaware of the mistake. That is corrected in \nthis bill.\n  There is more congressional accountability, and that has been \nreferred to on the floor. Yes, it is true, Congress will be watching \nthe Internal Revenue Service more closely.\n  There is another provision which I think is important so that \ntaxpayers across America don't get the wrong impression. We ask the \nInternal Revenue Service and the Treasury to report to us annually in \nterms of compliance; that is, what percentage of American taxpayers are \nmeeting their legal obligations and filing their taxes and what percent \nare not. If we see an increase in those who are not meeting their legal \nobligation after we pass this, we are going to have to address it \nagain, because, as I said, the vast majority of Americans do pay their \ntaxes and pay them on time.\n  Those are the good parts of the bill, and they are extremely good \nparts of the bill. I think the bill, when viewed in this context, is a \nplus. Unfortunately, in the dead of night, in the depths of the \nconference, some people couldn't leave well enough alone. They thought \nthis bill was so popular and so destined for success, they couldn't \nwait to put their own amendments on the bill, none of which has \nanything to do with reforming the Internal Revenue Service, but all of \nwhich have something to do with our Tax Code and our Treasury and \nwhether or not we are creating breaks in this bill that we shouldn't.\n  One tax break has to do with a change in individual retirement \naccounts. I like IRAs. I think they have been good for America. A lot \nof people were able to save money, they are glad they did, and now it \nhas grown over time and it will help them retire. I think we should \nexpand IRAs, particularly for working families so they have a way to \nput a little money aside for their future needs. The Senator from the \nState of Delaware, Senator Roth, created the so-called Roth IRA. I kid \nhim so much about the publicity he is receiving. No one will ever be \nable to defeat him. He is the author of the Roth IRA, and he will be \nremembered for that and many other things for years to come. It \nexpanded the idea of an individual retirement account and gave \nAmericans more options.\n  Unfortunately, in this bill we have taken a new twist on this IRA, \nand created even more tax opportunities for those at higher incomes, \nunder the name of an individual retirement account. Do you know what it \nwill cost us when it is all said and done? It will cost the taxpayers \nsome $13 billion--that is ``billion dollars''--$13 billion.\n  A year ago, this Senate was consumed with the debate over amending \nthe Constitution to balance the budget. We had given up on the idea of \nbalancing the books here and said, ``That is it, put it in the \nConstitution, and let the courts enforce it.'' That debate went on and \non and on. The amendment failed by one vote. So here we are, a year \nlater. Are we talking about the deficit and balancing the budget? No. \nInstead, in this bill and others, we are talking about a surplus and \nspending $13 billion we don't have to create tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals. I don't think that makes sense. I think that is very \nshortsighted. In the long haul, I think we will regret it.\n  There is a reference, as well, to a provision in this bill which has \nnothing to do with the underlying legislation about the Internal \nRevenue Service, a provision that will deny veterans medical benefits. \nWhy? Why, in God's name, would that be included in the Internal Revenue \nService reform bill? It shouldn't be.\n  So I find myself in a dilemma as a member of the conference. When I \nsaw all of the baggage being loaded on to this bill, I refused to sign \nthe conference report. I said I would not put my name to this, not \nbecause the underlying bill is bad--I think it is good--but because of \nall of the people who just couldn't suppress the urge to add another \nornament to the tree, something they personally wanted.\n\n  Now this bill comes to the floor, and those of us who like the \nunderlying bill and despise the amendments added to it are in a real \ndilemma. I will probably end up voting for it, but it will be \nreluctantly. I can guarantee you this: If this passes--and I guess it \nwill--I hope that others will join me, Democrats and Republicans, to \nmake sure that we strip out these little baubles that have been added \nto the bill that, frankly, are not in the best interest of\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nthis Nation. They benefit a handful of wealthy people instead of \nAmericans who deserve the real help and the real break in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for such time \nas I need to complete my statement concerning the Internal Revenue \nService\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a member of the conference \ncommittee, I rise in support of the conference report on this historic \npiece of legislation which will overhaul the agency that is most feared \nby the American people, the Internal Revenue Service.\n  However, I want to make sure that the Record reflects my compliments \nto those many dedicated IRS employees who were not, and are not, a part \nof the abuses or the horror stories that we heard during the Internal \nRevenue Service hearings held before the Finance Committee. These are \nthe many dedicated individuals doing their job in a satisfactory \nmanner.\n  With the Finance Committee hearings that began last September and \nended in April, the American public heard some chilling testimony, \ntestimony of an agency that is simply out of control and an agency with \nno or little accountability.\n  For fishermen in Alaska, the conference report retains an important \nchange that was proposed by Senator Stevens and myself. Under our \namendment, it will be far more difficult for the IRS to seize limited \nentry fishing permits. IRS will have to factor in the amount of money a \nfisherman will earn if he kept his fishing permit before embarking on a \nseizure. And even if IRS determines that future earnings will not be \nsufficient to pay a tax debt, the fisherman will, for the first time, \nbe able to appeal that decision--the point being, once the fisherman \nloses his or her fishing permit, they do not have a source of revenue \nfor payment of taxes; as a consequence, the IRS is very unlikely to \nmake a recovery.\n\n  Another important change we've made prevents IRS from harassing the \ndivorced woman for her ex-husband's tax cheating. Under the Conference \nagreement, divorced or separated innocent spouses will only he held \naccountable for taxes on their own income, not on the taxes owed by \ntheir spouse.\n  We heard some horror stories in testimony, Mr. President, from women \nwho were subjected to harassment by the IRS when, clearly, their \nhusbands were cheating on their own taxes in an effort to evade taxes \nthrough tax shelters, and so on, without any knowledge of the spouse.\n  In addition, we've added a rule suspending interest and penalties \nwhen the IRS does not provide appropriate notice to taxpayers within 18 \nmonths of filing. Although I preferred the Senate provision suspending \ninterest and penalties if IRS fails to notify the taxpayer within 12 \nmonths, I was persuaded to delay the 12-month rule for 5 years to \nenable IRS to update all of its computers to meet this standard.\n  The important thing for taxpayers to know is that long notification \ndelays by IRS will no longer benefit the Service because it will not be \nable to stack penalties and interest on taxpayers who may have \nunwittingly made a mistake on their returns.\n  We've also changed the burden of proof in cases coming before the Tax \nCourt. This is a long overdue change. When American citizens go into a \ncourt, they should be presumed innocent, not guilty until they can \nprove their innocence. That principle is enshrined in our Constitution \nand must apply in tax cases as well as any other cases. Now it will.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, the culture at the IRS must change. \nThis bill makes very important changes that should give the American \npublic more confidence that if they make a mistake on their tax \nreturns, they will be treated fairly by their government and not \nsubjected to threats and harassment.\n  But this bill is just a first step. It is incumbent on the Finance \nCommittee to hold the agency accountable for implementing this bill. \nMore oversight is needed because it is only through oversight that we \ncan hold this agency accountable to the American people.\n  Finally, I note that problems between the IRS and taxpayers could be \ngreatly minimized if we overhauled the far-too-complex tax code that is \nso intimidating that less than half of all taxpayers have the \nconfidence to fill out their returns by themselves.\n  I ask each of my colleagues to address his or her own tax situation \nrelative to how many Members of this body do their own tax returns. I \nmust admit that I, for one, do not, simply because of the complexity.\n  I believe fundamental tax reform is the most important thing we can \ndo to restore public confidence in the tax system. This conference \nreport takes a small, but much needed step toward simplification. It \nchanges the holding period for capital gains from 18 months to 12 \nmonths. I strongly support this change on both economic grounds and \nbecause this will significantly simplify tax filing for any individual \nwho owns a mutual fund or shares of stock.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an historic milestone and I expect it \nwill pass with overwhelming bi-partisan support. I hope that next year \nwe can produce fundamental tax reform that will have similar bi-\npartisan support.\n  Mr. President, the conferees included a provision which is unrelated \nto IRS reform but will have an important effect in our on-going debates \nabout international trade. We have included a provision that changes \nthe name of ``most favored nation'' trade status to ``normal trade \nrelations.''\n  This is a long overdue change that I strongly support. For many \nyears, we have debated extending normal trade status to some of our \nformer adversaries such as China. In determining whether to treat \nimports from these countries in the same way as we treat imports from \nour allies, such as Japan and Great Britain, the term ``most favored \nnation'' has historically been used.\n  That term ``MFN'' has caused confusion among many members of the \npublic, for it implies that we are granting a special favored status \nthat is better than what we grant our other trading partners.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, MFN--most favored nation--merely \ngrants equal status, not greater status, for those countries. Changing \nMFN to normal trading relations should do a lot to clear up public \nconfusion and allow us to debate the issues with a clearer focus.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that my colleagues will support the \nconference committee's report with regard to the IRS, and, as a \nconsequence, I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't intend to speak for more than about \n5 minutes. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for granting \nme this time. I also want to thank my colleague and friend, Senator \nRockefeller from West Virginia, for deferring so I can maintain a \nschedule. I will be brief.\n  I am enthusiastically supporting the product brought out of the \nFinance Committee that we will be voting on shortly to rein in what has \nbeen in many instances an out-of-control agency that has, I think, \ntrampled upon some liberties of the American people. I commend the \nFinance Committee for doing this. It is much needed reform. I am glad \nthat we are finally here on the floor debating and, hopefully, ready to \npass this.\n  Former Chief Justice John Marshall, in a landmark case many of us \nlearned in law school, McCulloch v. Maryland, said that ``the power to \ntax involves the power to destroy.'' We understand that the power to \ntax is a power that is granted to Congress. So we have no one to point \na finger at in that regard other than ourselves. But the power to \ndestroy, I am sure, Marshall was referring to was the fact that \ntaxation, if improperly applied, can destroy.\n  But there is a second point to that which I think is important; and \nthat is, if the administration of the power to tax is abused, it can \nalso have the power to destroy.\n  We have heard about the documented, systemic abuse of taxpayers in \nthe oversight hearings that have been held. This bill will, hopefully--\nand I believe will--effectively end the agency's disregard of taxpayers \nrights. We have heard the horror stories of taxpayer\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\nmistreatment by armed IRS agents raiding taxpayers' homes and Americans \nbeing subjected to years of harassment, unsubstantiated audits, audits \nthat are targeted at low-income and favor high-income, audits that are \ntargeted at those of modest education, quota goals, disregard for rules \nand regulations, and even laws, in order to achieve a certain product \ngoal. Those are abuses that have been documented, have been discussed, \nand really form the basis for the legislation that we are addressing \ntoday.\n  I would like to relate just one story that was relayed to me by one \nof my constituents in Indiana. He gave me permission to tell this story \nbut requested that I only tell it if I did not disclose his name. \n``Why?'' I asked. He said, ``Because I fear retribution.'' I said, \n``You have nothing to fear.'' He said, ``No. I fear retribution. I have \nbeen through so much, I don't want to give that agency or anybody \nassociated with that agency any cause to come after me again. I cannot \ngo through that again. So use my story but don't use my name.''\n  The history is that as he was preparing for Christmas and shopping to \npurchase both gifts and food for his Christmas dinner for his family, \nhe was shocked to learn that his credit was denied because he was told \nhe had no money in his bank account. His entire savings had been wiped \nclean by the IRS for back taxes and penalties. He immediately called \nthe IRS, and he was told that the reason for this was that 10 years \nago, in 1987, the IRS discovered that his 1987 tax return was not on \nfile and that he had not answered any of the registered letters that \nwere sent to him. Of course, he never received those registered letters \nbecause he had not lived at that address since 1987.\n  Subsequently, he had filed returns for each year, which the IRS had \nprocessed, and he had received responses back from the IRS at his new \naddress. So all of the subsequent years, the IRS knew where he was. But \nin 1987, with a previous address, because they had lost his return and \nbecause the registered letters notifying him of that were sent to his \nold address, the two computers didn't match, or the two agents didn't \ncheck with each other. And, therefore, my constituent found that his \nentire savings had been wiped out just before Christmas, and he learned \nabout it when his credit was denied as he was shopping for his family.\n  That is just one tale. But it doesn't end there. That is horrific \nenough.\n  A few months later, after some paper shuffling at the IRS, this \ngentleman was told--based on the information that he had to provide \nagain to the IRS--they actually owed him a refund of $1,500 for his \n1987 return. He had supplied duplicate information again to the IRS. \nHowever, they said since the statute of limitations had run, he was no \nlonger entitled to his refund.\n\n  That is the kind of thing that causes your mouth to drop open and I \nguess you pull your hair out. I don't think that is why I lost my hair. \nBut had I been that taxpayer, the outrage that would have ensued I \nthink is something that all of us can identify with.\n  After a lot of intervention and a lot more paper shuffling, he did \nfinally get his $1,500. Only the IRS could pull off something like \nthis.\n  These stories of abuse and mismanagement go on and on. I will not \ndetail those in the interest of time.\n  It is unfortunate and sometimes, I think, disgraceful that an agency \nof the greatest democracy in the world could have attributes that could \nbest be described or identified as a paramilitary wing of a despotic \nregime.\n  So it is past time, I believe, that this legislation pass the \nCongress, and be signed by the President, and that we urge the new \nCommissioner of the IRS, Mr. Rossotti, to conduct a thorough \nhousecleaning based on what we have put in this legislation.\n  The IRS exists to serve the American people, not the other way \naround. There has to be accountability for this agency. There has to be \nmore protection for the taxpayer. Efficiency and integrity need to be \nthe twin goals of the IRS. Therefore, passing this legislation is a \nvery important step to achieving this end.\n  I want to close, Mr. President, with a quote that is etched into the \nstone of the IRS building headquarters here in Washington. It is a \nquote from Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said, \n``Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.'' If that in fact is \nthe case, if taxes are what we pay for a civilized society, then we \nhave every right to demand that the tax collector act in a civilized \nmanner. The IRS has not done that. The tax collector has not acted in a \ncivilized manner. We pay our taxes. We expect a civilized processing of \nthose taxes. Hopefully, this bill will take us toward that end or \nachieve that end.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very happy to be making comments \nwhile the Senator from the State of Wyoming is presiding.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say that there may hopefully be some \nencouraging news with respect to the negotiations going on about \nproduct liability. As you know, the majority leader came to the floor \nand said that a cloture vote would continue as planned for tomorrow \nmorning, and that amendments would be allowed up until 5 o'clock, which \ncollectively allowed for about 4 hours of amendments.\n  I think it is very important, in the relationship between the \nmajority and the minority, for the minority to be able to make \namendments. And I think there has been some--no, not some, but a great \ndeal of concern from our side about the pattern of using cloture \nmotions, rather than as a chance to shut off debate, as simply a chance \nto shut off amendments. But now I understand that there is some \nconsideration being given to perhaps postponing the cloture vote for a \nperiod of days so that there can be some discussion on the subject of \namendments on the product liability bill.\n  It is actually very interesting. In all the years--I was reflecting \non it this morning with Senator Gorton--that this Senator from West \nVirginia has been working on product liability, there has really been \nno debate about product liability, only speeches. There have been \nspeeches on the topic or a filibuster would commence and continue, and \na series of speeches, but really never debate, never questions and \nanswers back and forth, people probing each other.\n  So I hope, anyway, that this possibility will come to pass. I think \nwe do need debate. I think we do need a chance to offer amendments.\n  Having said that, however, the Senator from West Virginia wishes to \nreiterate his position that I reached an agreement with the White \nHouse. It was an arduous, long process, but one in which honor and \nfaith was kept on both sides, and I feel bound by the position of the \nWhite House as it stands now, or however it develops--and it probably \nwon't develop--but that has to be my position. I am a defender of the \nfaith, so to speak, in terms of the negotiation that I carried out with \nthe White House to produce a rather minimal bill with respect to \nproduct liability but, on the other hand, a bill which moves the \nsubject forward.\n  Mr. President, my real purpose today is to speak about veterans' \nrights. I should start out by saying that I very much respect the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, whom I specifically and directly \nremove from any criticism which I might be about to make, because it \nshould not be directed at him at all. That goes also for the ranking \nmember, Mr. Moynihan, for his part in bringing the IRS debate and bill \nto a conclusion. But I am not happy and I think my colleagues know \nthat.\n  Veterans' rights have been bartered away, in deals without the full \nscrutiny of the Senate or even the authorizing committee. There are \nmany here who believe very strongly in the authorizing process; not \neverything is appropriating. Authorizing has to come first. That is the \nway of the Senate. That has been quietly and very definitely thrown \naside in this whole process.\n  I am referring to the denial of veterans' disability rights which \nwere enacted as part of TEA 21, and in the process now going on with \nregard to the technical corrections bill needed to amend drafting \nerrors which were admittedly made in that bill.\n  America's veterans, indeed, all Americans, are being subjected to \nwhat amounts to an unprecedented power\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\nplay, conducted behind closed doors, as part of the highway \nreauthorization process. This is a kind of process which one can talk \nabout on the Senate floor and very few choose to listen to it, because \nit sounds like what everybody doesn't like about Washington and, in \nfact, it is what everybody should not like about Washington.\n  This is an example of a process run amok, where any provision, no \nmatter how heinous or unrelated, can be added in conference under cover \nof darkness.\n  Now, of course, if you add something in conference, all of us \nunderstand that the conference report is unamendable. So you vote yea, \nor you vote nay on the report, but you cannot amend it; thus the power \nto use this process is a formidable power, and thus we need to do \nthings correctly in this body.\n  I think the process that has gone on here is a process all Members \nare going to come to lament. This process is backroom, back-door \npolitics. It is not democracy, and, Mr. President, veterans have earned \nbetter than this.\n  Veterans have earned more from their government than a process that \ndenies their rights without any accountability. Veterans have earned \nmore than a process where the denial of veterans' rights can be \ninserted into unamendable conference reports, under the cover of \ndarkness. They have earned more than a process where, in the name of \nexpediency, extraneous provisions are placed in conference reports to \navoid accountability, and where the majority has, in effect, destroyed \nthe normal protections.\n  Why is it, I ask myself time and time again, why is it that this \nSenate is willing to look the other way on this? Why is it that we are \nallowing such an abuse of power to go on?\n\n  It is clearly unfair. I do not think that it was the original purpose \nof the conferees or the original people doing ISTEA to deny benefits \nthat are in the current law for tobacco-addicted veterans who have \ndisabilities, veterans who have gone through an unbelievably difficult \nprocess at the Department of Veterans Affairs to qualify for service \nconnection for their disabilities. But, in fact, under the highway \nbill, current law has been rescinded, wiped from the books, and nobody \nhas done anything about it, and nobody can do anything about it. And we \nsit here, stand here, talk here, silently, knowingly doing nothing \nabout it at all.\n  Now, IRS reform, highway spending, these are two things that I very \nmuch favor. I voted for the underlying bills. In terms of the IRS \nreform conference report, had that come up clean, I would have voted \nfor it now. I voted for it in committee. I am on the Finance Committee. \nHowever, I cannot support its passage at the expense of America's \nveterans.\n  You say, well, but that is just one group of people and this is a \nvery large issue. Well, veterans are more than just one group of \npeople, Mr. President. They are symbolic of the tenor of a nation, the \nmoral attitude of a country towards its citizens who have maintained \nits freedom. Veterans are at all times to be taken very seriously \nbecause of the sacrifices that many of them have made, and in this case \nin particular, where their disability has been fostered by the \nGovernment's actions in a number of ways.\n  My colleagues know I have been fighting for many months to correct \nthe injustice that we did to veterans. It is my duty, it is my honor to \ndo so, and I am going to continue to do so here. But I must stop and \nask, why, why is it that the majority continues to use their power to \ndeny full Senate consideration of H.R. 3978, the highway corrections \nbill?\n  If we brought it up, we could have a time agreement of a half hour, \ndivide it in two, 15 minutes each side, and we could have an up-or-down \nvote. But, of course, all of that is just talk at this point, because \nwe are on a conference report and it cannot happen, and I understand \nthat. But that will not keep me from standing here and voicing my \noutrage at a process which so undoes veterans who have suffered, and \ndoes it so unfairly.\n  Why has the leadership endorsed, in fact induced, conferees to take \nsuch action? Why have they decided to totally ignore the needs of \nAmerica's veterans on the way to what amounts to a 44-percent increase \nin highway spending over the last budget cycle.\n  I am all for highway spending. I remind my colleagues I come from the \nState of West Virginia, where only 4 percent of the land is flat, so if \nyou don't have a highway somewhere around you, you are in pretty big \ntrouble pretty quickly. So highways are important to me.\n  But instead of bringing this bill to the floor for debate and a \nsingle amendment, the majority simply said they would find another way \nto pass this bill, quietly, covertly, out of the light of day. And it \nturned out that the other way of doing this was the IRS conference \nreport, which we are debating today.\n  We are evading the usual process that would have allowed this to be \nfully aired and debated in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which has \njurisdiction over veterans compensation matters. People say, well, \njurisdiction, who cares? Well, jurisdiction matters, and there are a \nlot of people in this body who place great weight on jurisdiction. \nAuthorizing committees have jurisdiction for some things; the \nAppropriations Committee has jurisdiction for other things, but \njurisdiction is important.\n  Jurisdiction has been bypassed, abrogated, tossed aside in this whole \nprocess, and now we are taking away a benefit which was granted to \ndisabled veterans under existing law. Some are going to argue we are \ngiving veterans a new benefit. That is absurd. We have removed a \nbenefit which was there under the current law for veterans who are \ntobacco addicted to the point of disability, after going through a \nseries of VA tests which are so rigorous that at this point, only a \nrelatively few hundred have been able to qualify for those benefits. So \nit is extremely unfair.\n  Once again, we sidestep the regular process. The IRS conferees failed \nto restore the benefits. Once again, I exempt the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee and the chairman of the full committee. I exempt them \nfrom blame for this. We failed to restore the cuts. And this is at the \ndirection of the majority. This has been a complete mockery of our \nbudget process and of regular order in the Senate.\n  So, this is what I have called a ``midnight raid'' on veterans' \nbenefits. To put it bluntly, America's veterans have been wronged, \ndeeply wronged, by backdoor trickery. Funding for veterans' benefits \nhas been cut; imaginary savings have been diverted to pay for highways; \nand veterans' disability rights have been placed in jeopardy, to say \nthe least.\n  I had hoped to offer an amendment to the corrections bill that would \nhave struck the veterans' disability compensation offset from the \nunderlying conference report. But that was all pushed aside. I no \nlonger have that option.\n  I will say that the IRS restructuring conference report has slightly \nimproved the language pertaining to veterans. I will give them credit \nfor that, since credit must be given where credit is due. The \nconference report strikes references to smoking being ``willful \nmisconduct.'' You understand I am talking about a veterans population, \nfor the most part older, which was encouraged to smoke by the \nGovernment, told to take a smoking break, where they were sold \ncigarettes at a reduced price, and where the warnings about the dangers \nof tobacco were not even produced or shown on cigarettes used in the \nmilitary until 5 years after that was happening as a routine matter for \nthe civilian population in the United States.\n  So, this is another nail in the veterans' benefits' coffin. I am \nvery, very angry about it. America's veterans will not be fooled by \nbackroom, backdoor legislating, no matter how anybody chooses to try to \nclean up the record on this. They will see through this charade. They \nwill remember it on Veterans' Day, on Memorial Day, on the Fourth of \nJuly, when we all give our speeches about veterans. And then we come \nin, in the darkness of night, and take away benefits from disabled \nveterans, who under current law have disability compensation rights, \nand we take them away. We take them away and will not restore them. I \ncannot be a part of that, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting \nto oppose the IRS reform conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Rhode Island \nis recognized.\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, the conference report before the Senate \nincludes the TEA 21, that is the Transportation Efficiency Act of the \n21st century, which some call the ISTEA II Restoration Act. It includes \na technical corrections measure to that bill. The technical correction \nmeasure, which is part of the legislation before us, remedies errors \nmade in H.R. 2400, which was the surface transportation bill we passed \njust before the Memorial Day recess.\n  As everyone knows, just before we went out on that break for Memorial \nDay, there was a great desire to complete the legislation before us. We \ncompleted negotiations on Thursday evening and delivered a very complex \nbill that had over 900 pages the first thing on Friday morning. In \nother words, we completed the negotiations on Thursday night, and by \nthe next morning we had a bill of over 900 pages before us. Inevitably, \nsome errors were made.\n  We have before us legislation to correct those errors. I emphasize \nthis is just a technical corrections bill. Many Members have come to us \nin the ensuing days suggesting new items or changes that they wanted to \nbe made because they felt in the original legislation they did not \nobtain them. But we resisted all such requests. This bill merely \ncarries out the agreements of that conference on H.R. 2400. I will \nrefer to it sometimes by the number. That is the original \ntransportation legislation that we passed.\n  The technical corrections in the legislation before us have been \ndeveloped jointly by the House and the Senate conferees, with valuable \ninput from the U.S. Department of Transportation. I think it is \nimportant to note this legislation before us does not change the \nformula allocations agreed to in the conference. The technical changes \nin this legislation relate to apportionments. Those that exist are made \nto ensure that the legislative instructions to the Department of \nTransportation on the formula will produce an apportionment to the \nStates just as we agreed upon. In other words, the only changes we made \nin this legislation, so-called technical corrections, are to take care \nof things that were left out inadvertently or to clarify an intent that \nwas there and clearly recognized in order to carry out that intent.\n\n  This bill also corrects drafting errors relating to veterans' \nsmoking-related disability benefits. This is to what the Senator from \nWest Virginia was referring. The provisions of H.R. 2400 were intended \nmerely to reverse a recent decision by the general counsel of the \nVeterans' Administration, which decision had not yet been implemented. \nIt is very important to remember that. We have been advised that the \nbill may be interpreted to deny benefits to some veterans who were \neligible for benefits prior to the general counsel's decision. In other \nwords, it has come to our attention there may be situations that have \narisen that, as a result of the language as we drew it, denied benefits \nto some veterans who were receiving them. What we meant to do was to \nreverse the general counsel's decision as it might apply to future \napplicants in an entirely new category of benefits opened by the \ngeneral counsel. And with this technical corrections bill, we reach \nthat objective.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post several weeks ago that \nhas caused serious concern. That article suggested that Congress had \ndeclared smoking ``willful misconduct'' by America's veterans. That was \njust plain wrong. That statement in the Washington Post, that we \nincluded smoking as ``willful misconduct'' by American veterans, gave \ngreat offense to some. I want everyone to know that was an incorrect \nreading of the legislation.\n  Section 1110 of title 38, which is the existing law and has nothing \nto do with the transportation legislation, entitled veterans to \ncompensation if they are disabled by service-related illness or injury. \nThere are two exceptions to this entitlement in current law. The first \nexception is ``willful misconduct.'' A veteran cannot get disability \ncompensation if the illness or injury results from willful misconduct. \nThat is the law. It has been the law a long time. The second exception \ndenies benefits if the illness or injury resulted from alcohol or \ndrugs. These two exceptions are in the current law. That is where they \nare.\n  Now, H.R. 2400, the transportation legislation, added a third \nexception. It would have denied benefits where the illness results from \nsmoking. This did not make smoking willful misconduct. This was a third \nexception to the provision that entitles a veteran to disability \nbenefits. The first was willful misconduct, the second was alcohol or \ndrugs, and the third was smoking related.\n  From where did we get that language? That was suggested by the Senate \nlegislative counsel as the most straightforward means to reverse the \ngreat opening of benefits under the general counsel's decision.\n  This language had the unintended consequence of denying benefits to \nsome veterans who would have qualified prior to the decision. This bill \ndrops the language suggested by the Senate legislative counsel. We just \ngot away from all that language that we had in there and returned to \nthe language which was suggested by the administration, which reverses \nthe general counsel's decision as it might apply to future applicants.\n  No veteran now entitled to benefits as a result of adjudication, or \nwho has applied for such benefits, will be affected.\n  This bill makes the following changes to the veterans subtitle:\n  One, it clarifies that veterans who file claims for smoking-related \nbenefits are grandfathered. That filing isn't going to be eliminated.\n  Second, it makes clear that those active-duty service personnel who \ncontracted a smoking-related illness while in the service continue to \nqualify for disability compensation. We don't change that.\n  Third, we ensure that survivors and their dependents will receive a \n20-percent increase in education assistance benefits.\n  Madam President, we prepared a summary of this technical corrections \nbill, and I ask unanimous consent that this summary be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I also point out, Madam President, that we voted on the \nunderlying veterans issue three times in this Senate. Each time it has \napproved the action that we took here.\n\n\n                     home heating oil pilot program\n\n  The Department of Transportation Secretary has been given new \nauthority under section 4007, of the newly passed Transportation \nEfficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21), for waivers, exemptions \nand pilot programs. Therefore, section 1221(j), the home heating oil \npilot program is redundant and no longer necessary. Striking this pilot \nprogram is not intended to suggest that a home heating oil pilot \nprogram should not be conducted. On the contrary, because of the unique \nseasonal nature of the heating oil industry, it is essential that a \npilot program be implemented on or before December 1, to be valuable \nthe following winter. The home heating oil pilot program was first \nauthorized in section 346 of the National Highway System Designation of \n1995. However, this pilot program was never fully implemented by the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n House/Senate Joint Summary of Technical Corrections to Transportation \n                    Equity Act for the 21st Century\n\n       This legislation: (1) restories provisions agreed to by the \n     conferees; (2) makes technical corrections to provisions \n     included in H.R. 2400; and (3) eliminates duplicative program \n     authorizations.\n       This legislation does not change the formula allocations \n     contained in the Conference Report to the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century.\n       The following is a section by section description of \n     provisions included in the TEA-21 Restoration Act:\n     Section 9001 Short Title\n     Section 9002 Authorization and Program Subtitle\n       Adjusts funding levels for high priority projects to \n     conform with list in the conference report and to correct \n     other errors.\n       Adjusts funding levels for Highway Use Tax Evasion projects \n     to allow for implementation of the Excise Fuel Tracking \n     System.\n       Corrects the obligation limitation levels for mathematical \n     consistency and conforms obligation limitation treatment to \n     current practice for research programs.\n       Makes other conforming and technical changes such as \n     renumbering sections and correcting cross reference.\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\n     Section 9003 Restorations to General Provisions Subtitle\n       Restores the National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation \n     program.\n       Restores the Substitute Project for the Barney Circle \n     Freeway, Washington, D.C.\n       Restores Fiscal, Administrative and Other Amendments \n     included in both House and Senate bills.\n       Removes section 1211(j) regarding winter home heating oil \n     delivery.\n       Makes technical corrections to section 1211, Amendments to \n     Prior Surface Transportation laws and section 1212, \n     Miscellaneous Provisions.\n       Clarifies program funding categories for Puerto Rico and \n     continues current law penalties for Puerto Rico for non-\n     compliance with the federal minimum drinking age \n     requirements.\n       Clarifies that contract authority is authorized for \n     provisions contained in section 1215, Designated \n     Transportation Enhancement Activities.\n       Modifies Sec. 1217(j) to allow for effective implementation \n     of this subsection.

The program then provides authorization of $950 million for \nconstruction of a project.\n  I wish to ask the chairman to confirm my understanding that these \npre-construction activities are to be funded in the same fashion as \nother transportation programs, that is to say, with an 80 percent \nFederal match. The Federal role in the actual construction program, \nhowever, is limited to not more than a two-thirds match. Is that also \nthe chairman's understanding?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, that is my understanding and that is indeed what the \ncommittee intended in passing this program.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                             section 105(e)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I commend the distinguished chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee for his hard work and \ndedication to the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century that \npassed the Congress on May 22. I am honored to have been a participant \non the conference committee. Mr. President, I would like to enter into \na colloquy with the distinguished chairman to clarify a provision in \nthe TEA 21 legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I will enter into a colloquy with the \nsenior Senator from Florida to clarify a provision in the TEA 21 \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to clarify section 105(e), special rule, \nthat states if in any of fiscal years 1999 through 2003, the amount \nauthorized under subsection (d) is more than 30 percent higher than the \namount authorized under subsection (d) in fiscal year 1998, the \nSecretary shall use the apportionment factors under sections 104 and \n144 as in effect on the date of enactment of this section. Does this \nprovision jeopardize the 90.5 guarantee rate of return even if a \nState's gas tax revenues to the highway trust fund are to grow \nsignificantly over the life of the bill?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No, my understanding is that the intent of this section \nis to prevent the dollar amount of the minimum guarantee from growing \nout of proportion far beyond that which the conferees anticipate. The \nintent of the Congress is that no State will receive less than a 90.5 \npercent rate of return on their gas tax contributions to the highway \ntrust fund, of the funds distributed to the States which are covered by \nthe minimum guarantee provision.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998. I want to thank the Chairman, and \nother members of the Finance Committee for their work in crafting this \nmuch-needed measure.\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\n  This legislation is about more than merely reforming one Government \nagency. This bill is about fundamental fairness and the role of the \nFederal Government in our lives. The out-of-control IRS is a prime \nexample of intrusive and unnecessary big government.\n  Madam President, I have spent 15 years in Congress fighting to lower \ntaxes, cut spending, and shrink the size of our bloated and intrusive \nFederal Government.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Coverdell and I introduced the Middle \nClass Tax Relief Act of 1998, which is a step toward a simpler, \nflatter, fairer Tax Code. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act would deliver \nsweeping tax relief to 29 million lower- and middle-income taxpayers by \nincreasing the number of individuals and married couples who pay the \nlowest tax rate, which is 15 percent.\n  The bill raises the limit for the 15 percent bracket to $35,000 for \nan individual taxpayer. In addition, this bill significantly lessens \nthe effect of one of the Tax Code's most onerous and inequitable \nprovisions--the marriage penalty--by allowing married couples to earn \nas much as $70,000 and still pay only 15 percent in taxes.\n  It is essential that we provide American families with relief from \nthe excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of \nthe opportunity to provide for their needs and save for the future. The \nMiddle-Class Tax Relief Act permits individuals to keep more of the \nmoney they earn. With this extra income, Americans will be able to save \nand invest more. Increased savings and investment are key to sustaining \nour Nation's current economic growth.\n  Last year, Congress passed a major tax-relief bill, the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, which provided an estimated $96 billion in tax \nrelief to Americans at all income levels. And I and others have \nsponsored numerous legislative proposals to eventually repeal the \ncurrent Tax Code, and to lower or eliminate taxes on families, estates, \ncharitable giving, farmers, Social Security benefits, tip income, \nInternet access and services, gasoline, and conservation efforts.\n  Cutting taxes is only a part of the solution to the problems of big \ngovernment. We must also cut spending.\n  For 10 years, I fought to enact the line item veto legislation, which \nwould have helped eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending of \ntaxpayer dollars from annual appropriations bills. When the Supreme \nCourt struck down the 1996 law, Senator Coats and I introduced a \nrevised line item veto authority, called separate enrollment. Our bill \nwould avoid the Constitutional questions surrounding the original line-\nitem veto, and we intend to push for its early enactment.\n  Clearly, the line-item veto is a necessary tool to curb the Federal \nGovernment's appetite for pork-barrel spending. Last year alone, \nCongress added more than $8 billion in wasteful, unnecesssary, and low-\npriority spending to the appropriations bills. This year, with only \nabout half the bills done, nearly $7.5 billion has been set aside for \ncongressional earmarks. I intend to continue to oppose such wasteful \nspending when these bills come before the Senate, because these \nearmarks take money right out of the pockets of the taxpayers.\n  In 1997, I supported the Balanced Budget Act which cut spending by \n$270 billion and led to the first balanced Federal budget in 30 years. \nIn addition to refraining from adding unnecessary programs to the \nvarious agency budgets, we should be looking for savings and \nefficiencies in all areas of the Federal budget, including Congress' \nown funding. With the likelihood of significant budget surpluses on the \nhorizon, we must now work to ensure that any extra money is returned to \nthe people in the form of tax relief--not spent on pork-barrel projects \nor big-government programs.\n  Some are probably wondering what this discussion of tax relief and \nspending cuts has to do with IRS reform. On the surface, the IRS reform \nbill is simply about reforming a Government agency. But this bill is \nabout more, it is about fundamental fairness and the role of the \nGovernment in our lives.\n  As the people's elected representatives, we cannot merely point the \nfinger at this runaway agency. We have a responsibility to protect the \nAmerican public's individual freedom and dignity from the IRS and any \nother agency that oversteps its boundaries and unduly infringes upon \nthe American public's day-to-day existence.\n  The reforms in this bill are carefully crafted structural reforms. \nThey are reforms that will not only change the practices and procedures \nof the IRS, but its fundamental culture as well. These reforms will \nensure that the IRS treats taxpayers fairly and with the respect they \ndeserve.\n  The IRS Restructuring Act of 1998 implants additional oversight and \noutside expertise into the management of the IRS. An entire title of \nthis bill is devoted to taxpayer protection and taxpayer rights. Most \nimportant, this bill shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to \nthe IRS. This measure has relief for innocent spouses from tax \nliabilities incurred by former spouses from whom they have been \ndivorced or legally separated for at least 12 months. The fear of an \naudit looms over the heads of even honest taxpayers. After passage of \nthis legislation, honest taxpayers will now have greater protections \nthroughout the audit process.\n  These management and administrative provisions are key to restoring \nfairness and efficiency to the management and administration of our tax \nlaws.\n  In addition, this conference agreement builds on last year's Taxpayer \nRelief Act. It provides $12.9 billion over the next 10 years in much-\nneeded taxpayer relief for millions of hard-working Americans by \neliminating the complex 18-month holding period that was required to \nrealize the lowest applicable tax rate for capital gains. This \nprovision is vital to America's middle class. Capital gains are no \nlonger exclusively for the rich and powerful. The world of mutual \nfunds, discount brokers, and the Internet has empowered the middle \nclass with newfound prosperity. Simplifying and lowering the capital \ngains tax helps ensure the financial stability of our Nation's hard-\nworking middle class.\n  Let me close by saying that the IRS Restructuring Act of 1998 \nillustrates our continuing effort to change the way we collect our \ntaxes, and on a larger note, the role of Government in our everyday \nlives. This bill is a step toward smaller and more efficient \nGovernment--less taxes and less spending, means less big government.\n  Swift passage of this measure will send a loud and clear message to \nAmerica. The message is that Congress hears your call for smaller, less \nintrusive Federal Government and for lowering the excessive tax burden, \nwhich saps job growth and robs Americans of the opportunity to provide \nfor their needs and save for their future.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Internal \nRevenue Service reform bill that is before us today.\n  Mr. President, last fall, the Finance Committee held a series of \nhearings to expose problems in the Internal Revenue Service's dealings \nwith taxpayers. Although we all knew that there were serious problems \nwith the way the IRS does business, it is safe to say that all of us \nwere truly shocked at what we learned from the hearings.\n  As Senator Roth put it at the time, we found that the IRS far too \noften targets vulnerable taxpayers, treats them with hostility and \narrogance, uses unethical and even illegal tactics to collect money \nthat sometimes is not even owed, and uses quotas to evaluate employees. \nIt is behavior that is not only unacceptable, but reprehensible.\n  Madam President, the IRS reform bill begins to address the kind of \nproblems that were uncovered by the Finance Committee's hearings. For \nexample, it shifts the burden of proof in tax disputes from the \ntaxpayer to the IRS, and increases penalties for IRS violations of \ntaxpayer rights. It provides relief for innocent spouses from tax \nliabilities incurred by individuals from whom they have been divorced, \nlegally separated, or living apart for at least 12 months. It provides \nrelief in certain interest and penalty situations. And it extends \ngreater taxpayer protection in the audit process.\n  These are important changes, and they deserve our support today. \nThere is no excuse for not reforming an agency that has too often \nabused innocent taxpayers. The House passed the IRS\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\nreform bill on June 25 by the overwhelming vote of 402 to 8, and my \nhope is that it will pass by a similarly resounding margin here. I \npredict that it will.\n  But I also predict that even a good IRS reform bill will not solve \nthe myriad problems that exist. Our nation's Tax Code, as currently \nwritten, amounts to thousands of pages of confusing, seemingly \ncontradictory tax-law provisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless \nthat reform is followed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the \nInternal Revenue Code itself, problems with collections and enforcement \nare likely to persist. If the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it does \nnot matter what kind of personnel or procedural changes we make at the \nagency. Complexity invites different interpretations of the tax laws \nfrom different people, and that is where most of the problems at the \nIRS arise.\n  Replacing the Tax Code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would \nfacilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive \nIRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to \nlobby for complicated tax loopholes.\n  There are a variety of approaches to fundamental reform that are \npending before Congress: a flat-rate income tax, a national sales tax, \nand the Kemp Commission's simpler single-rate tax, to name a few. Each \nhas its passionate advocates in Congress and around the country, and \nany one of these options would be preferable to the existing income-tax \nsystem.\n  But the fact is, there has not yet emerged sufficient public \nconsensus in favor of a sales tax over a flat tax or some alternative. \nAnd it is likely to take a public consensus, the likes of which we have \nnot seen in recent years, to drive a tax-overhaul plan through Congress \nand past the President. Realistically, it is probably going to take \nseveral more years to develop the kind of support that will be \nnecessary to pass tax reform into law.\n  Until then, we can continue to lay a solid foundation for reform. We \ncan continue to cut taxes every year. Last year, we cut taxes for \nfamilies with children, for young people trying to get a college \neducation, and for seniors who were looking for relief from heavy death \ntaxes and taxes on capital gains. Another modest increment of tax \nrelief is provided in the IRS reform bill today. It will give senior \ncitizens more opportunities to participate in Roth IRA plans. It will \nsimplify the capital-gains tax by eliminating the 18-month holding \nperiod that was added to last year's bill at the last minute without \nany debate.\n  Madam President, this legislation is not an end in itself. It is a \nstep--a step in the direction of fundamental tax reform. Let us pass it \nand move on to the next stage in addressing the American people's \ndesire for tax relief and a simpler, fairer Tax Code. Madam President, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting Senator Roth \nfrom Delaware. He is a serious, thoughtful legislator who does some \nawfully good work. There are times when I disagree very strongly with \nhim; there are other times when I agree with his proposals. I think he \ndoes some excellent work in the Senate. I appreciate it.\n  The conference report that is before the Senate contains some \nimportant legislative accomplishments. Some of the provisions in this \nconference report are useful, necessary, long overdue, and \naccomplishments that I very much support. I voted for this bill when we \nsent it to conference, and now it comes back from conference to the \nSenate as a conference report for our consideration.\n  While this legislation has much to commend it and addresses some very \nimportant issues, it also, as is the case with a number of conference \nreports, attracted some lint, some dust, and some other material as it \nwas massaged and manipulated in conference.\n  One little provision that is, in fact, not so little, is Section 5001 \nof the bill. Page 332 of the statement of the managers explains this \nprovision, and I want to read it for the Record. On page 332 of the \nreport, it says:\n\n                     Title V. Additional Provisions\n\n       A. Elimination of 18-Month Holding Period for Capital \n     Gains.\n\n  And then it says:\n\n       House Bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n\n  And it goes on to describe the ``conference agreement.''\n  That means, with respect to this issue, there was nothing in the \nHouse, nothing in the Senate, no debate, no discussion, no amendment, \nno vote. And all of a sudden, from the legislative darkness, a proposal \nemerged from the conference. It is like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, \nI guess. It is not surprising to those of us who watch conference \ncommittees. Senator Byrd was telling me today that he calls the \nconference committees ``the Third House.'' There is the House, the \nSenate, and then there is a separate body called ``Conference \nCommittees.''\n  This is an example of what can happen in conference committees, of \nwhat can happen in that third body.\n  Let me describe what this proposal is. This proposal expands \nfavorable tax treatment for capital gains--that is, the lower tax rate \nfor capital gains. It does that by reducing the holding period for \neligibility for the lower capital gains tax rate from 18 months to 12 \nmonths. To get the lower tax rate, you only need to hold onto an \ninvestment for 12 months under this provision, rather than 18 months, \nas the law stands now. This proposal costs about $2 billion--$2 \nbillion.\n  Who will it benefit? Here is a chart that shows who it will benefit. \nCitizens for Tax Justice put these figures together. In shortening the \nholding period for capital gains from 18 months to 12 months, 90 \npercent of the benefit will go to taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 \na year; over three-fourths of the benefit will go to taxpayers with \nincomes over $200,000 a year.\n  I suppose those who talk about capital gains a lot will say, gee, \nthis benefits everybody. Yes, it is kind of the cake and crumbs theory, \nwith the cake at this end of the chart and a few crumbs down here. But \nthe chart is clear enough. The benefit, by far, will inure to those \nwhose incomes are very large. And the reduction, therefore, of the \nholding period from 18 months to 12 months is, in effect, a reduction \nin revenue of $2 billion, the benefit of which will go to the folks \nlargely making $100,000 a year or more.\n  As I indicated, that proposal was offered to the conference committee \nat the last minute, had never been considered by the House, had never \nbeen considered by the Senate, and was never debated or voted upon by \neither body.\n\n  One would probably ask the question: Well, if there is $2 billion \nthat is available to be used for one thing or another, how might it be \nused? Perhaps reducing the Federal debt. That might be one approach. \nThe Presiding Officer shakes his head vigorously at that. I assume that \na number of people would think maybe using that to reduce the Federal \ndebt would be useful.\n  Others still might say, well, this was done on about the same day, I \nbelieve, or within a day or two of the decision by the other body in \nthis Congress--the House of Representatives --that they can't afford \nany longer to provide low-income energy assistance for home heating for \npoor people who live in cold climates. In the view of some members of \nthe House majority, there is not enough money for that, so we will get \nrid of that.\n  Or there is not enough money really to fully fund summer jobs for \ndisadvantaged youth. So, what we will do is, we will just cut back on \nthat.\n  However, there are $2 billion available here, there is plenty of \nmoney for this--without debate, and without a separate vote in either \nthe House or the Senate. But there is not enough money for some of \nthose other priorities--priorities, for example, which I have come to \nthe floor to talk about, of the needed investment in Indian schools.\n  Indian schools--those are schools that are our responsibility, under \nthe federal trust responsibility. I have talked about the condition of \nthose schools and the repairs and investment that those schools need. I \nhave talked\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\nabout going into schools where the stench of sewer gas comes up into \nthe classroom and requires children to be escorted out of the \nclassrooms. I talked about schools I visited with 160 people sharing 1 \nwater fountain and 2 bathrooms. It appears we don't have enough money \nto be helpful there. But someone found $2 billion all on its lonesome \nin the legislative darkness to be stuck into a piece of legislation, \nwithout debate in the House or the Senate, in a manner that will \nbenefit a very few--benefit, in fact, those who probably need it least.\n  So, what do we do about that? The conference report comes to the \nSenate and we are told: There is nothing you can do about that; that is \nthe way it is. It is true you didn't have a chance to debate or discuss \nor vote on it. That is life. That is the way the system works.\n  The problem is, there is a rule in the Senate called rule XXVIII, \nparagraph 2. I want to read the rule. This part of the Standing Rules \nof the Senate states that ``conferees shall not insert in their report \nmatter not committed to them by either House.''\n  Let me read that again: ``Conferees''--talking about the conference \ncommittee and the conferees on the committee--``shall not insert in \ntheir report matter not committed to them by either House.'' That means \nif something isn't either in the House bill or the Senate bill, it is \nnot an item that can be considered by the conference. That is the \nstanding rule of the Senate, rule XXVIII, paragraph 2.\n  So how does this provision get here? How do we, in the legislative \ncrevices of conference committees, as they finish their work and as the \nworld isn't watching quite so closely, discover that $2 billion can be \nspent just like that when a Senate rule says ``conferees shall not \ninsert in their report matter not committed to them by either House\"?\n  Mr. President, I think the Senate will be advantaged, and I believe \nthe other body will be advantaged, by a process that does not bring to \nus a piece of legislation dealing with the restructuring of the \nInternal Revenue Service that contains revenue provisions of this type.\n  I don't have a problem with someone coming to the floor of the Senate \nand saying let's debate changing the capital gains provisions of the \ncurrent Tax Code, let's debate changing the holding period, let's \ndebate changing the rate; that is not a problem. I think it is \nperfectly appropriate that we have that debate. But I think it is \ninappropriate that the debate be prevented, as is now the case, when \nthey stick in, during a conference, a provision that was neither in the \nHouse bill nor in the Senate bill--literally in the last few minutes of \nthe conference--and there it sits as a $2 billion revenue item that a \ngood number of other Members of the Senate might have used much \ndifferently--as I indicated, perhaps to reduce the Federal debt, or \nperhaps to restore money for low-income energy assistance for the poor, \nor for a number of other things.\n  But this practice now exists that provides a way to avoid all the \nunpleasantness of debating these things on their own. So we now are in \na situation where the conference report, which is a piece of \nlegislation that has a great deal of merit and much to be commended, \ncontains a provision to reduce the holding period for capital gains \nfrom 18 months to 12 months, which will provide $2 billion of tax \nreductions, 90 percent of which will accrue to those with over $100,000 \nin income, with no debate and no vote. In my judgment, that is not the \nbest of what the Senate ought to be offering the American people.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  So, Mr. President, with that in mind, I will make a point of order, \nand let me state the point of order. Section 5001 of the conference \nreport contains matter that was not in either the House bill nor the \nSenate bill. Rule XXVIII, paragraph 2 of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate states that ``conferees shall not insert in their report matter \nnot committed to them by either House.'' Pursuant to rule XXVIII, I \nmake a point of order against section 5001 of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, before I formally make that point of order, let me say \nthat those who will respond to the point of order saying, ``Oh, gosh, \nthis will kill the bill,'' are wrong. This will not kill the bill. We \nhave waited on this bill month after month after month after month. It \nis a good bill, and it has a lot to commend it. All stripping out the \n$2 billion item that was added in the legislative darkness at the end \nof this conference would do would be to require the conference to \nreconvene, take that portion out, and ship it back to the House and \nSenate. You might say the House is not in today, and that is correct. \nSo it might take a couple of days. But this would not kill the bill. \nThose who will argue that it will kill the bill will argue something \nthat is specious.\n  Let us decide as a Senate that this is not the way to do serious tax \npolicy. This bill is too good for this provision. This is a set of \ncircumstances where the chairman of the committee brings a bill to the \nfloor, which causes me to commend him for the work he has done. I did \nthat at the start of my discussion. But it is a bill that contains a \nprovision that should never have been part of this bill.\n  I recognize that the chairman of the committee and the ranking member \nwere not the authors. At least from press reports I believe they were \nnot the authors of this legislation added in conference. I fully \nunderstand that some things are not necessarily within their control, \nas conferences work.\n  But I still feel strongly that this provision should not remain in \nthe bill and, for that reason, Mr. President, I make the point of order \nunder rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is constrained by the precedent of \nOctober 3, 1996, not to sustain the point of order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In that event, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I do not wish to unnecessarily prolong the \ndebate, but I would like to remind the Senate of the process by which \nthe 18-month holding period became law. The 18-month holding period \narose from the final negotiations between the congressional leadership \nand the administration on the conference agreement to the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997. The 18-month holding period was not in either the \nHouse or the Senate bill. No House or Senate Member proposed this \nadditional holding period. No hearing was held on its tax policy or \ncompliance implications.\n  Therefore, from the standpoint of process, today, we are reversing \nwhat was done about 1 year ago. In this conference agreement, we are \neliminating a provision that was added in conference, a provision that \nwas itself not contained in any House or Senate bill before its \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, the most important factor to consider is this. If the \npoint of order succeeds, the IRS conference report falls. All of the \nmeritorious provisions that Members have addressed will also fall. One \nof the best chances to reform the IRS in over 40 years could well be \nlost if the appeal of the Chair's ruling succeeds. No one can guarantee \nwhat would happen if the distinguished Senator from North Dakota would \nprevail. Therefore, Mr. President, I move to table the motion made by \nthe Senator from North Dakota, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the----\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not debatable.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be allowed to speak for 3 minutes in response to the \nremarks by our chairman, the Senator from Delaware, and that the \nchairman,\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\nin turn, have 3 minutes, and that these two 3-minute speeches be the \nonly comments made before we proceed to a vote on the motion to sustain \nthe ruling.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had come down to join the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. I will not take more than a few minutes, but I \nwanted to speak on this. I don't mean to complicate matters, but I came \ndown to speak on this question.\n  Mr. ROTH. I must object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have to say to my friend from \nMinnesota that we entered into a very special arrangement to have the \ntwo comments and no more. And the chairman feels that if there were to \nbe one more allowed that it would extend indefinitely. And the \nagreement having been reached, I feel that we will not be able to.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I regret objecting then, because I \ndon't quite understand why it would be that we wouldn't want to have a \ndiscussion, I think, on the issue that my colleague raised, and as a \nSenator I certainly want to speak on it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I didn't know of any intention of delaying this. I don't \nthink it would be a problem giving a couple of minutes to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. I know he spoke earlier on the floor on the subject. As \nfar as I am concerned, we are almost ready for a vote, except that the \ntabling motion came almost immediately. My appeal of the ruling of the \nChair is a debatable motion, and the Senator from Delaware moved almost \nimmediately to table, which prevented this from being a significant \ndebate. That is the Senator s right, and I made my comments. But I \nwanted to respond briefly to the comments the Senator from Delaware \nmade. I mean it seems to me that it wouldn't be a problem if I am \nallowed to speak for 3 minutes and the Senator from Delaware and the \nSenator from Minnesota for a couple of minutes, and we can have a vote. \nIt seems to me to be quicker to get it done that way.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I amend my unanimous consent request to have 2 minutes \nfor the Senator from North Dakota, two 2 minutes for the Senator from \nMinnesota, and no other speakers other than the chairman.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just a \nminute, the Senator from North Dakota can have the 4 minutes, and we \nwill go forward. I did speak earlier. People will be accountable on the \nvote. The discussion is taking place. We can come back to it if we need \nto come back to it. My colleague has been taking the leadership on \nthis. Just go ahead.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me go ahead, and if that consent is \nagreed to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Point of order.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes, the \nSenator from Delaware has 4 minutes, and no other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are never going to be accused of \nlegislative speeding around here. It is fascinating to me that this \nbill has been kicking around for what, 10 months or so? And all of a \nsudden in the last couple of minutes we are dealing with $1 billion a \nminute, if I get 2 minutes. If I get $1 billion a minute, and he gets \n$1 billion a minute, it is a $2 billion tax break provided in the \nclosing minutes of a conference report. Gosh. Month after month after \nmonth has gone by. Then all of sudden we have to get to the \nintersection in a nanosecond.\n  That is fine. Some days I might have objected, but I am in such an \nawfully good mood today that I am persuaded to speak for 2 or 3 minutes \nand then sit down.\n  First point: It is not going to kill the bill if we dump a $2 billion \nprovision stuck in the middle of this piece of legislation by folks \nthat didn't want a debate on it, didn't want votes in the House or the \nSenate on it. Getting rid of that provision won't kill the bill. Do not \nbe fooled by that. Nobody is talking about killing this bill. We are \njust talking about taking a sow's ear out of this bill. You know the \nold saying in my area, which is farm country, ``You can't make a silk \npurse out of a sow's ear.'' There is nothing in this provision that you \ncan make a silk purse out of, I guarantee you.\n  This was not done in the regular way. The chairman indicated the 18-\nmonth holding period came not from the House or Senate. It came as part \nof a deal made by the White House and legislative leaders. That is \ntrue. That was a deal. It was a deal with respect to changing tax \npolicy, and there was a lot of negotiation going on back and forth.\n\n  That was a tax bill. That was a big tax bill. This is an IRS \nrestructuring bill. All of a sudden, you have substantive changes in \ntax policy with no debate. That is the point I am making.\n  Finally, it makes sense, in my judgment, to move in the direction of \nincentives for long-term holdings, not short-term holdings. That is \nprecisely what the 18-month-rule did. It says there is a benefit to \nholding investments for the long term. Those who think in the longer \nterm invest in the longer term. That is precisely what builds this \ncountry.\n  But today we hear people say let's go back to the shorter term, let's \nthink short-term, and let's provide big tax breaks to upper-income \npeople who think that way. Those that have a couple hundred thousand \ndollars a year or more, if they will just think in the shorter term \nthey get a big tax break.\n  You talk about marching in the wrong direction. Get some drums and \nbugles here and just quicken the cadence. This doesn't make any sense \nat all.\n  The reason I appeal the ruling of the Chair is we never had a chance \nto debate this.\n  And I might add that the point of order that I raised would have been \nsustained prior to October 3, 1996, because for decades, going back to \nthe 1930s, the rule that I cited had force. ``Conferees shall not \ninsert in their report matter not committed to them by another House.'' \nThat rule of the Senate would have persuaded the Presiding Officer to \nrule in my favor.\n  But on October 3, 1996, the Senate did something, in my judgment, \nthat was very ill-advised. It overturned a ruling by the Chair, and we \nforever changed this rule until the Senate votes to change it back. \nThis would be a good opportunity to do that, because this is precisely \nthe kind of mischief--$2 billion worth of mischief--that occurs in a \nconference committee with an item that was never in the House bill, \nnever in the Senate bill, never debated, and never voted on. But here \nwe find it folded neatly between the covers of this bill, which was \nsupposed to have dealt with IRS restructuring.\n  You got $2 billion you want to use for something. I say to Members of \nthe Senate, you got $2 billion you want to use for something. What is \nyour priority? What is your priority? To search out those with $200,000 \nor more in income and say, ``You know what you need. You need a tax \ncut, and that is the priority of the U.S. Senate. It is the priority of \nthe U.S. House.'' Boy. I don't think that would match the priority most \npeople would want to expose in the middle of the day here in the Senate \nin a debate.\n  So that is the reason I have asked for this vote.\n  Once again, I appreciate the Senator from Delaware and the work he \nhas done. Much of what is in this piece of legislation I commend. It \nhas great merit, but this provision should never have been stuck in \nthat bill. I think everybody in the Senate knows it.\n  If we will vote to overturn the ruling of the Chair, we will solve \nthis problem without killing the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time does the Senator from \nNorth Dakota have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He consumed all of his time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me emphasize what I said earlier, that \nif his appeal should be sustained, there is no\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\nquestion but what it kills the conference report. That is a matter of \ngreat seriousness. For no one can guarantee, if we go back to the \nconference table, what will come out of that negotiation. I can assure \nmy friends on both sides of the aisle that I objected and fought many \nother provisions, some of which I think they would feel just as \nstrongly about, if not more strongly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Is it not the case that once a House passes a \nconference report the conference committee is dissolved?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. So it no longer exists. So we would have to create a \nnew one.\n  Mr. ROTH. We would have to create a new one. The distinguished \nSenator is absolutely correct.\n  The other point I want to make, Mr. President, is that the 18-month \nholding period resulted from exactly the same process to which the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota is objecting. But I recall no \none from that side of the aisle objecting to the 18 months on the same \ngrounds that it is objecting to the reduction of 12 months.\n  So, again, what I am saying is that we are correcting something that \nwas done a year ago. And for that reason, I must urge that----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. I will not yield for any more time.

Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to commend the chairman and ranking \nmember for the excellent job that has been done on the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act. The conferees have taken very \ngood ideas and have made the strongest possible bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator deserves to be heard. May we \nhave order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If anybody wishes to speak, they may after the \nSenator from Missouri, but at the present time, he is speaking.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I have a loud voice, but \nnot that loud, and I appreciate the chance to share my thoughts with my \ncolleagues.\n  As I was saying, this measure is very important for the citizens of \nthis country, all across the Nation. We have not only seen and heard of \nthe abuses that were brought out before the Finance Committee, but I \nthink each one of us in our home States has heard the concerns \nexpressed. This is the time now for us to move forward, for the Senate \nto add its voice and pass this bill for America's taxpayers.\n  This is a historic opportunity to make some far-reaching changes in \nthe operation of the Internal Revenue Service to strengthen taxpayers' \nrights. I believe the conferees have delivered, and it is now up to us \nto deliver. For too long, taxpayers have had to put up with poor \nservice from the IRS, often to the tune of larger tax bills because of \ninterest and penalties that accrue during the lengthy delays caused by \nthe IRS in settling the disputes.\n  For my part, I have asked people across Missouri for their \nsuggestions on how to fix the IRS and protect taxpayers' rights. And as \nchairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have also asked small \nbusinesses to give me their ideas. We have had hundreds of people who \nhave taken the time and made the effort to share their views with us.\n  I introduced a measure, called Putting Taxpayers First, in February. \nIn that measure, we proposed things that are included in this \nconference report:\n  No. 1, a requirement that the IRS restructure its operations to serve \nspecific groups of taxpayers with similar needs, like individuals, \nsmall businesses, the self-employed, and corporations;\n  No. 2, greater due process protections for taxpayers to guard against \nunreasonable seizures by the IRS;\n  No. 3, expansion of the current attorney-client privilege of \nconfidentiality to cover accountants and other tax practitioners who \nprovide tax advice;\n  No. 4, reform of the penalty and interest rules so they do not stand \nin the way of taxpayers who try to settle their accounts and get on \nwith their lives;\n  No. 5, clarification that a taxpayer may recover attorney's fees and \ncosts when the IRS discloses information about the taxpayer without \npermission and when an IRS employee improperly browses a taxpayer's \nrecords.\n  In addition, I am delighted to see: A requirement that the IRS \nestablish an independent appeals process for taxpayers; a prohibition \nagainst the IRS contacting third parties, such as a business's \ncustomers or suppliers, without notifying the taxpayer first; \nimprovements to the offer-in-compromise program; and prohibition on \ncommunications between an appeals officer and the IRS auditor or \ncollection agent handling the case without permitting the taxpayer to \nbe present.\n  These are some of the abuses that we can and we will deal with in \nthis bill.\n  During the floor consideration in the Senate, I worked with Senator \nMoseley-Braun on an amendment which would provide clear direction that \nthe IRS expansion of electronic filing of tax and information returns \nwill be voluntary and not another Government mandate on the taxpayers \nof America. I am sorry that the conference agreement omitted this \nimportant provision, but rest assured that we will be keeping a careful \neye on the IRS to ensure that Americans use electronic filing because \nit is simple, convenient, and easy to do so, not because they are \nforced to do so.\n\n  While our ultimate goal must be simpler and less burdensome tax law, \ntaxpayers need help today when dealing with the IRS. Like the bill \nintroduced earlier this year, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act \nprovides that help by putting America's taxpayers first.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the good work and the effort that has \ngone into this, the many people who have taken a lead in sponsorship of \nthis, and the\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\nwork that has been done in the committees. I know that the big \nchallenge will lie ahead of us in the next couple years to embark upon \na full-fledged reform of the IRS Code. That is the next step. But today \nwe are taking the very first step.\n  When I first argued for this bill, and pointed out that common \ncriminals had more rights than taxpayers, my colleague from Texas asked \nif we really wanted to treat taxpayers like common criminals. And the \nanswer is, we certainly do not want to treat them worse. This at least \ngives the American taxpayers the rights that all citizens should have \nin the United States. And we believe that it will end abuses in the IRS \nwithout curtailing the IRS' ability--an important responsibility--to \ncollect the taxes that are owed.\n  I commend the measure, and I thank the leaders on both sides. I hope \nthat we can adopt the measure and send it to the President without \nfurther delay or distraction.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief, but I did want to \nrecognize the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member \nfor the tremendous work they have done on this bill to reform the IRS. \nMany of my colleagues have come to the floor today to speak about the \nreforms embodied in H.R. 2676.\n  While the House moved very rapidly, the Senate engaged in a more \ndeliberative process, appropriately, and reviewed in greater depth, in \ngreat detail, the changes we believed would be necessary. We did not \nwant to make symbolic changes in the IRS, but wanted to change the very \nculture, the very thinking of the IRS, the way it functions, the way it \ntreats the taxpayers of this country.\n  I have been in the Congress of the United States now a few years. And \nnot by my vote, but by the collective vote of past Congresses, we have \nseen the Internal Revenue Code expand and expand and become more \ncomplicated. And every time the government decided it needed more \nmoney, it hired more IRS agents. Control spending? No. Demand a leaner, \nmore efficient bureaucracy? No. Review policies and repeal or reform \nuneconomic ones? No. Raise taxes and encourage the tax collector to \nsqueeze the taxpayer harder--that was the way 40 years of liberal \nCongresses claimed they were addressing the fiscal problems of our \ncountry.\n  So the IRS was an agency that Congress created and allowed to grow. \nAnd as the Tax Code became more complicated, the agency became larger, \nand by its very character it became a much more complicated and \ndemanding agency.\n  Times have changed. I believe we are able to bring about reform of \nthe IRS today for a variety of reasons, not just because we discovered \nabuses, but also because this Congress is committed to downsizing, to \nright-sizing, Government. For the first time, we are talking, not about \nbudget deficits, but about surpluses. For the first time, we are \nsucceeding in our efforts to create a less intrusive IRS. In fact, we \nare talking about tax reform, not in some symbolic way, but \nfundamentally changing the way we tax the American people are asked to \npay for the Government services and programs for which they ask. That \nis why we are able to be here today in a bipartisan mode, to talk about \nthe changes that are embodied in this very, very significant document.\n  So, I honor my chairman and ranking member here today, and my \ncolleagues, who have stood forthright on this issue. When a citizen of \nour country, a taxpayer, receives a letter from the IRS, and it goes on \nthe dinner table, with the family fearful to open it because they do \nnot know what is inside, they are fearful there may be an audit \nannounced, or that somehow they failed to comply with the code that is \nso complicated that they and their tax accountant, or even a tax \nattorney, cannot understand it. It is wrong for Americans to live in \nfear of their government like that. That bleak day is ending. The \nCongress well ought to have responded long ago to sense of dread on the \npart of American families. Some of us tried to. Because no American \ncitizen, no taxpayer ought to fear their Government.\n  Without question, taxpayers have feared the IRS. Some of that will \nnow change as the reforms embodied in this conference report are \nimplemented and become functional, and as they are carried out in the \nregulation and enforcement process.\n  Two hundred twenty-two years ago, the American Revolution began, in \nlarge part, over an oppressive tax system. Today, for the first time in \ntwo hundred years, the Congress is taking significant power away from \nthe tax collector and giving it back to the taxpayer. Today we reverse \ndirection on a two hundred-year trend. Today we keep faith with the \nspirit that has been at the core American values and traditions from \nthe start. Today, the Congress is taking long-overdue action to restore \nsome of the liberty that an insatiable government has spent years \neroding.\n  But the day of change is not over, nor should it be. I, like others, \nbelieve we should move now to significantly change our country's \nInternal Revenue Code. The tax laws of our country should not be used \nfor social engineering, nor should they be designed in such a way to \ntempt and enable legislators and bureaucrats to manipulate social \npolicy in this country, to decide for the taxpayers what is good for \nthem, and to use the tax code and the IRS to force them to behave \naccordingly. That impulse for social engineering, directed from a \nWashington, DC, that thought it was all-knowing, is what grew the tax \ncode and gave the IRS its power. Decades of tax-and-spend Congress \nempowered and encouraged the tax collector to step outside the due \nprocess Americans expect in every other encounter with their \ngovernment, and went about structuring social policy through tax law; \nand they gained power and they gained control.\n  Today, we make a first step. This reform bill is an important symbol, \nbut it is more than symbolic. It is the first installment on our \ncommitment to do more. I believe if we restructure the tax code by \nreforming it in a significant way, by simplifying it and restoring a \nsense of freedom and fairness, we can come back to the very agency we \nare changing today and restructure it once again, because: As goes the \ncode, so goes the character of the tax collector.\n  So once again, I stand, like many of my colleagues do today, ready to \nvote for this conference report as a major first step in doing what the \nAmerican taxpayer has said needs to be done for a long while and maybe \nlessening the fear that the taxpayer has of their Government and of the \nIRS just a little bit.\n  I hope that we will return next year--in the very next year--not only \nto review the work we have done here but to reform the tax code in a \nmore significant way and once again improve the tax collecting agency \nof our country, the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am so pleased we are finally acting to \nsend this bill to the President. This important legislation has been \ndelayed long enough. It has been over a year since the Kerrey/Portman \nIRS Reform Commission reported their findings to Congress and the \nAmerican people. The Commission's report was extremely clear. The IRS \nhad become a monster agency feared by law abiding citizens. It acted \nwith total disregard for the rights of American taxpayers and ruled not \nthrough law or practice, but fear and fear alone.\n  I urge swift Senate action on the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. The American people cannot \nafford any further delay or political grandstanding. The House passed \ntheir bill on November 5, 1997 and we passed a reform bill on May 7, \n1998. We should have been acting on a final conference report months \nago. Unfortunately, despite the extensive analysis contained in the \nKerrey/Portman Commission's report, some in Congress chose to engage in \npartisan politics using IRS abuses as a mechanism for talking about the \nevils of ``big government.'' The American taxpayer deserved better.\n  The problems at the IRS are not about ``big government'' but rather \nan agency with a conflicting mission and little guidance from Congress. \nIn each Congress, new and in some cases sweeping changes in the tax \ncode are enacted\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\ninto law. The IRS must then swiftly implement these complex and \ndifficult changes in the tax code. Excessive contracting restrictions \nand little managerial oversight results in an actions that border on \nthe extreme.\n  I am pleased to have supported historic taxpayer Bill of Rights \nprovisions in the 1993 deficit reduction plan. But, it became obvious \nfrom the Kerrey/Portman Commission report that additional taxpayer \nprotection reforms were necessary. We could no longer allow the agency \nto rule by fear. American taxpayers should not fear challenging any \ndecision made by the IRS. This should be the right of every American to \nchallenge any decision by any federal agency. If an individual feels \nthat the Social Security Administration erred in denying benefits, this \nindividual can challenge this decision without fear of retaliation. No \none should ever fear challenging the decision of any federal agency. \nBut, sadly this had become the case with the IRS.\n  Many taxpayers simply were convinced that they had no choice but to \nsubmit and pay the often times excessive penalties and interest \ndemanded by the agency. There simply was no assumption of innocence.\n  Taxpayers need this bill. This is not about those who do not honor \ntheir financial responsibilities. It is about protecting those that \nvoluntarily pay their fair share. It is also about providing guidance \nto the agency responsible for implementing the laws that we pass. It is \nabout leveling the playing field to ensure that taxpayers have the same \nrights and protections when dealing with the IRS.\n\n  The conference report adopts many of the provisions included in S. \n1096, the original Kerrey/Grassley IRS reform bill which I cosponsored \nshortly after it was introduced. These provisions are essential if we \ntruly hope to reform the IRS. The legislation will shift the burden of \nproof in many of the cases in U.S. Tax Court from the taxpayer to the \nIRS. Under current law, it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to \ndisprove any charges brought by the IRS. This is counter to criminal \nlaw and makes it difficult for a taxpayer to disprove charges brought \nby an agency without almost unlimited resources. The legislation also \nmitigates interest charges and penalties for some tax cases. No longer \nwith the interest charges and penalties significantly amount to more \nthan that total taxes owned the IRS.\n  The conference report also includes new restrictions on the ability \nof the IRS to seize property. Too many times overzealous actions by the \nIRS resulted in the seizure of a business or the home devastating \nworking families and leaving no means to repay taxes owed. What is even \nmore outrageous is I have heard of cases where decisions to seize \nproperty were later overturned. The seizure of one's economic security \ncannot be part of a normal enforcement strategy for the IRS. It must be \nan extreme and final solution, not simply a compliance mechanism.\n  I am also pleased that the final agreement maintains an independent \nboard to oversee actions within the agency. I have heard from many IRS \nemployees about internal problems that create major obstacles to \nreform. An independent board drawing from the private and public \nsectors will provide some real strategic planning assistance for the \nCommissioner. It also ensures effective citizen oversight.\n  The IRS needs to put the idea of service back into the Internal \nRevenue Service. Its mission must be to serve the public and provide a \ncooperative environment for those voluntarily complying with their \nfinancial obligation.\n  The legislation will make a difference. No longer will a convicted \ncriminal have more rights and protections than an honest taxpayer \nchallenging the IRS. We should have acted many months ago. Every day \nthe Republicans delayed this bill in the Senate resulted in more \ntaxpayer abuses. More fear and more abuse. Today's actions will make \nsure this all stops.\n  Currently, honest taxpayers and business pay an average of $1,600 per \nperson for those who do not meet their financial obligations. An \nestimated $120 billion a year goes uncollected by the IRS. We should be \ndoing more to encourage more Americans to come forward and meet their \nobligations. But, so many taxpayers have simply given up. There is \nwide-spread belief that you cannot find fairness or respect at the IRS.\n  We need to give the IRS the tools and the guidance to bring respect \nback to the IRS. If we want American taxpayers to respect their \ngovernment we must ensure that they are treated with respect and \ndignity. The legislation we are not considering meets this test.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting effective and \ncomprehensive IRS reform and restructuring.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am gratified that the Senate finally has \nbefore it today the final language of The Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) Restructuring and Reform Act. I continue to support this bill, \nwhich has been making its way through the Congress for many months and \nwhich is long overdue. I commend Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for \ntheir conscientious work on this legislation. I also commend Senator \nGrassley and Senator Kerrey for introducing the original IRS reform \nbill, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters who support the reining in of the \nIRS. They want the IRS to be more responsive to their questions and \nmore respectful of their rights, and that is exactly what they deserve \nfrom their government. I will be pleased to return home and tell \nVermonters that the Senate has acted in their interests and passed \nlegislation that will make the IRS more responsive to the average \ntaxpayer and that gives the average taxpayer more rights when dealing \nwith the IRS.\n  This bipartisan legislation will bring many significant reforms into \nreality, including:\n  Burden of Proof. The burden of proof is on the IRS in all court cases \nfor tax years beginning after the date of enactment of this bill.\n  Innocent Spouse Relief. Innocent spouses and former spouses will no \nlonger be held responsible for tax liabilities incurred by the other \nspouse.\n  Interest and Penalties. If the IRS fails to notify the taxpayer of a \ndelinquency within 18 months, the taxpayer will not be held responsible \nfor penalties and interest accrued during that time.\n  IRS Accountability. IRS employees will be held more accountable for \ntheir actions and advancement will be based on a system of merit.\n  Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics. $6 million will be provided in matching \ngrants to establish taxpayer clinics to provide tax assistance to low-\nincome taxpayers.\n  Oversight Board. A nine-member IRS Oversight Board will be \nestablished. This board will consist of the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe Commissioner of the IRS, a representative of IRS employees or a \nfull-time Federal employee, and six members from the private sector.\n  Collections. This bill establishes formal procedures to ensure due \nprocess for any liens or levies placed on a taxpayer.\n  Confidential Communications. Privileged communications will be \nexpanded to include tax advice between an accountant or tax advisor and \na taxpayer.\n  I am also pleased that two amendments offered by Senator Ashcroft and \nmyself have been retained in the final conference report. One \namendment, based on our bill, the Taxpayer Internet Assistance Act of \n1998, requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with speedy access to tax \nforms, publications and other published guidance via the Internet. This \nlegislation provides for online posting of documents created during the \nmost recent five years.\n  The second amendment requires the IRS to treat an electronically \nauthenticated document the same as a paper document. This is required \nas more and more people file their returns online and use electronic \nsignatures. This bill will ensure that people who use an electronic \nsignature will have no less or no greater status in the tax context \nthan those using a physical signature. By retaining these two \namendments, the Senate is recognizing the importance of the Internet \nand its potential to give taxpayers greater access to information and \nservice.\n  In addition, Senator Russ Feingold and I introduced the Equal Access \nto Justice for Taxpayers Act of 1998, S. 1612. Under current law, many \ntaxpayers are unable to recover their legal\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\nfees and other costs when the IRS takes unjust actions against them. \nOur bill would modify the Equal Access to Justice Act to give taxpayers \nthe same rights as other citizens to fight unjust governmental action. \nProvisions similar to the Equal Access to Justice for Taxpayers Act \nwere included in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act.\n  The bipartisan bill before us will institute a wide range of \nconstructive and sensible steps to reshape the IRS and to improve the \nway it deals with the American taxpayers they are intended to serve.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act.\n  Mr. President, the people of this nation have watched as Congress has \nfinally taken serious strides toward the reform of our federal tax \ncollection arm--the Internal Revenue Service. They have watched and \nthey have waited because they know that meaningful changes in the way \nin which we collect income taxes in this country is sorely needed and \nlong overdue.\n  Well, today we have an opportunity to send to the President a reform \npackage that is not only meaningful, but one that will strike at the \nheart of some of the most serious abuses exemplified by some of the \nreal-life horror stories we've all heard over the past few months.\n  Indeed, the Senate Finance Committee in their hearings during the \npast year uncovered an agency that, in many instances, simply ran \nroughshod over taxpayers rights and the IRS' very own rules.\n  Agents misused files, violated privacy, made arbitrary decisions \nconcerning the payment of delinquent taxes, demoted those who sought to \nreport improper tactics. They were evaluated on statistics based on \nseizures of personal property and finances; they lied and misled the \npublic. In short, the high level of trust that must exist when people's \nprivacy, dignity, and very livelihood are at stake had disintegrated \ninto a quagmire of duplicity and dishonesty.\n  Now, that's not to say that everyone at the IRS engages in such \ndubious practices. I have no doubt that the majority of Americans who \nwork for the IRS are attempting to do an often unpleasant and thankless \njob with integrity and the best interests of the taxpayers at heart.\n  Unfortunately, as is always the case, it is the transgressions of the \nfew that foster the decay of the whole. In fact, I'm sure that the \nmajority of the honest, hardworking people of the IRS would welcome a \ncleanup of the system just as much as any American taxpayer.\n  This conference report provides such relief from the practices of the \npast and is a giant step forward in rebuilding the trust that has \nslowly but steadily been eroded over the years. It provides $12.9 \nbillion over the next 10 years for reforms, which will include an \noversight board to keep careful watch over the management and \nadministration of the IRS. It shifts the burden of proof from the \ntaxpayer to the IRS, where it belongs. It provides relief for divorced \nor separated spouses who unwittingly become embroiled in the tax \nliabilities of their estranged husbands or wives. It requires the IRS \nto report annually to Congress regarding employee misconduct. In short, \nit helps put government back in the hands of those it is supposed to \nserve.\n  We still have a long way to go in terms of simplifying our tax \nsystem--something we must do if we are to follow through on our promise \nto not only reduce the burdens of our archaic tax structure but to \nreduce instances of abuse. So, even with the passage of this \nlegislation, our work will be far from done. But this bill will create \na more level playing field between the IRS and taxpayers, and it will \nmake the IRS more accountable to the American taxpayer. As I said when \nI spoke on this issue in May, the issue comes down to trust. The people \nof this nation must be able to trust that their government will be \nfair, will be discreet, will be responsive. Taxpayers should not fear \nthe very institutions that are supposed to be serving them.\n  The House put their overwhelming stamp of approval on their version \nof the legislation with a 426 to 4 vote, and passed the conference \nreport 402-8. In the Senate, there was not one vote against the measure \nwhen we last considered it. It's now time that we send this bill to the \nPresident with the message that it has strong, bipartisan backing in \nCongress and the overwhelming support of the American people. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting for this Reform Act and putting \n``service'' back into the IRS.\n\n\n                    technical corrections to tea-21\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Subtitle A of title IX of the conference \nreport on H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, contains a \nnumber of technical corrections to the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe Twenty-first Century (TEA-21). This subtitle is essentially \nidentical to H.R. 3978, which passed the House by voice vote but has \nbeen held up in the Senate due to objections chiefly over provisions \nconcerning Veterans smoking benefits.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus my remarks on the technical \ncorrections to title VIII of TEA-21. This title of the transportation \nbill did two things. First, it provided roughly $17.5 billion in \noffsets to pay for the cost of the additional highway and transit \nspending in TEA-21. With respect to the offsets in TEA-21, the \ntechnical corrections in this conference report make a number of \nchanges in the Veterans provisions which will provide a net $959 \nmillion increase in Veterans spending as a result of correcting a \ndrafting errors in TEA-21.\n  This technical corrections bill modifies provisions in TEA-21 that \ninadvertently labeled smoking an act of willful misconduct on the part \nof the veteran. Further, this bill reverses provisions included in TEA-\n21 that extended the change in compensation law to include those people \nwho are currently serving in the military or have recently left the \nservice but are still within certain statutory presumptive periods \nwhere any illness is presumed to be service connected. The technical \ncorrection also clarifies that the grandfather clause will include \nthose veterans who have filed a claim before the enactment date, not \nonly those with adjudicated claims upon enactment. Finally, the \ncorrections bill adds a new section which extends the GI bill \nreimbursement increase to a veteran's survivor and dependents. This \nrate increase was intended to be included in the original bill but was \ninadvertently left out.\n  Second, TEA-21 established a rather elaborate regimen under our \nbudget laws to ensure a minimum amount of discretionary funding would \nbe set aside for highway and transit programs. The conference report on \nTEA-21 did not include an explanation of the budget process changes in \ntitle VIII and I did not have a chance to discuss these changes in \ndetail when we considered the conference report on TEA-21.\n\n\n               TEA-21's Highway and Transit ``Firewalls''\n\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 extended through 2002 the spending \nlimits, or caps, on spending provided in the annual appropriations \nprocess, what we call ``discretionary'' spending. The Balanced Budget \nAct also provided separate limits on defense, nondefense, and violent \ncrime discretionary spending, which are frequently referred to as \n``firewalls''. These separate spending limits, or firewalls, \neffectively segregate a specified amount of spending for defense and \nviolent crime reduction.\n  Highways and transit spending are considered nondefense discretionary \nspending and must compete with other programs under the nondefense \ndiscretionary cap. While the Balanced Budget Act made transportation \nspending a priority, there was a strong desire to provide a means to \nallow the taxes collected by the Highway Trust Fund to be made \navailable for highway spending. The House-passed transportation bill \ntook highways off-budget. The Senate developed a mechanism in the \nbudget resolution to direct savings from reductions in direct spending \nprograms to the Appropriations Committees to pay for increased \ntransportation spending.\n  Trying to find a mechanism to provide a guarantee for discretionary \nspending for highways without breaking the budget proved to be one of \nthe more difficult tasks for the conferees on the transportation bill. \nWe ended up with a complicated mechanism that kept highways and transit \nfunding subject to the appropriations process, the budget process, and \nthe discretionary caps.\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\n  Subtitle A of Title VIII of TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act to establish new categories on highway \nand transit spending at outlay levels for certain programs in TEA-21. \nThe Act also made reductions to the nondefense discretionary limits by \nan amount equal to OMB's estimate of base level of funding for these \nprograms.\n  These highway and transit categories are very similar to the current \ndefense and violent crime categories in the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act with two notable exceptions. Unlike the \ndefense or crime caps, TEA-21 amended section 250(c) of the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to add a special rule that \nprovides that any spending in excess of the highway and transit limits \nbe charged to the nondefense discretionary or discretionary spending \nlimits.\n  Next, TEA-21 amended section 251(b)(1) of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act to provide for two adjustment to the \nhighway outlay limits and one adjustment for the transit outlay limit.\n  One of our objectives in TEA-21 was to ensure that highway revenues \nwould be spent. To meet this objective, the first adjustment ensures \nthe highway outlay limit fluctuates with changes in gasoline tax \nlevels. The highway spending levels and the outlay limits established \nby TEA-21 are based on the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) February \n1998 estimates of tax revenues to the highway trust fund. To the extent \nactual revenue levels are different than these 1998 estimated levels or \nthe Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) updated estimates for the \nbudget year is different than these levels, OMB is required to adjust \nhighway obligation levels in TEA-21. Next, OMB is required to calculate \nthe outlay changes that would result from the change in the obligation \nlevels and adjust the highway outlay limits by that amount.\n  A second concern was raised that purely technical changes in outlay \nestimates could cause the highway or transit outlay limits to be \nexceeded. The second adjustment TEA-21 added to section 251(b)(1) of \nthe Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act was to provide \nadjustments to the highway and transit outlay limits due to purely \ntechnical estimating changes. This was a challenge to draft because it \nis difficult to distinguish between changes in outlays for technical as \ncompared to policy reasons. Under this second adjustment, OMB is \nrequired to estimate the outlays that would result from TEA-21 in its \nfinal sequester report this fall. Each year, as part of the President's \nbudget submission, OMB is required to update its estimate of the \noutlays resulting from TEA-21 and adjust the outlay limits by any \nchange in outlays due to technical re-estimates.\n  On this technical adjustment for outlays, our intent is that OMB only \nadjust the outlay limits because of purely technical estimating \nchanges. To the extent Congress makes changes in the appropriations \nprocess or takes other actions in legislation that effect the level of \noutlays for highways or transit, the resulting change in outlays should \nbe absorbed by the respective limits and OMB should make no adjustments \nto those limits.\n  Mr. President, section 251(b)(1)(D)(ii) is vague with respect to how \nOMB is to adjust the estimate it is required to make pursuant to clause \n(i) in this fall's final sequester report of the outlays resulting from \nTEA-21. Our intent is that OMB adjust this estimate of outlays by the \nadjustments it will make to the outlay limits pursuant to subparagraphs \n(B) (to align spending with revenues) and (C) (adjustments for \ntechnical outlay re-estimates).\n  Mr. President, the highway and transit firewalls we established in \nTEA-21 was a compromise with the House and the Administration. I would \nhave preferred a much simpler and much less rigid approach. I am \nparticularly concerned, and share the concerns of the distinguished \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee, that these new firewalls \nunnecessarily impinge on the appropriations process. Finally, I am \ntroubled by the complexity of this mechanism and the reliance we have \nplaced on OMB estimates, particularly with respect to the adjustments \nallowed for the outlay limits.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, let me say this. Even with my \nreservations and concerns about our new discretionary firewalls and the \noutlay adjustments that will be made to them, I strongly support TEA-\n21. The conference report is the culmination of over 14 months of \neffort by many members of the House and Senate. Our compromise allows \nfor highway funds to once again be released to states and avoid delay \nin this year's construction season. Most importantly, TEA-21 provides \nincreased funding for our nation's infrastructure while maintaining \nfiscal discipline and our balanced budget. I support this bill and am \nproud to have played an integral role in its development.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, first I commend Finance Committee Chairman \nRoth, and my Finance Committee colleagues Senator Kerrey of Nebraska \nand Senator Grassley, for their invaluable contributions to this \nimportant step in cleaning up the IRS. The IRS reform bill that we are \nabout to pass would never have seen the light of day were it not for \nthe efforts of the IRS restructuring commission and the determined \nleadership of Chairman Roth, who presided over the first meaningful IRS \noversight hearings that this body has had in decades.\n  The IRS reform bill is a landmark achievement, a shot across the bow \nto the IRS letting them know that ``business as usual'' will no longer \nbe tolerated. But this bill--although it contains the largest \nassortment of taxpayer rights ever enacted into law, and reforms the \nIRS with such important innovations as the new Treasury Inspector \nGeneral for Tax Administration--is only the first step in a continuing \nprocess to curb the abuses of the IRS. More important than the new \ntaxpayer rights, more important than the procedural and structural \nreforms, is the process that we used to fashion this bill. Simply \nstated, the oversight power of the Congress is the single most powerful \ntool that we have to root out the abuses and injustices that have \nbecome ingrained in the corrupted culture of the IRS. I strongly \nsupport the concept of regular oversight hearings of the full Finance \nCommittee to make sure that past mistakes are corrected, that past \nmisconduct is punished, and that the attitude and modus operandi at the \nIRS are changed permanently.\n  The corrupt culture of the IRS can change only if the old regime at \nthe IRS is completely swept away. I am encouraged by the recent \nannouncement of a high-level resignation at the Service, in an office \nwhich seemed to be a black hole for disciplinary investigations \ncompleted against IRS officials. But one change in office is not \nenough. Our oversight hearings exposed a rogue agency that was \nliterally out of control. We heard testimony that armed agents use \nSWAT-team tactics to raid businesses, that IRS officials callously \nignored the life-threatening health problems of a taxpayer, that a \nsexual harasser was promoted to be national director of Equal \nEmployment Opportunity, and that statistics of property seizures were \nused to evaluate the performance of IRS employees.\n  Most incredible but all-too-believable was the story of one of my \nconstituents, an IRS employee who blew the whistle on a renegade \nspecial agent with a drinking and substance abuse problem. This \nrenegade agent had fabricated allegations of political corruption \nagainst several public officials, including the former Majority Leader \nof this body. This renegade was protected instead of punished by his \nsupervisors, and the IRS employees with the courage and public spirit \nto report the misconduct ended up being the targets of retaliation. In \nthis instance, as in most of the horror stories brought before the \nFinance Committee, the misconduct could not have occurred without the \nencouragement or acquiescence of IRS management. Yet, we were told that \none of the IRS managers responsible for this cover-up and retaliation \nwas still on the job.\n  Congress cannot let up on the IRS. We must follow through on the \nmisconduct exposed by the bright spotlight of our oversight hearings. I \nam calling on Commissioner Rossotti to testify again before the Finance \nCommittee, prior to the end of this legislative session, to bring us up \nto date on the disciplinary actions taken as a result of our hearings. \nHas the member of IRS management who covered up the\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\nscheme to frame Senator Howard Baker been fired? Have the IRS employees \nresponsible for the abuses of power recounted to the Finance Committee \nbeen identified and terminated? Have the members of IRS management who \ncondoned such behavior, or who ignored it through complete \nincompetence, been found and disciplined? We cannot fall into the trap \nof thinking that things are fixed at the IRS just because this reform \nbill will soon become law. The Senate has an obligation to continue its \nvigilance over the actions of the IRS, to follow through on the abuses \nthat have been exposed and root out those that perpetuate. Experience \nhas shown conclusively that the IRS cannot be trusted to police itself.\n\n  This IRS reform bill is a step in the right direction. The \ncomprehensive taxpayer bill of rights section is of the most value to \ntaxpayers, although it is my belief that these provisions could have \ngone further to strengthen the rights of our taxpayers. Unfortunately, \nunder our rules, overly aggressive and abusive IRS collections activity \nis apparently built into the budget baseline, and can only be redressed \nby raising new taxes as an offset. Any system that requires us to raise \ntaxes to replace money that the IRS picks from the pockets of our \ntaxpayers is a system that is broken and needs fixing.\n  I am particularly pleased that the provisions of my Taxpayer \nConfidentiality Act are included in the conference report. These \nprovisions afford uniform confidentiality protection to taxpayers for \nthe tax advice they receive from federally authorized tax practitioners \nin noncriminal matters before the IRS and during subsequent court \nproceedings. Under current law, communications between taxpayers and \nlawyers concerning tax advice can often be protected from disclosure to \nthe IRS by the common law attorney-client privilege, but communications \nwith other federally-authorized tax practitioners--certified public \naccountants, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, and attorneys \nproviding advice in the role of a tax practitioner--are not protected. \nThe new tax practitioner-client privilege eliminates this unfair \npenalty imposed on taxpayers based on their choice of tax advisor.\n  I am concerned, though, about an amendment to this provision that was \ninserted at the 11th hour while the bill was in conference. The \namendment was meant to target written promotional and solicitation \nmaterials used by the peddlers of corporate tax shelters, but appears \nto me to be vague and unfortunately employs an ambiguous definition of \ntax shelter that some argue could be read to include all tax planning.\n  I discussed the problems inherent in this last-minute attempt to \ncreate an exception for the marketing of corporate tax shelters in \nmeetings and discussions with the Majority Leader, Chairman Roth, their \ncounterparts in the House, and the Speaker. It was agreed that the \nlanguage would be clarified to alleviate these concerns and ensure that \nthe amendment does not cover routine tax advice and normal tax planning \ndesigned to minimize a corporation's federal tax liability. The \nlanguage of the conference report, however, could be interpreted in a \nmanner which does not fully reflect our understanding and thus \nundermines the intended benefit to taxpayers.\n  Our oversight hearings have given us ample reason not to trust the \nIRS to interpret this exception to the new privilege in a narrow \nmanner. Nor can taxpayers rely on timely clarification through judicial \ninterpretations, as these will be many years in the making. This is an \nitem we will have to address at the soonest possible instance, in the \nnext tax bill.\n  One excuse we often hear from apologists for the IRS is that our tax \nlaws are too complicated, and that this is the source of the tensions \nbetween taxpayers and the Service. I cannot accept this as the reason \nwhy armed raids are conducted on the homes and businesses of peaceful \ncitizens, or why laws and internal IRS rules are broken with gusto and \nimpunity. But it is true that the complexity of the code is a drain on \nthe resources of our taxpayers, and is one of the reasons I support tax \nreform. In this regard, it is a big relief to all taxpayers, big and \nsmall, young and old, that the provisions of my Capital Gains \nSimplification Act have been incorporated in the IRS reform bill. \nRestoring the 12-month holding period for long-term capital gains will \ndramatically reduce tax compliance costs, lessen the punitive lock-in \neffect on capital, and yield additional federal revenues in the first 2 \nyears.\n  There is one final point I would like to make concerning the IRS \nreform bill, as one of the primary advocates of the Sense of the Senate \nResolution and the moratorium on Notice 98-11 regulations. Notice 98-\n35, issued by Treasury to announce its intention to withdraw the \nproposed and temporary regulations issued under Notice 98-11, has \nraised some concern for high-tech industries. For instance, Notice 98-\n35 does not make clear the grandfather rules for licenses--it is \nimportant that this be clarified, as the income of many high tech \nbusinesses comes from royalties tied to licensing agreements. Also, the \nasset test described in Notice 98-35 may put high tech businesses at a \ndisadvantage--as the assets of high tech business consists mainly of \nintangible assets, which the Notice does not adequately take into \naccount. It is my hope that the Treasury Department will clarify these \nand other issues unique to high tech businesses.\n  Mr. President, final passage of the IRS reform bill is an important \nstep in the on-going process of reining in the IRS. Let no defender of \nthe status quo at the Service be mistaken on this point: This is the \nbeginning, not the end, of our reform efforts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the \nConference Report on the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This \nlegislation is a victory for the American taxpayer, and I applaud the \nwork of my colleagues, Senators Roth, Bob Kerrey, Grassley, and others, \nwho have demonstrated such determination, vision and leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  I believe that the average American taxpayer is fundamentally \nhonorable, willing to play by the rules and carry his or her fair share \nof public obligations. Most public servants at the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) perform their jobs responsibly. But, sadly, there are \nexceptions on both sides of this equation, and those exceptions lead to \ncontentious circumstances which must receive careful IRS management \nattention. Regrettably, that has too often not been forthcoming.\n  It is clear that the Internal Revenue Service is subject to some \ndifficult challenges. After downsizing in recent years, the remaining \nIRS agents are strained as they try to meet the demands of increased \naudit and collection work. The management structure within the IRS has \nmade these problems even more difficult to solve. Regardless of the \nreason, the abusive and humiliating tactics which were brought to light \nduring the Senate Finance Committee hearings are intolerable and must \nbe stopped. This legislation is an important step in the process of \nreinstituting control at the IRS.\n  I have previously supported reform efforts that were intended to make \ntax collection fairer, and the IRS more accountable. In 1988, I \ncosponsored the Taxpayers Bill of Rights which expanded the procedural \nand disclosure rights of taxpayers when dealing with the IRS, \nprohibited the use of collection results in IRS employee evaluations, \nand banned revenue collection quotas. During the 104th Congress, I \ncosponsored the Senate version of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights II, \nwhich created the Office of Taxpayer Advocate, allowed installment \npayments of tax liabilities of less than $10,000, and imposed \nnotification and disclosure requirements on the IRS. Last year, we \nenacted the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, which imposes civil and \ncriminal penalties on Federal employees who gain unauthorized access to \ntax returns and other taxpayer information.\n  The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 \nwill restructure and reorganize the Internal Revenue Service. It will \ncreate a new IRS Oversight Board to review and approve strategic plans \nand operational functions that are crucial to the future of the agency \nand will ensure the proper treatment of taxpayers by the IRS.\n  It would allow taxpayers to sue the IRS for up to $100,000 in civil \ndamages caused by negligent disregard of the law. It also expands the \nability of taxpayers to recover the costs of such litigation, including \nthe repeal of the ceiling on hourly attorneys' fees.\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\n  The Conference Report expands the protections provided to ``innocent \nspouses'' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties \nbecause of actions by their spouse about which they had no knowledge \nand could not have reasonably expected to know.\n  I remain concerned about the provision included in the Conference \nReport that shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in \ncourt if the taxpayer complies with the Internal Revenue Code and \nregulations, maintains required records and cooperates with IRS \nrequests for information. This provision could give comfort to a small \nnumber of Americans who will do anything to avoid paying their taxes \nbut may make the system of tax collection even more complicated.\n  I support the idea of expanding every American's ability to save for \nretirement and I was a cosponsor of the Roth IRA bill to promote \nsavings for every American. However, I am concerned that the proposed \nchanges to the IRS included in the Conference Report are being paid for \nnot by reducing spending or by eliminating an unnecessary corporate tax \nbreak, but instead by giving a tax reduction to allow some elderly \ntaxpayers to convert their existing Individual Retirement Accounts into \nRoth IRAs. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this tax \nchange will not provide enough revenue to cover the cost of IRS reform \nafter the year 2007. I would have preferred that a more suitable offset \nwere included to pay for the important changes in this Conference \nReport and I believe that this offset should have been included in a \ntax bill.\n  Americans merit an efficient and a respectful government. In the \ncourse of history, we have fought for freedom from despotic \nbureaucracies. At the essence of our democracy is our right to alter \nany public institution which fails significantly to deal respectfully \nand competently with American citizens. I believe the changes this \nlegislation will make will regain the balance that has been lost in the \nrelationship of the taxpayers to the IRS while permitting the IRS to do \nthe difficult job it was created to do.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank my \ncolleague, who has been waiting so patiently, for giving me the \nopportunity of sharing some thoughts with respect to the IRS reform \npackage. I assure you I will keep my remarks to a minimum.\n  But I would like to congratulate the manager of the bill, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and the ranking \nmember, my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, \nSenator Moynihan. They have done an outstanding job. I would like to \ncommend Senator Bob Kerrey for his work. His work truly has helped \nbring together the Senate and the Finance Committee in a way in which \nwe can pass this legislation that will be helping millions of taxpayers \nand change, I think, the culture--the culture--in which the IRS has \nbeen operating.\n  Indeed, the litany of witnesses and stories--anecdotal and \notherwise--that demonstrated that there seemed to be a pattern that \nnone of us could be proud of--the abuse of the little guy, not the big \ncorporate giant, but the small business entrepreneur, the average-day \ncitizen who lived in fear and, indeed, tyranny, and in some cases was \nrampant tyranny. And in no case was it worse than as it related to the \ninnocent spouse. And every year approximately 50,000 cases were opened. \nAnd the revenuer was after a spouse who had little, if anything, to do \nwith not paying their fair share of taxes--innocent of the fact--and in \n90 percent of the cases they were women. They signed a joint return, \nand in some cases didn't even sign a return. We had some cases where \ntheir signature was forged, but we were so desperate for money, they \nwere hunted down. Indeed, some had to give up their jobs and some had \nto live in fear, and some even left their spouses, their new spouses \nbecause they were afraid that the new spouse and his family would have \nthe revenue agent after them. Horrendous. Incredible.\n  I take this opportunity to salute a courageous person who came and \ntestified before our committee, a citizen of New York, Beth Cockrell, \nwho epitomized this tragedy and whose case went all the way up to the \nSupreme Court. And because of the manner in which the law was written, \nwhy, the court ruled against her. But nonetheless--nonetheless--she is \na person who was abused by the revenue code and the agents who pursued \nher.\n  Indeed, now they will be free, hundreds and hundreds of thousands--\nmostly women--who have lived for years with open cases against them, \nwho had accumulations of interest and penalties, in some cases that go \ninto the hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \ndollars, and they can hopefully now begin to resume a more normal life \nand clear away that pattern of abuse with which they have had to live. \nHundreds of thousands will be free. And, yes, tens of thousands on a \nregular basis no longer will have to face this because they were \nmarried, and someone--their mate--did not pay his or her proper taxes, \nthey were then held responsible. They would be totally innocent and \nunaware of this fact.\n\n  I have heard colleagues speak to many issues in terms of what this \nbill does. I think it is important so the culture, hopefully, will be \nchanged.\n  I think one of the most significant provisions, one that I was proud \nto author along with Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Moynihan, \nthe Innocent Spouse Relief Act of 1998, a bill that would give \nprotection to innocent spouses, and is supported by all of our \ncolleagues, will now be the law of the land, and those who are innocent \nwill no longer have to live in fear for the actions of someone else.\n  I thank my colleague for giving me this opportunity, Senator McCain \nof Arizona, to make these remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7643-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7668-S7670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our relationship with the People's \nRepublic of China is perhaps the most complex of any within the realm \nof foreign policy. Absent the scale of confrontation the United States \nexperienced with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, U.S. \ndiplomacy must, for the foreseeable future, walk a very fine line \nbetween cooperation and challenge with the world's most populous \nnation. The very nature of the Soviet threat provided a level of \nclarity absent in our attempts at formulating a long-term policy for \ndealing with China. There is no justification for a policy of \ncontainment when there is no reason to believe that Chinese foreign \npolicy is inherently expansionist. Indeed, there is no reason to \nbelieve that China's external ambitions extend beyond those with which \nwe are already familiar: island chains in the South China Sea and the \nmost dangerous issue of all dividing our two countries, the status of \nTaiwan.\n  The complexity inherent in U.S.-China relations simply allows for \nneither the demonization of China, as many here would have it, nor the \nkind of alliance we enjoy with our closest allies. The issues are too \nvaried, and the emotions surrounding them run too deep. The issues with \nwhich the United States takes exception relative to China, especially \nin the area of human rights and religious persecution, are too central \nto our values as a nation for us to ignore. With every dissident thrown \ninto prison, for every item produced with forced prison labor, for the \nmemory of those killed in Tiananmen Square, those charged with the \nconduct of American foreign policy must take the government in Beijing \nto task and demand, not ask, a measure of justice none of us really \nexpects to materialize soon enough. And therein lies the dilemma we \nface in dealing with China: We demand of it something it has never \nhad--freedom.\n  President Jiang Zemin made clear the high priority his government \nplaces on social stability at the expense of personal liberty. \nPresident Clinton, to his credit, offered an articulate defense of the \nemphasis the United\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nStates places on freedom, and he placed it squarely in the context of \nan emerging world power struggling with the dichotomies of economic \ndevelopment and dictatorship. Economic freedom cannot forever coexist \nwith authoritarian dictates in the political, social and cultural \nrealms.\n  The kind of technological innovation and rapid transition from \nlaboratory to marketplace common to advanced industrialized countries \nis not possible when individual freedom is constrained and lacking \nessential legal protections. China's poor record on protection of \nintellectual property is symptomatic of this phenomenon. Furthermore, \nthat it views religious and political freedom as a threat is a sign \nthat it has some distance to go before it can join the community of \nnations represented in the G-7, as no nation can reach its full \npotential that fears the free expression of ideas by its own people.\n  To a very large degree, the ongoing controversy involving technology \ntransfers to China has its seeds in the inability of dictatorial \nsocieties to draw upon reservoirs of talent that cannot be created \nwhere the flow of information is tightly controlled and where the kind \nof intellectual exchanges that resulted in the great technological \ninnovations of the 20th Century are constrained. It is no accident that \nthe wealthiest nations on Earth are those that, since the Second World \nWar, have pursued market economies within the framework of democratic \nforms of government. Japan and Singapore are completely lacking in \nnatural resources, yet enjoy among the highest standards of living in \nthe world. The Asian economic crisis is a serious warning of the need \nto reform certain government policies and business practices, but the \naccomplishments of the economic systems still warrant respect.\n  President Clinton's trip to China has to be viewed within the context \nof what could realistically be expected of China. In one significant \nrespect, his trip was a success. The access afforded him to the Chinese \npublic was unprecedented, and the President did a fine job of \nexpressing the importance of democratic values to the Chinese people. \nHe further deserves gratitude for his denunciation of the Tiananmen \nSquare massacre, an event of singular importance for post-Cold War \nrelations between the two countries. The events of May and June 1989, \noccurring as they did while the central front of the Cold War was \nundergoing dramatic transformations that would reshape most of the \nworld, were a sad reminder of the extremes to which governments that do \nnot rule with the consent of the people will go to maintain their hold \non power. By conveying the message directly to the Chinese people that \nthe leader of what has historically been known as the ``Free World'' \ncondemns the events of 4 June 1989, President Clinton communicated to \npro-democracy elements in China the vital message that the United \nStates supports their efforts.\n  To the extent the President is criticized for a mission for which the \nonly success was symbolic, it must be admitted there is little of \nsubstance to show for the effort. It is apparent that his sights were \nset low, and his achievements accordingly modest. To be fair, the kinds \nof change we hope to witness in China will not materialize over night; \nChina is a country that thinks in terms of its thousands of years of \nhistory, and that history is replete with repression, foreign invasion \nand civil war. It is a deeply scarred nation, neither willing nor able \nto lose sight of its legacy of exploitation at the hands of others. But \nChina today stands on the brink of becoming one of the world's premier \npowers and, as such, must understand that more is expected of it. The \nrole it seeks to play, regionally and globally, must be firmly rooted \nin a moral foundation in which the worth of the individual lies at the \ncenter of its system of governance. Repression is alien to such a \nsystem, as is the insecurity all too often manifested in expressions of \nexternal aggression. If its goal is to instill in its neighbors a fear \nof its looming shadow, all it will have to show for its efforts is an \nelement of regional hegemony in a region where countries have fought \nferociously to resist such intimidation. It will then suffer \neconomically, with the risk of social instability that President Jiang \nemphasized is one of his greatest concerns.\n  The areas of trade, proliferation, the status of Tibet, and the \nfuture of Taiwan all remain largely unresolved--the latter dangerously \nso. The President's rejection of Taiwanese independence is consistent \nwith previous Administration statements and U.S. policy going back to \n1972, but only if loosely interpreted. United States policy remains \n``one China,'' but the context in which the President's statement was \nmade and the manner in which it was declared were painfully close to \nresolving the issue of Taiwan's status by fiat and in Beijing's favor.\n  Taiwan is a complex country. It is torn internally between an \nhistorically indigenous Formosan population that claims independence \nfrom mainland China, and the large segment of the population that \nrepresents the mass migration from the mainland following the communist \nvictory in 1949. The latter claims to be the legitimate government of \nall of China. The reality on the ground, of course, does not allow for \na policy predicated upon such a claim. To have reaffirmed as the \nPresident did the so-called ``three noes'' policy, however, served only \nto exacerbate concerns in Taiwan about its security--legitimate \nconcerns irrespective of where one stands on the issue of its \nindependence--while possibly emboldening Beijing. Given how close our \ntwo nations came to armed confrontation in March 1996 over Taiwan's \nsecurity and right to exist as a democratic country, a more sensitive \narticulation of U.S. policy was in order.\n  Since coming to Congress, I have been a staunch advocate of free \ntrade. The unprecedented period of economic growth that the United \nStates has experienced is owed in no small part to our level of trade. \nWe cannot and should not, however, expect the American public to \ncountenance a level of Chinese imports that is not reciprocated. Trade \ndeficits that result from the natural dynamics of free market \nmechanisms should not be feared; deficits that occur as a result of \nsystematic imposition of barriers to free trade must be confronted. In \nthis respect, the President's trip was an abject failure. U.S. \ncompanies must have unfettered access to the Chinese market, and ought \nnot be compelled to compete with companies owned by the Chinese \nmilitary, which comprise a disappointing number of those in the \nsouthern economic zone.\n  On the extremely contentious issue of technology transfers, an \nentirely separate discussion is warranted to do it justice. At issue as \nfar as U.S. exports are concerned is dual-use technology that, by its \nnature, presents considerable regulatory difficulty. As we in the \nCongress press the Department of Defense to make more use of commercial \ntechnologies, we should not be surprised that the Chinese are doing \nprecisely that. The Commerce Committee will be holding hearings into \nthe export licensing process, and I am aware of the number of hearings \nheld in both chambers of Congress by various committees. Suffice to say \nfor now, though, that we need to get a better handle on this issue. For \nAmerican companies, the stakes are high; for our national security, \nthey are higher. The latter must take precedence. It is questionable \nwhether the President agrees with that supposition.\n  This Administration's handling of export controls warrants close \nexamination, as there is considerable evidence that dual-use \ntechnologies are finding their way into Chinese weapon systems. While I \ndo not fear the kind of global confrontation with China that existed \nrelative to the Soviet Union, I fear the threat to regional stability \nthat can and will arise should Chinese military modernization enable it \nto project military power at the expense of its neighbors. And I fear \nfor the future of Taiwan should China develop the means to militarily \nsubdue that democratic bastion. China has a right to defend itself; it \nhas a right to a modern army. The Pacific Rim is too fraught with \ntension, however, to ignore the regional and global implications of \nmodernization untempered by moral or practical constraints.\n  In the area of proliferation, the outcome of the China summit is \nunclear. China's continued refusal to join the Missile Technology \nControl Regime augurs ill for our ability to rein in its\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\nexport of destabilizing military technologies. The recent nuclear \ndetonations by India and Pakistan were testament to the dangers \nimplicit in policies that seek to resolve border disputes through the \nbrandishing of ever more destructive forms of weaponry. China's support \nof other countries' nuclear weapons programs is extremely dangerous. \nIts support of their development of the means of delivering those \nweapons is even more so.\n  The one true consensus in the realm of national security affairs is \nthe danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their \nmeans of delivery. A cloud will continue to hang over U.S.-China \nrelations until we are confident that China respects our concerns, as \nit expects us to respect its concerns. We should certainly not be \nexacerbating that problem through exports of our own to China that \nbenefit its military-industrial complex. Administration policies in \nthis regard deserve the close scrutiny they are now receiving.\n  China will always act in its self-interest. It will always view the \nworld through the prism of its own unique history, and through its own \nunique culture. Such perspective does not excuse its repressive \ndomestic policies, and U.S. policy ought not make allowances for those \npolicies. We should be under no illusions that China will be a \nstrategic partner; in all likelihood, it will not. It is a relationship \nthat should be managed, and that should start from the premise that \nChinese foreign policy will, at times, run counter to our own. Our \nexport policy must take that into account, even if that comes at the \nexpense of business.\n  Mr. President, it is sometimes said that the business of government \nis business. It is not. There is no constitutional prerogative for \ngovernmental intervention in the marketplace. There is a constitutional \nprerogative to provide for the common defense. As in any area of life, \nto some degree there is an element of balance that needs to be \nmaintained. The current Administration's great failing is its inability \nto appreciate that fundamental requirement and to provide for the \ncommon defense. We should and do work with China for our mutual \nbenefit. We must do so, however, without losing sight of the nature of \nthe Chinese regime. President Jiang may prove an able leader; effusive \npraise usually reserved for Jeffersonian democrats, however, obscures \nthe depth of the chasm that remains in the Sino-American relationship \nand the origins of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. That \nis not ideologically-driven rhetoric; it is a view of a dictatorial \ngovernment through the prism of history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nhis remarks. For a moment, I want to respond to some of what my \ncolleague from Arizona said. He need not stay, but I did want to \namplify on some of his remarks.\n  I have had the honor of being able to work closely with Congresswoman \nPelosi, who I think has been a very courageous leader in the human \nrights area. I have worked with a lot of human rights organizations, \nand Wei Jingsheng and others in China, who have had the courage to \nspeak up. I, too, want to give credit where credit is due. I think it \nis terribly important that the President speak out about human rights--\nterribly important. I think it was perhaps even more important that \nthis was on television and radio and people in China had an opportunity \nto hear this discussion.\n  I also believe, however, that really the question is, What next? I \nthink that is really the question in regard to the whole issue of \nweapons of mass destruction and exporting of technology --dangerous \ntechnologies--in regard to trade. I think last year China exported \nsomething like $40 billion worth of products to our country and we \nexported $15 billion to China. That is clearly a policy that doesn't \nserve the people in our country well at all.\n  I think also in the human rights area, which is very near and dear to \nmy heart, I wish the President had met with some of the human rights \nadvocates in China. I wish he had met with some of the families of the \nvictims of Tiananmen Square or, for that matter, of those who are now \nin prison. But most important, on the ``what next'' part, I really hope \nthat we will see some changes. There are, at minimum, some 2,000 men \nand women in prison in China just for the practice of their religion or \nbecause they have spoken out; many have spoken out for democracy, which \nis what we cherish in our country. We just celebrated 222 years of our \nnoble experiment in self-rule. Those prisoners of conscience should be \nreleased.\n  We meet all the time in our country very courageous men and women, \nnow living in the United States of America. Many of them can't go back \nto China. They have been ``blacklisted.'' They should be able to go \nback to their country. It is not enough to say, because the Government \nreleased Wei Jingsheng, who served 16, 17, 18 years in prison because \nhe had the courage to stand alone and to speak out for democracy, that \nthis represents progress, because he is now in exile. He can't go back \nto his country to see his family, to see his loved ones.\n  Quite clearly, the discussion about Tibet was good, but what we \nabsolutely have to see are some negotiations with the Dalai Lama, a \nspecific timetable to put an end to what has been absolute pressure on \nthe people in Tibet. Last year, things got worse in Tibet. There has \nbeen no improvement whatsoever in human rights. Every time I have an \nopportunity to speak out about human rights on the floor of the Senate, \nI don't miss that opportunity.\n  I say to the President that I appreciated someone who was pushing and \npushing the President to speak out on human rights. I am glad he did. I \nthink the credit should be given to the President for raising a lot of \nother terribly important questions that deal with our national security \nand our national defense. I also believe, however, in the human rights \nequation, which I think should be part of the foundation of our foreign \npolicy. The whole way we need to measure the success of the President's \ntrip is, what next? What next? The proof will be in the pudding. We \nhave to wait and see. We have to continue to press and press and press.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7668-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7670-S7675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know I am going to be joined on the \nfloor in a moment. I had a chance to speak earlier today on the floor \nof the Senate. But unless there is some tabling motion--and there may \nnot be opportunity for full debate and discussion--I told my colleague \nfrom Washington that I would just begin to speak about an issue that \nshe is going to raise on the floor of the Senate. I guess the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, will also speak to this \nbecause he has been raising this question over and over again. The \nthree of us really have focused on this.\n  This, again, has to do with what I talked about earlier today on the \nfloor of the Senate--compensation to veterans with tobacco-related \nillnesses.\n  There was the hope on the part of the veterans community--the Chair, \nI think, would be interested in this--that there would be compensation \nto veterans having to do with addiction to tobacco. That is to say, in \nmany ways it was handed out like candy. These veterans say, ``Look, if \nthere are going to be rules for compensation, the same rules should \napply to us.'' That seems fair to deal with some of the health care \nstruggles and illnesses with which they have to deal.\n  That was the first preference. I want to go on to add--now I am \nspeaking for myself--if not direct compensation for veterans, then at \nleast the money that is saved by not providing that compensation should \ngo to veterans. The Office of Management and Budget, I think, estimated \nsavings of something like $17 billion. I personally think that is too \nhigh an estimate, but that is a whole other issue. But if not the $17 \nbillion for compensation, then at least it seems to me that money ought \nto go to veterans' health care.\n  I could spend hours and hours--I will not--talking about all the ways \nin which veterans fall between the cracks. I actually found this to be, \nI think, probably the greatest education I have\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\nhad since I have been a U.S. Senator, having to do with my dealings \nwith veterans. I have been just amazed by how much veterans really need \nhealth care coverage, and it is not provided; veterans that are \nhomeless; veterans struggling with PTSD, on and on. I think there is a \nwhole lot that needs to be done.\n  Let me say to those who follow veterans' health care issues that we \nhave a flat-line budget that does not take into account really the \ninflation in medical costs, and I don't think takes into account \ndemography, because more veterans are living to older age. We have a \nreliance on third-party payments that I am not sure is going to come \nthrough. If we ever get back to the VA housing bill--I hope we will--I \nwill have an amendment that deals with that. We have, as I said before, \na population that is living to be 85 and beyond, and I don't think we \nhave figured out yet what to do about that.\n  We also have the problem of compensation for atomic veterans who have \nbeen waiting years for justice. I intend to be out here with a piece of \nlegislation for an up-or-down vote on this. These are men and women \nthat went to ground zero in Nevada and Utah without any protective \ngear. So many of them have died from cancer. So many of their children \nand grandchildren have had illnesses. So many of them have struggled. \nWe should expand the list of radiogenic diseases that are covered, that \nare presumptive diseases, because they still aren't getting \ncompensation. It was a terrible thing the government did. It was a \nterrible thing. We lied to them. They should have been given protective \ngear. They should have been told what they were going to be exposed to. \nThey weren't.\n\n  My point is that on each and every one of these issues, whether they \nget direct compensation or not, at the very least that money ought to \nbe put into veterans' health care. Instead, what happened is when the \nISTEA highway bill went from the Senate to the House, all of a sudden a \nwhole bunch of new projects got added on. The question becomes, How can \nwe afford it? What is the ``offset''? For those watching this \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate, that means, Where do you get the \nmoney from? Where the money was taken from was the $17 billion that the \nveterans community thought would, in fact, go to direct compensation \nfor them and their families, or at the very least would go into \nveterans' health care. That is exactly what happened. That is what \nhappened on the bill.\n  When that bill came back here, when it passed the Senate, I voted \nagainst that bill. Then for complicated reasons there were some changes \nthat needed to be made in a technical correction bill, and Senator \nRockefeller stepped forward. I was pleased to join him. And he said, \n``Look, when that technical correction bill comes before the floor of \nthe Senate, I will have an amendment to essentially knock out the \nprovision that took $17 billion, or however you score it, away from the \nveterans community.'' We went through a debate on this. We reached an \nimpasse.\n  The majority leader then decided the way he would deal with this is \nwe would just put the technical corrections for the highway bill in the \nIRS conference report. So this conference committee dealing with this \nInternal Revenue Service bill essentially took the technical \ncorrections for ISTEA and put it into the IRS conference report, which \nmeans we can't amend it.\n  So when Senator Murray comes to the floor of the Senate, she is going \nto be, I think, appealing the ruling of the Chair. She is going to talk \nabout what happened having been outside the scope of the IRS conference \ncommittee. In other words, there was no chance for discussion on the \ntechnical corrections bill about what happens to veterans compensation \nand health care, and so on and so forth. The technical corrections just \ngot put into the IRS conference committee.\n  So we will have that debate on the floor of the Senate. Senator \nMurray will be out here taking the lead. I thank her for that, because \nI actually think that what was done was a real injustice.\n  Let me say to colleagues, I think the Congressional Budget Office \nscored this at about $10 billion, and then the OMB scored it at $17 \nbillion. In some ways, it gets to be sort of funny money. But in any \ncase, the higher figure was chosen because that gave some of our \ncolleagues the opportunity to load more projects onto the ISTEA highway \nbill and gave them more of an offset. But in all due respect, I say \nthis to all of my colleagues, the veterans community is going to hold \nus accountable on this.\n  I hope people will listen very carefully to what Senator Murray has \nto say, and I hope we have an initiative similar to the initiative \nwhich Senator Dorgan took. And we will have a very strong vote.\n  For my own part, if we don't win on this--and I hope we do--I think \nit ought to go back to conference committee. I think this provision \ndealing with the technical corrections should be knocked out because I \nthink we should have a separate vote on the technical corrections bill. \nThen we should be able to come out here with an amendment and have an \nup-or-down vote as to whether or not the $17 billion that should have \ngone to compensation for veterans and their families, or at least into \nhealth care for the veterans community, should or should not be there \nas opposed to transferring it to the highway bill.\n  That is the issue. There is no way people here are going to be able \nto avoid it. One way or another, I think people are going to hear from \nthe veterans community. And they should hear from the veterans \ncommunity.\n  So we will shortly, when Senator Murray returns, have this \ndiscussion. I assume that this question will be before the Senate.\n  For my own part, if we don't win, though I hope we do win, I think \nwhat I want to do is keep coming back over and over again and basically \nraise the same question and forcing votes. We can have the same votes \nover and over and over again. People can play around this however they \nwant to. People can vote against the proposition that we honestly ought \nto have taken the $17 billion that should have gone for veterans' \ncompensation and health care and kept it there, or people can vote \nwhether it should be transferred to the highway bill for different \nprojects that were added on in the House. We should have a strong vote \nin the Senate on this question. Or people can vote one way, and then \nkind of just look the other way while in the conference committee it \ngets done.\n  But regardless of what we do procedurally, regardless of what we do \nprocess-wise, I want to remind colleagues one more time on the floor of \nthe Senate that this was a real injustice. I don't know how people \njustify it. I don't know how people justify it.\n  First issue: The veterans community says, ``Look, if we are going to \nbe talking about compensation for people who are addicted to tobacco, \ndo you know what happened to us when we were serving our country? \nCigarettes were handed out to us like candy.'' So we asked for some \ncompensation. We are paying the price for that addiction to tobacco. We \nasked for the compensation. They don't get the compensation. Then I \nsay, and I think other veterans say this as well, if not the direct \ncompensation, at least over the next 5 years put it into veterans' \nhealth care. Put it into the veterans' health care system. There is not \none Senator here who spends any time back in his or her State with the \nveterans community who doesn't know that this is a system in need of \nreform. Dr. Kizer has moved forward with some good initiatives; some \nother initiatives I question. I think he has provided good leadership. \nBut we should be doing much, much more. Much, much more.\n\n  What about Vietnam vets? More drop-in centers? Senator Akaka has done \na great job of leading the way for drop-in centers for Vietnam vets and \nother veterans. What about other veterans who struggle with post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome? What about veterans who are homeless, many \nof them struggling with substance abuse? What about elderly veterans? \nWhat about veterans who fall between the cracks, and they don't have a \ndirect service-connected disability illness and they are not low-income \nand therefore they are not eligible? And so on and so forth.\n  This is a system that needs to be put on a more solid financial \nfooting. This is a system that needs to do better by way of veterans. \nThis is a health care system that faces many challenges. And what we \ndid is we took the $17 billion that should have been direct \ncompensation for these veterans who are\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\naddicted to tobacco--or at a minimum should have been put into \nveterans' health care--and we used the money to offset the cost of a \nwhole variety of different projects, mainly highway projects added on \nto the ISTEA bill in the House of Representatives. And then when \nSenator Rockefeller and some of the rest of us wanted to amend the \ntechnical corrections bill to knock out that transfer of funds away \nfrom the veterans community to highways, we never had the opportunity \nto do so. The majority leader didn't want an up-or-down vote.\n  You can do all you want with procedure and process. But you still \nhave to be held accountable. But instead, we got another end run. We \nhave the technical corrections bill folded into the conference report, \ncompletely outside the scope, as far as I can see, of any IRS reform \nbill, thus denying us the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote.\n  Senator Murray will come here and challenge that, saying it was \nbeyond the scope of the conference committee, and we will vote on this \nissue. I look forward to when she comes out in the Chamber and when we \nhave that vote. And I say to colleagues, please, focus your attention \non what was done, because I do not see how we explain this away to \npeople in the veterans community.\n  I hope I am not boring people with this argument. I keep repeating it \nover and over again, but I don't see how you explain to people that the \nmoney which should have gone to them by way of compensation--and, as a \nsecond choice, at least into their health care system--instead got \ntransferred to paying for people's highway projects.\n  Does anybody want to debate anybody in the veterans community about \nthis? Does anybody want to defend this in any VFW hall or American \nLegion hall? How about the Vietnam Vets of America? How about the \nParalyzed Veterans of America? How about the Disabled American \nVeterans? How about the Atomic Veterans? How about the Military Order \nof the Purple Heart? Do any of my colleagues want to defend this? I \nthink this is a tough one, and I hope that we can take corrective \naction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks today by \nreiterating my strong support for the underlying bill that is before us \nto reform the Internal Revenue Service. This is a good bill and it is \nreally long overdue. I want to join my numerous colleagues who have \ncomplimented Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan and others who have \nworked very hard and long on this legislation. I have listened to my \ncolleagues all day talk about the benefits of that bill, and I add my \ncomments to that in support of that as well.\n  Despite my strong support for this underlying bill, I am deeply \nconcerned about title IX of this conference report, because hidden deep \nwithin this bill in title IX is language to take some $17 billion from \nAmerica's veterans. Several of my colleagues have been addressing this \nissue today, and I associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Durbin. I know Senator \nWellstone has taken quite a bit of time to outline what is in this \nbill, and I thank him for his words, his comments, and his support.\n  Title IX is the technical corrections language for the transportation \nlegislation. Hidden within that is a provision that takes away \ndisability benefits from veterans whose illness resulted from smoking. \nMany of these veterans, as my colleagues know, were encouraged to smoke \nduring wartime service with free cigarettes that were provided by our \narmed services. I am outraged by this language, and I am sure that many \nof my colleagues in the Senate are as well. I know Senator Chafee, who \nis the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, has spoken to this issue. I have immense respect for Senator \nChafee and for his leadership in crafting the very important TEA 21 \nlegislation, the transportation bill that passed. Transportation is a \ncritical and important issue.\n  However, let me be very clear. I continue to oppose the veterans \noffset used to fund the increases in transportation. The chairman \nargued that this is not a controversial matter, that the Senate has \nalready spoken. With all due respect, I disagree. If this issue is so \nnoncontroversial, why are we debating it within the IRS reform bill? \nThis legislation has nothing to do with the veterans bill. If this \nissue is truly noncontroversial, then let's have a stand-alone debate \non the issue of cutting $17 billion in veterans' benefits. The \ntechnical corrections bill is at the desk. We could have a time \nagreement on that. It could pass very quickly. It does not need to be \nincluded in the IRS reform legislation. It has nothing to do with the \nIRS reform legislation.\n  I ask, and I believe all of my colleagues should ask the question, \nWhy on Earth is the IRS reform legislation used to take money from our \nAmerican veterans? It is a very legitimate question. The original \nSenate version of the IRS reform did, of course, not target veterans, \nand neither did the House bill, the IRS reform bill. Somehow the \nconference committee agreed to add the technical corrections for the \nhighway legislation to this bill on IRS reform. I am assuming that this \naction was taken at the direction of leadership, since I know that the \nFinance Committee does not have jurisdiction over the veterans funding \nissue. The IRS bill is viewed as politically popular and a cinch to \npass. That, I would guess, is why the veterans cuts were added to this \nbill. The proponents of this veterans grab want to avoid \naccountability. That is wrong, and that is why I am opposed to title IX \nof the underlying bill being included in this bill. The proponents \nfigured that we would just roll over and accept these wrongful cuts \nbecause everyone wants to reform the IRS.\n\n  I have been fighting this veterans grab all year. It was in the \nPresident's budget, and I opposed it. At the Budget Committee, I voted \nagainst Democratic and Republican proposals that included these \ndisastrous cuts to veterans health. On the Senate floor, I voted \nagainst the budget one final time in opposition to these cuts to \nveterans. During consideration of the budget, I was pleased to join \nwith Senator Rockefeller and others to fight against these cuts. I \nvoted against the Craig-Domenici amendment to validate the $10 billion \ncut in veterans funding. Sadly, the Senate budget resolution paved the \nway for the transportation bill to use the veterans savings to offset \nthe increased transportation funding.\n  I want to be sure that my colleagues are aware that the technical \ncorrections language punishing veterans that is included in this IRS \nbill is opposed by virtually every veterans service organization. Many \nof them have written and contacted me in opposition to the cuts, \nincluding the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nParalyzed Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the \nDisabled American Veterans.\n  Senators need to know that this issue has touched a nerve with \nAmerica's veterans. They are deeply offended that the Congress and the \nadministration would divert money targeted to care for sick veterans to \npay for other spending priorities. This issue is not going to go away. \nAmerica's veterans and many in Congress will continue to fight this \nbattle. We simply must revisit this issue and do the right thing for \nAmerica's veterans, and the time is now. The best way to do that is to \nremove the language from this nonrelated IRS reform bill and vote on \nthe issue separately.\n  I ask unanimous consent now to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the American Legion that I recently received.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 2, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The American Legion ask you to recommit the \n     IRS Restructuring conference report back to the conferees \n     with instructions to strip out H.R. 3978, the technical \n     corrections language to the Transportation Equity Act for the \n     21st Century (TEA 21).\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\n       Urge the Senate leadership to allow H.R. 3978 to be debated \n     on the floor as a stand along bill. Also encourage the Senate \n     leadership to allow an ``up-or-down'' vote on Senator \n     Rockefeller's amendment to H.R. 3978 that would strike the \n     veteran's disability compensation offset included in the TEA \n     21 highway legislation. The TEA 21 correction bill should not \n     be part of the IRS Restructuring conference report.\n       Subsidizing the highway trust fund with $15.4 billion in \n     offsets from veterans compensation is just plain wrong. This \n     is a grave injustice to America's disabled veterans who \n     became addicted to tobacco during military service. The \n     suggestion that approximately 500,000 veterans would file \n     tobacco-related claims each year is ridiculous. Since 1993, \n     approximately 8,000 veterans have filed claims for tobacco-\n     related illnesses and less than 300 claims have been granted.\n       The American Legion fully acknowledges that Members of \n     Congress recognize and appreciate veterans' contributions to \n     our country. Unfortunately, many legislators have not been \n     provided an honest opportunity to cast a fair vote with \n     regard to veterans suffering from tobacco-related illnesses \n     as demonstrated by the recent vote on the TEA 21.\n       Once again, The American Legion ask you to recommit the IRS \n     Restructuring conference report back to the conferees with \n     instructions to strip out H.R. 3978, the technical \n     corrections language to TEA 21. Encourage the leadership to \n     debate H.R. 3978 as a stand alone bill and ask for the \n     opportunity to have an ``up-or-down'' vote on the Rockefeller \n     amendment. Veterans and Members of Congress deserve a fair \n     vote! Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steve A. Robertson,\n                                  National Legislative Commission.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Legion again urges all U.S. Senators \nto reject this language targeting veterans. I implore all Senators to \nreview this letter before casting a vote today on this issue. I am here \nto urge my colleagues to join me and others to free America's veterans \nfrom the IRS reform legislation. Free the cuts in Veterans Affairs to a \ngenuine and a very public debate.\n  We are going to have a vote on this issue today. Regardless of \nwhether it is procedural or a straight-up vote, one thing is very \nclear--it will be a veterans vote. I ask my colleagues to vote with me \nand with America's veterans.\n\n\n                             point of order\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I make a point of order that title IX of \nthe conference report is outside the scope of the conference, pursuant \nto paragraph 2 of rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \nwhich states:\n\n       Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not \n     committed to them by either House. . . . If new matter is \n     inserted in the report . . . a point of order may be made \n     against the report, and if the point of order is sustained, \n     the report is rejected. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not sustained.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, at the proper time I will move to table \nthe appeal of the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington, \nbut I want to let people debate on this. Obviously, a motion to table \nis not debatable, so I am not going to raise the motion to table until \neverybody has had a chance to have his or her say here.\n  Mr. President, I would make a correction, if I might, to what I \nunderstood the Senator from Washington was saying. She seemed to \nindicate that this technical corrections measure that is included \nwithin the IRS reform--she indicates it takes $17 billion from \nveterans. I argue, of course, whether there is any taking from veterans \nat all, period. But the important point is that the technical \ncorrections measure is strictly a technical corrections measure. The \n$17 billion that the Senator from Washington is referring to was a \nprovision that was in the conference report on H.R. 2400--in other \nwords, the conference report on the transportation legislation which I \nlike to call ISTEA II.\n  That was adopted by the Senate here, 88 to 5. That is where we \nhandled that particular measure. Then we came to the technical \ncorrections, and there, those technical corrections indeed do deal \nstrictly with technicalities.\n  As perhaps some will recall, we finished that bill on a Thursday \nevening; we finished the negotiations with the House of \nRepresentatives. Everybody was anxious to get off on the Memorial Day \nrecess, and the staff and all worked all night long and came forward \nwith the so-called H.R. 2400, the ISTEA II, if you would, on Friday, \nthe day after we negotiated late into the evening.\n  There we voted on the printed version, which was, to the best of our \nability, correct. But there were technical mistakes in it. At the time, \nwe recognized that there would be. But there is nothing, no technical \nmistake about the money that, through a general counsel's opinion, had \nbeen going to the veterans. That was taken care of, in the legislation \nthat we voted on, on that Friday. And this technical corrections \nmeasure has nothing to do with that.\n  So I am not quite sure why the distinguished Senator from Washington \nrefers to this technical correction measure as taking $17 billion from \nveterans. It just plain does not do that. We believe that the technical \ncorrections that are included in the IRS reform bill are strictly \ntechnical and noncontroversial.\n  By the way, I didn't flesh out the part about what a monstrous job \nthis was, not only finishing it on that Thursday evening, the \nnegotiations and voting on the bill, but it is a 900-page bill. It \npresented tremendous challenges, and inevitably some errors were made.\n  This technical corrections bill which has been developed jointly by \nus--the Senate and the House conferees, with some input from the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation--is truly a technical corrections measure. \nIt doesn't do anything with formula allocations.\n  It is true that this veterans thing gets very, very confusing. The \ngeneral counsel of the Veterans' Administration came forward with a \ndecision that would have greatly enlarged the benefits that were \navailable to those who had smoking-related illnesses.\n  By the way, that never truly went into effect. There were some who \nmade applications for grants or benefits under it. But to the best of \nmy knowledge, I don't believe anybody actually received benefits. Their \nrequests were being considered.\n  The administration itself realized that this went way beyond anything \nthey were intending, and the administration itself pulled back from \nthat general counsel's decision and reversed it. We--that is the Senate \nof the United States, the Congress--went along with that reversal and \nused those funds that would otherwise have been available for general \npurposes for this transportation legislation.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a mistake to suggest that this technical \ncorrections measure is anything other than what it is labeled, a \ntechnical corrections measure that covers some of the problems that \nwere raised as a result of the haste that we were under with this \nmassive legislation when we were trying to recess for the Memorial Day \nrecess.\n  I don't know whether there is further debate to take place on this. I \nam not trying to cut people off peremptorily. If the Senator from \nWashington has further comments, I will give her an opportunity to \nspeak if she wishes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me simply say the chairman states \ncorrectly that the transportation bill did go through in a hurry right \nbefore a recess, and we are now looking at technical corrections to \nthat bill. That bill is at the desk, and we should have an opportunity \nto take a look at it, offer amendments, and vote it up or down.\n  Being as it is included within the IRS conference report, we don't \nhave the ability to do that. I think many Members would very much like \nthe opportunity to speak out on this issue. As we went home for the \nFourth of July recess, many people heard from veterans in their States \nwho are outraged this was included in the transportation bill. They \nwould like the opportunity to make their voices heard on that.\n  If we are able to override the ruling of the Chair, we will have the \nopportunity to do that. That is simply what we are asking for today. It \nwill not hold up the IRS reform bill. We can simply move that next \nweek. It will allow Members to make their statements known and their \nviews known on\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\na very critical issue to many veterans in our country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might ask the floor manager a question.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it not true that one of the technical corrections \nhas to do with the fact that those who helped write the provisions of \nthe law that attempted to rescind the general counsel's regulation \nexpanding benefits for those who smoked while in the military, that in \ndoing that, actually the drafter expanded that to reduce other benefits \nthat were for veterans who were never even intended to be covered? That \nis one of the technical corrections, to return it to what it should be, \nrather than to have an expanded reduction in benefits that go to \nveterans. Is that not true?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from New Mexico is absolutely correct: Set \naside the big expansion of the program that took place as a result of \nthe general counsel's opinion. Set that aside. There were some veterans \nreceiving benefits under other programs that were related to smoking \ndisability problems that occurred while they were on active duty.\n  Inadvertently, the language in the original legislation--that is the \nISTEA conference report--eliminated some of those benefits. This \ntechnical corrections bill that we have before us will straighten that \nout and restore those benefits. In an odd way, should the Senator from \nWashington prevail and this technical corrections measure be eliminated \nin some fashion, it will result in a failure to cure a problem that has \narisen inadvertently.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to note with great pleasure that \nI will have to support the conference committee report for the reason \nthat the Senator from Rhode Island has just stated in response to the \nquestion from the Senator from New Mexico. As now provided, absent \nthese technical corrections, we will have existing benefits to veterans \ntaken away.\n  I am correct in my understanding, am I not, that there are existing \nbenefits which would be canceled in this way. I am not the least happy \nabout the administration's decision to override the ruling of the \ngeneral counsel of the Veterans' Administration, but that is history. \nWhat we have here is the correction that will really be a clear \ninjustice to a many great persons, never intended by anybody.\n  So, Mr. President, I will have to support the conference report and \nvote for the motion to table.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I happened to be upstairs in the Hart Building \nworking on something else and listening to Senator Patty Murray from \nthe State of Washington raising this very strong argument about \nveterans. I previously spoke on veterans; therefore, one might think I \nwasn't going to come down and give the same speech again. But when I \nheard the powerful argument from the Senator from Washington and I \nheard some of the responses, the Senator from West Virginia had to come \ndown, because this is really the only way that we can protect veterans. \nWe have no other choice.\n  I believe the Senator from Rhode Island--although I didn't hear him \nsay it, I know he said it in the past--this is somehow expansion of the \nbenefit, this is some new benefit that goes to veterans. I don't know \nhow to make this clear, but what we are talking about here is that, \nthrough however it worked, the legislators who were working on this \nparticular piece of legislation, that started out with ISTEA and now \nhas come to the IRS conference report, rescinded current law.\n  They took current law which says that if you go through all the steps \nthat you have to go through in the VA to prove that you are a disabled \nAmerican veteran by virtue of your addiction to nicotine and that it \nwas caused and continued and it was because of your service, and all of \nthese steps that you have to go through, that you are entitled to \nappropriated funds.\n  I will agree it is not money that comes from highways. I have always \nsaid this is not money that comes from highways, either ISTEA I or \nISTEA II. But we have rescinded current law and, therefore, veterans \nare being denied and will be denied--unless as the distinguished \nSenator from Washington is trying to do in making a point of order--\ndisability benefits which are rightfully theirs under current law.\n  How do we come to this point? How do we allow ourselves not to \ncorrect this? It is not a matter of spending money. It is not a matter \nof taking money away from this or that highway project. It never has \nbeen. It is simply reinstating current law which, in fact, at this \nparticular moment only affects 300 veterans throughout the United \nStates of America, because out of the 8,000 who have applied for this \ndisability, only 300 to this point have made it.\n  Now, I think we are probably talking about $200 or $300 million \ntotal. The administration, of course, participated in this sham by \ncoming up with this $17 billion. Then it was $10.5 billion. And who \nknew what it was, which was basically to pay for programs which they \nwanted. Unfortunately, the majority party joined in on this.\n  So here are the veterans with nobody to speak for them, with no \nlegislative tools available to them, left on an unamendable conference \nreport on IRS which has nothing to do with veterans. And the Senator \nfrom Washington is doing the only thing that she can do in her desire \nto protect veterans, keeping their current law ability to use \nappropriated funds to pay for their disability benefits. That is what \nthe Senator from Washington is trying to accomplish.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I know the Senator from Rhode Island wants to move to a \nvote on this. Let me just conclude by saying that veterans know this \nissue very clearly. They know that the language we have included in the \nIRS reform validates the cuts to their ability to get health care, if \nthey were smoking when they were young and they now have disabilities \ndue to that.\n  They are very clear on this vote. They are very clear in what they \nare saying to us. They were very clear to me over the last month. This \nbill, if we vote on it this way, will cut the health care benefits of \nmany of our service people who started smoking when they were young.\n  I think that the veterans are going to be watching this issue \nclosely. I hope that my colleagues will support me on this so that we \ncan move to separately deal with the technical corrections bill in a \nway that does not undermine the health care benefits of the many \nveterans across this country who served our country well.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do want to stress, once again, as I said \nbefore, that killing the technical corrections bill is not going to \nrestore any $17 billion. The technical corrections bill has nothing to \ndo with that. It does not mention it, does not involve it at all. That \nwas all taken care of in the conference report.\n  Indeed, we voted three times on that measure. We voted on the whole \nmatter of the $17 billion being used in connection with the ISTEA II \nlegislation. We voted on it twice in connection with the budget, and we \nvoted on it once when we did the conference report here.\n  So, Mr. President, I do want to stress that should Senator Murray's \nappeal of the ruling of the Chair be successful, the entire IRS reform \nbill would effectively die. And so I urge my colleagues to uphold the \nruling of the Chair.\n  I now move to table Senator Murray's appeal of the ruling of the \nChair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator not agree that if the Senator from \nWashington prevailed on her point, that, in fact, it would not vitiate \nthe IRS bill, but would simply mean that the conferees would have to go \nback, the conferees themselves, and do this work and perhaps straighten \nout the veterans situation and then come back to us?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. My understanding is there are no House conferees. The \nconference has been dissolved.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That does not mean there could not be new conferees. \nI mean, this is an important point.\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, it is a complicated way of proceeding, but it is my \nunderstanding that this would actually kill the IRS reform.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This Senator believes that is incorrect. It would \nsimply be the reestablishment of the conference committee, which could \nthen clear up this matter which the Senator from Washington is trying \nto clear up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make a point to the Senate. If you do not table \nthis, and you accept the proposal of the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, you have done two things--both of which are probably very, \nvery bad for our country: One, you will kill this bill; secondly, you \nwill dramatically cut veterans' benefits beyond anything anybody \nintended. Because to eliminate these technical corrections, you leave \nin place a law that is signed. The highway bill is signed into law, and \nit has a mistake in it. And the mistake dramatically cuts veterans' \nbenefits beyond what was intended.\n  So it may not be the intention of the sponsors, but you will \naccomplish two things, and I just stated them. And I believe that is \nthe case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator yield----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No. I would like to press forward with the----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Simply because it is this Senator's judgment that \nwhat the Senator from New Mexico has said is in two respects incorrect. \nThis Senator would like to simply give his opinion, and that would be \nthat, No. 1, the ISTEA bill would in no way be affected. That is \nsigned. It would in no way be affected. Second, the IRS bill would in \nno way be affected at all. It is simply a matter that the conferees--\nagain, new conferees--would come back, not debating the IRS bill, but \nsimply clearing up this matter which is of extreme importance to this \ncountry's moral obligations to veterans.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, at this time I move to table Senator \nMurray's appeal of the ruling of the Chair. And I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  They yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the appeal of the ruling of the Chair. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important \nissue for the taxpayers of this country. My purpose today is to:\n  First, inform my colleagues;\n  Second, alert future Members of this body; and\n  Third, create a historical public record so that future Congresses \nwill not repeat the mistakes of the past. The issue is the integrity of \nthe government's present and future efforts to stop widespread fraud, \nwaste and abuse against taxpayer funded programs.\n  The government's strongest and most effective tool against fraud is \nthe False Claim Act. In recent years, the False Claims Act has been \nunder attack from industries targeted by the government's anti-fraud \nefforts. Since 1986, when Congress passed amendments that I sponsored \nto toughen the law, more than $4 billion has been recovered through the \nFalse Claims Act. Hundreds of billions more in fraud have been saved \nthrough the deterrent effect that this law has upon those who would \nbetray the public's interest.\n  In addition to the recovery of money and the deterrent effect of this \nlaw, the False Claims Act is important for another, perhaps, more \nimportant reason. The fact is that the False Claims Act is being used, \nday after day, by prosecutors to maintain the integrity of countless \nfederal programs funded by American taxpayers. For example, the False \nClaims Act is being used in the health care industry to ensure that \nnursing home residents receive quality care--like enough food.\n  Nonetheless, this Congress just witnessed an unconscionable assault \non the False Claims Act. The law has thus far escaped unharmed. But, \nthere is a ``clear and present danger'' lurking in the shadows. It is \nfor this reason that I speak today, Mr. President--to chronicle the \nevents that occurred over the past seven or so months.\n  The perpetrator of this assault on the False Claims Act was the \nAmerican Hospital Association (AHA). The AHA used its notable clout to \nsystematically and cleverly orchestrate a major grassroots campaign to \n``gut'' the False Claims Act. In the final analysis, its effort fell \napart because the approach taken by the AHA lacked an essential \ningredient--``credibility.'' You see, the AHA appealed to a great many \nlegislators by using horror stories from hospitals in their respective \nstates and districts. But the horror stories, in the end, had no \nbearing on what the AHA peddled as the solution--gutting the False \nClaims Act.\n  The correct solution was not to change the law--indeed there was, and \nis, no problem with the language of the False Claims Act. Rather, the \nsolution was to correct a number of missteps made by the Department of \nJustice in implementing the law through its national initiatives. The \nAHA was abundantly aware of this fact. But AHA chose instead to pursue \na strategy of bait and switch. The AHA allegedly backed a bill to gut \nthe law simply to strong arm the Justice Department into changing how \nthe False Claims Act was implemented. The strategy succeeded. \nUnfortunately, it comes at the expense of a serious loss of \ncredibility, in my eyes, for the AHA.\n  Before describing the events of the past months, some historical \ncontext is in order. The False Claims Act was fathered by President \nAbraham Lincoln. Lincoln had become frustrated by the widespread fraud \nagainst the Union Army by defense contracts during the Civil War. \nContractors would sell the same horses twice to the Army; they\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nwould sell sand instead of gun powder; and sawdust instead of muskets.\n  Included in the anti-fraud arsenal of the False Claims Act was a \nprovision called qui tam. Qui tam is a concept that dates back to \nfeudal times. It allows private citizens who know of fraud against the \ntaxpayers to bring a lawsuit against the perpetrators. In other words, \nthe citizen acts as a partner with the government. As an incentive, the \ncitizen shares in any monetary recovery to the U.S. Treasury.\n  Over the decades, the False Claims Act, and especially the qui tam \nprovisions, proved to be effective, both in catching and deterring \nfraud. Think about it, Mr. President: The most effective way to catch \nfraud or other wrongdoing is to have ``insider'' information. Insiders \nhelp make investigations more targeted, more effective and more \nefficient. Congress has long recognized the value of insiders. That is \nwhy Congress established laws to encourage and protect whistle blowers. \nWe know the value of inside information, and the role it plays in our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances.\n\n  Then, in 1943, things changed. That is when private industry played a \nrole in amending the False Claims Act. The amendments neutralized the \nlaw's effectiveness--instead of having a powerful tool against fraud \nperpetrated against the government we had a toothless piece of \nlegislation. Would-be perpetrators of fraud now had every reason to be \ncelebrating in the streets; and taxpayers had suffered a major blow.\n  During the early 1980s, our defense budget was rising rapidly to \ncounter the Soviet threat. It rose so rapidly, in fact, that it was \nbeyond our ability to manage the money properly. As one defense \nofficial said, it was as if we opened up the money bags at both ends, \nlaid them on the doorstep of the Pentagon, and told the contractors to \n``come and get it.''\n  Fraud against the government was suddenly out of control. I recall at \none point that eight out of the top ten defense contractors were under \nfederal investigation for fraud. Amazing!!!\n  Not coincidentally, that is the year Congress restored the teeth to \nthe False Claims Act that were removed some 40 years earlier. It was in \n1986 that I sponsored, along with Howard Berman of the House of \nRepresentatives, amendments to the False Claims Act intended to put the \n``bite'' back in the statute. Since that time, the law has been a \ntremendous success. It has recovered more than $4 billion for the \ntaxpayers, and continues to deter fraud in amounts estimated in the \nhundreds of billions.\n  Since passage of the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act, private \nindustry has been plotting to once again gut the law. Even before the \namendments were passed, a major effort was underway by the defense and \nother industries to undermine passage. Even supporters of my amendments \nsuddenly turned against my bill. There were curious instances, as I \nread in news accounts, of campaign money being given in close proximity \nto actions taken by Members to stop my bill. In the final analysis, the \npublic's concern about fraud prevailed. My amendments passed and the \nFalse Claims Act has demonstrated itself to be one of the most powerful \ntools in the war against fraud.\n  I knew at the time, Mr. President, that it would only be a matter of \ntime before some industry would mount yet another assault on the False \nClaims Act. It is for that reason I have come to be ever vigilant. \nThere are many citizen groups around the country that have joined me in \nthis vigil. They have the taxpayers' best interests in mind.\n  One such assault occurred in 1990, led by the defense contracting \ncommunity. It was unsuccessful. One main reason for the failure of the \ndefense contracting community was because that industry lacked \ncredibility. The public grew skeptical of that industry's attempts to \nexempt itself--under the guise of competitiveness--from anti-fraud \nstatutes.\n  This year, the defense industry succeeded in persuading the \nDepartment of Defense to propose an exemption for that industry from \nthe False Claims Act. Fortunately, the Department of Justice, with the \nassistance of the Inspector General's Office at the Department of \nDefense preempted the plans of the defense industry.\n  A major and well orchestrated assault on the False Claims Act came in \n1998 from the health care industry, and more particularly, from the \nhospitals. The hospital industry has a great deal of credibility with \nmembers of Congress. We all have hospitals in our states and districts, \nand we work closely with them in addressing their concerns.\n  So, while the defense industry sat back after their attempt failed, \nthe hospital industry took the lead in seeking to carve out an \nexemption from the False Claims Act for the entire health care \nindustry. The health care industry played heavily on its credibility \nwith the public in pursuing its agenda to exempt itself from the False \nClaims Act. It was reported to me that all the while, the defense \nindustry watched in awe as progress was made. We all knew that if the \nhospitals succeeded in carving out an exemption from the False Claims \nAct, the defense industry would be next in line. And soon other \nindustries would be lining up, too.\n\n  The AHA's official and public assault on the False Claims Act began \nearly this year. On January 30, 1998, the AHA met with staff members of \nthe Committee on Aging, which I chair. It was determined at that \nmeeting that the AHA's concerns were not with the language of the False \nClaims Act, but with the Justice Department's implementation of that \nlaw. The AHA alleged that the Justice Department was heavy-handed in \nits implementation of the law and was not separating innocent billing \nerrors from actual fraud. All this from an industry where a recent \nsurvey found that the majority of hospitals pooled did not even have a \ncompliance officer who is responsible (1) for developing and \nmaintaining compliance programs, (2) investigating compliance issues, \n(3) overseeing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, (4) overseeing \nbilling and coding, as well as (5) overseeing tax-related issues.\n  A few days later, my staff met with the Iowa Hospital Association, \nwhich expressed the same concerns as the national association. As a \nresult of these meetings, I took a personal interest in the allegations \nof the AHA. Consequently, I met with Attorney General Reno on March 3, \n1998, to discuss the AHA's concerns. Furthermore, I urged the Attorney \nGeneral to take whatever action was necessary to insure that the \nimplementation of the False Claims Act was being done properly, and if \nnot, to take expeditious action to correct the situation. She agreed.\n  I also met with Congressman McCollum of Florida who had expressed an \ninterest in introducing a bill to amend the False Claims Act. During \nthat meeting, he agreed to a one month reprieve before introducing the \nbill so that I could, among other things, facilitate a dialogue between \nthe Justice Department and the AHA in the hope of reaching a \nresolution. Unfortunately, I was dismayed when Mr. McCollum introduced \nH.R. 3523 on March 19, 1998--a little over a week after our meeting. \nThis changed the debate dramatically. As opposed to concentrating on \nresolving the concerns of the AHA through dialogue and communication, I \nwas forced to expend my energies protecting the False Claims Act and \nthe Medicare Trust Funds. Sometime later, on April 29, 1998, two of my \nSenate colleagues, Senators Cochran and Hollings introduced S. 2007, a \nparallel bill to H.R. 3523.\n  The bills introduced in the House and Senate were characterized as \ninnocuous by, among others, Representative McCollum and the AHA. But, \nthe changes were not simple, the changes were not minor and the changes \nwere not clarifying. Quite the contrary, the changes were devastating \nto the future use of the False Claims Act against the health care \nindustry. So stated the Justice Department, the American Association of \nRetired Persons and others. Even the Clinton Administration voiced its \nconcern with the bills and was prepared to issue a veto order if it \nbecame necessary.\n  The House bill demonstrated itself to be popular among House members, \nIndeed, H.R. 3523 enjoys bipartisan support, boasting 201 co-sponsors. \nHowever, the McCollum bill stumbled.\n  On June 3, 1998 the Department of Justice issued written guidance on \nthe appropriate use of the False Claims Act in health care matters. \nThis guidance\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nwas issued in response to concerns relating to the Justice Department's \nenforcement strategies in national health care projects. In response, \nCongressman Delahunt, co-sponsor of H.R. 3523, determined that the \nwritten guidance made this new legislation inadvisable. Mr. Delahunt \nthen courageously decided to pull back his support for H.R. 3523. \nShortly thereafter Congressmen Bliley, Barton, Dingell, Stark, and \nBerman stated in a Dear Colleague that: ``The Department's guidelines \nare quite extensive and sufficient time must be given to allow for \ntheir appropriate implementation. A non-legislative solution is the \nappropriate manner to address their issues.''\n\n  At this juncture it must be said that the Department of Justice, \ndespite the attacks, despite the rhetoric and despite the \nmisinformation, raised itself up from its bootstraps and, in good \nfaith, issued guidance documenting its implementation of the False \nClaims Act. And even more amazing, Congressman McCollum, it is \nreported, still plans to move forward with the bill that would gut the \nFalse Claims Act.\n  I suppose there are certain people associated with this effort who \njust don't get it. Who don't mind moving forward despite major \nquestions of credibility. There are many more important issues that I \nand my staff could have been working on for the last seven months on \nbehalf of the taxpayers. Instead we spent seven months of negative \nenergy trying to put out brush fires as the False Claims Act came under \nassault.\n  How anyone could ever suggest someone would enjoy that kind of \npolitics is beyond me. To say the bill is ``innocuous'' is beyond me. \nAnd that's what I mean, Mr. President, when I talk about major \nquestions of credibility.\n  In the Senate, my colleagues, Senators Cochran and Hollings, played a \ncritical role in having the Department of Justice issue responsible \nguidance to the health care industry without gutting the False Claims \nAct. In addition, my Senate colleagues worked hand-in-hand with me to \ndevelop legislative and report language that assures the future \nintegrity of the False Claims Act and the good faith implementation of \nthe guidance by the Department of Justice. I thank you, Senator Cochran \nand Senator Hollings.\n  All in all, the history of the assault of the False Claims Act sends \nus on a long and winding road. But it is important to recognize that \nfuture attacks on the False Claims Act are undoubtedly around the \ncorner--this despite the fact that the law's success is in many ways \nunparalleled in the enforcement community.\n  Consequently, the False Claims Act is, and will remain, a target of \nthose industries that accept billions and billions of taxpayer dollars \nannually and balk at strict accountability. I ask only that we, as \nlegislators, remember the history of the assault made upon the False \nClaims Act by the AHA in the present. I ask further that we agree to be \nstrong despite the strength of an industry, simply because it is the \n``right'' thing to do. Taxpayers deserve no less--and as legislators, \nwe should deliver no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7675-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEATH OF ELLISON ``BUBBY'' McKISSICK, JR.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, while the Senate was recessed last week, \nSouth Carolina lost one of its most prominent citizens, Ellison \n``Bubby'' McKissick, Jr., who was best known as a leader in the textile \nindustry both in the Palmetto State and throughout the United States.\n  Bubby McKissick passed away, after a long illness, at the rather \nyoung age of 69. Though his passing came too soon, he distinguished \nhimself in many ways throughout his life. Not the least of these \nachievements was serving as the Chairman of Alice Manufacturing, the \nMcKissick family mill and one of the largest textile companies in the \nSoutheast. Additionally, he was a past president of the American \nTextile Manufacturers Institute, and a forceful advocate for measures \nthat would make the textile industry more competitive, including \npromoting education.\n  While his career ultimately took him to the boardroom, Bubby \nMcKissick learned the textile business from the ground floor of one of \nhis family's facilities, working in some of the most demanding jobs in \nany mill operation. Additionally, Bubby McKissick served in the United \nStates Marine Corps during the Korean War, earning the rank of \nSergeant, and having the unenviable distinction of being wounded in \ncombat. This was a man who truly did not have anything handed to him on \na silver platter, and who knew well the valuable lessons that one can \nonly learn from experience and hard work.\n  Bubby McKissick's passing is all the more saddening because he was a \nloyal supporter, and more importantly, a valued friend. I had known \nBubby almost literally from the day he was born as his family was well \nknown to me. I was pleased to watch the successes and achievements of \nthis man, both professional and personal, and I take consolation in the \nfact that he lived a full and rewarding life.\n  Mr. President, Bubby McKissick's passing leaves a tremendous void not \nonly in our state's corporate community, but in the lives of the many \nmen and women who called him friend. Bubby McKissick will not soon be \nforgotten, and I am certain that all those who knew him would join me \nin sending condolences to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7677-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the use of indiscriminate force by units of \nthe Serbian special police and the Yugoslav armed forces in Kosovo must \nstop. If unchecked, the violence there could well spillover into \nAlbania and Macedonia and could at some point involve other nations in \nthe region, including our NATO allies.\n  Acting at the direction of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the \nSerbian police and military units have brutally targeted civilians and \nused scorched earth tactics with a plan to drive ethnic Albanians out \nof their towns and villages. According to the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, around 65,000 people have been \nforced to flee their homes in Kosovo since March and prior to the \nlatest Serbian special police and troop attack on the town of \nBelacevac.\n  Of that number, around 12,000 have fled to neighboring Albania across \ntreacherous mountains--some children had to walk barefoot for days. \nAbout 8,000 have fled to Montenegro and small numbers have sought \nrefuge in Macedonia, where the United States maintains about 350 Army \npersonnel as part of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force.\n  Before I comment further on what I believe should be done to address \nthe crisis in Kosovo, I would like to briefly describe how this crisis \ncame about.\n  Kosovo, with a population of 2 million of which more than 90 percent \nare ethnic Albanians, enjoyed autonomous province status under the 1974 \nYugoslav Constitution. However, changes to the Serbian constitution in \n1989 through 1991 revoked that autonomous province status and abolished \nthe Parliament and Government of Kosovo. Since that time, Serbian \nauthorities have carried out a policy of repression: firing ethnic \nAlbanians from all public jobs and using arrests, brutal and often \nfatal beatings and other forms of intimidation in violation of commonly\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\naccepted human rights standards. In the face of this repressive policy, \nethnic Albanians pursued a policy of non-violent resistance. They \nboycotted Serbian institutions and built their own parallel set of \npolitical, economic and social institutions. In 1992, they elected \nIbrahim Rugova as president and a 130-member parliament.\n  When the policy of non-violent resistance failed to make any \nprogress, some ethnic Albanians turned to violence and over the past \ntwo years, the Kosovo Liberation Army has conducted attacks on Serbian \npolice and other officials. On the night of February 28 of this year, \nSerbian special police reportedly killed more than 20 ethnic Albanians \nin a sweep through the Drenica region of Kosovo. Since late February, \nit is estimated that more than 200 ethnic Albanians have been killed in \nKosovo at the hands of Serbian special police and military forces. As \nSerbian police forces have increased their violence against civilians, \nmore and more ethnic Albanians have joined the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n  Mr. President, the actions of Slobodan Milosevic and his henchmen \nhave been condemned by the entire international community. Russia, at \nthe conclusion of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council meeting on \nJune 12, 1998, joined the NATO defense ministers in condemning \n``Belgrade's massive and disproportionate use of force as well as \nviolent attacks by Kosovar Albanian extremists.''\n  The United Nations Security Council, by resolution 1160 adopted on \nMarch 31, 1998, condemned the excessive use of force by Serbian police \nforces against civilians and peaceful demonstrators in Kosovo and \nacting under Chapter VII of the Charter imposed a comprehensive arms \nembargo on Yugoslavia and urged the Prosecutor for the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia to begin gathering information \nrelated to the violence in Kosovo.\n  The Security Council's action is important because, by taking under \nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council has \ndetermined that the violence in Kosovo is a threat to international \npeace and security. This is important because, there is a possibility \nthat Russia may use its veto to prevent the Security Council from \nauthorizing the use of all necessary means to stop the violence in \nKosovo. In this regard, I note with approval that both Secretary of \nState Albright and Secretary of Defense Cohen took the position that \nthe Security Council's authorization was desirable but not required for \nNATO action to intervene in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I applaud NATO's decision to conduct an air exercise \nin Albania and Macedonia to demonstrate its capability to project power \nrapidly in the region. I regret that Russian President Yeltsin was \nunable to gain Milosevic's commitment to withdraw Serbian special units \nfrom Kosovo, when they met in Moscow on June 16. Milosevic has already \ndefaulted on his commitment to President Yeltsin to carry out no \nrepressive actions against civilians.\n  Mr. President, we all hope that this tragic situation will be \nresolved peacefully, but that does not appear to be likely. Bosnia has \ntaught us that quick and decisive action can prevent a crisis from \ngetting out of hand. We must not allow Milosevic to draw this crisis \nout, while the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo suffer. The \ninternational community must let Milosevic know that he must halt the \nsystematic campaign of repression and expulsions in Kosovo. He must \nwithdraw his special police from Kosovo and return his military forces \nto their barracks. And he must engage in bona fide negotiations to \nrestore a significant degree of autonomy to Kosovo. Anything else will \nbe insufficient and justify strong action by the international \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7677-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 2271.

A bill to amend the boundaries of Grant-Kohrs Ranch National \nHistoric Site in the State of Montana; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                GRANT-KOHRS RANCH NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today and introduce \nlegislation which will amend the boundaries of the Grant-Kohrs Ranch \nNational Historic Site in the State of Montana.\n  Congress authorized the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site on \nAugust 25, 1972 to preserve the Grant-Kohrs Ranch that operated from \n1860-1972. Preserving the ranch also preserved a historic reminder of \nour Nation's frontier cattle era. The ranch's\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nintact 120-year archive, 26,000 artifacts, and 88 historic structures \ncapture the heritage of the American cowboy and cattlemen.\n  Today the area is the hub of a thriving tourism industry and also \nprovides unique educational opportunities. Tourists are constantly in \nsearch of a feel for the true American West. The Grant-Kohrs Ranch \noffers a vivid recollection of life on the frontier while providing a \ngreat experience for visitors and jobs for local residents. The ranch \nhas been designated a National Historic Landmark and is a true asset to \nMontana.\n  The legislation that I am proposing will incorporate an additional \n120 acres of land into the authorized boundary of the Grant-Kohrs Ranch \nNational Historic Site. The 120 acres that will be included in the new \nboundary of the ranch are already owned by the National Park Service \nand their inclusion in the ranch's boundary is recommended as a means \nof conserving the property of the original ranch from future \ndevelopment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the administration's letter of \ntransmittal, the bill, and a section-by-section analysis of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record for the information of my \ncolleagues.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Grant-Kohrs Ranch National \n     Historic Site Boundary Adjustment Act of 1997.''\n\n     SEC. 2 ADDITIONS TO GRANT-KOHRS RANCH NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE.\n\n       The Act entitled ``An Act to authorize the establishment of \n     the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site in the State of \n     Montana, and for other purposes'', approved August 25, 1972 \n     (86 Stat. 632) is amended by striking the last sentence in \n     the first section and inserting:\n       ``The boundary of the National Historic Site shall be as \n     generally described on a map entitled, ``Boundary Map, Grant-\n     Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site'', numbered 80030-B, and \n     dated January, 1998, which shall be on file and available for \n     public inspection in the local and Washington, District of \n     Columbia, offices of the National Park Service, Department of \n     the Interior.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Section by Section Analysis--Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site \n                    Boundary Adjustment Act of 1997\n\n       Section 1: Short title.\n       Section 2: Amends the Historic Site's enabling Act by \n     incorporating 120 acres of land already owned by the National \n     Park Service into the boundaries of Grant-Kohrs Ranch \n     National Historic Site.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill ``to amend the \n     boundaries of Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site in the \n     State of Montana.''\n       We recommend the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       The enclosed draft bill would incorporate 120 acres of \n     land, purchased by the Federal government as an uneconomic \n     remnant in 1988 and administered by the National Park \n     Service, into the authorized boundary of Grant-Kohrs Ranch \n     National Historic Site. Adjusting the boundary to incorporate \n     this tract is recommended by the site's 1993 General \n     Management Plan and 1995 Management Assessment, both of which \n     had extensive public involvement and review.\n       This parcel is a critical component of the cultural \n     landscape and a defining character of Grant-Kohrs Ranch \n     implicit in its National Register designations as a National \n     Historic Landmark and Agricultural Historic District. The \n     property also augments the Ranch in conserving open space \n     amid the continued growth of Deer Lodge and Powell County, \n     Montana.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 ------ ------\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n                                      Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n       Enclosures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2273. A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 1998, the \nrates of disability compensation for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities, and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation \nfor survivors of certain service-connected disabled veterans, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n      Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1998\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I introduce legislation today to grant \na Cost-of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) increase, to take effect at the \nbeginning of next year, to recipients of certain Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) benefits.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is simple and straightforward. It \nwould grant a COLA increase to recipients of various VA benefits--most \nnotably, compensation benefits received by veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities, and the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation \nor ``DIC'' benefits received by the survivors of veterans who died in \nservice or died after service as a result of service-connected injuries \nor illnesses. The COLA to be awarded under this legislation would be, \nas in past years, the same COLA awarded to recipients of Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  It is a matter of great importance that VA compensation checks keep \npace with inflation. I know this from personal experience; in \nDepression days, all that kept the wolf from the door of the Specter \nhousehold was a small veterans disability check. The Congress has not \nfailed to grant cost-of-living adjustments in past years, and I know it \nwill not fail now. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-\n     of-Living Adjustment Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN COMPENSATION RATES AND LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall, as provided in paragraph (2), increase, effective \n     December 1, 1998, the rates of and limitations on Department \n     of Veterans Affairs disability compensation and dependency \n     and indemnity compensation.\n       (2) The Secretary shall increase each of the rates and \n     limitations in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and \n     1314 of title 38, United States Code, that were increased by \n     the amendments made by the Veterans' Compensation Rate \n     Amendments of 1997 (Public Law 105-98; 111 Stat. 2155). This \n     increase shall be made in such rates and limitations as in \n     effect on November 30, 1998, and shall be by the same \n     percentage that benefit amounts payable under title II of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased \n     effective December 1, 1998, as a result of a determination \n     under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).\n       (3) In the computation of increased dollar amounts pursuant \n     to paragraph (2), any amount which as so computed is not an \n     even multiple of $1 shall be rounded to the next lower whole \n     dollar amount.\n       (b) Special Rule.--The Secretary may adjust \n     administratively, consistent with the increases made under \n     subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation payable \n     to persons within the purview of section 10 of Public Law 85-\n     857 (72 Stat. 1263) who are not in receipt of compensation \n     payable pursuant to chapter 11 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n       (c) Publication Requirement.--At the same time as the \n     matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be \n     published by reason of a determination made under section \n     215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 1998, the Secretary \n     shall publish in the Federal Register the rates and \n     limitations referred to in subsection (a)(2) as increased \n     under this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2274. A bill for relief of Richard M. Barlow of Santa Fe, New \nMexico; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 private relief bill for richard barlow\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I introduce a private relief bill \non behalf of a constituent from Sante Fe, New Mexico, Mr. Richard \nBarlow. It appears to me that his case represents a misuse of authority \nwithin the government in response to a public servant's concern that \nthe Congress receive accurate information about important matters of \nnational security. In recent years, the Congress has adopted measures \nto protect ``whistle blowers'' who step forward to identify grievous \nerrors or abuses that occur within the government. Mr. Barlow's case \ninvolves government reprisal against a man who never actually blew the \nwhistle, but indicated to his superiors that he might do so if they \nfailed to correct misinformation that they had supplied to\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\nthe Congress. Let me provide you with a brief outline of the case that \nI believe justifies filing this bill on his behalf.\n  In the summer of 1989 officials from the Department of Defense \nprovided information to the Congress on the sale of F-16 aircraft to \nPakistan. Mr. Barlow concluded that the information provided was \nincorrect and misleading and indicated to his supervisor that he \nintended to correct that information. What followed is a history of \nreprisal leading to the loss of career, family, and income. The \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) suspended Mr. Barlow's high level security \nclearances and transferred him to other duties, while conducting its \nown investigation into the matter. When that investigation led to DoD's \ndecision to terminate his employment, Mr. Barlow resigned. Because of \nthat experience, Mr. Barlow has had significant personal problems \nincluding the dissolution of his marriage and long periods of under- \nand unemployment.\n  As a constituent, Mr. Barlow asked for our help. In 1993, I asked the \nInspector General of the DoD to review this case to see if it had been \nhandled fairly. Because of the nature of the issue, Inspectors General \n(IG) from DoD, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the State \nDepartment reviewed the matter. The former two concluded that DoD had \nhandled the matter fairly; the IG from the State Department disagreed.\n  Mr. Barlow again appealed for my assistance to enlist the support of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee in investigating the case. Senators \nThurmond and Nunn requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) to \nreview the findings of the IG offices. Last summer, the GAO concluded \nthat there was insufficient evidence to support the findings of the DoD \nand CIA Inspectors General that Mr. Barlow's case had been handled \nfairly.\n  Given those findings, I requested the Secretary of Defense to review \nthe case to determine if Mr. Barlow should be compensated for the \nlosses he incurred. The Secretary replied that, after a careful review, \nno compensation was warranted.\n  Mr. President, I continue to believe that from the evidence I have \nreviewed, Mr. Barlow has been unfairly treated and is worthy of \ncompensation for the price he has paid.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today not only because I \nbelieve a constituent has been wronged, but because this case involves \nan issue that's virtually important to the effective functioning of the \ngovernment. In my view, private relief bills are not undertaken \nlightly. They are appropriate in cases of individuals who have been \nwronged, who have exhausted all possible remedies for resolution, and \nwhose case represents matters of important legal or policy matters. In \nMr. Barlow's case, in order for the Congress to do its job, it must \nrely on timely and accurate information from all the agencies of the \ngovernment, particularly when it involves matters of national security. \nIn 1989 Mr. Barlow was very concerned about efforts in Pakistan to \ninitiate a nuclear weapons program and that the Congress needed to know \nthe full implications of selling nuclear capable F-16 aircraft to \nPakistan. Recent history indicates how important those concerns were.\n  Mr. President, although I believe compensation may be due to Mr. \nBarlow, I believe that such judgments require careful review by those \nexperienced in such matters such as the Court of Claims. The Court will \nreport its findings back to the Senate to guide our deliberations \nbefore determining the outcome of this bill. I hope that the Court will \nperform its review quickly and report their findings to the Senate in \norder for us to resolve this matter before the end of this session of \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMPENSATION OF CERTAIN LOSSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay, \n     out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, \n     to Mr. Richard M. Barlow of Santa Fe, New Mexico, the sum of \n     $1,100,000 for compensation for losses incurred by Mr. \n     Richard M. Barlow relating to and a direct consequence of--\n       (1) personnel actions taken by the Department of Defense \n     affecting Mr. Barlow's employment at the Department \n     (including Mr. Barlow's top secret security clearance) during \n     the period of August 4, 1989, through February 27, 1992; and\n       (2) Mr. Barlow's separation from service with the \n     Department of Defense on February 27, 1992.\n       (b) No Inference of Liability.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed as an inference of liability on the part \n     of the United States.\n       (c) Limitation on Agents and Attorneys Fees.--No more than \n     10 percent of the payment authorized by this Act may be paid \n     to or received by any agent or attorney for services rendered \n     in connection with obtaining such payment, any contact to the \n     contrary notwithstanding. Any person who violates this \n     subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be \n     subject to a fine in the amount provided in title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (d) Non-Taxability of Payment.--The payment authorized by \n     this Act is in partial reimbursement for losses incurred by \n     Mr. Barlow as a result of the personnel actions taken by the \n     Department of Defense and is not subject to Federal, State, \n     or local income taxes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2276. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nEl Camino Real de los Tejas as a National Historic Trail; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    el camino real de los tejas national historic trail act of 1998\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Breaux that is very important to the \nStates of Texas and Louisiana, as well as to our neighboring country of \nMexico. This bill will designate the El Camino Real de los Tejas Trail \nin Texas and Louisiana as a National Historic Trail. This legislation \nis the culmination of efforts by interested parties in Texas, Louisiana \nand Mexico, including legislators and members of academia, to study the \nfeasibility and suitability of designating this exceptional complex of \nroads as part of the National Trails System.\n\n  El Camino Real, comprised of economically important roads in Mexico \nand the United States, was used by Native Americans and the colonial \npowers of Spain, France and England during the seventeenth, eighteenth \nand nineteenth centuries. These viceregal roads were used for \nexploration, conquest, mission supply, settlement, cultural exchange \nand military campaigns, connecting a series of Spanish missions and \nposts between Monclova, Mexico and Los Adaes, the first capital of the \nprovince of Texas, now located in the Red River Valley of Louisiana. In \nthe late seventeenth century, French interests expanded westward from \nthe Mississippi River Valley into Spanish Texas. The official Spanish \nresponse was retaliatory. As a result, routes were extended from Mexico \nnorth and east into Louisiana. The historic remnants of these efforts \ncan be found today at the Spanish outpost of Los Adaes in northwest \nLouisiana and the French frontier post of Fort St. Jean the Baptiste \nnear Natchitoches, Louisiana.\n  El Camino Real de los Tejas, named for the Indian tribes living in \nwhat is now east Texas and northwest Louisiana, begins in Maverick \nCounty, Texas and extends into Sabine and Natchitoches Parishes in \nLouisiana. Historically, the trail was composed of several routes, \nincluding Camino Pita, Upper Presidio Road, Upper Road, Lower Road, \nLower Presidio Road, Camino de en Medio, and the Laredo Road. These \nroads were established beginning in 1689. The Old San Antonio Road, \nsometimes called the Camino de Arriba, the nineteenth century route \nbetween San Antonio and Natchitoches, is a separate road system that in \npart followed El Camino Real and overlaps it in many segments. It was \nused by famous politicians and expansionists, such as Sam Houston and \nDavy Crockett. Altogether, the roads in the United States make up \napproximately 2,500 miles of changing routes in Texas and eighty miles \nin Louisiana. As an important observation, there may well be evidence \nprocured in the future that will show that El Camino Real de los Tejas \nextended all the way to the Natchez Trace.\n  In July, the National Park Service will complete its study of the El \nCamino Real de los Tejas with a positive determination of suitability \nand feasibility for establishment of a national historic trail. This \ncomes after enthusiastic support from the Natchitoches\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\ncommunity, including Northwestern State University and the Louisiana \nDepartment of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. Strong support and \ncontribution to the research and potential of trail designation came \nfrom the Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas Historical \nCommission, consultants, and many others. Trail designation would make \npossible coordination of activities along the length of the trail. It \nalso would mean increased opportunities for coordination with the \nMexican government on respective resource preservation and research, as \nwell as enhanced opportunities for cooperative educational programs and \ntourism related to El Camino Real de los Tejas. The study anticipates \nlittle, if any, federal acquisition of private land, and only on a \nwilling seller basis. Instead, the management of the trail would depend \non cooperative partnerships between the National Park Service and other \nadministering agencies, interested property owners or land managers, \nand other entities.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents truly successful efforts on \nbehalf of the National Park Service and State and local governments and \nassociations to commemorate the settlement of Texas and Louisiana. The \nEl Camino Real de los Tejas will make a fine addition to the National \nTrails System, and I urge its speedy consideration and approval by this \nbody. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``El Camino Real de los Tejas \n     National Historic Trail Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) El Camino Real de los Tejas (the Royal Road to the \n     Tejas), served as the primary route between the Spanish \n     viceregal capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \n     capital of Tejas at Los Adaes (1721-1773) and San Antonio \n     (1773-1821).\n       (2) The seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth \n     century rivalries among the European colonial powers of \n     Spain, France, and England and after their independence, \n     Mexico and the United States, for dominion over lands \n     fronting the Gulf of Mexico, were played out along the \n     evolving travel routes in this immense area.\n       (3) The future of several American Indian nations, whose \n     prehistoric trails were later used by the Spaniards for \n     exploration and colonization, was tied to these larger forces \n     and events and the nations were fully involved in and \n     affected by the complex cultural interactions that ensued.\n       (4) The Old San Antonio Road was a series of routes \n     established in the early 19th century sharing the same \n     corridor and some routes of El Camino Real, and carried \n     American immigrants from the east, contributing to the \n     formation of the Republic of Texas, and its annexation to the \n     United States.\n       (5) The exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, \n     migration, military occupation, religious conversion, and \n     cultural exchange that occurred in a large area of the \n     borderland was facilitated by El Camino Real de los Tejas as \n     it carried Spanish and Mexican influences northeastward, and \n     by its successor, the Old San Antonio Road, which carried \n     American influence westward, during a historic period which \n     extended from 1689 to 1850.\n       (6) The portions of El Camino Real de los Tejas in what is \n     now the United States extended from the Rio Grande near Eagle \n     Pass and Loredo, Texas and involved routes that changed \n     through time, that total almost 2,600 miles in combined \n     length, generally coursing northeasterly through San Antonio, \n     Bastrop, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine in Texas to \n     Natchitoches, Louisiana, a general corridor distance of 550 \n     miles.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(a) is amended--\n       (1) by designating the paragraphs relating to the \n     California National Historic Trail, the Pony Express National \n     Historic Trail, and the Selma to Montgomery National Historic \n     Trail as paragraphs (18), (19), and (20), respectively; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(21) El camino real de los tejas.--\n       ``(A) In general.--El Camino Real de los Tejas (The Royal \n     Road to the Tejas) National Historic Trail, a combination of \n     routes totaling 2,580 miles in length from the Rio Grande \n     near Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas to Natchitoches, Louisiana, \n     and including the Old San Antonio Road, as generally depicted \n     on the maps entitled `El Camino Real de los Tejas', contained \n     in the report prepared pursuant to subjection (b) entitled \n     `National Historic Trail Feasibility Study and Environmental \n     Assessment: El Camino Real de los Tejas, Texas-Louisiana', \n     dated ______ 1998.

A bill to exclude veterans' educational benefits from being \nconsidered a resource in the computation of financial aid; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n          veterans educational benefits protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue which \nis of vital importance to our nation's brave veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  The Montgomery GI bill, which was made permanent on June 1, 1987, \nguarantees basic educational assistance for most persons who are, or \nhave been, members of the Armed Forces or the Selected Reserve for \nsignificant periods of time.\n  The Montgomery GI bill was created to help veterans in their \nreadjustment to civilian life, to aid in recruitment and retention of \nqualified personnel in the Armed Forces, and to develop a more highly \neducated and productive work force.\n  Currently, Montgomery GI benefits are considered ``other financial \naid'' in the determination of need.\n  In other words, when a veteran applies for financial aid, colleges \nand universities are required to consider veterans' educational \nbenefits as a resource when computing the financial award.\n  The ultimate result is that the total financial aid award is reduced.\n  This penalty does not exist for other Americans who serve our \ncountry.\n  The National Community Service Act of 1990 decrees that a national \nservice educational award or post-service benefit shall not be treated \nas financial assistance.\n  Mr. President, this inequity is an affront to the many veterans who \nhave sacrificed to defend our nation from harm.\n  Today, I am introducing the Veterans Educational Benefits Protection \nAct of 1998 to prevent GI bill benefits from being considered a \nresource in the computation of financial aid.\n  Let me read to you from a letter that I received from a Florida \nveteran. He writes:\n\n       I do not think that VA education benefits should be \n     calculated into the financial aid equation for two reasons.\n       First, I paid for the Montgomery GI Bill, albeit only \n     $1200, but more so with a sacrifice of time serving my \n     country.\n       I previously paid for these benefits and am currently being \n     penalized for that through financial aid . . . I did not \n     qualify for any type of federal educational grant this year \n     in part because my veterans benefits were counted as \n     financial aid in my package.\n\n  It's ironic, Mr. President.\n  We created the Montgomery GI bill to reward veterans for their \ndedication to the defense of our liberties.\n  They earn its benefits through years of service and help to finance \nthem through paycheck deduction.\n  But current law unfairly penalizes the 94 percent of veterans who \nsign up for the program and the 40 percent who actually use the \nbenefits to which they are entitled.\n  Our bill will revoke this self-defeating approach and restore common \nsense to this important veterans educational program.\n  If it is enacted, Montgomery GI bill benefits will no longer be \ntreated as other financial assistance for purposes of the need analysis \nformula.\n  This is a critical change.\n  It is well-known and well-documented that education has a dramatic \nimpact on earning potential and employment success.\n  Employees with a college education are more likely to earn higher \nsalaries--and less likely to become unemployed--than those workers who \ndid not advance beyond high school.\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n  Even worse, failure to enact this legislation will harm our efforts \nto attract our best and brightest young people to the armed services.\n  The Department of Defense has identified the Montgomery GI bill as \nits best available recruitment tool.\n  Mr. President, just over fifty years ago, in 1945, tens of thousands \nof American servicemen returned home from defeating totalitarian \naggression around the globe.\n  Because Congress had enacted the original GI bill a year earlier, \nthey arrived with the assurance that the federal government would \nreward their brave defense of freedom and heroic sacrifice with a \nchance for a better life.\n  When Congress passed that first GI bill, it made a covenant with the \nmen and women who put their lives on the line to protect our cherished \nfreedom and democracy.\n  By making it more difficult for veterans to finance higher education \nonce they leave the armed services, current law has undermined that \ncompact.\n  I am confident that the Veterans Education Benefits Protection Act \nwill help us reaffirm our commitment to these courageous Americans, and \ngive veterans access to the higher education that they so richly \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Educational \n     Benefits Protection Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Having served their country with honor, veterans of the \n     Armed Forces deserve the Nation's gratitude and support.\n       (2) Recognizing that education is a key element of economic \n     success and reintegration into civilian life, Congress has \n     for more than 50 years provided aid to veterans seeking \n     postsecondary education.\n       (3) The escalating costs of postsecondary education make \n     veterans more dependent than ever on veterans' educational \n     benefits.\n       (4) Recipients of veterans' educational benefits should not \n     be disadvantaged with respect to any other recipients of \n     Federal educational aid programs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Product \n     Safety and Liability Fairness Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) For too long, the Congress has engaged in a contentious \n     debate over federal product liability legislation without \n     making significant progress in addressing the legitimate \n     concerns of all sides to the debate;\n       (2) As the Congress has always been presented with only the \n     two extreme positions of the proponents and opponents of \n     federal product liability legislation, it is time for a true \n     common sense middle ground;\n       (3) While the opponents of federal product liability \n     legislation contend that there is no need for any reform at \n     all, there is real concern among businesses and others about \n     the effect of the product liability system that Congress \n     should examine;\n       (4) While the proponents of federal product liability \n     legislation speak forcefully about the problem of frivolous \n     lawsuits and slow and costly litigation, the bills supported \n     by the proponents often fail to address these issues while \n     instead placing restrictions and limitations on legitimate \n     claims;\n       (5) While no persons with legitimate claims should be \n     denied redress and their constitutional rights to a trial by \n     jury, and while the product liability system does and must \n     continue to provide valuable deterrence to the manufacture \n     and sale of dangerous or defective products, there is no role \n     in our legal system for frivolous product liability lawsuits;\n       (6) The several states and their courts can and must \n     continue to be the primary architects and regulators of the \n     tort system, with only infrequent and limited intervention by \n     the federal government;\n       (7) If the Congress is to intervene in this traditional \n     province of the states, it should do so only to address real \n     issues while balancing the interest of all sides to the \n     debate;\n       (8) Federal legislation that seeks to limit frivolous \n     product liability lawsuits and which encourages alternative \n     and less costly forms of dispute resolution fits this narrow \n     role for the federal government to take in the area of \n     product liability law.\n\n     SEC. 2.

STATUTE OF REPOSE BEYOND USEFUL SAFE LIFE IN \n                   PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in Subsection (a)(2), \n     in any civil action subject to this Act against a product \n     manufacturer or seller for harm caused by a product that is a \n     capital good, such defendant shall not be liable for damages \n     if the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that the harm was caused by use of the product after its \n     useful safe life.\n       (1) In determining the useful safe life of the product, the \n     trier of fact shall consider, among other things, the \n     following:\n       (A) the number of years the product has been in use and the \n     frequency of product use;\n       (B) the average age of similar or like products still in \n     similar uses;\n       (C) the normal practices of the product user, similar \n     product users, and the product manufacturer or seller with \n     respect to the circumstances, frequency, and purposes of the \n     use of the product;\n       (D) any representations, instructions, or warnings made by \n     the product manufacturer or seller concerning the proper use \n     of the product or the expected useful safe life of the \n     product; and\n       (E) any modification or alteration of the product by a user \n     or third party.\n       (2) A product manufacturer or seller may be liable for \n     damages caused by a product used beyond its useful safe life \n     if:\n       (A) the product manufacturer or seller expressly or implied \n     warranted that the product may be utilized safely for a \n     longer period; or\n       (B) the product manufacturer or seller intentionally \n     misrepresented facts about the product, or fraudulently \n     concealed information about the product, and such conduct was \n     a substantial cause of the claimant's damages.\n       (b) Presumption Regarding Useful Safe Life.--If the harm \n     was caused more than twenty (20) years after the time of \n     delivery, a presumption arises that the harm was caused by \n     use of the product after its useful safe life. This \n     presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of evidence.\n\n               TITLE VI--PRODUCT LIABILITY CLASS ACTIONS\n\n     SEC. 601 NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n                   CERTIFICATION OR SETTLEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part V of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after chapter 113 the following new \n     chapter:\n\n              CHAPTER 114--PRODUCT LIABILITY CLASS ACTIONS\n\nSec. 1711.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on Senate \naction last month on S. 1415, the comprehensive tobacco settlement \nlegislation, and to explain the votes I cast on various amendments, \nmotions to invoke cloture, and other procedural matters relating to \nthis legislation.\n  At the outset, I would like to thank the floor manager of the \nlegislation, Senator McCain, for his absolutely outstanding work on the \ntobacco settlement legislation. As Chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Arizona took on the difficult \ntask of bringing our Committee together to report out comprehensive \ntobacco settlement legislation.\n  Mr. President, I believe that passing a tobacco bill would be good, \nbut only if it is the right bill. In my judgment, if we are to pass \nsuch a bill, it should follow a number of important principles. First, \nit should increase funding for research on tobacco-related illnesses. \nSecond, it should provide funds for smoking cessation programs, anti-\ntobacco education programs, and counter-advertising. Third, it should \ninclude programs to combat drug abuse among our kids, a crisis that \ndemands just as much attention as youth smoking. Fourth, it should not \nplace unfair burdens on our small businesses. And finally, it should \naccomplish these goals without imposing a huge net tax increase on the \nAmerican people.\n  Last summer, the tobacco industry started this process when it \nentered into a settlement with the Attorneys General of several States, \na settlement which required congressional action. I voted to report out \nthis legislation from the Commerce Committee, with the hope that it \ncould be modified in ways to achieve the above-stated goals through \nmore amendments to the legislation, through consideration in the House, \nand through an eventual conference. While many improvements were added \nto the legislation--such as the addition of the Coverdell-Craig-Abraham \n``Drug Free Neighborhoods Act'' and the Gramm amendment to reduce the \nmarriage penalty tax--more were clearly needed to achieve the goals set \nforth above.\n  My vote for cloture was designed to move the process ahead in the \nhope that we could pass a bill and that it would meet the standards set \nforth above. It did not signal my intent to vote for final passage of \nany legislation that remained following the amendment process. Had \ncloture succeeded, it was my intention to work with others in offering \namendments to modify the bill to achieve my aforestated goals.\n  Following the failure to invoke cloture, it became clear that we were \nnot going to be able to move the bill forward in the way I would have \nliked. In light of this, and my belief as a member of the Budget \nCommittee that we should keep the budget balanced, I voted with Senator \nStevens on his budget point of order. Senator Stevens raised a point of \norder that the tobacco legislation was inconsistent with the budget \nagreement reached last year between the Congress and the President. I \nvoted against the motion to waive that point of order, which sent the \nlegislation back to the Commerce Committee where, perhaps, we can \ndevise a more acceptable bill.\n  Mr. President, let me just comment briefly on some of the major \namendments that were voted on during the course of the floor \nconsideration of this bill.\n  I joined Senators Craig and Coverdell in offering the ``Drug Free \nNeighborhoods Act'' as an amendment to the tobacco legislation. We are \nfalling very far behind in the war on drugs, and teenage drug use has \nparticularly become much worse in recent years. In the last six years, \nfor instance, the percentage of high school seniors admitting that they \nhad used an illicit drug has risen by more than half. Sadly, nearly 20 \npercent of our eighth graders\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\nuse illegal drugs. This amendment provided needed resources for drug \ninterdiction and deterrence and particularly addressed the alarming \ntrends in drug use among teenagers. As we address the harmful health \nconsequences of tobacco, we need to also remember that drug use among \nteenagers is worsening and is even more unhealthy, dangerous, and \nunacceptable.\n  I voted for Senator Gramm's amendment to reduce the size of the net \ntax increase proposed in the bill by reducing the marriage penalty tax \nfor working families earning less than $30,000. Under the bill as \nreported out of Committee, the burden of the price or tax increase from \n65 cents to $1.10 per pack of cigarettes would have fallen \ndisproportionately on working class Americans. I believed that we ought \nto give some of this revenue back in the form of relief from the unfair \nmarriage penalty tax, which requires married people to pay higher taxes \nthan they would if they were single.\n  On the Reed amendment, which would have denied the advertising \ndeduction for any business found in violation of FDA tobacco \nadvertising regulations, I opposed this amendment and felt that the \nlegislation had begun to stray further away from the core goals that \nshould concern the Congress. Under that amendment, which was narrowly \nadopted, if the FDA finds that one advertisement of a tobacco product \nfailed to comply with marketing and advertising rules issued by the FDA \nnearly two years ago and still under litigation, the offending company \nwould lose the entire business expense deduction for all of its \nadvertising in that year. The Congress should not be giving the FDA or \nany other regulatory agency such expansive and punitive authority. The \npossibility of such a penalty could chill advertising and deter \nlegitimate, protected speech. In my view, this raises serious \nconstitutional concerns and liberty interests that should at the \nminimum be seriously considered in the appropriate committees. This is \nunsound public policy, unsound tax policy, and an unwise expansion of \nfederal regulatory authority. It also sets poor precedent and raises \nconstitutional concerns. No matter what we think of the uses of \nadvertising, the Constitution protects the right of free speech.\n  I supported Senator Gregg's amendment to eliminate the liability caps \nthat had been included in the manager's amendment. I had concerns about \nour taking action to limit the liability of the tobacco industry \nwithout enacting other legal reforms that are desperately needed by so \nmany industries. I found it highly incongruous that we would not extend \nthe same liability protections to industries that produce life-saving \nproducts as we do for the tobacco industry.\n  For example, I would have liked to see us include reforms to permit \nthe development and manufacturing of beneficial products, such as \npacemakers and other medical devices. Too often, biomaterials needed to \nmanufacture those products have been unavailable due to litigation \nconcerns. I had supported Senator Ashcroft's amendment in the Commerce \nCommittee that would have added the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act \nto the tobacco settlement legislation. The biomaterials legislation, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, offers liability protections to manufacturers \nof biomaterials, which are needed to produce life-saving devices but \nwhich have been tragically unavailable in some instances because of \nlitigation concerns. Such important health-related legislation as the \nbiomaterials bill would be appropriate to include as part of tobacco \nsettlement legislation, and, in my view, should in fact be directly \nlinked to and included in the legislation.\n  In summary, I would like to again commend my colleagues for their \nhard work on the legislation and the majority leader for bringing this \nimportant legislation to the floor and giving the full Senate ample \nopportunity to debate and consider the bill. While I had hoped we could \ncome together on the issue, I think it became far more complex than any \nof us had imagined. A number of amendments, many of which I supported, \nchanged the nature of the legislation so fundamentally that the \nlegislation really must be revisited from square one. With almost no \nrestrictions on payments for damages and penalties, for instance, it \nbecame clear that the industry would never agree to voluntary \nadvertising restrictions. In my view, tobacco advertising is one of the \nmost powerful factors in influencing the decisions of teenagers with \nrespect to smoking, and it was one of the key parts of that legislation \nthat we were not going to get.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues on this issue, and with my \nown Governor and state legislature. I am pleased that Leader Lott is \nconsidering setting up a bipartisan task force to revisit this \nimportant issue. There is much that can still be done on it, and I \nbelieve that we have learned a great deal in going through this process \nonce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7693-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE BREAST CANCER STAMP\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was concerned to learn this \nmorning that the IRS will not allow individuals who purchase a special \nstamp intended to raise funds for breast cancer research to list the \ndonation as a charitable gift for tax deduction purposes.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation that authorized the US Postal \nService to issue a stamp priced at 40 cents, with the additional 8 \ncents going to the National Institute of Health and the Department of \nDefense to fund breast cancer research. The clear intent of my \nlegislation was that gifts made to fund breast cancer research through \nthe purchase of the breast cancer stamp are to be considered as a \ncharitable donation. For the IRS to treat them in any other way \nviolates the spirit of the law.\n  Breast cancer is one of the greatest health risks facing America \ntoday. More than 2.6 million women are living with breast cancer right \nnow, one million of them have yet to be diagnosed. Breast cancer is \nstill the number one killer of women between the ages of 35 and 52. The \ndisease claims another woman's life every 12 minutes in the U.S.\n  Despite increases in the last few years, research dollars are still \ndesperately needed to fund cancer research. In 1996, the National \nCancer Institute could fund only 26% of the research grant \napplications, a decline from 60% in the 1970's.\n  Clearly, there needs to be innovative ways to offset this reduction \nin research spending. The breast cancer stamp is one such idea. It has \nthe potential to raise millions of badly needed cancer research \ndollars. I am disturbed that the IRS has chosen to make it more \ndifficult to raise this money. My legislation was designed to encourage \ncontributions for breast cancer research and I hope the IRS will help \nfulfill its intent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7694-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7694-S7695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. BRUCE CANADAY\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am happy to announce that one \nof North Carolina's own has been elected president of the American \nSociety of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). As president for the 1998-\n1999 season, Dr. Bruce R. Canaday, Pharm.D., FASHP will lead the \nnation's pharmacists in developing new and innovative patient care \nmethods. His job will also include representing pharmacists from an \narray of varying disciplines such as hospitals, health maintenance \norganizations, long-term care facilities and home health care to name \njust a few.\n  After earning his B.S. in pharmacy from Purdue University, Dr. \nCanaday went on to earn his Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the \nUniversity of Tennessee. Dr. Canaday's previous experience include \nserving as Chair of the ASHP House of Delegates and member of the Board \nof Directors, and as president of the North Carolina Society of Health-\nSystem Pharmacists.\n  When Dr. Canaday is not teaching future pharmacists under his title--\nClinical Professor--at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, \nhe is working as Director of the Department of Pharmacotherapy for the \nCoastal Area Health Education Centers in Wilmington, N.C. At both the \ncoastal centers and at UNC, Dr. Canaday's contributions to the field of \npharmacy have taught pharmacy students the information necessary for \ndelivering effective and efficient healthcare to those in need.\n  Mr. President, if those credentials are not enough for my colleagues \nto\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nget a good idea of all this fine North Carolinian has done and \ncontinues to do, may I add that Dr. Canaday is a board certified \npharmacotherapy specialist. As a specialist, he maintains a clinical \npractice at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in New Hanover, \nTennessee.\n  I am confident, Mr. President, that Dr. Canaday will do a fine job \nand be a successful leader for the American Pharmacy. Good leadership \nis important. And I think it is especially true today because of the \ncomplexity and command that healthcare and healthcare reform has in \nthis evolutionary age.\n  Mr. President, North Carolina continues to be blessed by the \noutstanding achievements of its men and women. The rise of Dr. Bruce R. \nCanaday to president of the American Society of Health-System \nPharmacists is a recent example. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin congratulating Dr. Canaday for his latest achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7694-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SHOLL'S COLONIAL CAFETERIA\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to salute Washington, DC's beloved Sholl's Colonial \nCafeteria for 70 years of prospering business and never-ending \ndedication to its customers and employees. People have come from all \naround the world simply for a sampling of Sholl's down home hospitality \nand great food.\n  I cannot count the number of meals I have eaten at this Washington \ninstitution, but as I am sure many of you who have also visited this \nlandmark know, the memories of dining at Sholl's are endless. Each \nperson who has dined at Sholl's has their own memory of what has made \nit so special to them. For some it was simply a piece of their apple or \nrhubarb pie. For others it was the unique experience of dining amongst \nclose friends, colleagues or even new friends you made during a visit.\n  But for everyone who has frequented Sholl's, there are fond memories \nof the wonderful people who worked at this restaurant and made it such \nan enjoyable place to start or end your day. The friendly hello from \nthe late Evan Sholl, Cafeteria founder, and his beloved wife, Gertrude, \nor their son-in-law and current proprietor, George Fleishell has kept \nus all returning to Sholl's over the years.\n  Patrons of Sholl's have described members of the Sholl family, who \nhave owned and operated Sholl's over the last 70 years, as having the \nbiggest hearts in Washington.\n  Sholl's is not just a business. It is more like a home where friends \nmeet regularly to get together and enjoy some good food and have a good \ntime. Whenever I dine at Sholl's, it is like going to dinner at a \nfriend's house.\n  I have enjoyed eating at Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria for many years--\nsince the days when I was an intern in 1963 until today. I hope that we \nwill all be able to enjoy many more home cooked meals at Sholl's \nCafeteria for many more years to come.\n  Recently reporter James P. McGrath chronicled the ``70 Years of \nNourishing Body and Soul'' of Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria in an article \nin the Washington Post. I ask for unanimous consent that this \ninspirational story of hard work, perseverance and determination be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 15, 1998]\n\n                         (By James P. McGrath)\n\n       Most city dwellers of a certain age have fond memories of a \n     great cafeteria they patronized at some point in their lives. \n     Given the velocity and scope of urban redevelopment, however, \n     many of those grand, old dining palaces are gone, but, \n     happily, the flagship of them all survives: Sholl's Colonial \n     Cafeteria at K and 20th streets NW in downtown Washington. \n     Although the Sholl's at Vermont and K closed in 1984, the \n     Sholl's cafeteria a half-dozen blocks away managed to \n     survive, and today it celebrates its 70th year of operation.\n       In this city of monuments, Sholl's is a monument unto \n     itself. Long before multiculturalism came into fashion, \n     diversity was its hallmark. Its current staff of 40 \n     represents 17 nations, and at one time or another, every \n     Latin American country has had a representative on staff.\n       Humanity, generosity and kindness also have been Sholl's \n     standards. A family atmosphere permeates the place--from the \n     lounge at the entrance, to the vastly long steam table laden \n     with delectable food, to the huge dining room, where \n     customers can seek out a seat in their favorite nook or \n     cranny.\n       Sholl's is not interested in political correctness, and it \n     makes no bones about its religious sentiments. While its \n     owners don't proselytize, neither do they hide their \n     convictions. On a simple plate in the cafeteria lobby is a \n     supply of `grace-before-meals' prayer cards, featuring \n     Protestant, Catholic and Jewish devotions. Cafeteria founder \n     Evan Sholl and his beloved wife, Gertrude, both devout \n     Catholics, regularly invited visiting clergy of all \n     denominations for complimentary meals.\n       Those meals were and are as basic and all-American as apple \n     pie (and, boy, what delicious apple pie Sholl's makes). The \n     cafeteria's famous powder-milk biscuits are world-class (eat \n     your heart out, Garrison Keillor). Food preparation at \n     Sholl's emphasizes freshness too, with all items prepared \n     daily from scratch, on the premises, in as-needed quantities, \n     with no leftovers for the next day.\n       Some might consider such Sholl's fare `square,' but the \n     cafeteria routinely ranks among Phyllis Richman's `Best 50 \n     Restaurants in Washington.' In an Oct. 19 review, The Post's \n     food critic wrote, `Every city needs a down-home cafeteria, \n     and few have one with more character than Sholl's. It's been \n     a D.C. fixture . . . long enough to qualify for Medicare. . . \n     .'\n       Sholl's has attracted its share of notables over its long \n     career. When Harry S. Truman was vice president, he enjoyed \n     dining there, as did H. L. Hunt, the parsimonious billionaire \n     from Dallas. It is easy to imagine Truman and Hunt sitting \n     across from one another and enjoying a good old fashioned \n     `rhubarb.' That, of course, would be rhubarb pie, a daily \n     Sholl's delicacy.\n       The late Evan Sholl, who died in 1983 at the age of 85, and \n     his son-in-law and current proprietor, George Fleishell, are \n     responsible for the cafeteria's amalgam of great food and \n     good works. Both gentlemen have dispensed generosity, \n     wholesale and retail. The amount of free food distributed by \n     Sholl's over the years would have fed an army many times \n     over. In addition, shortly before his death, Evan Sholl \n     distributed a year's profits in bonuses to his employees on \n     the basis of $100 for each year of service.\n       Many believe that a nation's greatness is best measured by \n     how it treats its old, its disabled and its young. Using that \n     yardstick as a standard, also has earned high marks, giving \n     meal passes to the needy, many of them elderly and/or \n     disabled, and donating thousands of food baskets to the poor \n     at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The cafeteria keeps its prices \n     down too, and low-, modest- and fixed-income people, many of \n     whom are elderly, flock to the cafeteria. Dining room \n     employees gently guide infirm customers to convenient tables, \n     carry their trays for them and routinely decline tips.\n       Sholl's is popular with the young and hale too. Tourist \n     buses, looking for the best food buy for the buck, routinely \n     drop off throngs of kids at the cafeteria's doors, and from \n     the decibel level, the kids seem to be having a whale of a \n     time.\n       The dining room walls at Sholl's are covered with wonderful \n     memorabilia and pictures of yesteryear as well as awards from \n     the food industry and other organizations. The one that says \n     it best, however, is from the Cosmopolitan Club, which \n     saluted Evan Sholl in 1982 as `the citizen who has performed \n     the most outstanding, unselfish service to the Washington \n     Metropolitan Community.'\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7695-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7695-S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         JERUSALEM POST EDITORIAL ON AMENDING THE PLO COVENANT\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there is much discussion in the news \nabout the slow progress of the Middle East Peace Process. \nUnfortunately, much of the criticism is pointed at Israel's Prime \nMinister Benyamin Netanyahu. I was pleased to read, however, the \nJerusalem Post's editorial of July 6 titled\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\n``The Missing Summit'' which correctly identifies Arafat's failure to \nrevise the PLO Covenant as a major obstacle to peace. The editorial \nreads as follows:\n\n       The summer heat tends to slow everything down, even \n     diplomacy. In the absence of real movement in the peace \n     process, talk of summits is proliferating. Prime Minister \n     Binyamin Netanyahu has unsuccessfully pushed for a ``Madrid \n     2'' international conference, France and Egypt have a \n     proposal, and yesterday Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, \n     Jordan's King Hussein, and Palestinian Authority Chairman \n     Yasser Arafat met in Cairo. However, the only summit missing \n     is the one that is most necessary--between Netanyahu and \n     Arafat.\n       When Mubarak, Hussein, and Arafat last met in September, \n     they could hardly have expected that by now there would still \n     be no deal on the much-anticipated second redeployment. Much \n     of the blame for delay has fallen on Netanyahu's doorstep, \n     and indeed Netanyahu seems to be a master at drawing matters \n     out. Next to Arafat, however, Netanyahu's delaying skills \n     seem almost amateur.\n       In the current stalemate, one of the main issues in \n     contention is Israel's demand that the Palestinians amend the \n     PLO Covenant to erase its multiple calls for Israel's \n     destruction. Arafat's promise to do so is as old as the Oslo \n     process itself. The Oslo era officially began with an \n     exchange of letters between prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and \n     Arafat, days before the signing of the Declaration of \n     Principles on the White House lawn. Arafat's September 9, \n     1993 letter to Rabin states the Covenant's denials of \n     Israel's right to exist ``are now inoperative'' and that he \n     pledges to ``submit to the Palestinian National Council for \n     formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the \n     Palestinian Covenant.''\n       At that time, amending the Covenant seemed imminent. It is \n     now almost six years later, and Arafat's commitment is yet to \n     be implemented. In April 1996, the Peres government attempted \n     to negotiate a formula to resolve the issue, but the \n     resolution actually passed by the PNC again made no specific \n     amendment to the Covenant. Then in January 1997, as part of \n     the Hebron Accords, Arafat again committed to ``complete the \n     process'' of amending the Covenant.\n       Since then, Arafat has sent letters to President Bill \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair retroactively listing \n     the articles of the Covenant that were supposedly canceled by \n     the 1996 PNC resolution. But this, too, can only be taken as \n     a statement of intentions, since the Covenant states that it \n     can only be amended by a two-thirds vote of the PNC, and \n     numerous PLO officials have stated that it has been \n     ``frozen,'' not amended. Now Netanyahu is seen to be delaying \n     matters by demanding that the Palestinians finally carry out \n     a commitment that is a foundation stone of the entire \n     process.\n       Since the beginning of the Oslo process, Israel has--\n     despite fits and starts, internal division, and even the \n     assassination of the prime minister--demonstrated its \n     commitment to the process by transferring territorial control \n     to the Palestinians. Even under Netanyahu, this process \n     continued with the redeployment in Hebron, and now a major \n     further redeployment is on the table. In this context, it is \n     not unreasonable to characterize the situation as Netanyahu \n     did to the diplomatic corps on Friday: ``The issue is not \n     what Israel is prepared to give--it is prepared to give \n     considerably--but it is the Palestinians' unwillingness to \n     give anything of substance.''\n       In the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian Police cut off \n     Israeli settlements after the IDF refused passage on an \n     Israeli security road to a convoy led by a Palestinian \n     minister. The standoff, which could have broken out into a \n     full-fledged shooting war, was a reminder of how dangerous \n     the current situation is. But the lesson is not just that \n     Israel has an interest in resolving the existing impasse, but \n     that the Palestinians do as well.\n       Now that Clinton has returned from China and the end of the \n     Knesset summer session approaches, the fate of the \n     redeployment package will be determined. So far, the United \n     States has not rejected Israel's concerns regarding the \n     package on the table, but it has not subjected the \n     Palestinians to the same public pressure that Israel has been \n     under. The sticking point is no longer the size of the \n     redeployment, since creative solutions can be found for the \n     territory surrounding the Israeli settlements that will be \n     isolated by the withdrawal. The more significant question is \n     whether Arafat will be pressed to deliver something much less \n     tangible than what Israel is delivering, but no less \n     necessary for the ultimate success of the peace process. \n     Amending the Covenant is such a fundamental building block, \n     as is an end to the long boycott by Arafat of direct \n     negotiations with Netanyahu.\n\n  Mr. President, the Palestinian Authority has promised since 1993 to \nchange the PLO Covenant so that the Israeli people can be confident in \nthe Palestinian regime's acceptance of the existence of the State of \nIsrael. To this day, this most basic and vital action has not been \ndone. As the Jerusalem Post correctly points out, the U.S. Government \nhas ``. . . not subjected the Palestinians to the same public pressure \nthat Israel has been under.''\n  The Palestinian Authority must formally and officially amend the \nCovenant. Until they do so, United States influence should be focused \non this failed Palestinian promise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7695-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE DEROSSI AND SON COMPANY\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nDeRossi and Son Company, which has been recently honored by the Small \nBusiness Administration. DeRossi and Son Company was nominated as the \nRegional Small Business Prime Contractor of the Year and recognized as \none of the top small business prime contractors in the State of New \nJersey. As a result of this nomination, DeRossi and Son has earned the \nU.S. Small Business Administration ``Administrator's Award for \nExcellence'' certificate. It is a pleasure for me to be able to note \nthese accomplishments and congratulate DeRossi and Son on a job well \ndone.\n  Since 1926, when Angelo and Dominick DeRossi founded the company, \nDeRossi and Son has manufactured military dress coats for the United \nStates Government. The company provided clothing for the United States \nArmed Forces during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. \nDeRossi and Son has a long history of excellence, beginning in 1943 \nwhen it received the Army Navy E Award during World War II. This was an \naward issued for excellence in production and quality during the war. \nMr. DeRossi believes that the success of the company is due to the \ntraining he received from his grandfather and father and to the great \ndedication and effort his staff and employees have in serving the \ncustomer.\n  Small businesses face enormous odds for success in the corporate \nworld. There are tremendous obstacles every day, yet DeRossi and Son \nhas been able to rise above adversity. This award is a wonderful \ntestament to its strength and perseverance among small businesses in \nthe State of New Jersey and across the country. Few companies are able \nto make this claim, and I am honored to be able to say that one has \nbeen from my home state.\n  Both the DeRossi Family, and the company they built over the last \nseventy-two years, are excellent examples of an immigrant success \nstory. The DeRossi Family's contributions have done much for the future \nof the town of Vineland, the State of New Jersey, and the United States \nas a whole. I congratulate DeRossi and Son on a job well done, and I \nwish both them and their employees the best of luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7696-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7696-S7697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CRIME VICTIMS WITH DISABILITIES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues \nSenator DeWine and Senator Leahy in sponsoring the Crime Victims with \nDisabilities Awareness Act. This legislation will help us better \nunderstand and prevent crimes against Americans with disabilities.\n  Mr. President, Americans with disabilities are four to ten times as \nlikely as other Americans to be the victims of crimes. That means that \n54 million Americans are at increased risk of victimization because \nthey suffer from one or more disabilities.\n  We have long known that criminals are opportunists, and that they \ntarget the weakest members of society for exploitation. As a result we \nhave initiated programs to heighten public awareness of crime against \nwomen, children, and the elderly. Americans with developmental \ndisabilities deserve the same consideration.\n  Many disabled Americans have been the victims of crime, Mr. \nPresident. Indeed, many of these Americans have been repeat victims \nbecause their condition renders them less likely to report incidents to \nthe proper authorities.\n  If some Americans are unsafe from crime, Mr. President, all Americans \nare unsafe. Criminals who prey on the disabled are not only showing \ntheir lack of morality and victimizing a particularly vulnerable \nsegment of our society, they are degrading our entire nation. To the \nextent they are allowed to continue their criminal activities they \nendanger all Americans.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It will direct the \nAttorney General, in conjunction with the National Research Council, to \ndevelop a\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nresearch program to help us better understand and prevent crimes \nagainst the disabled. It also directs the Attorney General to include \nin the annual National Crime Victims Survey statistics regarding crimes \nagainst victims with developmental disabilities.\n  These measures, Mr. President, will help us to heighten awareness of \ncrime against the disabled and help us put a stop to it. It will help \nus to make our streets and our homes safer for all Americans by \nprotecting the most vulnerable among us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7696-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR. NILS DAULAIRE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when most of us think about health \nwe think about it on a personal or local level. Perhaps a child is \nsuffering from an ear infection or an outbreak of chicken pox has \nemptied the local elementary school. But when Dr. Nils Daulaire thinks \nabout health it is from a global perspective, and I am delighted to \nreport that Nils was recently named the next President and CEO of the \nNational Council for International Health.\n  I have known Nils for many years. He is a fellow Vermonter and a \ntrusted friend whose advice I have valued enormously. Nils' boundless \nenergy and devotion to helping others is an inspiration to everyone who \nknows him. He is as comfortable tending to a sick child in a remote \nvillage in Nepal as he is representing the United States Government in \ninternational health policy negotiations. Over the years, Nils has \nearned a reputation as a leading authority in the public health field.\n  During his tenure as Senior Health Adviser at the Agency for \nInternational Development, Nils worked to ensure that international \nhealth is a major focus of AID's efforts worldwide. He played a central \nrole in convening a conference of health agencies and organizations to \ndevelop a multi-year U.S. strategy to strengthen global surveillance \nand control of infectious disease. Nils' leadership was instrumental in \nthe strategy that emerged from that conference, which should, over \ntime, result in a significant reduction in the number of deaths from \ninfectious disease. As the new head of NCIH whose membership includes \nover 1,000 medical professionals and organizations, Nils' continued \ninvolvement in this initiative will be critical to its success.\n  The NCIH's mission to improve global health is a monumental task. I \ncannot think of a person more capable of leading NCIH into the next \ncentury than Nils Daulaire. He is a straight talker and he knows what \nhe is talking about. He understands the medical issues and he \nunderstands the political issues. Once Nils begins his new job on \nAugust 1, NCIH's operations will be split between Nils in Vermont and \nhis other capable staff in Washington. I look forward to continuing our \nclose working relationship on infectious disease, on maternal health, \nand other important issues.\n  Mr. President a June 24, 1998, article in the Washington Post \ndescribed Nils Daulaire's contribution to the field of international \nhealth. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 1998]\n\n                  A Man to Make Health a Global Issue\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Nils Daulaire, the U.S. government's leading authority on \n     international health, is leaving his post as senior health \n     adviser to the Agency for International Development to become \n     president and CEO of the National Council on International \n     Health.\n       The NCIH is an organization of more than 1,000 medical \n     professionals and organizations; pharmaceutical companies \n     such as Merck and Becton Dickinson & Co.; government agencies \n     such as the Peace Corps and the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention; international relief organizations such as \n     CARE, Save the Children and Project Hope; Planned Parenthood; \n     religious relief agencies; and universities such as Harvard \n     and John Hopkins. It receives funding from the MacArthur, \n     Kellogg, Ford and Turner foundations, and some government \n     financing.\n       Based in the United States, its mission is to advance \n     policies and programs that improve health around the world. \n     But a recent blue-ribbon panel headed by former surgeon \n     general C. Everett Koop recommended a major restructuring of \n     the organization. The new NCIH will focus on the need for \n     improving global health and making health one of the \n     cornerstones of globalization, on a par with international \n     trade, currency flows and information and communication. A \n     32-member board is being replaced by a smaller board where \n     leading medical experts can cross-fertilize ideas with \n     experts in development and leaders in the private sector.\n       The Koop report also recommended hiring a president and CEO \n     with international stature, which the board has done: \n     Daulaire, 49, is a Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude \n     graduate of Harvard College and received his medical degree \n     from Harvard Medical School. He has a master's in public \n     health from Johns Hopkins. He has spent two decades in \n     fieldwork, including five years in Nepal, and has provided \n     technical assistance in more than 20 countries. He speaks \n     seven languages.\n       He was the lead U.S. negotiator at the Cairo International \n     Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Beijing \n     World Conference on Women in 1995 and the Rome World Food \n     Summit in 1996. He has represented the United States in the \n     last five World Health Organization assemblies and was \n     helpful in the election of Gro Brundtland, former prime \n     minister of Norway, to be director general-elect of WHO with \n     a mission to revitalize it.\n       New leadership of both of these organizations holds \n     enormous potential for putting health at the center of \n     efforts to improve living conditions around the world. NCIH \n     plans to change its name to the Global Health Council and \n     aims to become, within five years, the preeminent \n     nongovernmental source of information, practical experience, \n     analysis and public advocacy for the most pressing global \n     health issues.\n       ``You can get more done from the outside than the inside,'' \n     Daulaire says. ``In terms of my work over the last five \n     years, if I had had an outside organization that was highly \n     effective in explaining things to the public, tying people \n     together, involving the private sector, it would have made my \n     job much more effective. When you look at the whole movement \n     toward a globalized economy, you can't have enormous \n     differentials in health status. You can't have disruption of \n     economies and trade due to the spread of disease.\n       ``A reason disease is uncorrected is people accept it as \n     natural,'' Daulaire says. ``One of the consequences of the \n     global communications revolution is people [elsewhere] will \n     be aware of how good we have it. They will see their poor \n     conditions and have an awareness that this is not a necessary \n     condition.''\n       When he first arrived in Nepal 20 years ago, ``I thought \n     I'd landed in the 14th century. Kids had never seen a wheeled \n     vehicle. When I went back five years ago, there were \n     satellite dishes and cellular phones.'' The use of \n     information technology as a tool for health care workers and \n     educating people in poor, rural areas has led to astounding \n     changes in the last 15 years, he says.\n       Currently, the council's top health priorities are AIDS, \n     maternal health, family planning and infectious diseases. It \n     plans to increase public and private funding to improve \n     effectiveness in these areas through sharing information \n     about what works best. Using cutting-edge technology and \n     communication is a key component of its plans. It plans to be \n     ready for emerging diseases.\n       Daulaire believes the damage to foreign assistance programs \n     by congressional budget hackers has to be reversed, but he \n     also recalls a conversation with a staffer who works for a \n     prominent Republican. He bluntly told Daulaire that these \n     programs may be the right things to do but they have no \n     constituency and so they were ``going to get hammered.''\n       The new NCIH plans to develop that constituency so that \n     people, governments and the private sector understand that \n     countries can't participate in the global economy when they \n     are dragged down by health care costs that can be avoided. \n     Daulaire sees a major role for the private sector in \n     promoting global health, and already Becton Dickinson & Co., \n     a multinational medical technology company, has indicated a \n     keen interest in developing a major partnership with the new \n     NCIH.\n       Daulaire's appointment is to be announced officially \n     tomorrow at the NCIH's 25th annual meeting. He takes office \n     Aug. 1, bringing to the post a rare blend of medical \n     expertise, optimism, fieldwork, knowledge of bureaucracies, a \n     network of relationships with health experts and politicians \n     around the world, and an unusual ability to articulate \n     complicated health and development issues to the media.\n       Global health is not them; it is all of us. Daulaire is the \n     person to move that principle into the center of efforts to \n     raise standards of living around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7697-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7697-S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING AN IDAHO CIVIC LEADER\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \nIdahoan who has distinguished himself in both the public and private \nsector.\n  Kirk Sullivan is retiring after 27 years with the Boise Cascade \nCorporation. But to simply say that Kirk enjoyed a long and productive \ncareer with a company is not adequate and doesn't do this outstanding \nindividual justice.\n  While not a native Idahoan, Kirk has worked most of his adult life to \nmake the state a better place to live. And over the years he's \ndedicated himself to helping others.\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\n  Idaho's children are of particular interest to Kirk. He has used his \neducation and business experience to act as a tremendous resource to \nour children, from elementary school to the university level.\n  As an active member of the Business Week Foundation, Kirk served as a \nmentor to Idaho high school students eager to learn how business \noperates and how to be successful in the workplace.\n  As the founder of the Bishop Kelly Foundation, Kirk raised money for \nBoise's private high school.\n  Kirk has not just played a supporting role in those ventures, nor in \nothers. When Kirk sets out to do something, he takes charge. He \nactively raised money for the Children's Home Society of Idaho, he is \nleading a $500,000 fund drive for the Boise Master Chorale, and he \nraises funds for the University of Idaho.\n  Kirk's boundless energy is contagious. I have seen him take on so \nmany different issues and set lofty goals. He doesn't know the word \n``no.'' When he's asked to do something, it is always ``yes.'' I've \nseen him gather some of the very talented people in the state of Idaho \nand tackle some of these major projects and come up with major results. \nIt is so invigorating to see how he weaves your magic.\n  In fact, even though Kirk Sullivan is not an alumnus of the \nUniversity of Idaho, he has received the school's Presidential Citation \nfor giving to the University and its community.\n  I must add, Mr. President, that the University of Idaho is not the \nonly beneficiary of Kirk Sullivan's efforts and enthusiasm. He has \nserved as President of the Bronco Athletic Association at Boise State \nUniversity and is currently a member of the Commission on the Future of \nClemson University, his alma mater. He also is on Clemson's College of \nEngineering and Science Leadership Committee, with a fundraising goal \nof $100 million.\n  So you can see, Mr. President, that Kirk and his wife, Betty, are \nvaluable assets and cherished members of our community.\n  While Kirk is retiring, I'm confident in the knowledge that his good \nworks and commitment to his state will never wane. Idaho is a much \nbetter place because of the dedication and tireless efforts of Kirk \nSullivan.\n  I take pride in congratulating him today, and I know all Idahoans \nsalute him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7697-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IOWA'S BILL FITCH\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our former colleague, Senator John \nCulver of Iowa, brought to my attention an article, which recently \nappeared in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, about Bill Fitch. Mr. Fitch was \nan outstanding athlete when he attended Cedar Rapids' Wilson High \nSchool and, also, during his college years at Coe College in Cedar \nRapids. Later on, Mr. Fitch coached at Coe College, Creighton \nUniversity (where he coached Bob Gibson, the famous baseball pitcher), \nand North Dakota (where he coached Phil Jackson, now coach of the \nChicago Bulls). He won the 1981 NBA title as the Boston Celtics' coach \nwith Larry Bird. He coached in the NBA for 25 years and was the only \nperson to coach 2,000 regular-season games and his 944 wins ranked \nsecond only to NBA coach Lenny Wilkens. I am grateful to Mike Hlas of \nthe Cedar Rapids Gazette for writing this column about one of Iowa's \ngreat athletes, and I am thankful to my friend, Senator John Culver, \nfor bringing it to my attention.\n  At this point, I ask that Mr. Hlas' article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   [From The Gazette, Apr. 22, 1998]\n\n                       C.R.'s Fitch a Big Winner\n\n                             (By Mike Hlas)\n\n       No one will ever put a sign at Cedar Rapids' city limits \n     proclaiming it the hometown of the NBA's all-time losingest \n     coach.\n       That's good. Bill Fitch, who attended Wilson back when it \n     was a high school and coached at Coe, deserves respect.\n       You don't last long enough to lose 1,106 times unless you \n     were good. You don't become the only coach in NBA history to \n     coach 2,050 times in the regular season unless you were good.\n       Fitch, fired by the Los Angeles Clippers Monday at age 63, \n     was good.\n       But as Casey Stengel once said, I managed good, they just \n     played bad.\n       Perhaps none of Fitch's 25 NBA squads was as bad as the \n     1997-98 Clippers, who won 17 and lost 65, and did so without \n     a hint of style.\n       It didn't even feel this rotten for Fitch in 1970, when he \n     and the Cleveland Cavaliers spent their first years in the \n     NBA together. The original Cavs were so bad they were \n     unaffectionately nicknamed the Cadavers. Somehow, Fitch kept \n     a sense of humor and his sanity.\n       By the time Fitch's nine-year engagement closed in \n     Cleveland, the Cavs had made the playoffs three times.\n       As the years passed, Cedar Rapids could take more and more \n     pride in calling Fitch a homeboy. Especially when NBA \n     coaching legend Red Auerbach, then a general manager--brought \n     him to Boston to coach the then-stale Celtics.\n       When surrounded by people who could play the game better \n     than anyone, Fitch turned out to be quite a coach. He had \n     three consecutive 60-game winners in Boston, and won the NBA \n     title in 1981 with young Larry Bird.\n       Houston was Fitch's next stop. The Rockets had four winning \n     seasons in five years under Fitch, and once reached the NBA \n     finals, only to lose to Bird's Celtics.\n       The NBA's heights were great, but Fitch was one of the few \n     coaches who could survive in its depths. His last seven teams \n     were in New Jersey and Los Angeles, where talent was \n     inadequate. Last year, though, he did lead a very young \n     Clipper club to the playoffs.\n       The promise gave way to a nightmare season. A very good \n     player (Bo Outlaw) left as a free agent, and another star \n     (Loy Vaught) missed most of the year with a bad back.\n       So the coach got fired because he's 63 years old, because \n     his players supposedly began to tune him out, and because the \n     Clippers are about to move into a big new arena in downtown \n     Los Angeles and want a sharper image.\n       Fitch, who had worked with Bird and Kevin McHale and Moses \n     Malone, was surrounded in his final season with youngsters \n     who had never won a thing in the NBA. They were tuning him \n     out? He should have turned them out.\n       For anyone to endure four years with the Clipper's and 25 \n     seasons in the NBA as a coach is semi-amazing. If meddling \n     management isn't giving you a headache, some underachieving \n     knucklehead player is giving you heartache.\n       You need a cast-iron stomach to coach in the NBA for 25 \n     years. To be the only person to coach 2,000 regular-season \n     games in the league tells how highly regarded Fitch was held. \n     His 944 wins rank second only to Lenny Wilkens. It is \n     something worth honoring.\n       As any coach will tell you, losing one game tears you \n     apart. To drop 1,106 and keep plugging is wonderful.\n       ``It's depressing,'' Fitch said about this season, days \n     before he was fired. ``But it's also one that makes you want \n     to say, `Never again,' We'll get it going in the right \n     direction again.''\n       If you spend four years with the Bad News Clippers and can \n     still say a thing like that, you are a winner for the \n     ages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7698-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7698-S7699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the Majority \nLeader's legislation, S. 2214, reducing the top capital gains tax rate \nfrom 20 to 15 percent, and reducing from 18 to 12 months the holding \nperiod required on capital gains.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is good news for the economy, and it \nis good news for America's working families.\n  Ours is a global economy, Mr. President. And in my view it is \ncrucial, if we want to continue enjoying our current prosperity, that \nwe do more to maintain our competitive edge. Even with last year's \ncapital gains tax cut, at 20 percent America's long term capital gains \ntax rate remains among the industrialized world's highest. Further, \ncountries like Australia and the United Kingdom, which have higher \nrates, also allow taxpayers to index the cost of the asset on which \nthey make gains.\n  We pay a high price for our high capital gains tax, Mr. President. As \nStanford Dean John B. Shoven points out, higher capital gains rates \nincrease the cost of investing in capital and equipment. As a \npercentage of Gross National Product, the United States invested less \nin nonresidential projects from 1973 to 1992 than any of our major \ncompetitors. And investment in plant and equipment has fallen to only \nhalf the level of the 1960's and 1970's.\n  Without updated plant and equipment, productivity lags and we cannot \ncompete with other nations. Lowered capital gains taxes would directly \naddress this problem. National Council of Policy Assessment Senior \nFellows Gary and Aldona Robbins predicted, before last year's reduction \nin the top capital gains tax rate, that a cut of 50 percent in that \nrate, to 14 percent, would lower the cost of capital by 5 percent. This \nwould induce investors to increase the capital stock by $2.2 trillion \nin 5 years. And that larger stock of capital would create 721,000 new \njobs and increase GDP cumulatively by almost $1 trillion.\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\n  That's a lot of jobs and a lot of growth, Mr. President. Particularly \nwhen we can achieve them simply by allowing the American people to keep \nmore of what they earn. And we are well on our way to spurring this \ngrowth and job creation. For example, Mr. President, Congress' Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates that the recent cut in the top capital \ngains tax rate from 28 to 20 percent will increase capital gains \nrealizations by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That's a trillion \ndollars, Mr. President, that will be freed from stagnant investments \nfor more productive purposes.\n  We should also keep in mind, Mr. President, that this tax cut will \nbenefit the vast majority of the American people. In addition to \ncreating jobs and keeping our businesses competitive in the global \nmarketplace, this capital gains tax cut will directly aid America's \nworking families.\n  It is time to recognize, Mr. President, that America's middle class \nis fully integrated into our free market economy. The vast majority of \nworking Americans are not just wage-earners, they are investors as \nwell.\n  Americans who own stocks, bonds and other investments on which they \nmay take capital gains are investors. Small business owners, \nnonprofessional salaried employees and blue collar workers with a \ncompany retirement plan are investors.\n  As economist Lawrence Kudlow points out, ``Today's investor class \ncould total as many as 125 million people. That's equivalent to \nvirtually the entire working population of the U.S..''\n  How does Mr. Kudlow come up with this number? According to a recent \nNasdaq survey, 43 percent of all Americans own stocks--more than double \nthe 21 percent reported in 1980. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found \nthat 51 percent of Americans own at least $5,000 in stocks, mutual \nfunds or other retirement saving vehicles. And the American Savings \nEducation Council reports that nearly half of all American workers \ncontribute an average of 5 percent of their gross income to 401(k) \nindividual retirement plans.\n  Forty-nine percent of America's investors are women, 38 percent are \nnon-professional salaried workers--and both groups have annual incomes \nof $75,000 or less. Nearly two thirds of investor families have incomes \nunder $50,000.\n  Mr. President, these responsible, hard-working, middle class \nAmericans are concerned about their futures; they are attempting to \nbuild and nurture a nest-egg for themselves, their retirement and their \nchildren.\n  These Americans know that wealth is created through innovation and \nhard work in free markets. They know that saving is crucial to their \nfuture and to the future of this nation. They saw the dangers big-\ngovernment social engineering posed to our economy and brought about \nthe most significant political revolution in this country in 50 years, \nputting the free-market Republican party in control of both Houses of \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, middle class investors in America support our nation \nthrough disproportionate savings and investment. In return these middle \nclass Americans seek fair treatment. They seek policies that do not \npenalize them for their hard work and financial responsibility. And in \nmy view it is time we gave it to them. And that means lowering the \ncapital gains tax to 15 percent.\n  It is also important to note, Mr. President, that it is the moderate \nincome person who is penalized most by high capital gains tax rates. \nThe increase in moderate income workers reporting capital gains is \nlargely due to the increasing use of mutual funds. These funds allow \nmore and more Americans to invest in the stock market by pooling \nresources in the hands of a fund manager who buys and sells stocks.\n  The only down side to this profitable arrangement, Mr. President, is \ncreated by the tax code. Individuals investing in mutual funds cannot \nbalance their capital gains by selling off other stocks showing capital \nlosses as wealthy people can. This means that a significant proportion \nof mutual fund investors show capital gains on a regular basis--and see \ntheir returns reduced because of capital gains taxes--even though they \nare not controlling individual investment decisions.\n  If we want Americans to save more, Mr. President, in my view it makes \nsense to make savings pay more by taxing it less. This cut in capital \ngains taxes will make savings and investment more attractive to \nAmericans by increasing the net return on investments.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I believe it is important at this point to \naddress the fear expressed by a number of people that this tax cut \nwould bust the budget. Fortunately for us, that simply is not true.\n  As I have already mentioned, the Joint Committee on Taxation has \nestimated that the most recent cut in the capital gains tax rate will \nproduce $1 trillion over the next 10 years in increased capital gains \nrealizations. That translates, Mr. President, into an increase of $47 \nbillion in federal revenues. This further cut in the top marginal \ncapital gains tax rate will only magnify that increase in revenue.\n  Indeed, Congress' own Joint Economic Committee last year published a \nstudy, written by economists James Gwartney and Randall Holcombe of \nFlorida State University, finding that revenue from the capital gains \ntax would be maximized at 15 percent. Thus, the tax cut we are \nconsidering today would achieve the maximum federal revenue possible \nfrom this tax, while in addition spurring economic growth and job \ncreation.\n  This is a truly win-win situation, Mr. President. We now have an \nopportunity to encourage savings and investment, spur continued \neconomic growth and maximize federal revenues. I urge my colleagues to \ngrant the American people the benefits of this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7698-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CORRECTING THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION REFORM \n                              ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the unholy alliance between the \nRepublican leadership in Congress and the health insurance industry is \nworking overtime to prevent enactment of meaningful patient protections \nto end the abuses of HMOs and managed care health plans. The tactics of \nthe Republican leadership yesterday made that crystal clear--and \ncontinue the obstruction that has been taking place since the beginning \nof this Congress.\n  Yesterday, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, offered our \nPatients' Bill of Rights as an amendment to an appropriations bill, to \naddress the worst abuses of managed care. The Republican leadership \ndidn't want to debate our amendment in the Senate, because they know \nthat they cannot sustain a position that protects insurance industry \nprofits at the expense of patients.\n  So what did they do? They pulled down the important appropriations \nbill in order to avoid a vote on the Patient's Bill of Rights. Then \nthey filed an immediate cloture petition on the Product Liability Bill, \nto avoid having to debate the Patient's Bill of Rights on that \nlegislation. And I have no doubt that they will continue to engage in \nany other parliamentary maneuver they can devise--in an attempt to \navoid debating and voting on the Patient's Bill of Rights. They are \nready to impose a gag rule on the United States Senate, if that is \nnecessary to prevent us from ending gag rules on the Nation's doctors.\n  It is long past time for Congress to act on the issue of reforming \nmanaged care. Individuals and families are increasingly apprehensive \nabout how they will be treated when they are sick. A survey last year \nfound that an astonishing 80 percent of Americans believe that their \nquality of care is often compromised by their insurance plan to save \nmoney. And, too often, their belief is well-founded.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights will end abuses of HMOs and managed care \nplans across the country. Too often today, managed care is mis-managed \ncare. Decisions on health care should be made by doctors and their \npatients, not by insurance industry accountants bent on protecting \nprofits instead of patients.\n  For more than a year, the Republican leadership has been delaying \naction. I introduced patient protection legislation with Congressman \nJohn Dingell nearly a year and a half ago. Since that time, the \nPresident's non-partisan blue ribbon commission has recommended nearly \nidentical protections. Under Senator Daschle's leadership, we have \nintroduced the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation in both the House \nand Senate--and it is supported not only by Democrats but by \nRepublicans as well.\n  More than 170 organizations have endorsed it. These groups represent \ntens of millions of patients, doctors, nurses, persons with \ndisabilities or chronic illnesses, those in the mental health \ncommunity, workers and families, consumers, small businesses, religious \norganizations, non-physician providers and many others.\n  Yet, despite this support and the obvious need for action, the Senate \nleadership continues to delay. The special interests that profit from \nthe status quo have designed a campaign of misinformation to obscure \nthe real issues and prevent action.\n  There is no mystery about what is going on. The Republican \nleadership's position is to protect the insurance industry instead of \nprotecting patients. They know they can't do that in the light of day. \nSo their strategy has been to work behind closed doors to kill the \nbill. Keep it bottled up in committee. Prevent any debate or vote by \nthe full Senate.\n  Willis Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, was asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News \nto sum up their strategy. According to the article, Mr. Gradison \nreplied ``There's a lot to be said for `Just say no.''' The author of \nthe article goes on to report that\n\n       At a strategy session . . . called by a top aide to Senator \n     Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking \n     public positions that could draw fire during the election \n     campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican leaders in both \n     chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up in \n     committee.\n\n  Instead of participating in a productive debate on how to give \npatients the protections they need, insurance companies and their \nallies in the business community have heeded the call of the\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\nRepublican leadership, in the words of a leadership aide acting on \nbehalf of Senator Lott, to ``get off their butts and get off their \nwallets.'' They are contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nGOP candidates who toe their line, while simultaneously preparing to \nspend millions of dollars on TV ads to defeat the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  But before we swallow their phony charges of excessive increases in \ncosts and in the number of the uninsured, let's examine their \ncredibility on this issue.\n  Insurers say it is too costly to guarantee that treatment decisions \nare made by doctors and patients. Yet, they pay their CEOs and high-\nranking executives multi-million dollar compensation packages and spend \nmillions of dollars on luxury accommodations for corporate \nheadquarters.\n  How can the insurance industry tell the American people with a \nstraight face that this legislation will raise costs, when it is \nspending millions of dollars--derived from premiums paid by hard \nworking families--on a scare campaign to intimidate patients and deny \nthem the protections they need, deserve, and thought they had paid for?\n  Mr. President, we have, and I will include in the Record, a summary \nof the various protections that are included in this legislation. But \nbefore I do, I think it is interesting to know where we are with regard \nto the scheduling of this particular provision.\n  The Patient's Bill of Rights was offered last evening by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Daschle, and was sent back to the desk. We \nhave been denied an opportunity for a markup on this legislation in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee. The Republican leadership has \nrefused to schedule this legislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nwith the exception of the phony unanimous consent request. The consent \nrequest indicated that when we had the debate on this legislation, and \nafter a vote on or in relation to this legislation, it would be in \norder for the majority leader to return the legislation to the \ncalendar. That means that after we voted on the legislation, even if we \nvoted for good legislation that protects the consumers in this country, \nunder this consent request, the Republican leader would have been able \nto send it back to the calendar. The Republican leader would not send \nit to the House of Representatives for action. The Republican leader \nwould not even take legislation if it was sent over from the House of \nRepresentatives and we acted upon it. The Republican leader would not \nsend it to the President of the United States: instead, the Republican \nleader would put the legislation back on the calendar.\n  This is a phony initiative by the Republican leadership. There isn't \na Member of this body who wouldn't read it and understand how phony it \nis. It is insulting to the millions of patients in this country who \nhave suffered to say that if we take action to try to protect you, and \nwe have a positive vote in the Senate of the United States, the leader \nof the Republican Party can put it back on the calendar and frustrate \nevery other Member in the Senate.\n  This is the first time in 36 years I have ever seen a consent request \nlike this. Last night, the Republican leaders said, ``But, oh, wasn't \nthe Senator from Massachusetts here when there was objection to the \nleader's request?''\n  Here is the consent request. I will put it all in the Record, Mr. \nPresident: ``it be in order for the majority leader to return the \nlegislation to the calendar,'' effectively killing it. To add insult to \ninjury, Mr. President, it points out that we will not be in order to \noffer any other health care measures for the rest of the session.\n\n  Isn't that a beauty? We will not be able to offer any other health \nmeasures for the rest of the session. We will not be able to deal with \nmedical records confidentiality issues; we will not be able to deal \nwith Medicare issues. We will not be able to deal with any other health \ncare issue for the remainder of this session.\n  Why? What is it about debating the health care issues which are of \nsuch fundamental importance to families in this country that we cannot \nget a debate on it? What is it, Mr. President? What does the Republican \nleadership fear about debating these issues on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate that are of central concern to every family in America? That is \nthe question we ask.\n  And you know what our answer is? You know what our answer is, Mr. \nPresident? Our answer is that tomorrow at 10 o'clock we are going to \nvote on the IRS conference report. We are going to vote on cloture of \nthe product liability bill. Are we then going to proceed to health \ncare? No. We are instead going to have a 2-hour debate on agricultural \nsanctions. Then are we going to proceed to health care? No. We are \ninstead going to the higher education reauthorization. With the higher \neducation reauthorization, by prior agreement that was made many weeks \nago, we are prohibited from offering any amendments. And then this week \nis finished. It is gone. Starting tomorrow, thirty-five more days are \nleft in this session. This week is gone without any opportunity to \ndebate this important issue.\n  I see members of the Republican leadership here. Maybe the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma can explain why we cannot debate health care issues on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. We had the opportunity to have health \ncare raised yesterday by the Senator from South Dakota. And here we \nhave the Republican leadership agenda. The vote on the IRS conference \nreport is important and we are going to vote on it.\n  But is the conference report on the IRS more important than the fact \nthat tonight, across this country, insurance company agents are making \ndecisions on health care that will imperil the health of families? Can \nwe say that the IRS is more important? What about the vote on the \nproduct liability bill? Is that more important than this debate? The \nRepublican leadership says that we're going to have a 2-hour debate on \nagricultural sanctions. And it goes on and on.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just let me make a brief comment because I was denied \nthe opportunity last evening by the Republicans to have a conversation \nor ask questions last night. I will make a brief statement, and then I \nwill yield.\n  Last night, my friend from the State of Washington said: \n``Republicans will decide whether this great body is going to debate \nhealth care. I want to say that to the Senator from Massachusetts. \nRepublicans will. They'll make the decision. Democrats won't. And we \ndecided that because the Senator from South Dakota has raised this \nissue we are not going to permit a debate on this issue on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate.'' That is what they have said.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Republican leadership, in issuing their list of \npriorities about what we are going to consider during July and during \nSeptember, has denied us the opportunity to debate the health care \nissue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In 1 more minute I will yield. It has been the \nRepublican leadership who has denied us the opportunity to mark up this \nlegislation in committee, to move it to the calendar, and to permit any \ncertainty about when we would debate it. That is the record.\n  I will be glad to yield for a question to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield? I appreciate----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to rebut some of the things the Senator \nsaid.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator will have an opportunity to do so. I waited \nlast night until after the Senator finished. But I will be glad to \nyield to respond to a question, if you have one, or I will continue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Please continue. I will make the statement afterwards.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the area of the Patients' Bill of \nRights, we have provisions supported by four different groups. One \ngroup is the President's Quality Commission. The Commission is made up \nof a number of extraordinary individuals from the insurance industry, \nfrom HMOs, from consumer groups. This is a bipartisan group that is \nuniversally respected.\n  Another group is the NAIC, which is the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners. The NAIC includes both Republicans and \nDemocrats alike across the country. A third group is the American \nAssociation of Health Plans, which is the trade organization of HMOs.\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. I \nwould like to modify the Senator's request, that following his \nadditional 10 minutes, I have 10 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you. And I yield 8 minutes to myself of the 10 \nminutes.\n  So we have provisions supported by these four organizations: \nMedicare; the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; the \nPresident's Quality Commission; and the American Association of Health \nPlans.\n  Now, we come to the provision regarding access to emergency care to \npermit individuals to go to the nearest emergency room. All four \norganizations agree with this. My time tonight is going to be short, so \nI will get back to this issue at another time when we debate it.\n  Another provision is access to specialty care, for example when a \nchild has cancer and ought to be able to go to an oncologist. Oh this \nprovision, we have support from three out of the four organizations. \nThe President's Quality Commission, the HMO trade association, and \nMedicare all say yes.\n  For the direct access by women to OB-GYNs, the President's Quality \nCommission says yes.\n  Continuity of care allows an individual to be able to continue to get \ntreatment by their doctor if the doctor is dropped from an HMO. This \nprovision is effectively favored by all of the various groups.\n  What in these particular areas can our Republican friends complain \nabout? Let us go on.\n  Coverage of an individual to participate in clinical trials is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to get breakthroughs, particularly \nin breast cancer, and allow patients to take advantage of cutting-edge \nnew technology. Access to clinical trials is supported by the American \nAssociation of Health Plans.\n  Provider networks need to ensure adequacy. If you are going to \nrepresent yourself as an HMO, all of these groups say you ought to have \na balanced number of participating professionals and hospitals.\n  Nondiscrimination in delivery of services. You cannot discriminate \nagainst sick people and cannot discriminate in the delivery of health \ncare by race or religion. Three out of the four groups agree with this \nprovision.\n  Patients need information about copays, deductibles and standard \ninformation so they can make comparisons between different groups. Who \ncan complain about this? All four groups support this provision.\n  Prohibition on gag rules. All four groups agreed with us on this \nposition. You should not prevent doctors from being able to tell you \nwhat is in the best interest of your health.\n  Prohibition of improper incentive arrangements. Can you imagine we \nhave to put legislate to prevent HMOs from putting the kind of improper \nincentives into their arrangements with the medical profession? It is \nextraordinary that we have to do this, but it is necessary.\n  Internal appeals to have a fair appeal in cases. All four groups \nagree on that.\n  The external appeals, to have a third party group. The President's \nQuality Commission recommends it and Medicare has been doing it for \nyears.\n  And finally, to hold plans accountable in State courts. We had a vote \nhere in the U.S. Senate the other day not to give blanket freedom of \nany kind of liability for the tobacco industry, and it passed by two-\nthirds to three-quarters of the U.S. Senate. We want to give the same \nkind of protections and accountability on the issues of health care. We \nwill have a chance to debate that. If the Republicans don't want us to \ndo that, then let's have a rollcall vote on that.\n  These are the essential aspects of the Patients' Bill of Rights. They \nhave been taken from these four different organizations. Most of these \nitems are supported by two, three, in many instances all four, of the \ndifferent groups. This is a commonsense protection for the patients of \nthis country. If Republicans differ with those kind of protections, let \nus stand up and debate them. Let us hear their alternative.\n  We have heard in the last few days that the right to hold plans \naccountable is going to drive the health care costs through the roof. \nRead in the Wall Street Journal today an article on a study by Coopers \n& Lybrand that showed it will only cost pennies a day for this \nprotection. Don't just read the Journal article, but also look at what \nhas happened to the 23 million Americans--most of them State and county \nofficials--who have those kinds of protections, and look at the cost of \ntheir premiums. Their premiums are not any higher. This result is \nbetter than any study that can be done by the Chamber of Commerce or \nother group that is wholeheartedly opposed to this legislation.\n  These are the essential elements of the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nintroduced by Senator Daschle. Perhaps they have to be altered, or \nmaybe they ought to be strengthened, or maybe others in this body have \nbetter ideas to achieve these kinds of protections. But let us hear the \nopposition and the reasons for it. Let us hear the reasons. Let them \nadvance those causes. But the silence is deafening. The American public \ndeserve better.\n  The Republican leadership will have a chance to debate the issue, \nbecause Senator Daschle and others will continue to press it until we \nget a time to debate it. If that is wrong, so be it. Some of us are \ncommitted to protecting the American family, to make sure that doctors \nand nurses and patients are going to be making the health care \ndecisions and not the insurance companies. That is the issue, plain and \nsimple. We will challenge the Republican leadership tonight, tomorrow, \nand every other day for the 35 days remaining in this session, to give \nus a time to debate this issue.\n  It is interesting that the essence of this legislation is supported \nby Republicans in the House of Representatives, including Congressman \nGanske, who is a doctor and was at our press conference. Congressman \nGanske didn't believe this ought to be a partisan issue. Dr. Norwood, a \nRepublican, didn't believe this ought to be a partisan issue. But here \nin the U.S. Senate, the Republicans are making this a partisan issue. \nHere in the U.S. Senate we are told: No, not only you won't have any \none of us support it, but we won't even give you the time to debate it. \nThat is wrong.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator has used his 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the last 2 minutes.\n  In summary, the Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees the access to \nspecialists, emergency rooms, and other needed care. It expands \nchoices. It ensures independent appeals. It holds plans accountable for \nthe medical decisions, restores doctor-patient relationship, \nestablishes quality and information standards.\n  The American people are entitled to these rights in their health \ncare. Children in this country are entitled to them. Senior citizens in \nthe country are entitled to them. Hard-working men and women in this \ncountry are entitled to them. Doctors are entitled to the kind of \nprotections we provide. The major insurance companies and HMOs should \nbe held to a standard like every other industry in this country.\n  If that is wrong, let's call the roll and find out who believes in it \nand who does not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will respond to a couple of comments made by my \ncolleague and friend from Massachusetts.\n  One, he is absolutely, totally, completely wrong on many of the \nstatements that he made, particularly in saying the Republican \nleadership wouldn't allow this bill to come to the floor, allow a \ndebate to happen on the floor of the Senate on health care. As the \nSenator should be aware, we have already made a couple of offers that \nwe would try to accommodate some type of time agreement to bring up \nthis issue this month. We are still working on it.\n\n  My colleague was absolutely incorrect when he said the Republicans \nwere insisting that, if we win, we can still put this bill back on the \ncalendar. That wasn't our request. That wasn't our statement. It is not \nour last request.\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\n  I am reading the unanimous consent request given on June 25 or 26 \nwhich said votes held on final passage--if read the third time, the \nSenate votes on passage of the bill without any intervening action or \ndebate. The Senate will request a conference with the House, the chair \nwill be authorized to appoint conferees, and the Senate-House care bill \nwill be placed on the calendar.\n  I make those points. We are willing to have debate on the bill. We \nare willing to consider different options--both the House and the \nSenate, the proposal by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, as \nwell as the substitute that I am working on with some of our other \ncolleagues.\n  We will have a debate on the floor. We are willing to work out a time \nagreement to where we will have it this month. We don't intend to spend \n2 months on this bill or even 1 month on this bill, but we are willing \nto have a debate on health care legislation. It goes under the title of \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I happen to think that is a very good title.\n  I might also mention that the President's Commission on Health Care \nQuality came up with a lot of recommendations. They have several things \nthat they recommend be included in all health care plans, but they said \nthey should be included voluntarily. I might mention that the bill that \nour colleague from Massachusetts is promoting mandates; it doesn't have \nvoluntary compliance. It mandates a lot of things that aren't included \nin the President's Commission--many things. And many of those things \nhave a lot of cost. We have asked the Congressional Budget Office to \ngive us cost estimates of Senator Kennedy's bill, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and we don't have that. I hope we can get it before we commence \ndebate.\n  We have stated, and I just want to repeat to all of our colleagues, \nwe are willing to discuss this issue. We are willing to have time on \nthe Democrats' alternative. I might mention, the Democrats' \nalternative, I believe, to my knowledge, no Republican in the Senate \nhas cosponsored, nor should they, because I think it is a bad bill. I \nthink it definitely would increase consumer cost, drive up the cost of \nhealth care insurance, the cost of health care, period, and the net \nresult would be, fewer people would have health care. I don't think \nthat is a result that we want to have. I am willing to say that I am \nwilling to work to try to come up with a package that we can support.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Florida. Maybe we can come up with \na bipartisan package. I am willing to do that. I know the Senator from \nFlorida has met with other Senators in a bipartisan way to see if we \ncan come up with items that will make sense, that will not have \ndramatic increases in consumer cost, in health care cost, but try to \nsee if we can't work out some things to help cover some of the problems \nthat have arisen with managed care. I am willing to do that. I am not \none who says we don't need any legislation whatever. Some people have \ntaken that position. That is not this Senator's position. I am willing \nto try to legislate responsibly in health care. I don't want to do \nsomething we will find out will do damage, like how significant health \ncare cost increases affect our consumers. I don't think they are asking \nfor increased health care costs. I don't think that would be helpful.\n  So I will repeat to my colleague from Massachusetts and other \nSenators on the floor--and I know, because I have talked to the \nmajority leader day in and day out--we are working on trying to come up \nwith an arrangement where we will have adequate time, but not an \nunlimited amount of time, to consider health care legislation--maybe \nunder the guise of the Patients' Bill of Rights--and to allow a couple \ndifferent alternatives. My colleague from Massachusetts has an \nalternative; he has a proposal. Some of us are working on a different \nproposal. There may be some of those things in common. But certainly \nthere will be very significant differences--big differences, \nphilosophically, in cost, in premium increases, and so we need to \ndiscuss those.\n  We need to have an adequate time to discuss those and to consider the \ndifferent alternatives and then to have a vote. We expect to do so. We \ndon't expect to change the rules of the Senate. We don't expect to \nguarantee that one side or the other side will have a victory in the \nprocess, but we have stated--and, again, as assistant majority leader, \nI am telling our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle that we \nare willing to try to work out an arrangement, and we will have \nadequate time to discuss this issue on the floor this month. I think \nthat is fair enough.\n  The majority leader has been fair. What we are not willing to do is \nstop the Senate from doing any work. So, yes, we are going to pass IRS \nreform and we are going to pass it tomorrow. I think it is a giant step \nin the right direction. Yes, we are going to take up higher education \nreform, and we need to do that. It is very important to colleges, \nuniversities, and students all across the country. That needs to \nhappen. Yes, we need to pass appropriations bills. I think it was very \nunfortunate that the minority leader of the Senate introduced the \nPatients' Bill of Rights on the VA-HUD bill, the veterans and housing \nappropriations bill. It doesn't belong there. He knows that. We have \nalready indicated a willingness and a commitment to bring up the so-\ncalled Patients' Bill of Rights this month. Someone might say, wait a \nminute, you have not passed the tobacco bill. We spent 4 weeks on the \ntobacco bill. They didn't win. I believe they are not going to win on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Senator Kennedy said, ``We are going to bring up minimum wage.'' They \nhave that right. But they don't have a right to have their agenda \ntotally dominate the Senate. The Senate needs to do its work. We will \nconsider some of their issues and some of ours, like IRS reform. We are \ngoing to take that up, and, hopefully, we will pass that tomorrow.\n  So I mention to all of our colleagues that I want them to be aware of \nthe fact that we are trying to be fair, we will be fair, and we will \nconsider this issue. We will have different alternatives--I think \nsignificantly different alternatives. I believe the alternative that \nthe Republicans will be offering will be in stark contrast to the \nDemocrats'. Maybe some things will be in common. We are going to offer \ngreater choice and opportunity and competition. Hopefully, that will \nhelp change buyer behavior and get health care costs down, instead of \nthe increases that would be achieved by Senator Kennedy's proposal.\n  So there will be differences. But that is fine, that is good, that is \nlegitimate. We will have that debate, and we will have adequate time \nfor that. But it can't consume 2 months. It will probably consume 2 or \n3 days. The Senate needs to decide what it wants to do. I expect that \nwe will.\n\n  So I make that commitment to our colleagues. This is going to be a \nbusy month. We need to pass a lot of appropriations bills. We have a \ncouple appropriations bills we are working on right now that, \nunfortunately, people have tried to load up with bills that are \nextraneous, like the tobacco amendment on the agriculture \nappropriations bill or the Patients' Bill of Rights on the VA-HUD bill. \nThat is not acceptable. It is not going anywhere. It may be good for \npolitical posturing, but it is not going to help pass their \nlegislation. We have committed to bring up the legislation in due time \nthis month, have adequate debate and consideration of a couple of \ndifferent alternatives, and go from there. So I make that commitment to \nour colleagues. I think we should lower the rhetoric and the volume it \nhas had and see if we can't work together in a bipartisan way to make \nsome positive improvements in health care legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida. I know he had a \nunanimous consent request to speak. I didn't mean to delay him. I \napologize for interjecting, but I did think it was important to respond \nto the Senator from Massachusetts for his comments. I appreciate the \naccommodation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma and my \ncolleague from Massachusetts for a very interesting, exciting debate \nwhich, from the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma, will be a teaser \nto a future debate that we will look forward to having on these issues \nin the next few days.\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, yesterday the majority leader of the \nSenate, Senator Lott, the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nTorricelli, and a number of other Senators, myself included, introduced \na resolution reaffirming our commitment to the right of self-\ndetermination on the part of the people of the Republic of China on \nTaiwan. We did so in shock at the seeming abandonment of those people \nby the President of the United States on his trip to mainland China. \nThe resolution was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, and I \nhope will be reported back favorably and promptly for debate and \npassage by the Senate of the United States.\n  For decades it has been the policy of the United States to call for \nall of the relationships between the people and government on Taiwan \nand the People's Republic of China to be peaceful. It has been our \npolicy that the people of Taiwan should be permitted to determine their \nown future, much of which has now been undercut by President Clinton's \noverwhelming desire for approval on the part of a still Communist \ndictatorship in mainland China.\n  In fact, Mr. President, on his trip to China and in the policies \nimmediately preceding that trip, the President of the United States has \nmanaged to impose sanctions on the world's most populous democracy, \nIndia, for its natural reaction to our assistance to the missile \ncapabilities of the People's Republic of China; has managed to impose \nsanctions on Pakistan which is greatly harmful to the economy of the \nUnited States because of Pakistan's natural reaction to India's nuclear \ntest; has insulted and weakened the people of Japan, a long-time and \nvitally important democratic ally of the United States, by a refusal to \nvisit Japan on this trip to East Asia; and has undercut one of the most \nvital democracies anywhere in the world, and particularly East Asia on \nTaiwan.\n  As the Washington Post's editors wrote on July 2, and I quote:\n\n       Mr. Clinton has sided with the dictators against the \n     democrats.\n\n  It seems vital to me that we should reaffirm our commitment to the \nrights of self-determination on the part of the people of Taiwan, and \nencourage them on the successful path they have now traveled for almost \nhalf a century.\n  Mr. President, at the end of the Chinese civil war, when the \nnationalists were left only with an outpost on Taiwan, a group of \nChinese began a separate existence with almost no promise of a bright \nfuture, poverty stricken on an island that had just emerged from half a \ncentury of Japanese imperialism, threatened by the overwhelming armed \nforce of mainland China, without natural resources, with nothing to \nsustain them but the brilliance and dedication and the hard-working \nnature of the Chinese people on Taiwan, and an absolute commitment to \ntheir own freedom.\n  They have been perhaps the most successful example of what can happen \nto a people who are dedicated to the ideals that have moved the United \nStates since its founding.\n  On Taiwan, the Chinese people first created a magnificently \nsuccessful economy--an economy so successful that to this day they \npurchase more American goods and services than does all of mainland \nChina, and following immediately upon that economic success the \ncreation of a life and vibrant democratic system of government. Where \nunder such threat in the entire world do we see anything remotely \nsimilar? Perhaps in Israel, perhaps in Israel under a similar threat \nfrom the outside, but I think, Mr. President, nowhere else in the world \nhave we seen such a magnificent success in the building of a free and \nsuccessful economy and a free and successful democracy.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that it should be our policy in the \nfuture that we laud and support that degree of success, that we \nencourage the Chinese on the mainland to follow that example rather \nthan impliedly tell the people in Taiwan they must follow the example \nof the mainland.\n\n  We as Americans simply cannot abandon those free people on Taiwan. We \nmust clearly indicate to mainland China that it cannot attempt to solve \nits differences with them by the use of force. We must clearly indicate \nto mainland China that the people of Taiwan must be in charge of \ndetermining their own future. We can, of course, hope for one China, \nbut a one China that has institutions and is created in a fashion that \nrespects the views, the desire for continued freedom, on the part of \nthe people of Taiwan.\n  How it is that we have managed because of deterioration in our \nrelationship with four democratic nations in east and south Asia \nwithout gaining anything of substance, of any real substance in our \nrelationship with China, is beyond my power to explain. But at this \npoint a mild resolution totally consistent with the Taiwan Relations \nAct passed by this Senate, reaffirming our support for the freedom and \nrights of self-determination of the people of Taiwan, is, I believe, \nthe minimum we can do to make up for the disastrous remarks of \nPresident Clinton on his trip to China.\n  I repeat, I hope that the Foreign Relations Committee will report \nthis bipartisan resolution promptly, that it will be passed by both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives. Only in that fashion can we \nshow our dedication for the cause of a country that has followed our \nleadership, adopted our ideals, and deserves our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/08/senate-section/article/S7704-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
