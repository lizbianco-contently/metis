Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize this \nmorning the Reverend C. Edward Pruitt as our guest Chaplain for today. \nWe particularly welcome his words of assurance to give strength to all \nof us in the discharge of our duties.\n  Reverend Pruitt serves as the pastor of the Burke United Methodist \nChurch in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He has been in that post for 3 \nyears and has ministered to the people of Virginia and Maryland for the \npast 30 years in his distinguished career. A graduate from the Wesley \nTheological Seminary here in Washington, Reverend Pruitt has a very \nunique background.\n  If one detected a slight accent in the Reverend Pruitt's words this \nmorning, it might be because he grew up as a waterman's son--that's a \nfisherman's son--on the small island named Tangier in the middle of the \nChesapeake Bay. Here the islanders still speak with great pride with a \nlingering trace of the Elizabethan English dialog, reflecting the \nhistoric settlement of that island by the English Captain John Smith in \n1608.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues know that Tangier Island in \nVirginia exists, but it does. I have been privileged to be there many \ntimes. It is noted for one other thing: There is not a single \nautomobile for transportation.\n  Again, we welcome Reverend Pruitt, and the Senate is particularly \ngrateful to Bill Hoagland, chief of staff to the Republican Senate side \nof the Budget Committee for bringing to the attention of the President \npro tempore and the leadership the availability of this distinguished \npastor.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10449-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a \nperiod for morning business until 12:30 p.m. At 12:30 p.m., the Senate \nwill recess for the policy luncheons to meet until 2:15 p.m. When the \nSenate reconvenes at 2:15 p.m., the Senate will proceed to a cloture \nvote on the paycheck protection amendment currently pending to S. 25, \nthe campaign finance reform bill. If cloture is not invoked on the \namendment, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the campaign \nfinance reform bill itself. If cloture is not invoked on the bill, the \nSenate could resume the D.C. appropriations bill for the consideration \nof the remaining issues to that appropriations matter. A cloture vote \nis scheduled for tomorrow on the pending Mack-Graham amendment to the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill if that issue is not resolved.\n  Also, as announced, the Senate may turn to any appropriations \nconference reports that become available. Therefore, additional votes \nwill occur following the 2:15 p.m. vote during today's session of the \nSenate.

Mr. President, let me begin by simply commenting on the \ninteresting juxtaposition this body finds itself in this morning.\n  Less than 500 yards from here, the Governmental Affairs Committee is \nholding a hearing--another hearing--dealing with questions relating to \ncampaign finance in the last Presidential campaign cycle. There seems \nto be an extraordinary degree of enthusiasm for pursuing every facet of \nthat particular exercise, and I understand the enthusiasm because, \nobviously, it reflects in a very negative way upon many in the \nDemocratic Party. There has been an effort to direct the committee's \nattention to similar allegations regarding Republican activities, but \nthe Democrats have largely been denied an opportunity to demonstrate \nany balance. In fact, with all of the hearings held thus far, I am \nquite sure there have only been 3 days out of all of those hearings \nheld that the committee has spent analyzing, considering allegations \nregarding Republican activity. So while 90 percent of the attention is \ncentered on Democrats and less than 10 percent on Republicans, the \ninvestigation goes on.\n  The real question is, Where will this take us? And that leads me to \nthis comment on juxtaposition. I wouldn't be surprised if on the \ncloture vote this afternoon, virtually every member of the Republican \nGovernmental Affairs Committee will vote against cloture on the bill, \nwill vote not to come to some termination of this charade that we have \ncalled debate for the last 14 days.\n  It was on September 19 that the majority leader came to the floor, \nsurprising virtually all of us and asking unanimous consent to go to \nthe campaign finance reform legislation. Not having had an opportunity \nto consult with my colleagues, we had a temporary delay in agreeing to \nthat proposal. But during that discussion, the majority leader made it \nvery clear:\n\n       We want to do it in a time when it can be fully debated. I \n     think it is important that we have a chance to look at \n     different proposals and see if a consensus can be reached. . \n     . . So, we fully intend to have notification of the date and \n     an adequate discussion of all sides of the issue. . . .\n       . . . we will have a full panoply of options to make sure \n     we have it brought up at the right time and we can have a \n     full debate and look at all the other things we need to \n     consider.\n\n  Comments made by the majority leader on September 19.\n  Mr. President, that was over 2 weeks ago. Everyone can recall what \nhas happened since then. The bill was immediately laid down. The \nmajority leader, as is his right, proceeded to fill the parliamentary \ntree. By that, I mean adding, 8 or 10 amendments to the bill to \npreclude Democrats from offering any amendments to the McCain-Feingold \nbill. He did not offer just any amendment. He introduced this Lott \namendment, the bill, S. 9, kill the bill--which at least he was very up \nfront about. He is quoted in the Wall Street Journal on the 26th of \nSeptember saying:\n\n       I set it up so they will be filibustering me.\n\n  He was quoted in the Washington Times on the same day:\n\n       I presume the Democrats are going to filibuster what we \n     laid out. I set it up so they are going to do the \n     filibustering, not the Republicans.\n\n  So, Mr. President, his motives were pretty clear. He laid it out very \nwell. So there shouldn't be any doubt what this is about. This isn't a \ndiscussion about whether or not the proposal is a good idea. We have \nalready suggested, proposed that if it is a good idea, let's extend it \nto all organizations, let's extend it to corporations, let's extend it \nto all membership organizations that involve themselves in elections. \nIf you pay dues, you ought to have the opportunity to say how those \ndues are spent. That is the Republican argument. Well, if it is good \nfor unions, it ought to be good for corporations; it ought to be good \nfor the Chamber; it ought to be good for every other organization.\n\n  Interesting enough, the Right to Work Committee, no bastion of \nsupport for labor unions, is quoted in the Washington Post:\n\n       The Right to Work Committee says it is opposed to any union \n     provisions being included in the campaign finance overhaul.\n\n  Even the Right to Work Committee opposes adding the Lott amendment to \nthe campaign finance reform bill.\n  So we are not fooling anybody here, Mr. President. We have offered, \nas I noted a moment ago, to take S. 9 separately; no filibuster. Let's \nhave a good debate about whether it makes sense. Let's have amendments, \nand then let's vote up or down. We have offered that. That hasn't been \naccepted. Why? Well, the majority leader has made it very clear why. \nThat's too easy. He wants to set up a situation that requires a \nDemocratic filibuster.\n  So this is a poison pill, Mr. President--a poison pill. Why would \nDemocrats oppose cloture on the amendment? Because if cloture is \ninvoked on the amendment, by the very nature of cloture, all other \namendments that are nongermane to that particular amendment falls. \nCould we add corporations? No. Could we add any other organization? No. \nSo everybody ought to understand what this is all about. The majority \nleader does not want an up-or-down vote on his amendment. He doesn't \nwant an up-or-down vote on campaign finance reform.\n  So we find ourselves in an interesting situation. We could table the \namendment. I believe the votes are now here for the Senate to table the \nLott amendment, but it is increasingly unlikely that we will have an \nopportunity to table the amendment this afternoon.\n  I am very disappointed with the way this whole matter has been \nhandled from the very beginning in laying down the unanimous-consent \nrequest. When the majority leader attained his position, he and I had \nwhat I thought was an understanding: There would be no surprises. Well, \nyou can imagine my shock at the surprise a few weeks ago, that is, on \nSeptember 19, at this unanimous consent request, considering our \nunderstanding.\n  Yesterday, we filed a cloture motion to ensure that there will be \nanother vote on reform, at least tomorrow. What I didn't know is that \nthe majority leader took us out of debate on the campaign finance \nreform bill in order to preclude a tabling motion yesterday. That was \nsurprise No. 2. So this debate has been filled with surprises. I am \nsurprised, given what he said on September 19 about the full panoply of \noptions, that we have no options at all. We have the option of voting \nfor cloture.\n  If all this is confusing, it really boils down to something very \nsimple: Do you support meaningful campaign finance reform? Do you or \nnot? If you do, you will press the majority leader for a tabling motion \non his amendment. If you do, you will vote for cloture this afternoon \non the McCain-Feingold bill. So there shouldn't be any confusion at all \nabout what this is about, about what the motivations are or about the \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves this morning.\n  The bottom line is, the vast majority of Republicans are refusing to \nallow this Senate to act on one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation to be brought up in this Senate in this Congress. That is \nthe fact. And how ironic that as we investigate infractions, as we \ninvestigate allegations, the response is simply: Let's do nothing; \nlet's filibuster the campaign finance reform bill; let's load up the \ntree so we can't have a debate on amendments.\n  We all understand it. The American people understand it too, Mr. \nPresident. Sooner or later we will have our day. It is the old lose the \nbattle, win the war metaphor that keeps coming back. We may lose \ncloture today, we may not get our tabling motion today, but we are \ngoing to get some votes. If it is all we do for the rest of this \nCongress, we are going to get some votes.\n  Others have come to the floor to seek recognition. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. I rise to support his comments.\n  Mr. President, there is a wonderful cemetery in a little town called \nMedora, ND, on the edge of the Bad Lands in western North Dakota. The \ncemetery has very unusual tombstones in it because they did not always \nknow the names of the people who died when they tried a century later \nto identify the remains in the cemetery. So they took an oral history \nof the old folks living around there and did the best they could.\n  So if you visit that little cemetery, you will see tombstones that \nsay, on one ``Baby From The Hotel.'' They did\n\n[[Page S10451]]\n\nnot know who it was. They just knew it was a baby that died in the \nhotel. On the other, ``Man The Bank Fell On.'' Still another tombstone, \n``Cowboy With 2 Acres.'' Still another, they knew the man's name was \nPete and it said, ``Pete, He Died In A Disagreement.''\n  It is an interesting cemetery to visit because by these tombstones \nyou can tell, without knowing the names, who is buried there.\n  I was thinking about that cemetery today because we have today a \ngroup of people who are fixing to try to kill and then bury campaign \nfinance reform. They have been out here for days. Today is their day \nbecause today we have some votes. They want to kill it, and they want \nto bury it.\n  The problem for them is no matter what happens today, they are not \nable to create a tombstone that says, rest in peace for campaign \nfinance reform, because it is not going to rest in peace. Those who \nbelieve there is not enough money in politics and we ought to have \nmore, those who believe that we ought to kill campaign finance reform \nand they are the ones to do it, they want to have a little rest in \npeace tombstone and run to the back rooms and collect their political \ninheritance, the tens of millions of dollars that keep flowing into all \nof these coffers and hard money and soft money for this organization \nand that organization.\n  It is not going to work quite that way. If they kill campaign finance \nreform today, it will have been a charade. We were told that we would \nconsider campaign finance reform on the floor of the Senate. How did it \ncome to the floor of the Senate? It came to the floor of the Senate \ntied in ropes with a procedure designed to prevent anyone from offering \nany amendments or having any votes except those structured by the \nmajority leader. And those structured by the majority leader are \nintended to accomplish the following:\n  According to one who spent a great deal of time on the floor here, \n``We're going to kill it, and kill it proudly.'' Campaign finance \nreform, that is their goal, ``kill it, and kill it proudly.''\n  ``I set it up so they will be filibustering me,'' proudly crows \nanother.\n  Conservative columnist Mr. Novak wrote a column and said it as it \nwas,\n\n       The party's preference is * * * no reform at all: Remove \n     all limits on campaign contributions but disclose them daily \n     on the Internet. Because that won't become law, the GOP \n     leaders favor a Senate standoff in which no proposal gets 60 \n     votes needed to end a filibuster.\n\n  I did not say that. A Republican columnist wrote that. That is the \nstrategy.\n  Part of it is: ``[Speaker] Calls For More, Not Less, Campaign Cash.'' \nIt is because of a profound difference of opinion. Despite the facts, \ndespite this red line on campaign spending that goes up and up and up, \nspending that is out of control in politics in this country, despite \nthat, we have people who believe the problem is there is not enough \ncash in politics. They are dead wrong. They could not be more wrong.\n\n  The American people know and the American people understand that we \nneed to pass some sort of meaningful campaign spending reform. I happen \nto believe we ought to try to find a way to put limits on campaign \nspending.\n  Individual races, the Supreme Court said by a 5 to 4 decision you \ncannot support those. I would like the Supreme Court to have another \nopportunity to rethink that, but in any event there are other ways to \ndo it to provide incentives for spending limits on each campaign. In \nfact, the bill before us is watered down. They took that portion of the \nbill out before it was brought to the floor. So what they are trying to \nkill is even just a skeleton of what we ought to be doing.\n  If we get to vote on amendments, those of us who believe there ought \nto be spending limits will bring that to the floor and ask for a vote \non that as well. But that is not in the bill at the moment.\n  The strategy is a legislative strategy to bring it up, have no votes, \noffer a poison pill, fill the legislative tree so everyone is bound up \nand no one can do anything, then file cloture, have a vote on cloture, \nand pull the bill and claim to all of America you really allowed \nconsideration of campaign finance reform.\n  That is not consideration. That is a sham. That is not about honest \nconsideration of campaign finance reform. An honest consideration of it \nwould be to bring the bill to the floor and let people file amendments \nand have a debate and have votes and determine what is the will of the \nSenate.\n  The goal of those who want to kill this today is to do nothing \nbecause they like the current system. They will feel, I assume, like \nhogs in a corn crib when this is all done, just rejoicing at their \nbounty because they will have killed campaign finance reform, and the \nhundreds of millions of dollars that continue to float around to all \nthese campaigns will magnify and multiply manyfold.\n  We have had 6,700 pages of hearings on campaign finance reform, 3,361 \nfloor speeches--make that 3,362 now today and 3,363 with the next \nSpeaker--113 votes over the years, 522 witnesses. And some say, Well, \ngee, we need more time to consider this. We don't need more time to \nconsider this. Campaigns are not auctions. They are elections. Money \nisn't speech. If money is speech in American politics, then there is \nsomething wrong with the political system.\n  If we cannot begin with the germ of an idea that there is too much \nmoney in politics, that this red line signifies something that is \nunhealthy about American politics and that soft money is the legal form \nof cheating from the old type of campaign finance reform, and if you \ncannot deal with the form of cheating that erupts from the old campaign \nfinance reform because you don't want to do anything, then somehow we \nhave failed as an institution.\n  So my point today is very simple. In 1996, the Democrats, through \ntheir organization, spent $332 million. That was up 73 percent over 4 \nyears previous. The Republicans spent $548 million. That was up 74 \npercent over 4 years previous.\n  The fact is, the evidence is all around us that the cost of these \ncampaigns is mushrooming and escalating, and it is unhealthy. The \nquestion is, what do we do about it?\n  Today, we are going to answer the question who is for reform and who \nisn't, who wants to do something about this and who doesn't, who cares \nabout this issue and who doesn't care.\n  I know some are going to be tempted today to follow the strategy \nemployed by the majority leader: Construct a tent and create an \nillusion and have several cloture votes through which or behind which \nsome Members can hide with their votes so you never ever get to the \ncentral question of, Do you stand for campaign finance reform or don't \nyou?\n\n  I just say to those who have conceived of this strategy that this \ncampaign finance reform, if you think you have killed it today, it is \ngoing to be resurrected tomorrow. This is not going to rest in peace. \nYou are going to vote on this and vote on this and vote on this until \nyou understand this is a serious issue and the American people insist \nthat this Congress do something about campaign finance reform.\n  I am proud, as I believe the Senator from South Dakota, the minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, is proud and my colleagues are proud of \nstanding for reform and deciding that we support the kind of changes \nthat are necessary to bring some health to the campaign finance system \nin this country and to do something about the abuses, the outrageous \namounts of money in campaign finance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains under the control \nof the minority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is approximately 24 minutes \n56 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For the minority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, Americans from all walks of life know that we need \ntough new laws that limit the role of money in election campaigns in \nAmerican political life. They are fed up with a campaign process driven \nby the soaring costs of television commercials. They are fed up with \nincumbents and challengers who spend more time raising money from \nspecial interests instead of serving the public interest.\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\n  Americans want true campaign finance reform, and today is a test of \nwhether the Republican leadership in the Senate is listening. Will we \nget a chance to enact campaign finance reform, or will the Republican \nleadership in the Senate continue to block reform or even withdraw the \nbill entirely?\n  Instead of reform and accountability in Government, Republicans wants \nto silence the voices of America's working families. Instead of \nadopting real limits on campaign spending, Republicans want to sweep \nthe American worker under the rug.\n  In the world according to the Republicans, there would be more and \nmore money for their campaigns and less and less for those who speak up \nfor better jobs, better health care for our children, and a better \nretirement for our seniors.\n  So far in this debate, instead of limiting the amount of money in \npolitics, Republicans prescribe an overdose of money for elections in \nwhich their friends in big corporations and their lobbyists and special \ninterests can write more checks and bigger checks to the Republican \nParty.\n  Republicans in the Senate have decided that they would rather kill \nthe patient with a poison pill than cure the disease. They say that \nunless the bill silences the voice of labor unions and American workers \nin the political process, they will kill campaign finance reform. They \nwant to increase the power of large corporations and squash even the \nlimited power that American workers have today. Republicans want to \nhandcuff labor unions in the battle for a living wage and fair \nretirement benefits, for safety and health conditions in the workplace.\n  In short, Republicans want to impose a gag rule on American workers \nbut let their friends in big corporations, the National Rifle \nAssociation, and other well-heeled special interests buy a controlling \ninterest in the Government.\n  The Lott amendment is a killer amendment, because it unfairly \npunishes working Americans and their unions for participating in the \n1996 elections. The Lott amendment bars unions from collecting dues \nfrom any workers--including those who voluntarily join a union--unless \nthose workers sign a permission slip for their union dues to be spent \nfor political purposes.\n  When the amendment seeks to block labor union contributions for \npolitical purposes, the restriction is not limited to campaign ads or \nlobbying. Instead, it includes union newsletters, nonpartisan voter \nregistration drives, and get-out-the-vote efforts. The scope is vast, \nand the goal is obvious--to deny working Americans those basic rights \nof our democracy.\n  We have heard much in recent days about the importance of the first \namendment. Many on the other side of the aisle wrap themselves in the \nbanner of free speech when they oppose the McCain-Feingold bill. They \nclaim that the first amendment requires that more money be pumped into \nthe political process.\n  That is Alice-in-Wonderland, looking-glass logic, and everyone knows \nit.\n  I couldn't disagree more, and so does the majority of the American \npeople. Americans want campaign finance reform, and they want it now.\n  Strangely, those who claim that the first amendment demands more \nmoney in politics are silent about the Lott amendment's effect on free \nspeech. Working Americans and their unions have first amendment rights \nto freedom of speech and association. Political activity is critical \nfor workers to protect the legislative gains they have made in the past \n70 years. Workers can and should speak out to strengthen safety and \nhealth laws, and protect American jobs against exploitative foreign \ncompetition.\n  And what better way to address these and other basic concerns than by \nbanding together in their unions? The labor movement is the most \neffective voice for working Americans in the political process, and we \nall know it.\n  But the Lott amendment silences this voice. It imposes onerous prior \nconsent requirements on unions, and forces unions to set up burdensome \nbureaucracies to meet its terms. The amendment's supporters know this \nwould cripple unions' ability to participate in politics. Yet those \nsupporters say nothing about the denial of workers' freedom to speak or \nassociate. Many Republicans apparently care nothing for the first \namendment when it comes to American workers.\n  How hypocritical can you get?\n  Well, I believe that the first amendment applies to employees as well \nas executives. Unions have at least as much right to speak as \ncorporations. Nothing in the first amendment says ``except if you are a \nunion member.''\n  Unfortunately, it seems that many of my colleagues on the other side \ndisagree.\n  They want to continue the torrent of campaign ads and political \ncontributions from the big tobacco companies and other large \ncorporations, the National Rifle Association and other special \ninterests. The Lott amendment does nothing to affect the free flow of \nmoney from those groups, whether their members agree or not. Where is \nthe concern for corporate shareholders who do not want their money \ngoing toward political causes? What about dues-paying members of the \nNational Rifle Association who may not agree with all the political \nstands their organization takes? I don't hear Republicans expressing \nconcerns about them.\n  Instead, under the Lott amendment it is only workers who are silenced \nwhile big corporation and other special interests are unaffected.\n  The current campaign finance laws, inadequate as they are, at least \napply evenhandedly to political spending by both business and labor. \nThe Lott amendment violates fundamental principles of parity by \nimposing new restrictions on workers and labor unions.\n  This isn't reform; it is revenge. It is a blatant attempt to punish \nworking Americans for their role in the 1996 elections and an equally \nblatant attempt to increase the role of big business in the next \nelection.\n  These workers were pointing out the importance of fairness to working \nAmericans to increase the minimum wage, working families that were \npointing out the wrong priorities that were being pressed by the \nRepublican leadership in cutting back essential education programs. \nThey were pointing out the recommendations by the Republican majority \nto cut back on the Medicare Program and to use those cuts for tax \nbreaks for wealthy individuals, and the programs that were recommended \nand passed in the House and Senate to open up pension funds for \ncorporate raiders--all of these items were put out on the American \nagenda, and in instance after instance the American people rejected the \nRepublicans' proposal and reelected a Democratic President.\n  We must move beyond this partisan assault on American workers and \nenact real campaign financing reform. We should heed the call of former \nPresidents Carter and Ford as they wrote on Sunday:\n\n       We must demonstrate that a government of the people, by the \n     people and for the people is not a thing of the past. We must \n     redouble our efforts to assure voters that public policy is \n     determined by the checks on their ballots rather than the \n     checks from powerful interests.\n\n  If President Ford and President Carter can agree, if Vice President \nMondale and former Senator Kassebaum can agree, then surely this Senate \ncan reach agreement, too.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Lott amendment and support the \nmeaningful reforms of the McCain-Feingold legislation. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I yield myself 5 minutes from the time controlled by the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. In particular, in support of the McCain-\nFeingold bill. I want to commend those two Senators for their excellent \nwork and their unflinching efforts to bring this measure to a vote. I \nalso want to rise in opposition to the proposed Lott amendment. It is \nan amendment that is clearly a poison pill designed not to do anything \nother than derail meaningful campaign finance reform. This is the \nconclusion of all observers who have looked at this carefully--Common \nCause, the League of Women Voters, editorial pages in the New York \nTimes and Washington Post. Political scientist Norman Ornstein said, \n``A vote\n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\nfor the Lott amendment is a direct move to kill reform.'' Rather than \nkilling reform, we should be embracing it today, in terms of the \nFeingold-McCain legislative initiative.\n  In 1884, the Supreme Court gave us the task of protecting the \nelectoral system. In the words of the opinion in Ex Parte Yarborough, \nthey said Congress has ``the authority to protect the elective process \nagainst two great natural and historical enemies of all republics, open \nviolence and insidious corruption.''\n  What we are witnessing today in our electoral process encompasses \nthis form of insidious corruption--not specific misdemeanors, or \ninfractions, but a system in which the American people are losing faith \nand confidence, that they are seeing their system transform from one in \nwhich free elections are based on the merits of the candidates to one \nwhich they perceive is based upon simply the sheer volume of cash that \nflows into the system. This corrupting influence is weakening our \nability to govern and the confidence of the people in our motives and \nindeed in our actions.\n  Ninety-two percent of Americans think that too much money is spent on \ncampaigns; 89 percent want fundamental change in the campaign finance \nsystem; 85 percent believe special interests have more influence than \nthe voters; 69 percent believe that public officials are indifferent to \ntheir views, their concerns, their needs; 51 percent believe that quite \na few Government officials are corrupt.\n  If that is not evidence of insidious corruption, then I don't know \nwhat is. Perhaps other evidence might be the fact that people are no \nlonger participating in the most meaningful way a citizen can \nparticipate, by voting. We have seen voter participation plummet. In \n1996, voter turnout was below 50 percent, which is the lowest since the \nearly 1920's. Fewer people volunteer to participate as volunteers on \ncampaigns, as canvassers, as public-spirited citizens who want to be \ninvolved in the Government. The most frequently cited reason for people \nnot actively engaging as candidates is the fact that they can't raise \nthe enormous amounts of money that they perceive is essential to \nbecoming part of the American political process.\n  All of this argues, I think, eloquently and decisively for \nfundamental campaign finance reform. But what is happening today in \nthis amendment is an attempt to throttle the views of working men and \nwomen throughout this country. And at the same time, protect and \nenshrine the right of the few to give very, very much to political \ncampaigns.\n  That, I think, is another example of how the system has gone haywire \nand askew. Six hundred thousand people contributed over $200 in Federal \ncampaigns in 1996. That represents .31 percent of eligible voters. Of \nthose individuals that gave over $1,000, 237,000 Americans, .12 percent \nof eligible donors. Those individuals who gave the maximum amount under \nFederal law to Federal candidates, $25,000, in the entire United \nStates, 126--an infinitesimal fraction. That is what this argument is \nabout today in many respects. It is to allow those individuals to give \ndirectly and indirectly unlimited sums to the political process and to \nfurther erode confidence in our Government. At the same time, the Lott \namendment would circumscribe the ability of working men and women to \nmake small, routine contribution through political action committees.\n  The sum of all this is that we need fundamental reform. The Feingold-\nMcCain bill presents such reform. It would ban soft money to national \npolitical parties as well as the use of soft money by State parties to \nimpact Federal elections. It would eliminate the abuse of issue ads. \nThe last election cycle saw an explosion of issue ads, ads in which \ncandidates were beaten about the head and shoulders regularly, not by \ntheir opponent, but by groups that rose up suddenly and put ads on \ntelevision and departed just as quickly.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REED. The Feingold-McCain bill would also strengthen disclosure \nin election law. It would provide for strict codification of the Beck \ndecision, not circumscribe and prevent labor from participating in \nelections, but codify the Supreme Court decision, allowing the \nnotification of the use of funds for political purposes by unions and \nalso reduction for those individual members who object to such uses. \nAlso, it will put limits on party assistance of wealthy candidates and \nthe ban of foreign money into American campaigns. This is fundamental, \nnecessary reform of our campaign system. I argue in fact that as worthy \nas these reforms are, we would have to go further. But today at least \nlet us take the step forward for this sensible, moderate balanced \nreform, which the American people are demanding.\n\n  There are States in this country that have taken the step, have gone \nmuch further and passed expenditure caps on campaigns, that are \nexperimenting with other ways in which they want the issues to be \ndecided by candidates based upon their positions, not by campaign \ncommittees based on their balances in their checking accounts. We \nshould take the step forward today. We should in fact resist the Lott \namendment, which would derail meaningful campaign finance reform. We \nshould rather urge that we, as the Senate of this great country, \nproudly step forth and endorse meaningful campaign finance reform. Many \nyears ago, in 1914, the New England poet Robert Frost wrote: ``Good \nfences make good neighbors.''\n  Well, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to campaign \nfinance reform, all our fences are down. They have been demolished by a \nflood of cash running into elections. Unless we build good, strong \nfences, we can't be good neighbors or good candidates or indeed good \ncitizens. We need to reform our campaign finance system, we need to \nbegin today by defeating the Lott amendment and moving forward to pass \nthe McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his strong words. He has been \na very strong reformer in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me try to not repeat the arguments that have \nalready been made on the floor and instead draw from conversation that \nmy wife Sheila and I have had with people in cafes in Minnesota. We had \nthe opportunity, in August, to spend about a week just dropping in \ncafes in the morning around breakfasttime and lunchtime and just \ntalking with people and listening to what people had to say. I say to \nmy colleagues that one disturbing conclusion from these discussions \nwith people is that I think many people in our country, certainly many \nMinnesotans, are now pretty well convinced that way too much of \npolitics, way too much of Government is dominated by wealthy people and \nspecial interests, that too few people have way too much wealth, power, \nand say and that too many people--that is to say the majority of \npeople--are locked out.\n  Mr. President, in the cafes in Minnesota, quite often people would \nsay to us: When it comes to our concerns, Paul and Sheila, about \naffordable child care, jobs and decent wages, and affordable health \ncare, about the power of insurance companies, the way in which we are \ndenied coverage, about the concentration of power in banking, about the \nconcentration of power in agriculture, about affordable education, when \nit comes to our concerns, we don't think our concerns are of much \nconcern in the Halls of the Congress.\n  I think the main reason that people have reached this conclusion is \nthat they are so disillusioned about all the ways in which they see big \nmoney dominating politics. Indeed, I think that is the ethical issue of \nour time.\n  Mr. President, so that nobody has any illusions here, I don't think \nthat people view this as corruption as in the wrongdoing of individual \nofficeholders, but they view it as systemic. They really believe that \nthere is an imbalance of power where the wealthy few and powerful \ninterests pretty much dominate the political process. Mr. President, \nyou know what? I think they are right. I don't think it is just a \nperception. I think they are absolutely right.\n  If you believe in representative democracy, then you believe in the \nidea that each person counts as one and no\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\nmore than one. We don't have that any longer. We have auction block \ndemocracy, Government going to the highest bidder. People are \ndisillusioned. That is the meaning of the last election, where over 50 \npercent of the people in the country didn't even vote. The party of the \ndisaffected is the largest party in our country. Therefore, I don't \nunderstand, for the life of me, why my colleagues on the majority side \nintroduced an amendment--the majority leader introduces an amendment \nwhich basically destroys this campaign reform effort.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to thank Senators McCain and Feingold for \ntheir very strong leadership. I think this is the most important issue \nbefore us. I think it is the core question; it is the core issue. Every \nyear since I have been here in the Senate, I fought it out on these \nreform issues because I really think this goes to the very heart of \nwhether or not we really have a democracy or whether we just have a \npseudodemocracy. What we have before us really is not the McCain-\nFeingold original formula, but the extra-mild version, which I don't \nthink has enough zing in it, but at least it represents a step forward. \nWith the McCain-Feingold effort here, we have a ban on soft money \ncontributions to the parties. This is the sort of unaccountable money, \nif you will. We have in addition, some real standards on this issue \nadvocacy--and this has been gone over, which is a terribly important \npart of this legislation--and by the way, if you ban soft money to the \nparties and don't do anything about the issue ads, really psuedofake \nads, the money will just shift there, and in addition, you have some \nstandards dealing with tighter standards dealing with independent \nexpenditures. So it is a step forward. That is why we should pass it.\n\n  My hope is that it will whet the appetite of people in the country \nfor more because the truth of the matter is, in the spirit of \ncompromise, the one provision that was actually dropped--that is why we \nhave McCain-Feingold extra-mild now, it had do with us, with reducing \nthe amount of money spent in campaigns in Senate races. I mean, I \nthought that was the most important part that we would somehow reduce \nthe amount of money spent in exchange for discounts when it comes to \naccess to TV time or direct mailing, you name it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I mean, I think the criteria ought to be, let's \nstop this obscene money chase, let's stop the obscene amount of money \nall of us have to spend and the time we have to spend raising money. \nLet's lessen the special interest access and influence. There is way \ntoo much of that. The vast majority of people really are locked out of \nthis process, and let's try and have a level playing field, where \nchallengers have a shot at winning. By that criteria, the McCain-\nFeingold bill doesn't go far enough. But if this piece of legislation \nis passed--and that is why it is such an important bill, even this \nstripped-down version is so important--people in the country, I think, \nwill say, look, the Congress has finally taken some action. This is a \nstep forward.\n  People aren't fools. People aren't going to see this legislation as \nthe be all and end all. They are not going to see it as Heaven on \nEarth, as ending all special interest access; they are not going to see \nit as ending the huge amounts of money spent in politics. But people \nwill see it as a step forward. I say to my colleagues that what we have \nhere when it comes to the majority leader's amendment--quite frankly, I \nam surprised that some of my colleagues in the majority party have \nessentially followed the lead of this amendment. I hope they won't. If \nwe have a vote that is going to be very revealing.\n  If in fact people vote for this Lott amendment and continue to insist \nthat it became part of a reform bill knowing that it is, as everyone \nhas said, the ``poison pill'' amendment, then we may very well have no \nreform bill passed at all.\n  So this becomes a vote which tells people in the country where all of \nus stand and on what side each party stands on when it comes to this \nfundamental question of reform.\n  If we come here this afternoon and what we have happen is that we \nhave the Lott amendment out there--I don't know why we can't have a \nseparate vote on the Lott amendment. I thought we would. I think we can \nvote it down. If that doesn't happen, then there is no cloture, and \nthen we go to the McCain-Feingold bill and we can't get cloture, that \nis blocked by Senators in the majority party, then what happens is we \nagain reach an impasse, and people in the country become disillusioned.\n  As a Democrat, I will just say to the Members of the majority party \nthat, frankly, I think people will be very angry. I think they will not \nappreciate this amendment. I think they will not appreciate the effort \non the part of the majority leader to kill campaign finance reform. But \nI would say, not as a Democrat but as a Minnesotan, as an American \ncitizen, ultimately we all lose. If we do not take advantage of this \nmoment in time where we can pass a reform bill, albeit it still doesn't \ndo enough, then we will be making a huge mistake, and this will just \nadd to the disillusion of the people in the country.\n  The good news is that we can pass a reform bill. I hope we do. I hope \nwe do not squander this opportunity. The good news is that all around \nthe country there is a lot of energy for reform.\n  I introduced a bill with Senator Kerry which is a clean-election, \nclean-money option which essentially gets all of the private money out \nof politics. It is really strong. People in Maine have supported it. \nPeople in Vermont have now supported it. There are going to be \ninitiatives around the country on this. There is a lot of energy in \nStates all across the country. So I think people in the country are \ngoing to continue to put the pressure on.\n  But we ought not to miss this opportunity to do something good. We \nought not to miss this opportunity to at least begin to make some \nchanges in the way in which all of this money is spent on politics. We \nought not to miss this opportunity to pass the McCain-Feingold bill and \ngive people in the country a clear message that we hear them. We ought \nnot to miss this opportunity for reform. We ought not to miss this \nopportunity to reassure people in the country that we are committed to \na political process that is more open, with more integrity--and not \njust the heavy hitters, the big givers, the invested and the well-\nconnected running the show. We better not miss this opportunity.\n  I say to my colleagues in the majority party that I hope some of you \nwill have the courage to vote against this Lott amendment, if we have \nthat chance, or have the courage to join us and pass the McCain-\nFeingold bill, which would be a historically significant step in the \nright direction in leading our country toward more democracy, toward \nmore participation and more involvement as opposed to this awful system \nwe have right now which absolutely needs to be changed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. This debate is one of the \nmost important that the Senate will conduct in this session of \nCongress, and I desperately hope it will result in passage of \nmeaningful campaign finance reform.\n  There is an extraordinary need for reform of our election laws. \nDespite the apparent problems--problems that have gotten worse with \nevery election--Congress has not passed reform. Our failure to act has \ncontributed to a loss of confidence, not only in our electoral system, \nbut in our democracy.\n  The American public has lost faith in government and its \ninstitutions. Americans feel they don't control government because they \nbelieve they don't control elections.\n  If you ask people who runs Washington, most will say ``special \ninterests.'' People watch State officials, Members of Congress, and \nPresidential candidates chase money, and believe that's the only way to \nget your voice heard in Washington. They see televised campaign finance \nhearings, allegations of trading contributions for access, and they \nthink, ``how could my voice be heard over all that cash.''\n  Certainly, Congress is not alone to blame for the current system. \nVoters themselves share some responsibility. People routinely decry the \nuse of negative political ads, yet continually respond to the content \nof those ads. The media, especially television stations and networks, \nhave failed to adequately inform the public of important policy \nquestions. Instead of covering\n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\nsignificant issues, broadcasters often fall back on covering the \n``horserace'' aspect of the campaign, or ``sideshow'' disagreements \namong candidates.\n  But the ultimate responsibility rests in this Chamber, with Congress. \nFor more than 30 years the growing crisis has been ignored. Year after \nyear, speeches are given, bills are introduced, but no action is taken.\n  We now have a rare opportunity, with public attention focused on this \ndebate and this bill, to pass real campaign finance reform.\n  Senators McCain and Feingold have developed a genuine compromise \nplan. It is not exactly as I would have drafted--or any of us, if we \nhad that chance. It is, however, the best, last chance we have to \nrepair the broken campaign finance system.\n  The modified version of the bill addresses one of the fundamental \nproblems in the system--soft money contributions. By banning these huge \nsums from Federal campaigns, we correct many of the problems which have \nbeen exposed this year in hearings before the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  The bill also tries to deal with the growing and disturbing impact of \nindependent expenditures. I believe the sponsors of the bill have \nachieved a delicate balance in this area--curtailing the use of this \npractice, while still conforming to constitutional boundaries.\n  Mr. President, we have never had a time in our Nation's history when \nsuch a pervasive problem went unanswered by the Congress. America has \nmet challenges such as this before, and adopted policies which \nstrengthened our democracy. We have that opportunity with the bill \nbefore us.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill will help restore the American public's \nfaith in this institution and in all the institutions of Government.\n  As some of my colleagues know, Senator Brownback and I have \nintroduced legislation to establish an independent commission to reform \nour campaign finance laws. This commission would be similar to the Base \nClosure Commission, which proposed a series of recommendations to \nCongress for an up-or-down vote of approval.\n  But I do not believe that we should take such an approach at this \ntime. It would be much better if Congress acted on its own, without the \nhelp of an outside body, to reform our election laws. It would \ndemonstrate to the American public that Congress is serious about \nchanging the way our democracy functions.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I just want to take a moment and \ncommend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. Without his \ntireless efforts to advance this bill, it surely would have died long \nago. By bringing this cause to the floor, Senator Feingold truly \nfollows in the tradition of the great progressive movement in \nWisconsin. I'm proud to serve with him, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our efforts to pass this vital legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is the 5th year I have been a Member \nof the U.S. Senate. And this is the 5th year I can recall debating \ncampaign finance reform. I have voted for campaign reform legislation \nseveral times now, and each time it has been killed off by filibuster.\n  This year, I have served as a member of the Leadership Task Force on \nCampaign Reform. We knew from the beginning of the year this would be a \nbig issue. Therefore, we have devoted hours to finding a way to break \nthe logjam and move a bill.\n  Against this backdrop, I have been listening to this debate very \nclosely over the past few days. I have been watching the hearings in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, and I have been watching the \nefforts of colleagues on the other side of the aisle as they attempt to \nfind a compromise.\n  So far, I cannot see many differences between this debate, and the \nones we've had over the past few years. In this debate, we have a \nbipartisan group of Senators committed to reform. This group has worked \novertime to craft a reasonable reform measure that makes sense for \nAmerica. They have worked to generate support, to make their case to \nthe media and to the public, and to push for the last few votes \nnecessary to pass it. I have been proud to support the effort.\n  And, like usual, there is the familiar obstruction on the other side \nof the aisle: a concerted effort to preserve the status quo. Though \ncarefully disguised, their goal is to prevent reform legislation from \npassing.\n  There is a big difference this time. The public is paying more \nattention than ever before. The excesses of the last campaign season, \nbrought to light through the good work of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, have made campaign reform a front-burner issue in every \nkitchen in America. Just yesterday, more than 1 million signatures were \ndelivered to the Capitol. These are signatures from people all over \nAmerica who, over the past 7 months, have joined a nationwide call for \nreform.\n  The people are calling for reform, as they have for years. But this \ntime the call is louder, the focus is more intense, and the opponents \nof reform will be held accountable.\n  What exactly is the problem? Money, plain and simple. Too much money, \nhaving too much influence over our democratic process. As I have said \nbefore, this Congress has reached the point where votes and decisions \nhave become a bidding war between well funded special interests.\n  When the Senate debates a bill, we are no longer simply 100 Senators \nrepresenting our States. We are 100 Senators representing our States \nand every special interest who has ever made a major financial \ncontribution to the party, or to the campaign, in order to influence \ngovernment decisionmaking. This is wrong. This is not the way it should \nbe.\n  The campaign system is clogged with money, and there is no room left \nfor the average voter. Political campaigning has become an industry in \nthis country. In last election, over $800 million were spent on Federal \nelections alone. To what end? To perpetuate the status quo. Just think \nwhat $800 million could do if spent on charitable pursuits.\n  Instead, that money--much of it undisclosed, from dubious sources--\nflowed into the political arena and dictated the terms of our elections \nto the people. Like water, it flowed downhill into campaigns all across \nthe country. Some of it came out in the form of national party ads \nattacking candidates in the abstract; some came out in the form of \nissue-ads by interest groups trying to influence the outcomes. Some of \nit came out in the candidates own TV ads.\n  It reaches the point where you almost cannot hear the voices of the \ncandidates anymore, only the voices of the dueling special interests. \nWe do not know who pays for these ads, where they get their money, or \nwhat they stand to gain if their candidate wins. Yet they have found \nways to have a huge influence over the election process.\n  On the other side of the aisle, the opponents of reform argue against \nthe McCain-Feingold bill on free speech grounds. They wrap themselves \nin the flag and posture as protectors of free speech. Then they argue \npoliticians and political parties should be able to take money in any \namount from anyone in order to make the case for their reelection. They \nbelieve that having more money entitles one to a greater influence over \nour campaigns and elections. I find this argument shocking, Mr. \nPresident. I find it profoundly un-democratic, and un-American.\n  In hiding behind a transparent argument about free speech based on \naccess to money, the opponents of reform conveniently gloss over \nreality: our campaign system is so awash in money, that the voices of \naverage people and average voters are completely drowned out. \nUltimately, people are losing faith in their elected officials and \ntheir government. It is simply not a healthy situation for our country.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of reform miss the point. In America, \nmoney does not equal speech. More money does not entitle one to more \nspeech. The haves are not entitled to a greater voice in politics than \nthe have-nots. In America, everyone has an equal say in our government. \nThat is why our Declaration of Independence starts with, ``We, the \npeople.''\n  The last time we debated reform, I told a story of a woman who sent \nmy campaign a small contribution of $15. With her check she enclosed a \nnote that said, ``please make sure my voice\n\n[[Page S10456]]\n\nmeans as much as those who give thousands.'' With all due respect, Mr. \nPresident, this woman is typical of the people who deserve our best \nrepresentation. Sadly, under the current campaign system, they rarely \ndo.\n  I have tried to live by my word on this issue. My first Senate \ncampaign was a shoestring affair. I was out spent nearly 3 to 1 by a \ncongressional incumbent. But because I had a strong, grassroots, \npeople-based effort, I was able to win.\n  Since then, I have worked hard to keep to that standard. I have over \n20,000 individual donors. The average contribution to my campaign is \n$42. Over 90 percent of my contributions come from within Washington \nState. I firmly believe that's the way campaigns should be run: by the \npeople.\n  We need more disclosure, not less. We need more restrictions on \nspecial interest money, not fewer. We need less money in the system, \nnot more. We need to amplify the voices of regular people, instead of \nallowing them to be shouted down by special interests.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have made this debate way too \ncomplicated. After all the maneuvering, the cloture petitions, the \ntechnicalities, the procedural votes, this issue boils down to one \nbasic question: are Senators willing to make some modest reforms to \nreduce the influence of big money in politics and encourage greater \nvoter participation? Or are they more interested in protecting the \ncurrent system, and the ability of parties and politicians to turn \nfinancial advantage into political advantage?\n  Are you for reform, or against it? Are you with the people, or \nagainst them on the need for a more healthy democracy? The votes we are \ntaking today will show the answers to these questions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think by unanimous consent I have \nthe next 45 minutes reserved. I would like to yield the first 20 \nminutes, or 25 if he needs it, to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to thank my colleague \nfrom Texas for reserving this time.\n  Mr. President, we are going to change the subject in regard to \ncampaign reform. Let me just simply say that I think it is always a \nwise suggestion to check under the banner of what is alleged campaign \nreform, and I think if we would check under the banner in regards to \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, that campaign reform is an oxymoron. But \nhaving said that, I am not going to take any more time of the Senate on \nthis particular subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10450-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10456-S10462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BOSNIA AND NATO ENLARGEMENT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to talk about what is happening in \nregard to mission creep in Bosnia and how that reflects on the hearings \nthat will start very quickly in the Senate in regard to NATO expansion.\n  Mr. President, when President Woodrow Wilson exhorted Americans to \nmake the world safe for democracy, he did not mean sending U.S. troops \nto attack foreign television stations and to attempt to try to shut \ndown political speech in other countries. Yet that is exactly what \nhappened last week in Bosnia as NATO troops, or SFOR troops, took over \nfour television transmitters in an effort to control news broadcasts in \nthat shattered region. State Department officials, in declaring \nvictory, pledged to create a system ``free of the monopolizing \ninfluence of political parties.'' Let me emphasis that again. Free the \nsystem--``free of the monopolizing influence of political parties.'' \nThen they set about the task of deciding what television content from \nUnited States networks might be appropriate for viewing by the citizens \nof Bosnia--content that is not ``ethnically biased.''\n  Wrote Lee Hockstader of the Washington Post:\n\n       As a result of the seizures of the TV towers, NATO generals \n     and Western diplomats have cast themselves in the roles of \n     media executives determined to construct an evenhanded state \n     television station in a country that has never had one. That \n     represents a new level of involvement in Bosnia's affairs for \n     the West * * *\n\n  A new level of involvement indeed.\n  The trouble is, neither the American public nor Congress have been \ntold by President Clinton just what out expectations are in Bosnia. \nWhat is our mission? How long will it last? How much will it cost? What \nwill be accomplished? How do we extract out troops from the mess they \nare in?\n  None of these questions have been answered.\n  Is this war? If U.S. troops were involved in a war situation, we \ncould expect media outlets to be military targets.\n  Is this war? If so, we can expect costs and casualties far beyond \nwhat the administration has projected.\n  Is this war? If so, what national security interests are at stake?\n  Is this war? If so, our troops cannot be expected to defend their \nlives with Nielsen ratings.\n  Mr. President, given this outlandish situation, we are tempted to \ntreat these events as farce:\n  So when a television station in our home State gives a Senator a \nrough time, maybe we should call the Marines instead of the news \ndirector.\n  And certainly many Americans would agree they should not be bothered \nby the ``monopolizing influence of political parties'' during next \nyear's campaign season.\n  Now we are back to campaign finance reform. But, Mr. President, \nBosnia is serious business. Lives are at risk. Regional stability is on \nthe line. We have serious obligations.\n  A few days ago Congress adopted an important amendment to the Defense \nappropriations bill, kindly referred to by the distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee as the ``Roberts amendment.'' It \nrequires the President to certify to Congress by May 15, 1998, that the \ncontinued presence of United States forces in Bosnia is in our national \ninterest and why.\n  He must state the reasons for our deployment and the expected \nduration of deployment.\n  He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar cost \ninvolved, and give the effect of such deployment on overall \neffectiveness of U.S. forces.\n  Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our \nmission and out objectives.\n  And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home.\n  If the President does not meet these conditions, funding for military \ndeployment will end next May.\n  Following our actions against the television stations, Serbian \nofficials warned there would be retaliation. And the New York Times \nreported that Bosnian Muslims are secretly arming themselves.\n  A senior NATO commander was quoted, ``The question no longer is if \nthe Muslims will attack the Bosnian Serbs, but when. The only way to \nprevent such an attack, at this point, is for the peacekeeping mission \nto extend its mandate.''\n  Sound familiar. You bet it does.\n  Extend the mandate--that's mission creep by any name.\n  And it is the dangerous result of a policy that is lacking in \ndirection, lacking in leadership and lacking in purpose.\n  The events of the last few days are alarming. They make it more \nurgent that the administration develop and articulate a course of \naction that is based on sound policy.\n  Taking over TV transmitters? Trying to figure out on an even basis \nwhat should be programmed, what the people of Bosnia should hear and \nlisten to?\n  I suggested to one of my colleagues that if we had a choice of \nprograms we should put ``Gunsmoke,'' which is a favorite TV show of \nmine, on the Bosnian TV stations. I don't know what would be the \nopposing viewpoint. Maybe ``Natural Born Killers'' could be posed for \nsome of the people who have been convicted or who have been indicted \nunder the war crimes trials. Maybe in terms of programming we could \ndecide on old newsreels of Tito. Maybe that would do some good.\n  This is incredible in terms of taking over the TV transmitters.\n  We need hard answers on Bosnia.\n  We need direction.\n  We don't need Nielsen ratings.\n  In that regard, I thank my colleague from Texas for bringing up this \nspecial time for us to consider how Bosnia also segues in our decision \nin regard to NATO expansion.\n\n[[Page S10457]]\n\n  However, with all due respect to former Ambassador Richard Holbrook \nand Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, there is not much support \nfor American military presence in Bosnia in Dodge City, KS, where \n``Gunsmoke'' came from. Now, the question is, are the American people \nwilling to commit to additional military responsibilities called for \nunder article 5 of the NATO Charter, and at what cost? Will they \nsupport a commitment to the Czech Republic? How about Slovakia or \nSlovenia or perhaps Macedonia?\n  When I went over during the August break to visit our troops in \nBosnia, our intelligence officials and others in that part of Central \nEurope, here came the folks from Macedonia wanting to be included in \nNATO expansion. Some 20 Senators, myself included, following the \nleadership of the distinguished Senator from Texas, asked that question \nand 10 others in a letter to the President prior to Madrid. With many \nSenators listed as skeptical or undecided, clearly I think the hard \nquestions must be asked in full.\n  Simply put, to bring NATO expansion into focus, I think President \nClinton must become engaged. In Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and in \nBucharest, he addressed general European security concerns but he has \nnot made a case to the Congress and to the American people. As a matter \nof fact, in remarks during his European trip, the President said in the \npost-Soviet era, military matters are no longer primary, that \nterrorism, illegal drugs, national extremism, regional conflicts due to \nethnic, racial, and religious hatreds do matter. I can assure you using \nan expanded NATO to address these concerns raises more questions than \nanswers.\n\n  What means would be used? Warplanes, ground forces, and naval power \nare of little use in fighting ethnic hatred and racism. If NATO \nmembership reduces the threat of ethnic rivalries, somebody should tell \nthat to the Protestants and Catholics of Northern Ireland, the Basques \nin Spain, and the Kurds in Turkey.\n  Do we really want to change the most successful security alliance in \nhistory to a European United Nations? With 16 NATO members and 28 other \nnations inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the \nprotocol rituals and welcoming speeches left no time for any serious \ndiscussion. The meeting was over.\n  And, I must say while I understand the personal and emotional \nfeelings that all freedom loving people feel when visiting Prague, \nWarsaw, and Budapest, I do not think NATO expansion will right the \nwrongs of Yalta nor do I agree that raising serious questions about \nNATO expansion represents the echoes of Munich as some in the \nadministration have charged. To characterize serious critics as \nappeasers or isolationists sets needed debate off on entirely the wrong \nfoot.\n  Let me emphasize my reservations are not a reflection on the \npotential new members or their worthiness to join the alliance. I am \nextremely impressed with the success of the nations of Eastern Europe \nand their dramatic move toward democracy.\n  Let me share some of my major concerns.\n  Without argument NATO has been the most successful alliance in \nhistory. Likewise, most will agree that chief among the reasons for \nNATO's success is the fact that it is a military alliance comprised of \nlike-minded nations focused against a common threat. As we know, in the \npast the security threat was the Soviet Union and the nations of the \nWarsaw Pact.\n  Today, however, that threat is vastly diminished--some would say \ngone. With the Warsaw Pact now history, there certainly is no clear \nthreat to the survival of Europe on the horizon.\n  Certainly there are concerns for stability in Europe such as we have \nwitnessed in Bosnia and in Albania. But do we need to fundamentally \nalter the structure of this very successful alliance to insure \nstability in Europe? Will the results of our actions be to turn a \nsuperb military alliance into a political alliance with diminished \nmilitary capability? If we do, will NATO survive?\n  Let me stress we have vital interests in maintaining a healthy and \nstable Europe. That's not the question. Europe's continued peace is \nvital. But is enlargement of NATO necessary to achieve that goal?\n\n\n                  Why it is necessary to enlarge NATO?\n\n  The proponents state the reasons for enlargement include, preventing \na power vacuum from developing in Eastern Europe and promoting total \nEuropean stability by reducing in risk of instability in Europe's \neastern half. The concern appears to be if NATO does not offer \nmembership, the countries of Eastern Europe will founder, will not \nbecome fully developed Democratic states, or will become embroiled in \nethnic or nationalistic disputes based on historic rivalries like we \nsee in Bosnia. Worse, this theory holds, they will again become part, \neither voluntarily or forced, of an alliance with a resurgent Russia.\n\n  The Clinton administration has steadfastly maintained the position \nthat a stable Europe will be no threat to Russia and in fact will \nincrease the security of Russia. However, the Russians do not see it \nthat way and have consistently stated they are opposed to NATO \nexpansion for national security concerns.\n  Part of the ``why enlarge NATO'' question should be the timing of \nsuch an enlargement. Unfortunately, part of the motivation of the \ntiming of this venture is to have the first new members join at the \nsame time as the 50th anniversary of NATO. Let me say again, we are \nthinking about altering NATO, fundamentally realigning our relations \nwith Europe, risking our resources and committing our military for \nquestionable national interests and basing the timing of such an \nimportant event on the 50th anniversary of NATO.\n  Mr. President, that is public relations. It is not foreign policy.\n  What are the alternatives to NATO enlargement? Perhaps an enhanced \nPartnership for Peace would provide the desired stability and military \nsecurity in Eastern Europe instead of membership in NATO. Perhaps \nmembership in the European Union, coupled with Partnership for Peace, \nwould allow continued development of Democratic systems in Eastern \nEuropean nations. Those alternatives should be part of the national \ndebate.\n  Let's take a look at the cost of all of this. What are the costs of \nNATO enlargement? I am concerned with the widely varying values and \nassumptions used to arrive at the U.S. portions of the bill for \nenlargement. Since the Madrid Summit, it is clear that our allies are \nnot on board for sharing costs of enlargement. Until this plan for \nsharing is established and agreed to, how can we know what our actual \ncosts will be and why we should proceed? If our allies refuse to carry \nwhat we feel is their fair share, given our defense responsibilities, \nwill the United States pay more? And, if so, asking American taxpayers \nto up the ante would be most difficult.\n  Just as we have seen in the Bosnian operation, unexpected funding for \nDOD has directly affected the much-needed military modernization and \nprocurement programs. Why should we be willing to risk the future of \nour military capability in defending our vital national interests by \nrushing into NATO enlargement without confidently knowing, in great \ndetail, the costs associated with the enlargement and what our allies \nand the new members will and are capable of funding.\n  What will be the Russian reaction to NATO enlargement? Mr. President, \njust yesterday Susan Eisenhower and several distinguished foreign \npolicy experts came to the Senate and testified before myself and \nSenator Sessions and Senator Collins and Senator Stevens and others as \nto why they felt NATO enlargement was the wrong step at the wrong time.\n  The most important concern that must be well understood is the \nreaction of the Government of Russia to the enlargement of NATO. If we \nget this wrong, the need for enlargement will be self-fulfilling and we \nwill again need a strong military alliance facing east. We are in \ndanger of awakening the Russian bear, not taming him and putting him in \na cage.\n  Aleksei Arbatrov, the deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament's \ndefense committee, was recently quoted as saying that the way in which \nan expanded NATO was imposed on the Russians ``was a shock for those \ntrying to improve relations.'' He added there ``was a widespread \nfeeling of betrayal among Russian Democrats.''\n\n[[Page S10458]]\n\n  Mr. Arbatrov predicted Russia could turn to a strategy of first-\nstrike nuclear capability to combat what is perceived as a NATO threat \non its doorstep.\n\n  ``There is no chance whatsoever'' that Russia's Parliament would \nratify START II or START III, Mr. Arbatrov said.\n  I know that the Russians have joined the Partnership for Peace, \nsigned the Founding Act, and have been officially quiet, semiquiet, \nabout three potential new NATO members. However, there can be no doubt \nthat all factions of the Russian political system are opposed to the \nexpansion. What they see is a military alliance moving eastward, ever \ncloser to their borders.\n  We cannot allow Russia to dictate our actions or the actions of NATO. \nLet that be perfectly clear. But it would be most dangerous to embark \non such an important foreign policy matter as NATO enlargement without \nfully understanding or accounting for the Russian concerns. That is \nwhat Susan Eisenhower stated. That is what the other foreign experts \nstated.\n  Why are the Baltic States and NATO such a sensitive issue to Russia? \nThere are at least two reasons. Addition of the Baltics would move \nNATO's borders to Russia, and a section of Russian territory, including \nthe city of Kalinningrad, would be completely surrounded by NATO.\n  When asked about the Russian reaction to the addition of the Baltics \nto NATO, the Russian Ambassador to the United States said ``the \nreaction would be fierce.'' Even with this understanding of the \npotential reaction by Russia, the administration continues to insist \nthe Baltic States are likely to be asked to join in the next round.\n  I remain concerned we are approaching the Russian issue, Mr. \nPresident, with much bravado and arrogance with our fingers crossed \nbehind our back.\n  Although I consider these three areas--why enlarge? what is the cost? \nand what will be the reaction of Russia?--to be the most critical, \nthere are other areas of significant importance that must be part of \nthe debate, Mr. President. I look forward to discussing these three and \nthe others in detail in the coming months. NATO enlargement is the most \nimportant foreign policy and military decision the United States will \nmake or has made for many years. We must make the right decision.\n  And again, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for leading the charge in asking the right questions, the complex \nquestions that must be asked before the Senate considers either in \ncommittee or in the Chamber later the ratification of NATO.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have consumed of the 25 \nminutes that was yielded to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for approximately 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I might, I would just like to touch, I would tell the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, on a related matter, if I could, for \nanother, say, 2 or 3 minutes, if I might.\n  What I would like to talk about is the reaction in regards to how the \nAmerican people feel about this. It is the American public that must be \nfully informed and aware of what responsibilities NATO will entail and \nwhat expansion would mean to our American men and women in uniform.\n  What about the American public? Last April, the Roper Starch \nworldwide poll asked Americans the level of support for using armed \nforces in certain situations. I don't think the American people are \nisolationist, but I think there is understandable concern about risking \nAmerican lives in political wars of gradualism.\n  The Senator from Texas went to Bosnia, Brcko, took a look at Tuzla \nand Sarajevo, and is very concerned about mission creep and again \nrepeating the past mistakes in political wars of gradualism.\n  The American public understands that. If the United States were \nattacked, 84 percent of those polled supported using force--84 percent \nif we were attacked. I don't know about the other 16 percent. If our \nforces stationed overseas were attacked, 50 percent supported armed \nintervention. To safeguard peacekeeping within the framework of the \nUnited Nations, the support dropped to 35 percent. Hello. And to stop \nan invasion of one country by another, which is called for in article V \nin regard to NATO expansion, the support fell sharply to 15 percent.\n\n  I took my own poll. It was after the Dodge City Rodeo in August. I \nmet with the Ford County, KS, wheat growers. They are good friends of \nmine, long-time friends and constituents. I told them I was going to \nthe Czech Republic, Bosnia, and Hungary. The price of wheat depended in \npart on world trade and security. The heads nodded. But in that \nparticular case, I tell my distinguished friend and colleague from \nTexas, there wasn't much support until we took a hard look in regard to \nBosnia and to NATO enlargement. As a matter of fact, one farmer said, \n``My son is over there. He is a foreign linguist in the National Guard \nunit over there. He should be back.'' So I think we really need to \ndemonstrate not only to the Ford County, KS, wheat growers but to all \nAmericans as evidenced by this poll what are our vital national \nsecurity interests in regards to NATO expansion and answer those tough \nquestions about cost, what happens in relation to Russia and what \nhappens in terms of the long-term best interests of our foreign policy.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Texas and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Before the distinguished Senator from Kansas leaves \nthe floor, I do appreciate so much this Senator's leadership on the \nissue of Bosnia and the issue of NATO expansion because he is one of \nthe Senators who has taken the time to go to Bosnia, to look firsthand \nat the conditions there to determine what is in the United States \nsecurity interests and certainly the best interests of the people of \nBosnia.\n  I would just like to ask the Senator from Kansas before he yields the \nfloor to tell me and the American people about the experience that he \nhad in the resettlement-of-refugees issue.\n  What did the Senator see with his own eyes that brought him to the \nsame conclusion that I have come to, that we are barking up the wrong \ntree in putting U.S. troops in harm's way before the people of this \ncountry have come to a settlement themselves?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to respond to my colleague.\n  As my colleague knows, I have discussed at length the original \npurpose of the Bosnia mission was to safeguard our troops--that is, the \npeacekeeping role--and to try to do what we can in regard to technology \nrestoration, to nation building, to the possibility of the location and \ncapture and prosecution of war criminals and then refugee resettlement.\n  In response to the Senator's question, it is that part of the goal \nthat is especially difficult. Now, I think we have come from \npeacekeeping to peace enforcement. I think we have come far afield from \nthe original goal in that we are now disarming the police in regard to \nMr. Karadzic's troops, and I think in regard to what I am able to \nunderstand from our intelligence community we are aggressively going to \nlocate, capture and proceed with war criminals.\n  Now, as I have just indicated, we have a situation where the SFOR \ntroops have taken over TV transmitters. So I think the Senator from \nTexas makes a good point in terms of mission creep.\n  But in answer to the specific question, flying in the helicopter with \na one-star over there from Tuzla where our American forces have their \nheadquarters, we went over a small hill, and on the knoll of the hill \nthere used to be 60 Muslim families that lived there, and during the \nfighting since 1993 there was tremendous bloodshed, there were \natrocities very close by, and obviously that particular piece of real \nestate is not inhabited any more by the Muslims. So there was an \nattempt by SFOR and by NATO to relocate these refugees on that hill.\n  Three times they tried it. The first time, with 60 people, they tried \nto relocate on the hill, they were driven away by rocks and stones and \nshouts and intimidation by the Serbs in that area. The second time they \ntried, it got a little tougher. We were also involved in the building \nof new homes, in terms of financing those new homes. Then you got into \nsome home destruction.\n  Well, the third time, they were met by an angry crowd with 2x4's. \nThey\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\nburned the homes down. And we have pictures of them attacking the \nMuslims, the 60 people we were trying to relocate, with 2x4's. And I \nasked the one star, I asked the general, ``Are we going to try it \nagain?'' He said, ``No, I don't think that's a very good investment of \nour tax dollars or our time and effort.'' I think we got the message. \nHe suggested if we have successful refugee relocation, we should do it \nin Brcko. The Senator from Texas has been there, and I ask her now what \nher observation was about how that refugee resettlement effort is \ngoing. And I thank her for asking the question.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank him for \ntaking the time to go over there, to look firsthand, because I think \nyou get a very different perspective when you are able to do that. I \nappreciate the leadership position the Senator from Kansas is taking. I \nwill just say that I had a different experience walking on the streets \nof Brcko in August. But I came to the same conclusion, after going into \nthe home of a Serb, going into the street and talking to a Muslim who \nwas just resettling into the neighborhood where that person had lived \nbefore. I asked each individually, ``Are you working with your neighbor \nto help them resettle into their homes?''\n  I asked the Serb about the Muslim. ``Oh, no, no. We are not doing \nthat because we know that they are occupied and they have their own \nproblems. We wouldn't want to disturb them.''\n  So then you ask the Muslim, ``Have you met your Serb neighbor? Have \nyou had a chance to visit or have coffee with your Serb neighbor?'' And \nthe answer was, ``Oh, no, no, we actually haven't. We have not been \nable to do that.''\n  These are people who are living in homes that are 5 feet from each \nother, 10 feet. The streets are very narrow. Yet, they are not mixing.\n  I think we have to look at the big picture here. American people are \nvery generous. We want to help the people of Bosnia. But I think what \nwe are trying to do is help them in a way that will provide a long-term \npeace, an economic stability. And doing things that are inherently \nunpeaceful, putting our U.S. troops in harm's way, I don't think is the \nright answer. That is why I am saying let's go back to the table at \nDayton. Let's determine where we are.\n  I will give this administration a lot of credit for keeping the \nparties apart, for trying to forge a peace. Now I ask this \nadministration to say we have had 2 years of Dayton, let's assess it. \nLet's see if this is the right direction. Because I don't think it is.\n  We have witnessed elections in which the people who come in to vote \ncome in under armed guard, they vote, they leave under armed guard. We \nhave elected Muslims who cannot even enter the city to take control of \nthe government to which they are elected to serve. We have elected \nSerbs, where they are not able to reenter. We are declaring victory. I \nam missing something. We have elected governments that cannot serve, \nthat cannot even enter the cities in which they were elected. And we \nare declaring this to be a victory? I think we need to have a reality \ncheck.\n  That brings me to the bigger context of NATO expansion and cost, and \njust how much should the United States absorb when we are talking about \nissues where we want to be helpful but we want to make sure that our \nmoney is going toward a successful endeavor. That is where, I think, \nthis administration is not being realistic.\n  Take the idea of NATO expansion. I think all of us in this country \nbelieve that NATO is the best alliance that has ever been put forward \non the face of the Earth. Because of its strength, it never had to fire \na shot and the cold war was ended. Now we are looking at expanding NATO \nand the hearings are starting this week to do that very thing. I think \nthe questions that Senator Helms is asking are the very important \nquestions that must be answered if we are going to expand NATO in a \nresponsible way and in a way that sets a base for a long-term stability \nin Europe.\n  Senator Helms is not saying I am for a NATO expansion period. He is \nsaying I am for NATO expansion if it is done right. The ``if it is done \nright'' seems to be lopped off and not given very much attention. I \nthink it is time the administration gave the ``if it is done right'' \nportion of Senator Helms' statement its due. Because if it is done \nright, it will continue to be the greatest alliance that was ever \nformed on the face of this Earth. And if it is done wrong, it will be \nthe unraveling of the greatest alliance that was ever put on the face \nof the Earth.\n\n  So we have the choice, of whether to keep NATO strong and stable by \nexpanding responsibly or whether we just expand willy-nilly. America \nwill absorb all the costs, and then the American people will say, wait \na minute, I don't intend to completely prop up Europe without a fair \nshare taken by our allies in Europe.\n  That question becomes very important because just this last week in \nthe Washington Post there was a report on the meeting of NATO defense \nministers at which our own Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, \nparticipated. The reporter for the Washington Post says that this was, \nin fact, a startling meeting because the NATO defense ministers voiced \nserious misgivings about the United States insistence that they, along \nwith the new members to be brought into NATO, would carry the bulk of \nthe expenses related to NATO enlargement.\n  You see, President Clinton has told the American Congress that the \nAmerican share would be $2 billion over 10 years--$200 million. That is \nsomething I think American taxpayers would willingly absorb. But there \nis a lot of disagreement about those numbers because, in fact, we do \nnot know what is in the requirements for NATO expansion. So, to have \nnumbers before you have requirements is the cart before the horse in \nmost people's books.\n  The European allies said that they did not think it was right for \nAmerica to take $2 billion of the $35 billion which the Clinton \nadministration estimates NATO expansion will cost, and they are \nobjecting to paying $16 billion from the present membership. In fact, \nthe ministers from Germany, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands \nexpressed dismay and insisted that the burdensharing debate must be \nviewed in a wider context.\n  You see, Secretary Cohen was right. He said the right things. He said \nthat any shortchanging on defense investments by existing members or \nnew partners would lead to a hollow alliance and ultimately erode \nconfidence in future rounds of enlargement. Secretary Cohen is sending \nup the red flag of warning because he, too, is saying, do it right.\n  Let's look at the amount of gross domestic product that is spent by \nNATO members. The United States spends 3.8 percent of gross domestic \nproduct on defense. This is 3.8 percent of the domestic product of our \ncountry, the whole domestic product. The United Kingdom spends 3.1 \npercent, Germany spends 1.5 percent, France spends 2.5 percent. And \nthey are saying they are not going to spend any more than that.\n  So I think we need to be forewarned that our European allies are not \ncommitting to the same numbers that the United States is. I think we \nhave to put that in perspective. Because General Shalikashvili, who \njust left the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was lamenting \nthe fact that we don't have enough money in our defense budget to \nproperly train our troops for peak readiness. He says we don't have \nenough money to buy parts or equipment. Yet, we are spending $3 billion \na year, on average, in Bosnia, pursuing a policy that has yet to be \ndefined, with no exit strategy and with the administration now saying \nit is probable that we are going to extend the troops with no defined \nend when he has already extended the mission nearly 2 years beyond the \nfirst limit that he set.\n  Let's take another example. Just yesterday the President vetoed \nalmost $300 million of military construction in the United States. He \nvetoed such operational projects as a corrosion control facility, \nheadquarters facilities that would enhance command, control and \ncommunications, ammunition storage facilities--$300 million in America. \nAt the same time, he approved the expenditure of military construction \nin Europe for NATO enhancement of over $150 million. What kinds of \nprojects did he approve for NATO? Ammunition storage facilities, \nadministrative buildings--the exact same things he vetoed for military \nconstruction in the United States, for our bases, for our readiness.\n\n  So I do have a problem when the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs\n\n[[Page S10460]]\n\nsays we are not spending enough for our own readiness, for our own \nmilitary personnel, when the President vetoes military construction \nwhich was in the Defense Department's 5-year plan, saying these were \nnot priorities, while at the same time signing military construction of \n$150 million in Europe for NATO enhancement.\n  So, I have to say the issue of our own readiness is a key issue here. \nIf we are going to spend $3 billion in Bosnia for a policy that has, I \nthink, minimal chance to succeed and the outgoing Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs is saying we don't have enough money for our own readiness, what \nare we doing as the stewards of this country, as the ones responsible \nfor our own national defense, our readiness, our troop morale, our \nquality of life for our troops, our taxpayers, and, most of all, for \nour own security threats, when we would veto our own military \nconstruction and put half that same amount into European construction? \nAnd when we know that we are not spending enough to keep our troops \nready for the eventual real threat to the United States that could come \nfrom an incoming ballistic missile, for which we do not have the \ndefense; from a terrorist nation that would do any kind of bombing of \nour own people, either on our shores or off? Are we building up for the \npotential threat in Korea, in the Middle East?\n  I just have to ask the administration to think about these issues as \nwe look at our own situation and our readiness and our strength. Are we \ndoing everything we should for our own troops, for our own military \nconstruction, for our own quality of life for our men and women who are \nserving in the military? Or are we dissipating our resources in \noperations that are not defined, that have no exit strategy, in places \nlike Bosnia and Somalia and Haiti?\n  I would just ask the question, Do we have our priorities straight? \nWhen we look at the issue of NATO expansion, we must look at the cost. \nIt must be nailed down. It must not be a moving target. It must be \nclear. And we must tell our European allies exactly what we will do, \nand not be badgered into taking more than our fair share of the cost of \nEuropean security. We do want to step up to the line. We do want to be \nthe major superpower in the world, and fulfill our responsibilities. \nBut we are already spending more of our gross domestic product on \nnational defense than our European allies spend. I think the American \ntaxpayer has the right to ask the question: Are we spending the dollars \nfor our own security? Are we doing our fair share for the humanitarian \nneeds of this country, and for the countries that we are trying to \nhelp? Are we spending the dollars wisely? That is the question.\n\n  I think as we move toward NATO expansion, we must be good and \nresponsible stewards for the American taxpayer, and, more important, we \nmust be good and responsible stewards of the national defense of our \ncountry. We must meet the test, for our young men and women in the \nmilitary who have pledged their lives to preserve our freedom, that our \ncommitment to them is commensurate with their commitment to the United \nStates; that we will guard them with respect, with a quality of life \nthat allows them and their families to live with a high standard of \nliving, and that we will make sure that wherever they are, in the field \nor on our shores, that they have everything they need to do their job.\n  I think if we are going to keep that commitment to them and to the \nAmerican people, we must ask the questions about NATO expansion, about \nour mission in Bosnia: Are we spending the dollars wisely and are we \nassured that when we put our United States troops on the ground that \nthere is a United States security threat and risk that requires that \naction?\n  Mr. President, those are the questions that I hope Senator Helms, in \nhis hearings this week on NATO expansion, will focus on and not allow \nfuzzy, vague, moving-target answers from the administration. The \nAmerican people and our young men and women in the service deserve no \nless than total responsibility and total answers to those questions.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak \nin morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes, under the previous order.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Finance Committee recently \napproved fast-track authority for the President. I thought I might come \nto the floor and express some of my very serious concerns about this \nproposal.\n  Let me begin by saying to those who would paint every Member of \nCongress who has a problem with the fast track proposal with some broad \nbrush calling us protectionists or xenophobic. I, for one, am not.\n  Trade is very important to my State. California is the seventh \nlargest economy on Earth, and we produce 20 percent of the Nation's \nexports. Exports are one of the largest growing economic sectors in my \nState. More than 1 million jobs in California are directly related to \ntrade, and that number is growing. So I see free and fair trade as an \nintegral part of California's economic future, and it is my \nresponsibility as a U.S. Senator representing that State to see that \nthe concerns and issues and industries of my State are protected in \nagreements, or at least as nearly as I can do so.\n  As I see it, America already has the most open markets in the world, \nbut the problem is that this openness isn't reciprocated by many of our \ntrading partners, and that brings us to the present situation.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Members of this body \nconstitutional responsibility for matters of trade and the economy. \nFast track is essentially a surrendering, an abrogation, of those \nconstitutional responsibilities provided to this body by the \nConstitution of the United States. I, for one, see no reason why we \nshould surrender that.\n  Essentially, fast track is simply the ability of the administration \nto negotiate a trade agreement, then bring it quickly to the Congress, \nget it ratified within a specific period of time, without congressional \nopportunity to amend it in any way, shape, or form.\n\n  The administration claims that fast track authority is needed to keep \nour economy growing strong, to allow our companies to compete with \nthose of the European Union and Japan in growing markets such as South \nAmerica and the Pacific Rim and to maintain America's symbolic \ncommitment to free trade by letting the President negotiate agreements \nwithout fear that Congress is going to mettle in any of the details.\n  In my view, that argument flies in the face of reality. Since \nPresident Clinton has taken office, 220 trade agreements have been \nnegotiated with foreign nations. Only two of those required fast track.\n  In recent years, U.S. exports have been the strength of the economy. \nU.S. exports increased 50 percent since 1991 without fast track. Today, \nexports are 30 percent higher than in 1993.\n  According to trade data released by the International Monetary Fund, \nUnited States exports to Brazil, South America's richest market, grew \n56 percent from 1994 to 1995. During that same period, the European \nUnion's exports to Brazil grew only 8 percent, while Japan's exports \ngrew only 18 percent. This growth in U.S. exports has occurred without \nfast track authority. As a recent Wall Street Journal article citing \nthe IMF data, pointed out, U.S. exporters hardly seem handicapped \nwithout fast track.\n  So arguments that the United States cannot negotiate trade agreements \nwithout fast track I think are specious. Further, to argue that without \nfast track the United States risks losing the jobs that come with \nrobust trade begs the question of how previous fast-track agreements \nhave fared in this regard.\n  Once again, I did not vote for NAFTA, but NAFTA was my first \nexperience with fast track. Once spurned, hopefully twice learned. \nUnder NAFTA, the United States $1.7 billion trade surplus with Mexico \nin 1993 became a\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\nrecord trade deficit of $16.3 billion by 1996. The balance of trade has \ngone exactly the wrong way.\n\n  Our balance of trade with Canada has also grown, more than doubling \nfrom $11 billion to $23 billion annually.\n  Let us look at GATT, another important trade agreement. The GATT \nagreement has contributed to the largest merchandise trade deficit in \nU.S. history. Today, it is at an all-time high of $165 billion.\n  I think these experiences combine to present an eloquent statement \nthat says: Go slow. Fast track may well backfire. In the future it may \nnot be as desirable as some claim.\n  If we look at the currency problems in certain southeast Asian \ncountries, we can identify some of their trade strategies. I think what \nhappens, as a result of some of the financial problems, is these \ncountries push for more exports to our country and they close their \nmarkets to our products. This is a very real danger signal for the \nfuture. I think it indicates that as a nation we should go slow. We \nneed to be very careful and deliberate in these negotiations.\n  The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 billion in exports \nequals between 14,000 and 15,000 jobs. Based on that calculation alone, \nthe United States has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs as a result of \nthese trade deficits. The administration claims a modest increase in \nU.S. net exports as a result of NAFTA, but the jury is still out.\n  These mounting trade deficits should be a loud and clear message that \nAmerica should negotiate better trade deals, rather than give up \ncongressional responsibility through fast track.\n  The bottom line is that Members of Congress are being asked to \nforfeit our ability to offer amendments to any trade agreement with no \nguarantee that the major industries of our States will not be \ndisadvantaged by those agreements. Under fast track, Congress is left \nwith no recourse except to vote against the whole agreement.\n  The President tried to address some of these concerns in the proposal \nhe sent to Congress. But the goals and objectives of the President's \nfast track proposal are still just that--goals and objectives. Previous \nfast track agreements have demonstrated why this is just not good \nenough.\n  For me, a Californian, NAFTA was a big case in point:\n  NAFTA had an immediate negative impact on the California wine \nindustry. The California wine industry produces 90 percent of our \nNation's wine and 90 percent of the wine exported by the United States.\n  Coincident with NAFTA, Mexico gave Chilean wines an immediate tariff \nreduction from 20 percent to 8 percent and a guarantee of duty-free \nstatus within a year. By contrast, United States wines face a 10-year \nphaseout of a much higher Mexican tariff, leaving U.S. wines at a \nsignificant disadvantage in the Mexican market. It is actually a \nwipeout of our market share of wine in Mexico.\n  The result of this tariff inequity was predictable. Exports of all \nU.S. wines to Mexico have dropped by one-third since NAFTA went into \neffect, while Chilean wine exports to Mexico have nearly doubled. The \nsize of the Chilean gains virtually match the size of U.S. losses. \nChilean wine picked up the market share lost by the U.S. wineries, \ndominated by California.\n  During the NAFTA debate in Congress, the administration pledged to \ncorrect these tariff inequities within 120 days of NAFTA's approval. \nLet me quote from a letter to Members of Congress from then U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Mickey Kantor dated November 8, 1993:\n\n       Pursuant to your request, you have my personal commitment \n     that, within 120 days of the coming into force of NAFTA, I \n     will personally negotiate the immediate reduction of Mexican \n     tariffs on US wines to the level of Mexican tariffs on \n     Chilean wines and, thereafter, have them fall parallel with \n     future reductions in such tariffs.\n\n  I personally talked with Mr. Kantor at least three or four times on \nthis issue. I also talked with the President, as well as others in the \nWhite House. This was a glaring discrepancy, and the whole \nadministration made a commitment to correct the discrepancy.\n\n  You would think that at least by today, 3 years later, the tariffs \nwould be parallel. But 3\\1/2\\ years later, these inequities remain \nenshrined in the agreement. As a matter of fact, as the result of an \nunrelated trade dispute, Mexico actually raised tariffs on United \nStates wine back up to pre-NAFTA levels of 20 percent, increasing the \ntariff from the 14 percent it had reached under NAFTA. Rather than drop \nto zero within 10 years, the tariff is now 20 percent, a wipeout for an \nAmerican market share.\n  Another product of fast track, the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade, known as GATT, also contained monumental inequities that \nseriously disadvantaged California's wine industry. Prior to the \nUruguay round of GATT, major wine competitors had wine tariffs that \nwere almost four times the United States tariff on an ad valorem basis.\n  But, even though the United States had the lowest tariffs of any \nmajor wine producer, United States negotiators agreed in the Uruguay \nround to drop United States tariffs by 36 percent over 6 years, while \nthe world's largest wine producer, the EU, dropped its tariffs by 10 \npercent. As a result, the current U.S. tariff on all wine products is \nan average of 2.4 percent. That is far lower than the EU's current \naverage tariff of 13 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If I may, the Senator's 10 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to finish this.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask that the Senator have an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Pardon me?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have an \nadditional 2 minutes, if that would solve the problem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I do not finish it, I will perhaps get on the \nqueue and come back later. I thank the Senator from Texas. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have some very specific concerns about fast track \nthat are not adequately addressed in the current proposal.\n  First, tariff inqequities: As I said, the United States is already \nthe most open market in the world. But our trade agreements have \nsometimes disadvantaged American industries by not requiring a level \nplaying field with other nations. All too often, the price of modest \ntariff reductions elsewhere has been further reductions in the already \nlow U.S. tariffs.\n  Any future agreements should require that other countries meet our \ntariff level before we agree to lower our tariffs further. Any fast-\ntrack proposal would have to address this issue before winning my \nsupport.\n  There should also be stronger enforcement mechanisms included when \ntrade barriers are not lowered as provided for in an agreement. Half \nthe problems with previous trade agreements have stemmed from \nnonenforcement. A recent report from the American Chamber of Commerce \nin Japan said more effort must be dedicated to enforcing existing \nagreements.\n  For example, Europe simply did not accept the GATT commitments on \naudio visual services, instead, maintaining its 1989 European Union \nBroadcast Directive. This EU directive limits the market for U.S. \nmovies and TV broadcasting.\n  Another example is an agreement signed with China in May of this year \nwhich grants the United States access to Chinese markets for table \ngrapes. However, despite the agreement, China maintains a 55 percent \ntariff on United States table grapes, presenting a significant barrier \nto United States exports.\n  Second, phytosanitary standards:\n  In addition to tariff inequities, disagreements over phytosanitary \nstandards continue, and are often used as de facto trade barriers. For \nexample: Japan's stringent tests for pesticides on American nectarines, \ncherries, and other fruit continues to deny market access for United \nStates products.\n  Another example is Chile: The United States imported 1 billion trays \nof fresh vegetables from Chile during the 1996-97 growing year, while \nthe United States exported no similar products to Chile during its \ngrowing year--why?--because of Chile's phytosanitary restrictions on \nimports of United States poultry, fruit, and vegetables, which\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\nhas effectively banned all imports of these goods.\n  The President's fast track proposal--section 2(b)(6)(C)(iii)--states \nthat unjustified phytosanitary restrictions should be eliminated, but \nthere is no language requiring that scientifically based standards be \nestablished before a trade agreement can be signed.\n  Third, dispute resolution: The previous free trade agreement with \nCanada, and the NAFTA agreement, established a process for resolving \ndisputes. But the process does not always work. For example:\n  California growers have complained in the past about Mexican \ninspectors being unavailable at the border, so shipments are delayed.\n  There is also no timely method of solving a dispute within a matter \nof hours. This is important when perishable goods are sitting at a \nborder or a port warehouse awaiting a decision.\n  A bigger problem now is that if a Mexican inspector finds a pest and \ndoes not know whether that pest is subject to quarantine, it reportedly \ntakes a week for the inspector to find out. No shipper can leave fruit \nsitting at the border for a week.\n  In January of last year, Mexico shipped over 8,000 boxes of brussels \nsprouts to the United States market causing the price to drop literally \nin half. This product dumping caused the price to drop to a level from \nwhich the brussel sprout industry could not recover during that season.\n  The dispute resolution process needs to be strengthened to include a \nmechanism for swift resolution--within 48 hours--when a dispute \ninvolves perishable commodities.\n  Fourth, environmental standards: I agree with many of my colleagues \nthat we should not encourage a race to the bottom, in which the country \nwith the weakest environmental protection wins the prize of economic \ngrowth.\n  We all know that pollution knows no geographic boundaries. U.S. \ncommitment to preserving the quality of our environment should be as \nvigorous as our commitment to open markets, and that commitment should \nbe reflected in our trade agreements to the greatest extent possible.\n  For example, large numbers of American companies have located in \nMexico. The pollution from these companies goes into the New River, \nwhich flows north into the United States, terminating at the Salton \nSea. I have flown over the New River, and I have seen first hand the \nextent of the pollution which is killing the Salton Sea. No companies \nin the United States can do what is being done in Mexicali.\n  Also, Mexican farmers have access to pesticides and other chemicals \nthat are not available to American growers. These disparities will only \nincrease as we enforce our own laws.\n  California growers will soon face an uneven playing field regarding \nthe use of methyl bromide, a widely used soil and post-harvest \nfumigant. Under the Clean Air Act, the United States is phasing out the \nuse of methyl bromide by 2001, but our trading partners will continue \nto use the chemical. Moreover, many of our trading partners require our \ngrowers to fumigate their crops with methyl bromide before the \ncommodity is shipped.\n  U.S. requirements to control particulate matter will add costs to \nU.S. producers, while no comparable requirements are being imposed on \nmany of our trading partners.\n  Our trade agreements should encourage our trading partners to live up \nto the highest environmental standards, not put added pressure on \nAmerican companies to lower our standards.\n  Fifth, manufacturing base and labor standards: I also share the \nconcern raised by many of my Democratic colleagues that we need to be \nparticularly careful to protect our manufacturing base, and not \nundermine labor standards, as we negotiate new trade agreements.\n  At one point, California was home to six automobile manufacturing \nplants, but today we are reduced to one. Once we lose our manufacturing \ncapacity, I am very concerned it will be very difficult if not \nimpossible to reclaim.\n  Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, made a blunt assessment of the \nsituation: he said America will cease to be a world power if it loses \nits manufacturing base. I wholeheartedly agree.\n  Service jobs, like energy and transportation services--which have \nfueled much of my State's economic rebound--are important, but can't \ncompensate for the loss of higher-wage manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry. And if we lose our manufacturing base, we lose the service \njobs, technology advances, and innovation that go with it.\n  U.S. manufacturers already face enormous pressure to relocate \nmanufacturing capability abroad to meet the regulatory and competitive \ndemands of foreign nations.\n  The Semiconductor Industry Association, representing the makers of \ncomputers chips, says 30 percent of their investment abroad is due to \nchipmakers' desire to avoid high tariffs or meet a foreign government's \nrequirement that manufacturing be done in their country, in order to \nsell in an otherwise closed market.\n  For example: China's $3 billion semiconductor market is growing \nrapidly. But they have a closed market, imposing high tariffs unless \nthe manufacturer builds a plant in their country.\n  This is a $132 billion worldwide market and is expected to reach $245 \nbillion market by the year 2000. California is the Nation's leading \nchip producing State, so this is enormously important to my State.\n  U.S. trade agreements must aggressively tear down the trade \nrestrictions that force U.S. manufacturers overseas.\n  U.S. manufacturers often cannot compete with foreign countries on \nwage costs.\n  One of the arguments advanced by NAFTA supporters was the expansion \nof trade will boost the economies of our trading partners--and \ntheoretically their wages--and expand the demand for our products in \nreturn. However, based on our NAFTA experience, the theory has not \nmaterialized.\n  According to the Labor Department, the wage gap between United States \nand Mexico workers is widening, rather than narrowing. In 1993, Mexican \nwages were 15 percent of those in the United States. Today, they are 8 \npercent.\n  This decline in wages is not solely the effect of the Mexican peso \ncrisis. In 1994--before the peso collapse--real hourly wages in Mexico \nhad already dropped to nearly 30 percent below their 1980 level--UC-\nBerkeley sociologist Harley Shaiken.\n  Mexico's financial problems only exacerbated the trend. Since 1994, \nreal wages in Mexico have dropped another 25 percent to roughly half \ntheir 1980 level.\n  Clearly, NAFTA has not yet improved the wages of Mexican labor.\n  Conclusion: Any fast track legislation must contain the following \nassurances:\n  There must be a mechanism for swift and effective dispute \nresolutions.\n  There must be language included stipulating that any agreement \nnegotiated under fast track must set equal tariffs between the United \nStates and our trading partners before the United States agrees to \nlower tariffs further.\n  There must be mandatory mutual acceptance of scientifically-sound \nphytosanitary standards.\n  There must be enforceable environmental standards in place.\n  And there must be labor and wage provisions, and aggressive reduction \nof trade barriers, to protect our manufacturing future.\n  Without these assurances written into the bill, I am very concerned \nthat extension of fast track authority would give away, once again, the \nonly ability I have as a U.S. Senator to influence trade agreements to \nsee that they are responsive to the concerns of my State and important \nindustries.\n  Until these concerns are addressed, Mr. President, I must oppose any \nextension of fast-track authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10456-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10462-S10463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to speak in \nopposition to the motion to invoke cloture on S. 25, the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reform bill.\n  Throughout my years in Congress, I have supported efforts to reform \ncampaign finance laws. I have, for example, voted to eliminate \npolitical action committees and to prohibit the use of the \ncongressional franking privilege for mass mailings.\n  Along with Senators Gregg, Torricelli, and Johnson, I am cosponsoring \nin this Congress legislation to establish a bipartisan commission that\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\nwould recommend campaign finance reforms. The Claremont Commission Act, \nwhich is named after the agreement reached between President Clinton \nand Speaker Gingrich at a meeting in my home State of New Hampshire, \nwould establish a nine-member commission to examine campaign finance \nrules and propose comprehensive legislation for reform.\n  The Claremont Commission would make recommendations based on good \npolicy, not politics. The creation of such a commission finally would \nmake good on the promise that President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich \nmade when they shook hands in Claremont in May, 1995.\n  Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill is \nseriously flawed. Indeed, I believe that it is unconstitutional because \nit unduly restricts the freedom of speech that is guaranteed by the \nfirst amendment to our Nation's Constitution.\n  The bill's ban on soft money is a restriction on free speech. Even \nworse, in my view, the bill's severe limitations on so-called issue \nadvocacy advertisements that mention a candidate's name, or show the \ncandidate's likeness, within 60 days of an election, involve a direct \nregulation of the content of political speech.\n  Out Nation's founders meant to allow free, open, and robust political \nspeech and debate. The McCain-Feingold bill, however, moves to limit \nfree speech and debate. I wholeheartedly agree with my distinguished \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, as well as the many \nconstitutional scholars whose views he has cited, that the McCain-\nFeingold bill goes too far in regulating and restricting free speech \nand, therefore, is unconstitutional.\n  I believe that any meaningful campaign finance reform proposal ought \nto require candidates to disclose completely to the American people \nwhat they spend on their campaigns and from whom they received campaign \ncontributions. Full disclosure, not limitations on free speech, is the \nright kind of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my first official act as a new U.S. \nSenator, taken 15 minutes after I was sworn in, was to become a sponsor \nof the bipartisan campaign finance reform bill that the U.S. Senate \nwill begin to vote on later today.\n  I strongly believe that political campaigns should be about people \nand not money. But that is not what is happening in America today. \nCampaign finance activity has become like the arms race--one side gets \n$10, the next side gets $20, the other side comes back and gets $30. It \nspirals up and up--spending that is out of control, spending that is \nsimply unaccountable to voters.\n  Every Member of the U.S. Senate has devoted hours and hours to \nfundraising. Every Member of the U.S. Senate knows that when there is \nan election that Tuesday in November, folks sleep in on Wednesday, and \nthen in November it starts all over again. Every Member of the U.S. \nSenate knows that America deserves better.\n  I don't agree with every part of the McCain-Feingold bipartisan \ncampaign finance legislation; I would not pretend otherwise. And I \nthink that is true of many of the sponsors of this legislation. But if \nthis bipartisan bill passes, candidates in America are going to spend \nmore time talking to voters in shopping malls and less time working the \nphones raising funds. That is going to be good for democracy in \nAmerica, and I hope the Senate passes this bipartisan bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to comment a little bit on the \ncampaign finance debate that is going on.\n  Mr. President, over the last several months, Americans have expressed \ngrave concern over the daily reports of alleged illegal or improper \ncampaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee and White \nHouse during the 1996 campaign cycle. These reports have raised the \nperception among some Americans that access and votes can be bought in \nWashington and that the system for financing our Federal campaigns is \ncorrupt and broken.\n  Consequently, there have been many proposals introduced in the \nCongress that are intended to change the way in which campaigns for \nFederal office are financed. Most of these proposals call for enacting \nnew limits on how Americans can exercise their political freedoms. \nTheir stated purpose is to ultimately restore the trust of the public \nin their Government.\n  I share the concerns about these reports of irregular and even \nillegal fundraising during the 1996 elections. However, I disagree that \nthe way to respond to these concerns is to pass new laws that would do \nnothing more than limit the ability of Americans to exercise their \npolitical freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment.\n  The first amendment has always been the basis for active citizen \nparticipation in our political process. The first amendment ensures \nthat, among other things, average Americans can participate in our \ndemocratic process through publicly disclosed contributions to \ncampaigns of their choice. It also allows Americans to freely draft \nletters to the editor, distribute campaign literature, and participate \nin rallies and get-out-the-vote drives.\n  In my view, the Federal Government can restore the integrity of our \nelectoral process through greater enforcement of existing laws, \nincreased disclosure of contributions and expenditures, and protection \nof the rights of Americans to become involved in the democratic process \nwithout fear of coercion. We don't need new campaign finance laws. \nSimply loading new laws upon those which have already been broken will \nnot solve the problem. After all, if campaigns or donors would not obey \nthe current laws, strengthened almost 25 years ago after the Watergate \nscandal, why would we believe they would\n\n[[Page S10464]]\n\nobey a new set of rules? They simply can't.\n  The whole exercise is a public relations scheme designed to let the \npublic think we are reacting--when we are not. To move in this \ndirection would only threaten the ability of Americans to participate \nin the democracy which they have helped to create. Placing new limits \nor government controls are not the answer.\n  Mr. President, this leads me to my concerns with the McCain-Feingold \nproposal. While I commend the proponents of McCain-Feingold for making \nsome minor changes to their initial proposal, such as removing the \nprovisions providing for voluntary spending limits and restrictions on \npolitical action committees, the modified McCain-Feingold proposal \nstill continues to suppress the rights of Americans to communicate \ntheir ideas and express their views.\n  For example, this modification is premised upon the belief that there \nis too much money spent on American elections. If we accept this \nassumption, then Congress has decided to assert questionable authority \nto suppress the rights of Americans to become involved in the political \nprocess and make their voices heard.\n  In fact, the belief that there is government justification for \nregulating the costs of political campaigns was rejected by the Supreme \nCourt in the landmark case of Buckley versus Valeo. In Buckley, the \nCourt declared,\n\n       The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive or unwise. In the free society ordained \n     by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--\n     individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as \n     associations and political committees--who must retain \n     control over the quantity and range of debate on public \n     issues in a political campaign.\n\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal also fails to recognize that Americans \nhave a right to petition the government and have their voices heard. \nAmericans have both a right and obligation to make their views known \nand hold those that seek to represent them accountable for their \nactions or positions on issues.\n  Mr. President, I expect the American people will receive a full \ndisclosure of campaign finance law violations. I believe the testimony \nbefore the Governmental Affairs Committee has thus far proved the need \nfor the Federal Government to focus its efforts on greater enforcement \nof our existing laws and prosecution of those who violate the laws, \nbefore Congress seeks to pass new laws. Congress should not use \nviolations of existing law to restrict political speech and \nparticipation by those who abide by current law.\n  In addition to more timely enforcement of our existing election laws, \nwe should encourage greater disclosure of each contribution and \nexpenditure. Fair and frequent disclosure of contributions by Federal \noffice seekers will open up the political process to the electorate.\n  I am encouraged by the disclosure provisions contained within the \nMcCain-Feingold proposals. We share the same goal of letting the sun \nshine on the process. I am sure there will be additional opportunities \nto debate this aspect of the McCain-Feingold proposal.\n  Finally, Congress should work to protect the right of Americans to \nparticipate in the democratic process without fear of coercion. Despite \nthe Supreme Court decision in Communications Workers of America versus \nBeck almost 10 years ago, millions of Americans still have portions of \ntheir paychecks taken and used for political purposes for which they \nmay disagree, without their knowledge or consent.\n  I believe forcing an individual to make compulsory campaign \ncontributions is contrary to our constitutional form of government and \nthe first amendment freedoms we enjoy as citizens. As Thomas Jefferson \nonce said, ``to compel a man to furnish contribution of money for the \npropagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and \ntyrannical.'' For these reasons, I support the majority leader's \ndecision to offer the ``Paycheck Protection Act'' as an amendment to \nthe McCain-Feingold bill. I do not consider this a ``poison pill'' to \npassage of campaign finance legislation, but rather effective medicine \nfor our Nation's employees because it will allow individuals to regain \ncontrol of their paychecks, avoid coercion, and exercise their \npolitical freedoms.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as we approach the next century, the Senate \nhas the responsibility to restore the public's trust in their \ngovernment and preserve the political freedoms that were enacted over \n200 years ago. I remain hopeful that our actions here will not affect \nthe ability of future generations of Americans to enjoy these same \nfreedoms.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that the so-called Lott \namendment will be considered this afternoon after lunch--an amendment \nto the campaign finance reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold bill. \nI want to address that briefly. I have given it serious consideration \nbecause I think it is a serious matter.\n  I must say that I agree with the underlying intent of this \nlegislation. I support the concept of this amendment. I would like to \nsee it enacted into law. I believe that American workers need all the \nprotections they can get with regard to the matters that are addressed \nin this amendment. In fact, I intend to cosponsor freestanding \nlegislation that would give us an opportunity to have an up-or-down \nvote on this idea.\n  But, Mr. President, as I look at this, I became concerned whether or \nnot there is any chance of this amendment ever becoming law because, as \nI understand it, it is an amendment to the campaign finance bill. When \nI ask around whether or not those who are supporting the amendment will \nsupport the bill in case the amendment passes, I don't get any \naffirmative responses. In other words, as I see the state of play now, \nif we pass this amendment, then those who are primarily in support of \nthe amendment will still oppose the underlying legislation. So there is \nno chance, as I see it, that the amendment or the ideas expressed in \nthe amendment have any chance at all for becoming law in this process.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this particular legislation, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill. I cannot align myself, even though I agree with \nthe underlying intent, with an effort that has no chance of success in \nterms of passing any legislation or passing an amendment but that \nwould, in effect, make sure that the underlying bill, McCain-Feingold, \nand the so-called Lott amendment, would both never become the law of \nthis land. That is what we are faced with.\n  I must say it makes it a little bit more difficult for me when it is \nopenly expressed as an effort to kill the underlying legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I will do what I can for the rest of this Congress \nto see that the working men and women are protected in this regard.\n  I think it is a noble settlement. I think it is a good idea. There is \nfreestanding legislation on this which I will support. But since I see \nno hope and no opportunity for this amendment to ever have the force \nand effect of law, then I cannot support it and will not.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be heard for \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just want to express my gratitude and \nthe gratitude of the Senator from Arizona for the statement of the \nSenator from Tennessee, the fact that he was an original cosponsor of \nthis bill, he has been bipartisan every step of the way\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\nand has made this reform much more possible both in the past and today. \nAnd I thank him for his tremendous leadership on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10464-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, I apologize to my colleagues for having to take this \ntime right now before the cloture vote. However, the last couple of \nweeks have been somewhat hectic in the scheduling of floor action, with \nthe end of the fiscal year, appropriations bills, fast track and ISTEA \nlegislation brewing, all looming over the Senate schedule. And I wanted \nto address the Senate before these votes occur.\n  Having said all that, I think all of my colleagues understand that \none of the major roles of the majority leader is to set the Senate \nschedule during each day's session and during the week. Conversely, \nyesterday I watched with dismay as the minority leader filed a cloture \nmotion to the pending campaign finance reform bill and further \nannounced it would be his intention to continue that practice for the \nremainder of the week. Unfortunately, since I was not notified of the \nminority leader's intention, I could not be on the floor to respond.\n  I will say now that my response was really one of dismay. All \nSenators know that filing a cloture motion does affect the Senate \nschedule. Needless to say, if cloture is invoked, if more than 60 \nSenators voted to limit the debate, then the Senate must remain on that \nclotured item until disposed of, regardless of what the majority leader \nmight have had in mind for the schedule for floor consideration during \nthose few days.\n  So I say to my colleagues that I do regret the action, but I \nunderstand how these things happen. Sometimes we just can't get in \ntouch with each other and there is miscommunication. But prior to that \nevent, the Senate had basically conducted what I think has been an \ninteresting debate, an informative debate, and I think a fair and \nconstructive debate. As of yesterday afternoon at approximately 7:30 \np.m., the Senate had been considering this campaign finance reform bill \nfor parts or all of 6 days. The debate had exceeded 22 hours and has \nbeen basically evenly shared by both sides of the issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent the time spent on the debate be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Friday, September 26th (On the bill 10-3:45) 545\"\nProponents:\n

So I understand, especially in this case, though, there is \na wish by the minority to try to control the Senate schedule. However, \nthere are other pressing items that are pending on the Senate's \ncalendar that require Senate consideration. Some of those include, but \nare not limited to, fast-track legislation, remaining appropriations \nconference reports, ISTEA, Amtrak, adoption and foster-care legislation \nand, hopefully, perhaps others.\n  In closing, I hope that all Senators understand that I will have to \nmove to proceed to other legislative items after these two cloture \nvotes if cloture is not invoked. I am announcing to my colleagues now, \nso that no Member will be surprised by my actions. For the record, I \nhave held up my end of the bargain by making the campaign finance issue \nthe pending business prior to the October recess. It was suggested we \nwere going to delay it until the end of the week, or the end of the \nmonth, or the end of the session. I said at the time I had no intention \nof doing that. I thought we should have debate early and we should have \nevery opportunity for Senators to express themselves. The Senate has \nbeen provided more than adequate debate on this bill, and I think that \nthe important thing now is to go ahead and have these cloture votes. It \nappears to me that there is no consensus at this time on this issue. I \nwill have more to say about this after the votes, and I hope that we \ncan move on to other issues that need to be done before the close of \nthe session.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very disappointed with the \nannouncement made by the majority leader, but I am not surprised. He \nhas said from the very beginning that he was going to devise a strategy \nthat would kill campaign finance reform, and he may have done so in the \ninterim. It is not our intention to schedule legislation. It is not our \nintention to in any way obstruct the desires of the majority leader to \ngo on to other issues. But it is our desire to have a good debate about \none of the most important pieces of legislation pending before the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\n  While we have had a good exchange of views on this particular bill, \nwe have not had a debate. A debate in the Senate, by its very nature, \nallows Senators to offer amendments, to exchange views with regard to \nthe language of the bill itself. But we have been precluded from doing \nthat. Why? Because the majority has disallowed the opportunity for \nanybody to offer an amendment. What kind of debate is that? We have \nbeen on it and off it intermittently for the last couple of weeks, but \nwe have not had a debate, not one living up to the standards and the \nexpectations of anybody with regard to this body. This ought to be a \ndeliberative body. There is no deliberation when the tree is filled, \nthe amendments are precluded, and the bill is pulled.\n  So, we will continue to persist, regardless of whether it is in the \nform of an amendment or a bill. Again, I would rather work with the \nmajority leader. He mentioned being surprised. I guess now we both had \nthat occasion. I am not going to talk about Pearl Harbor this \nafternoon, as he did on the 16th of September. But let us not surprise \neach other. Let us get on with trying to lead the Senate in a way that \nwill allow us to complete our work. We are prepared to do that on this \nbill and every other bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10465-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10466-S10467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to S. 1156, the D.C. \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, is this a debatable motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is a debatable motion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to be heard on the issue, if I \ncan. In essence, what we are doing here is pulling the bill. We are now \nstating that, at least for the purposes of this week and perhaps this \nsession of Congress, debate on the campaign finance bill is over.\n  We are not prepared to accept that. I think we ought to have a good \ndiscussion this afternoon about whether we really want to do that. Do \nwe want to pull this bill and go to the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill? I would say that at least every Member on this \nside of the aisle, and perhaps some on that side of the aisle, are not \nprepared to do that. So we are not prepared to have that vote right \nnow, and I hope we will have a good discussion about it, a good debate \nabout whether it is in our interest to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not object for the purposes of \ngiving the majority leader the opportunity to respond.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for doing that \nso that I can respond to his comments. First of all, let me tell \nMembers where we are on this. The D.C. appropriations bill would be the \npending issue. We do have a cloture motion that we filed on that. We \nwould have a vote on that not before 4 o'clock. There is still a chance \nwe would get an agreement between Senator Mack, Senator Gramm, and \nSenator Graham of Florida on the immigration issue, and then we would \nhave one other pending amendment. I believe it is the Coats scholarship \namendment for the District of Columbia.\n  I believe those are the only two pending issues we would still have \nto dispose of on the D.C. appropriations bill, and then we would be \nable to go to final passage. That would be the last of the 13 \nappropriations bills, and then we could go on to conference on that \nand, hopefully, get all of these conference reports done before the \ncontinuing resolution runs out on the 23d, I believe, of this month. I \nwanted to make sure Members understand what we are trying to do here--\ngo back to the D.C. appropriations bill.\n  Now, with regard to the issue that we have been debating and the \nvotes we just had, those two cloture votes that we just took, in my \nopinion, put an end to campaign finance reform at this time. They end \nthe drive for phony reform, the kind that rigs the law in favor of one \nside or the other. They end the partisan game plan that treated the \nConstitution and the right of free speech guarantees as technicalities \nto be gotten around. That was the worst aspect of this year's effort to \nrewrite Federal campaign law, this willingness to abridge one of the \nfundamental freedoms of the American people.\n  Earlier this year, to my amazement, 38 Senators actually voted to \nchange the first amendment so that the Congress or a Federal agency \ncould limit free speech. I never thought I would see that day arrive. \nNow, those 38 Senators have been joined by others who would not \nexplicitly repudiate the first amendment, but they would in fact change \nit. I think that is a very serious challenge to the Constitution.\n\n  What we have here is an effort to change the subject, to change the \nlaws, where the laws we have on the books have already been broken. We \ndo not have a consensus yet on how to proceed on this issue. We will be \nback on this issue some day. But I want to say again that until we do \nsomething about the paycheck equity issue, allow people to have some \nsay over how their dues are used, and make sure that all campaign \ncontributions are voluntary, I don't see how we can ever resolve this \nissue. So I feel good about what we did today. I think we did the right \nthing for the American people, the right thing in protecting free \nspeech. Now we can move on to other issues, and we can continue to have \nother debate and other votes on this on other days.\n  But as for now, I think we did the right thing. I am proud the Senate \ndidn't turn its back on the Constitution. Just yesterday, the Supreme \nCourt ruled that you cannot limit free speech, you cannot limit \nadvocacy issues in campaigns. We may not like it, but in America you \nshould have a right to say how your monies are used. You should have \nthe ability to express your position on an issue or on a candidate.\n  So I hope that we can mend some of the problems that have developed \nand go on and do our work on a lot of important issues, and perhaps \nsome day we can find a way to have an opportunity to come together on \nthis issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a question, without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President----\n  Mr. KERRY. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The majority leader has yielded so that I may ask a \nquestion. Your request was to move to the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill. Correct me if I am wrong, but that is the last \nappropriations bill we haven't passed. We passed the other 12, and we \npassed a continuing resolution. The continuing resolution will expire \non the 23d of this month. So it is your hope that we can dispose of the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill, hopefully, tonight; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. That's correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And dispose of--I believe there is the Coats amendment \npending and also a Mack proposal pending. So if we can dispose of both \nof those amendments, finish the District of Columbia appropriations \nbill, let it go to conference, and hopefully work out the differences \nwith the House on that and several other conference reports, as many as \npossible this week, hopefully complete all those by the 23d, maybe we \nwon't need a continuing resolution. It looks like there may be a couple \nof bills that we may not be able to finish by the 23d. It is your hope \nthat we can finish the D.C. bill tonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. That's correct. I believe we can. I understand that the \ninterested Senators, on a bipartisan basis, have come very close to an \nagreement. I think we may have an answer within the hour.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The majority leader made some comments on the campaign \nfinance reform and paycheck protection. I know my colleague the \nminority leader said he wanted to have more discussion. I will tell my \ncolleague that I would like to visit about that a little\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nbit more as well. I think every American should be guaranteed the right \nto say whether or not they contribute to a campaign. I can't imagine \nthat any employees have money taken away from them on a monthly basis \nwithout their consent. I think that is un-American.\n  I personally inform the majority leader and tell my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, I think it is a very fundamental question of freedom, and \nI feel very strongly about it. I am happy to discuss that with our \ncolleagues and, hopefully, figure out a way to pass it. Two or three of \nmy colleagues say maybe it should be amended. I am happy to discuss \nthat with them as well. I never said it was perfect. I think we should \nhave a fundamental question of fairness. Should we not have the right \nor the opportunity to make sure that everybody that contributes to a \npolitical campaign does it on a voluntary basis?\n\n  So I appreciate the majority leader's responding to my question. I \nknow he wants to set this aside as far as campaign reforms and pass the \nappropriations bill. I concur with that.\n  But just to ask the majority leader a question, does he agree with me \nthat every American should have the right to be able to contribute to a \ncampaign on a voluntary basis?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is such a fundamental, basic right, I really can't \nunderstand why there is such resistance to it in campaign finance \nreform. Frankly, all employees, whether they are union members or not, \nshould have the right to say how their dues or fees are used, and it \nshould not be done without their permission.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky for the purpose of a \nquestion, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, Leader, let me just ask if you are familiar with \nthe cloture vote we had on this issue last year. I was asking the \nleader, since I am compelled to ask a question, if he is familiar with \nthe cloture vote we had last year.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe I am familiar with it, and I believe that the \nvote we just had, as a matter of fact, was a better vote in defense of \nfree speech than we had just a year ago. After all the pressures and \nall of the media hype on this issue, as a matter of fact, the Senate \nvoted by a stronger margin for free speech and for union members being \nable to have a say on where their dues would go.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say the majority leader's memory is excellent. In \nfact, the vote against cloture and the vote to defend the first \namendment was better this year than it was last year, in spite of all \nof the effort that has been made to undermine fundamental free speech \nin this country. So I commend the majority leader for his leadership, \nand we look forward to defeating this measure at any time it may be \noffered to the Senate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for the purpose \nof a question, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the majority leader if it is a fact that, under the \nprocedures of the Senate, this bill, the D.C. appropriations bill, \nwould have been the regular order of the Senate, so it was unnecessary \nto move to proceed to the D.C. appropriations as the regular order, \nexcept that by moving, as the majority leader has, he has in effect \ntaken the campaign finance reform bill and put it back on the calendar, \nwhich essentially removes it from the capacity of automatically coming \nup again before the Senate; is that an accurate description of what has \nhappened parliamentarily?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is an accurate description of what is \nhappening parliamentarily. We have had parts of 7 days of debate. We \nhave had two votes on this issue. As I said, it is obvious that a \nconsensus has not been reached. We have other important issues that \nMembers want to come up and debate. I accommodated advocates of the \ncampaign reform bill, and we have had the debate they wanted. It came \nup early, not later.\n  Now we have other issues we need to deal with. We need to deal with \nthe District of Columbia appropriations bill, so that it can go to \nconference and hopefully go down to the President. A lot of work has \ngone into that bill this year to try to help the people in the District \nof Columbia. Do we want the District of Columbia appropriations bill to \ndie here and be folded in some form or another in some CR at some \npoint?\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts would like to see us do Amtrak \nreform so that, as a matter of fact, the funds we have identified, a \nflow of funds for Amtrak, can go forward. If we don't get the reform \nauthorization language, the money will not be released. That is going \nto get to be a serious problem. We see the possibility, or even the \nprobability, of a strike facing Amtrak later on this very month. It \nseems to me that we need to address some of those issues so that we can \nhave adequate funding for Amtrak. I know the Senator from Massachusetts \nwants that.\n\n  The President of the United States indicated to me through top staff \nofficials on Monday morning that they hope we will vote on this issue \nand then move on to other issues, including the fast-track trade \nagreement. We have a lot of important work to do. I just said a moment \nago that I don't think this is the last time we are going to talk about \ncampaign finance reform. Maybe some day we can sit down and see what we \nmight agree on. We are certainly not going to agree to a situation that \ngives up any American's right to free speech and that forces other \ncitizens to pay, against their wishes, for campaigns they don't \nsupport.\n  So you are right that our purpose here is to get off of campaign \nfinance reform for now and go to the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill. I believe if we can do that, we could probably \nfinish today. The next order of business I would like to try to go to \nis the ISTEA transportation infrastructure bill. That, too, is a \nbipartisan issue that Senator Daschle and I have talked about. Senator \nMax Baucus is working on it, along with Senator Chafee. There is a \nbipartisan group, and they are ready to go. In that case, the Senate \nneeds to provide a little leadership because the House hasn't been able \nto pass a bill. They passed just an extension. We can pass a 6-year \nbill with a formula that would be fairer overall. There will be some \ndisagreements on that. Until we get started, we are never going to \nresolve them.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I can continue, let me say to the \nmajority leader, I think all of us have been sensitive to the needs of \nthe Senate to do the business of the Senate. We have set aside the \ncampaign finance reform in order to do that at any time that it was \nimportant. But there is a very big distinction between taking this off \nthe calendar in a way that prohibits us, if we were to reach agreement, \nfrom returning to it immediately or from really deliberating on it.\n  I ask the majority leader, would he be prepared, if Members on both \nsides were to discuss in the next hours some kind of approach that we \nweren't permitted to vote on, we weren't permitted to actually \nlegislate on, but which might resolve this question of how you provide \npeople the free choice with respect to their dues or otherwise, in a \nfair-minded way? Would the majority leader be prepared, if Members on \nboth sides believe there is a solution, to bring this back for a vote \nin order to deal with that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, when we have a solution even in distant sight that \nwould be fair and would not restrict Americans' ability to participate \nin the election process, a system that is a fair one, then certainly I \nam always amenable to talking further. My record is replete with \nexamples where I said, I think there is hope, let's work. But on this \nissue at this time, that hope is not there. There has been no real \nmovement in that direction. So I don't foresee that happening.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts was one of the ones who said, ``Are \nyou going to bring this up early, or are you going to wait until the \nlast day of the last week of this session?'' I said, no, I didn't want \nto do that because I didn't want us to end up on this issue without \nhaving the time to talk about it. I thought about it and I said, as a \nmatter of fact, let's go ahead and get started because I thought there \nwas a window of opportunity in here to have the debate, which we did \nfor some 23 or 24\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\nhours, on campaign finance reform. So I said, let's do it now. But I \nthink it would not be good faith, after all that, to want to do it \nagain next week, and every day we are in session, and the last day we \nare in session. I don't think that is in good faith either. That will \nwind up affecting everything else we need to do.\n  We have had a good debate. We know that right now there is not a \nconsensus. But if we begin to move toward one that is not partisan, \nthat is fair and does not limit free speech, I am always willing to see \nwhat we can agree to.\n  Mr. KERRY. One last question with a very quick response. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts contemplated the Senate doing what the Senate is \nsupposed to do, which is legislating, voting. We have not voted on one \namendment. We have not permitted one issue to come to the real \ndeliberative efforts of the Senate, which is through a vote. I think \nthe Senator knows that.\n  So my question would be, if there is this kind of solution, will the \nSenator permit it to come to a vote--if it were a majority of the \nSenate that had come to that conclusion, a majority of the Senate?\n  Mr. LOTT. I cannot help but be reminded of some of the speeches I \nheard the former majority leader from Maine, Senator Mitchell, make on \nthis floor. When a Senator would object to his procedures, he would \nreply that the Senator understands how the Senate operates; the Senator \nunderstands that in the Senate it quite often requires 60 votes, not 50 \nor 51 votes, to take action; the Senator understands that being \ndeliberative doesn't mean having multiple votes.\n  We could have had amendment after amendment after amendment and be on \nthis subject for the rest of this month. But there was no consensus. \nThere is no consensus. The truth of the matter is that the other side \nfeels that, if they do not limit free speech, the bill is not worth \nhaving. We, on the contrary, feel that if people can't have control \nover how their contributions are used or their dues are used, the bill \nwould not be fair.\n  But, as I have said before, we will keep working on this. And I am \nalways amenable to suggestions. I have been talking to Senators this \nvery morning about that.\n  I yield to the Senator, if I can. Let me yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, then I will come back to this side, for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you. I thank the leader.\n  I just wanted to ask a question. The Senator from Massachusetts \ntalked about the job of the Senate as it moves forward on legislation. \nI just wanted to harken back to his statement about FDA reform, and \nwhat has been done by some people trying to block consideration of FDA \nreform and comptime-flextime. If you will correct me, I believe it is \nstill on the calendar at this point because we do not have 60 votes to \nmove forward with the comptime.\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, on flextime, that is the pending \nbusiness. And, under certain circumstances this week, we could end up \nback on that bill, which will suit me fine.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is it not the fact that we will not be able to get 60 \nvotes on comptime-flextime, and as a result we have not been able to \nmove forward with that piece of legislation, which, as we have just \nbeen told by the Senator from Massachusetts, is the business of the \nSenate? We have not had that debate yet.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, in answer to the Senator's question, that the \nmajority of the Senate thinks there should be an opportunity for \nworkers to be able to take time to be with their children, or to do \nwhatever they might need to do--for the PTA or for their own health \nreasons. The U.S. Senate could, by a majority vote, allow that to \nhappen, but instead the bill has been filibustered. Since we have not \nbeen able to round up 60 votes, it still is pending on the calendar.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that the major opposition to the \ncomptime-flextime--you can tell me--the major opposition that is moving \nis on the other side of the aisle, and talking to those Members to \nblock the comptime-flextime bill from coming up for consideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know there has been a lot of interest by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, about that. And I know he had problems \nwith the Food and Drug Administration reform package, which, by the \nway, passed with a bipartisan vote, overwhelmingly, to cut off his \nfilibuster. We voted, I think, twice to cut off the filibuster, and I \nunderstand it passed 98 to 2. It took us a month to get it done.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Can the Senator say what outside organizations are \nprincipally opposed to the comptime-flextime bills being considered \nhere?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the AFL-CIO. I think it would be helpful if we \ncould check with their members because I think the members would like \nto have a say about the denial of their comptime-flextime.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. With respect to the Lott amendment on paycheck equity, \nwhat outside organization is blocking the consideration of that? In \nfact, what outside organization is a major opponent?\n  Mr. LOTT. That legislation to allow for voluntary contributions to \ncampaigns so that workers are not required to pay dues as a condition \nof employment and then have those dues used for political candidates. \nOur amendment to fix that problem has been opposed by the union bosses. \nBut yet the union members in the country, when they find out that their \ndues are being used for political purposes without their permission and \nwithout their knowledge--the ones I talk to--are irate. They say, ``I \nwant the opportunity to decide. I may want to give permission. I might \nwant to check it off and say this is fine.''\n  But in America shouldn't you have the ability to say that? Shouldn't \nyou have the choice about how your own moneys are used as a condition \nof employment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would also ask the question maybe in a little \ndifferent light.\n  Let me ask this question. My question is, can you come up with a \nreason why someone would want to be debating the changing of the \nunderlying law with respect to campaign finance at a time when there is \nanother debate going on out here about violations of current existing \nlaw? Can you possibly postulate for me what you think the motivation of \nsome might be to question the underlying existing law of campaign \nfinance in the face of overwhelming evidence and even new evidence that \nhas come out, as recently as other day, that there are existing \nviolations of campaign finance law? Could you answer for me or \npostulate for me what the reasons are that someone may want to divert \nattention away from a debate and examination of the breaking of \nexisting campaign laws to talk about something completely unrelated, \nwhich is changing the existing law?\n  Mr. LOTT. I said in my speech a week or so ago that what really \nbothers me here is people saying, ``My goodness, the laws which we \nwrote have been broken and, therefore, we should change them.'' And \nwhat new laws do they propose? Laws that restrict free speech, in the \nMcCain-Feingold proposal as it now stands. There are provisions in that \nwith regard to advocacy, or advocating an issue, or advocating even a \ncandidate. The Supreme Court just yesterday refused to review the lower \ncourt which said you can't limit that.\n  Our paycheck protection amendment has been called a ``poison pill.'' \nSince when is it a ``poison pill'' when you have an amendment that says \nthe American people should have a say about how their money is used?\n  I think that is a very strange description of a very fundamental \nfreedom and right I thought we still had in America.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I could ask one additional question, do you find it \nironic that on the day in which we have campaign finance hearings in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, talking about the legal activities \nat the White House with the Democratic National Committee, that Members \nof the Senate here on the other side of the aisle want to focus on a \ncompletely different issue which has to do with changing the existing \ncampaign? Do you think there is some sort of strategy involved here? I \nam just curious as someone sort of on the outside.\n\n[[Page S10470]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It appears to me there might be some thinking along those \nlines. But, you know, I, at this point, don't want to question the \nmotives of others.\n  I appreciate the questions that have been asked, and I would ask \nconsent that after the Senator from South Dakota speaks, that I be able \nto regain the floor to continue this discussion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of the matters raised by my \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  First of all, with regard to the District of Columbia appropriations \nbill, there is no reason why the majority leader could not have simply \ncalled for regular order. By calling for regular order, the D.C. \nappropriations bill would have been on the floor. We would not have had \nto put the campaign finance reform bill back on the calendar.\n  So no one should be misled by that sleight-of-hand. It is very \nimportant that everyone realize what happened. The majority leader \npulled the bill, put it back on the calendar, ostensibly so we could \ncome back to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. But that \nwasn't necessary because the regular order is the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill. So we could have achieved what the majority leader \nsaid he wanted to achieve simply by going back to the regular order.\n  Mr. President, I hope everybody realizes that is the reason Democrats \nhave found the decision of the majority leader questionable today. Why \nwould we do that if, indeed, we are going to be going back to cloture \nvotes tomorrow and to cloture votes again on Thursday?\n  I have heard several of my colleagues say that it is the American way \nto ensure that every single person voluntarily participate in the \npolitical process, and, in so protecting the voluntary nature of that \nparticipation, it is critical that unions provide for some mechanisms \nto refund that portion of the payment dedicated to political activity \nwithin each union. That is the American way to have that opportunity.\n  I do not want to debate the so-called Lott amendment at length. But I \ncertainly expect that they would then support that same freedom--that \nsame voluntary spirit--when it comes to the mandatory collection of \npolitical resources from corporations, from organizations, and from all \nother entities involved in the political process. If it is good for \none, it has to be good for the other.\n  With regard to having a full and fair debate about that, I don't know \nwhat could be more full or more fair than to bring up the bill \nseparately and have a good debate--an all-out debate about it.\n  Let's have a debate with amendments on whether or not we want to \nexpand it, whether, indeed, it is a good idea.\n  But I get back to why this is going on. This is going on not because \npeople are concerned about freedom, about free speech. This is going on \nbecause it is a poison pill, because we know as long as we are in this \nsituation we are never going to get to campaign finance reform.\n  So I hope everyone understands what this is all about. The majority \nleader says there isn't a consensus. I will agree today there are not \n60 votes on the bill, but we are getting closer to a consensus on a lot \nof these other issues.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, given this poison pill, campaign \nfinance reform probably choked a little bit today, but it did not die. \nIt is alive. It is well. And it may choke a little bit more as they try \nto shove it down the throat of the whole campaign finance reform \nconcept, but I will tell you this. Campaign finance reform will not die \nuntil it is passed. It will pass. I do not want to be in a situation to \namend other bills, but that is exactly what we will be forced to do if \nwe are not able to deal with this in a constructive way.\n  So I just hope that Republicans and Democrats can work through these \nobstacles, that we can rid ourselves of the poison pill and debate it \nas an issue as we should but then allow the Senate to work its will on \ncampaign finance reform in a meaningful way. I hope we can do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator from South Dakota yielding. I \nwould like to ask just a couple brief questions.\n  The majority leader has consistently this afternoon indicated there \nhas been a rather full and extensive debate on campaign finance reform. \nIsn't it the case that exactly the opposite is true? The master \nillusionists in America are those who are able to convince people that \nthey have seen things that do not exist.\n  Isn't that what we have here? We have had a debate on campaign \nfinance reform, we are told. Isn't it the case, I ask the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, that the campaign finance reform bill was brought to the \nSenate in a very complicated set of almost Byzantine procedures that \nare called filling the tree so that no one else had an opportunity to \ndo anything to amend this bill, and that under the procedure that \nexisted the bill was debated, but no one, save the majority leader, was \nable to offer one single amendment?\n  Isn't it the case that we had what is called an illusion? I think \nthis is an illusion to convince people to see things that do not exist.\n  I think people will see what happened here, a procedure that ties up \nthe Senate, allows no one to offer any amendments, and then a claim, \ntrying to pull the bill from the floor, that we have had a debate on \ncampaign finance reform. Is that an accurate description of what has \nhappened in recent days?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota is exactly right. That is \nthe description. We have spent a lot of time on it. But ask any Senator \nin this Chamber whether they have had an opportunity to offer an \namendment, to talk about differences that we might have with the \nMcCain-Feingold bill per se. We have all indicated that we are willing \nto support it, but there have also been a lot of indications on the \npart of many Senators that they would like to improve upon it, they \nwould like to change this or that. It is the nature of this body to \nhave a good debate about what is the most appropriate language, what is \nthe most appropriate provision with regard to these questions. We have \nbeen denied that.\n  So while we have had good speeches--I have heard some great speeches, \neven some exchange--we have not had a debate, not a debate in the true \nsense of the word where Democrats and Republicans can walk down to the \nfloor, offer an amendment, have a good vote, go on to the next \namendment, have an exchange. That has not occurred.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might just ask two brief additional questions.\n  Isn't it the case that on the cloture vote on the underlying bill, \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, 53 Members of the Senate voted for cloture, \nwhich suggests that 53 Members of the Senate support this bill? So we \nhave a campaign finance reform bill that has the support of the \nmajority of the Senate and a procedure designed to prevent the Senate \nfrom having a vote on it. Is that not the case that we now face?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct. The majority of the \nSenate has now gone on record in support of the bill as it is pending \nbefore the body, and we have been precluded the opportunity to vote up \nor down on that bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know the Senator has another engagement, but let me ask \none final question. Isn't it the case now that the pending business in \nthis Chamber was campaign finance reform and the majority leader is \nasking by motion to go to D.C. appropriations and that those who decide \nto vote to do that are voting to pull campaign finance reform? If that \nis the case--and I guess it is procedurally--I think we ought to have a \ndebate about that. I think we ought to have a vote on it, we ought to \nfind out who in the Senate decides to vote to pull campaign finance \nreform from the floor of the Senate before we have had the first \namendment offered to that bill.\n  Why haven't we had an amendment offered? Because this bill was tied \nup tight, brought to the floor with the design and a boast by some that \nthey are going to kill it and be proud they killed it, and they are \ngoing to put this in a position where someone else filibusters and gets \nthe blame for killing it.\n  This is clearly an illusion. And isn't it the case that the vote we \nare going\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\nto be asked to take--and I hope it is a record vote; you have already \nasked for the yeas and nays--will be a vote on whether we believe we \nshould pull campaign finance reform from the floor of the Senate? I am \ngoing to vote no, but isn't that in fact the vote we are going to have?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from North Dakota describes it \naccurately. We don't think----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question to the \nSenator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. FORD. Let him answer his question.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to wait.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be glad to complete my answer and yield to the \nmajority leader.\n  The answer is clearly yes. We don't believe that this is time for \nbusiness as usual here, that we simply pull the bill after we debated \nit, as we have now for some 23 hours, if you can call this a debate. \nSimply to pull the bill without any resolution on the issues is a very \ndifficult thing for many of us to accept. So the Senator is absolutely \nright. Our preference would be to stay on this bill. Let's see if we \ncan finish it. We hope we can finish the D.C. appropriations bill, too. \nWe have attempted to do that, but clearly we have to move on with \nsubsequent votes on campaign finance reform.\n  I would be happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will just wait, if the Senator is about through with his \ncomments. I will just go ahead and respond.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nallowing us to have this discussion to go back and forth, but I want to \npoint out to the Senator from North Dakota that the same rationale that \nhe used also applies to the amendment that I had offered, the paycheck \nequity amendment; 52 Senators voted to invoke cloture so that we could \ngo ahead and get a vote on that issue, as a matter of fact. So a \nmajority of the Senate feels very strongly about that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. It seems to me that sometimes maybe even the White House \nknows more about the rules of the Senate than some of us around here.\n  As a matter of fact, when the White House spokesman, Mr. McCurry, was \nasked about how the vote would come in the Senate, he was asked, \n``Well, what if there is a filibuster?''\n  Mr. McCurry said, ``Well, then there would be a filibuster and there \nwould be a cloture vote and then they would move on.''\n  ``But if they don't get 60 votes, that wouldn't be a vote.''\n  ``It would be a vote. That's the way the Senate rules work. What \nelse?''\n  ``Does the vote of 60, is that considered a vote?''\n  ``Mr. McCurry. A vote to limit debate by invoking cloture is \nconsidered a vote under Senate rules, yes, the last time I checked.''\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. McCurry seems to know more about the rules than some of \nus around here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. But the argument again that 53 Senators voted for cloture \non the underlying bill applies the other way, too; 52 Senators voted \nfor cloture on the amendment that was pending.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No one is suggesting, certainly not me, that the Senator \nhas not followed the rules. The Senator has used the rules exactly as \nhe desired to use the rules to bring this bill up, fill the tree, \nprevent it from having amendments, have a cloture vote, and kill the \nbill. This Senator understands that. I have been curious about why the \nmajority leader would not allow a motion to table. We understand that \nthere was not an interest in allowing a motion to table the Lott \namendment to be offered this morning.\n  In fact, the Senator in a rather unusual move last evening put us in \nmorning business all morning. Our expectation was we would be able to \nhave a motion to table. I wonder if the Senator would tell us why that \nwas inappropriate or whether he would allow us the opportunity to offer \na motion to table the Lott amendment at some point.\n  Mr. LOTT. In response to the Senator's question, as a matter of fact, \nI had been indicating all along that we would have full debate on this, \nwe would have cloture votes. If cloture was achieved, then we would \nmove on from there. If it was not, then we would go to other \nlegislative business.\n  As a matter of fact, I had to file the cloture motion last week, I \nguess it was last Friday, so we could have these cloture votes. As a \nmatter of fact, as to morning business, I have lots of Senators who \ncome in and say: We have very important issues we want to talk about. \nCan you set aside an hour or some time, even 2 hours, for morning \nbusiness?\n  Yesterday afternoon I came down to the floor. No Senators were \nwaiting to speak on campaign finance reform. One Senator was waiting to \nspeak on another issue, and so we went into morning business where \nSenators could speak up to 5 minutes on any other subject they wanted.\n  So if I could go on at this point, does the Senator from Utah have a \nquestion he would like to ask?\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to ask the majority leader a question \nregarding the Lott amendment about which we have heard some ex post \nfacto debate here. Is it not true that under the Lott amendment \ncorporate employees who are not members of the union also would be \nrequired to give their permission before their money could be used?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is absolutely true, a little point that seems to be \nignored in many circles around here. As a matter of fact, I don't think \nany worker, whether he or she is a union member or nonunion member, \nshould be compelled to have their dues or fees or assessments or in any \nway have to pay without their permission for politics or for a \npolitical candidate. I think it should be applicable to workers at all \nlevels. And so I purposely included that.\n\n  Some people say, ``Well, you went beyond the Beck decision of the \nSupreme Court.'' Yes, that is one of the key places where I did go \nbeyond the Beck decision. I said this voluntarism should be applicable \nto all employees, all workers. So clearly that is a part of the \namendment as it now stands.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Now, if I could further query the majority leader, on \nthis issue of equality between workers and shareholders and the \nsuggestion that corporations that are involved in giving soft money are \ntaking money involuntarily from the shareholders, is the majority \nleader familiar with the shareholder boycott movements that occurred, \noh, some decade or so ago, people who would sell their shares of stock \nin companies that did business in South Africa, for example?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am familiar with that, and I know of the Senator's \nbackground in business as a corporate executive, and he knows all too \nwell that stockholders, shareholders, have a very strong voice in what \nhappens, and that voice is by buying or not buying more stock or by \nselling what they have and putting it somewhere else. They can choose \nwhere they put their money. What a wonderful American procedure that \nis. But it is one that we value very much.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would say to the majority leader before my next \nquestion, I have been called by brokers who have told me what a \nmarvelous investment a particular company is. And I said, ``But they \nsell cigarettes, and I don't want to put my money in a company that \nsells cigarettes.'' And I was told, ``Yes, but they're mainly in \ncookies and biscuits and other kinds of food.'' And I said, ``No, I am \nmaking a decision as to whom I will support with my investment dollars, \nand the company that's in the tobacco business is not one I want to \nsupport with my money.'' I don't attack people who support it with \ntheir own money, but I make my own investment decisions. I have heard \npeople say the same thing about entertainment companies, saying they \ndon't want their money in the entertainment company that produces a \nparticular movie, and whatever.\n  But this is the next question I would like to address to the majority \nleader. The distinguished minority leader\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\ntalked about campaign finance hitting a bump in the road today but \nsaying it was not dead, that the Senate had hit it but not killed it.\n  Is it not the opinion of the majority leader that the biggest bump \nthat McCain-Feingold has hit is not the vote in the Senate but the vote \nin the Supreme Court? When the Supreme Court took action with respect \nto denying cert to a lower court ruling, did the Supreme Court not in \nfact inflict a much bigger blow on McCain-Feingold than the vote we \ntook today? And if, indeed, we had passed it today, is it not now clear \nthe Supreme Court itself would gut the bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it is obvious that that would be the result. Now, \nthere are those who have been saying, well, you never know how the \ncourts are going to rule until they look at the specific language or \nuntil they have in fact ruled. Right in the middle of the debate on \nMcCain-Feingold, the Supreme Court spoke clearly, once again, and said \nyou cannot limit people's speech. You cannot limit advocacy. You cannot \nlimit groups that want to take a position on an issue. It was really \ninteresting that ruling did come just yesterday of this week.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Would the majority leader not concur, then, that it is a \nbetter use of the Senate's time to be debating appropriations bills at \nthis point in the fiscal year than worrying about legislation that is \nclearly unconstitutional? Don't we have a responsibility, when \nsomething is clearly unconstitutional, to get off of it and move onto \nsomething more productive?\n  Mr. LOTT. It would appear to me to be the case. If the Senator will \nallow me, I would like to ask that the cloture vote scheduled for today \nnow occur at 4 p.m. I would say to the Senate that I have just notified \nthe minority leader of this request, therefore the next vote will be 4 \np.m. today on the motion to invoke cloture with respect to the Mack-\nGramm immigration amendment to the D.C. appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Senator wish me to yield further?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the majority leader for his courtesy. I have no \nfurther questions.\n  Mr. LOTT. As I said here last week, I think protecting citizens \nagainst forced political contributions should be the litmus test for \nthe sincerity of this debate. Anyone unwilling to do that cannot be \ntaken seriously as an advocate for reform. The fact is that the \nadvocates of McCain-Feingold decided that legislating about campaign \nfinance reform was less important than maintaining the system of \ncompulsory campaign contributions by employees. And, so, rather than \nallow their own legislation, the present form of McCain-Feingold, to go \nforward, they brought down the roof of the whole temple on their own \nbill. At least Samson had reason to wreck the place. But I don't think \nthat should be the case here. They are so determined to limit workers' \nability to say where their dues or their fees are going to be used, and \nhow, that they are willing to have the whole issue set aside.\n  So we stand here, now, in the midst of this scuffle, but maybe the \nthings we are finding out this very day about what happened in the 1996 \ncampaign will have some future effect on what we decide to do. \nBelatedly, now, we see these videotapes brought forward, showing White \nHouse coffees. Even more belatedly, we understand, now, that there is \nan audio track of the President's meeting with John Huang on June 18, \n1996. Where have these tapes been? Why haven't we known about this \nbefore?\n  When it comes to campaign finance, the administration gives a whole \nnew meaning to the term ``technical problems.'' Only a few days ago, \nwhile those White House videos were not available--or maybe people \nweren't aware of them--the Attorney General had been moving away from \nan independent counsel, not toward it.\n  So, I once again have serious problems with trying to detect who is \nserious about legitimate campaign reform. What we have here is not a \nlack of restrictive campaign laws. In fact, I think that is a big part \nof the problem. We already have more laws, more restrictions, more \nregulations than the mind can contend with. I think we have been making \nmistakes over a period of years in the writing of campaign laws, where \nnow it takes lawyers and CPA's and FEC experts to try to make sure that \na candidate for office, of either party, is complying with the law. \nWhat we have is a lack of enforcement of the existing laws. So, the \npush has been to say, well, there may have been some problems, maybe \nsome laws were broken, so what we need is new laws. I respectfully \ndisagree with that.\n  We are not going to go forward in a way that is unconstitutional. We \nare not going to go forward in a way that does not deal with this \nproblem of the taking of dues from workers and using them for political \npurposes.\n\n  I just came across an interesting quote attributed to former White \nHouse Deputy Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes. This is actually a quote \nfrom Michael Louis, in the New York Times magazine. He says that the \nDeputy Chief of Staff will tell you, point blank, that President \nClinton does not care about campaign finance reform, that he is using \nthe issue for his own purposes, none of them altruistic. I think that \nsums up what is going on here and I think the American people should \nnot allow themselves to be fooled by the debate that we have been \nhearing over the last week.\n  I yield further to the Senator from Kentucky for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I wanted to ask the distinguished majority leader \nif he was aware that there had been some survey data actually taken of \nemployees, union employees, assessing their attitude about their dues \nbeing taken, in effect, and spent on causes with which they disagree?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am aware that there have been some survey data. I am \ntrying to remember what the numbers were. I believe--perhaps you will \nhave them--in one instance it was 62 percent; in another it was 78 \npercent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the 78 percent figure the majority leader \nrefers to is the one that I saw; 78 percent of workers would like to \nhave an opportunity, up front in advance, to make the decision on \nwhether or not they contribute, in effect, to a political cause; \nfundamental American right. That is what the leader's amendment would \nhave provided, not just for union members but employees of corporations \nwho are not union members, and of course any shareholders who are \naggrieved have the option to sell the shares, if they object to any \npolitical donation of a corporation. So I commend the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to make another point. Perhaps the Senator \nmight want to respond with a question on that, or comment.\n  I didn't just dismiss the McCain-Feingold bill out of hand. I sat \ndown with the Senator from Arizona and we went over what was in his \nbill. One of the problems with it is how he deals with this paycheck \nequity issue. His bill, as I understand it--maybe you can correct me--\nsays, in effect, that after an election is over, if a member decides \nthat he or she would like to get their dues back because the money was \nused in some way he or she didn't agree with, then they could get it \nback.\n  Great. You have already had an election. Somebody has already been \nbombed with millions of dollars of money that is used against union \nmembers' permission, and then they can say, after the fact: If you are \nmad, you can get your money back. I don't understand the rationale for \nthat thinking.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The majority leader is absolutely correct. That \nprovision would have only given an employee who decided he didn't like \nit an opportunity to write in and get his money back after it was \nover--wholly inadequate, I would say to the leader, wholly inadequate.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The real decision is, do you--are you asked in advance \nwhether or not you want to contribute your hard-earned money to a group \nthat may go out and spend it on causes with which you disagree?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I don't mind listening to this debate but \nthe floor is in the possession of the majority leader and he yielded \nfor a question, not a statement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in case the Senator from Kentucky or the \nother Senator from Kentucky or any other Senator would like to speak--\nwe will have a vote at 4 o'clock, but in order\n\n[[Page S10473]]\n\nfor them to make some comments if they would like, I yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for his leadership on this very important issue. In the \njudgment of this Senator, there is nothing more important than \nprotecting the first amendment and giving American citizens an \nopportunity to participate in the political process.\n\n  I would say that is not just my view. That is the view of the United \nStates Supreme Court. It is the view of the American Civil Liberties \nUnion. The Court has said you have a constitutional right to support, \nto contribute to the candidate of your choice. So we are talking about \nfundamental first amendment rights in this debate.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues who have \nspoken during the course of this debate. The number of speakers has \nbeen roughly equal on both sides. Every one of the Senators who spoke \non my side of this issue spoke in defense of the first amendment.\n  I also extend my gratitude and my appreciation to Tamara Somerville, \nmy long-time assistant in this struggle to protect the first amendment. \nNobody has ever worked harder, produced more brilliant subject matter, \nand done it with greater humor than she. So, my thanks to Tam, not only \nfor her good work for me but also on behalf of the country, in defense \nof the first amendment.\n  I also want to thank her assistant, Lani Gerst, who did a remarkable \njob as well, for all of her help.\n  Mr. President, it has indeed been a wonderful debate. We will in all \nlikelihood have it off and on again. It seems that is the history of \nthis issue. It has been around a few times over the last 10 years, but \nI think the opposition to ruining the first amendment continues to \ngrow. Today's cloture vote against cloture was the highest in 10 years.\n  So, I end today on an optimistic note, that the first amendment will, \nindeed, survive for another year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I hear a lot of interesting talk. It amuses \nme some but it also bothers me. In the hearing in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee today--we heard the majority leader talking about \ntapes. They don't want to impugn the integrity of the President, but \nthey kind of scorn the tapes suddenly showing up. After everyone made a \nstatement all morning --never got to witness, talked about tapes all \nmorning--they tried to get to Mr. Ruff, I believe his name is, who is \nthe counsel for the White House, who came down to the meeting, came in \nthe audience, and the ranking member tried to get him before the \ncommittee to answer their questions. And he was gaveled down and the \ncommittee recessed.\n  Something about this does not ring true. If you can come out here and \njust bash somebody and bash them, and they have no opportunity to \ndefend themselves, and then you recess the meeting--something like that \nis what is happening here on the Senate floor. We see a campaign \nfinance reform bill that comes up and we do what we refer to as filling \nthe tree, and that means no one else can put up an amendment, and they \nsay we have an opportunity to debate the bill? That is like the man \ntrying to answer in the Governmental Affairs Committee about the tapes \nthat were released, and they wouldn't let him talk.\n  So, we are trying to get to a campaign finance bill here today and \nyou can't talk. Oh, you can talk, but you can't vote. And they talk \nabout this amendment of the majority leader's, that is so great--why is \nit that they will not accept a more comprehensive bill in the same \nlight that covers everybody? No, they want their own bill, because it \nis harder on labor than it is on business. It is harder on labor than \nit is on associations. So, that is the reason that amendment has been \ncloistered and we cannot get to it.\n  I understand we have a couple of more minutes. This is a little bit \nlike they talk about the laws, that everything is fine. It is like \nbeing opposed to the IRS. Oh, we have had all these hearings about IRS, \nwe are going to get rid of IRS, we are going to do all that--but the \nRepublicans are in the majority. They are the ones who are bashing IRS. \nBut they passed a bill, a tax bill, of almost 900 pages--900 pages, and \nthey are trying to say we want to get rid of the IRS. Sure they are \ngoing to get rid of the IRS. They are going to overload them. When IRS \nis overloaded the constituents are overloaded.\n  Come on, now, give us a break. If you are against the IRS, don't pass \n900 pages of new tax law. And, when a man wants to come to answer the \nquestions that they are asking, let him talk, let him answer the \nquestions. If you have an amendment that is comprehensive, that applies \nto all PAC's, all organizations, why not talk about it, why not let us \nvote on it? We are being gagged. We are being gagged by the majority. \nThey don't want us to vote. They have the ability to do that. That is \nthe rules of the Senate. I am in the minority. But we are going to \nprotect the rights of the minority. We will protect the rights of the \nminority and that is the reason we are a great country, we listen to \nthe minority's voice. We have a right and we exercise that right. We \nrepresent a State and we have that right, representing that State. We \nare U.S. Senators and we have that right.\n  So, therefore, that right is going to be exercised if I have anything \nto do with it and can stand on my feet.\n  I yield the floor at 4 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10467-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10473-S10474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

A bill to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to limit the conduct of securities \nclass actions under State law, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        THE SECURITIES LITIGATION UNIFORM STANDARDS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Dodd, Senator Domenici, Senator Boxer, Senator \nFaircloth, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hagel, Senator Reid, Senator \nWyden, Senator Allard, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Lieberman.\n\n  Mr. President, on December 22, 1995, the Senate took an extraordinary \naction in overriding President Clinton's veto of the Private Security \nLitigation Reform Act, Public Law 104-67. This major reform legislation \nwas an effort to try to do something about frivolous lawsuits that were \nfiled on a class-action basis against basically new, innovative \ncompanies.\n  These abusive lawsuits were literally a multibillion dollar tax \nimposed on new and innovative companies. They were invariably filed on \na class-action basis, where there was no real client. The cost of \ndefense against such litigation was so high that normally the cases \nended in large settlements out of court.\n  We passed a comprehensive bill to try to deal with that problem in \nFederal court. That bill made a combination of five major changes in \nthe law. It said, first, that there had to be real clients; that if a \nlawyer was going to file a class-action suit, he had to be filing it on \nbehalf of real shareholders, encouraged by a set of procedures where \nthe largest shareholder in the class-action suit was in fact in charge \nof that suit.\n  Second, the legislation required that there be specificity with \nregard to what the company was alleged to have done wrong.\n  Third, it required a discovery process designed to get the facts out \non the table, rather than a discovery process that was a tool for \nharassing defendants into settling the case.\n  Fourth, the legislation set up a system of proportional liability so \nthat you could not simply sue in order to reach where the deep pockets \nwere; you had to go after the real perpetrators of fraud.\n  Finally, it contained an attorney misconduct provision, which said \nthat if the judge made a judgment--we require an initial judgment by \nlaw--that this was an abusive lawsuit, then the parties who had engaged \nin this abusive conduct would be forced to pay for the legal expenses \nof the company that was defending itself.\n  So strong was the support for this bill that we were able not only to \npass it on a bipartisan basis, but we overrode the President's veto of \nthe bill.\n  We held a hearing on July 24 of this year in the Securities \nSubcommittee, which I chair, to gauge whether or not the law was \nachieving its purposes. What we discovered from the nine witnesses, a \nbroad cross-section of people--State regulators, companies that were \nsubject to these suits, a former SEC Commissioner--was that while we \nhad dealt with the problem in Federal court, we now were seeing a \nmigration of these lawsuits to State courts with a real effort and \napparently a successful effort to circumvent what we had done.\n  So, Mr. President, I have introduced this bill, with Senator Dodd as \nmy principal cosponsor--he is the ranking Democrat on the \nsubcommittee--and with a broad cross-section of Republicans and \nDemocrats to try to correct this problem. What our bill does is very \nsimply this. It sets national standards for stocks that are traded on \nthe national markets. What it says is that in the case of class-action \nsuits, and class-action suits only, if a stock is traded on the \nnational market, if it is a national stock, then the class-action suit \nhas to be filed in Federal court. This does not apply to individual \nlawsuits. It applies only to class-action lawsuits, and it applies only \nto stocks that are traded nationally.\n  Legislatively, we have been moving toward national standards for \nnational securities. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act, \nenacted overwhelmingly last year, created national rules for many \naspects of our national securities markets. This is an important step \ncontinuing in that direction, a step in line with the principles lying \nbehind the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to notify \nmy colleagues that, even though we have a relatively short amount of \ntime left in this session of Congress, the Securities Subcommittee will \nmove quickly on this legislation, beginning with legislative hearings \nbefore we adjourn for the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1260\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased this afternoon to rise \nalong with my colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, who spoke a few \nmoments ago, on a bill that the two of us are introducing together. I \nregret that I wasn't on the floor at the time he made his remarks. But \nI appreciate very much his leadership on this issue.\n  We are introducing a bill called the Securities Litigation Uniform \nStandards Act of 1997.\n  Just about 2 years ago, I stood here as part of a successful effort \nto restore the integrity and fairness of our private securities \nlitigation system.\n  It's probably appropriate at this juncture to remind ourselves just \nhow important the private litigation system has been in maintaining the \nintegrity of our capital markets.\n  It is highly questionable whether our markets would be as deep, as \nliquid, as strong, as transparent, were it not for our system of \nmaintaining private rights of action against those who commit fraud.\n  It is precisely because of the importance of this system, that the \ndepths to which it had sunk by 1995 was so very troubling.\n  The system was no longer a mechanism for aggrieved investors to seek \njustice and restitution, but was instead a means for enterprising \nattorneys to manipulate its procedures for their own considerable \nprofit and to the detriment of legitimate companies and investors \nacross the Nation.\n  I could easily spend all of my time today recounting the cases of \nabusive and frivolous litigation that were hindering our growth \nindustries; suffice to say that the flaws in the litigation system not \nonly threatened the viability of private rights of action, but also \npresented a serious threat to the growth and success of key industries \nacross the Nation.\n  Now that we are 2 years out from enactment of the reform bill, it is \neasy to see that many of the reforms are working well and that \naggrieved investors still have access to the courthouse.\n  However, there is one development since the enactment of the reform \nlaw that has the potential to undermine our good work and send us back \nto the days of litigation frenzy.\n  This development is the significant increase in securities fraud \nclass actions filed in State court.\n  Prior to congressional enactment of the reform law in 1995, \nsecurities fraud class actions in State court were almost unheard of. \nPeople went to the Federal courts.\n  But since we reformed the Federal system, there has been substantial \nincreases in State court filings both in 1996 and 1997.\n  It is not unreasonable to assume that it is the weaker, even abusive \nclaims, that are now finding a home in State court that they no longer \nhave in Federal court.\n  The development of differing standards in State courts is troubling \nnot only to this Senator, but also to the President. In a letter the \nPresident sent to me on this subject in July, he stated:\n\n       The possibility of change in one or more States' securities \n     laws similar to those proposed [last year] in California's \n     Proposition 211 suggests that there may be a need to \n     reconsider the appropriate balance of Federal and State roles \n     in securities law. As I said when I opposed Proposition 211 \n     last August, the proliferation of multiple and inconsistent \n     standards could undermine national law.\n\n  In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted a survey \nfor the President, on the effect of the reform act; one of the survey's \nconclusions was:\n\n       To the extent that State courts can be used to avoid the \n     discovery stay in cases that would otherwise have been \n     brought in Federal court, one of the goals of the reform act \n     may be frustrated.\n\n  This migration of frivolous class actions to State court threatens \nthe effectiveness of the reform act.\n  Not only is it reasonable to assume that more and more companies \ncould become hostage to increased State litigation costs, but the \nprospect of State litigation, where there is no safe harbor for \nforward-looking statements, is right now having a chilling effect upon \ncorporate disclosure of projections and other forward-looking \ninformation.\n  Let me just as an aside state how important it is for prospective \ninvestors to get as much disclosure from companies as they possibly can \nso that they can make intelligent decisions about whether to invest \ntheir hard-earned dollars in these companies. Mr. President, this is a \nquestion of getting as much information, as I said, from companies. \nWhat we had in the Federal law was, of course, a safe harbor to allow \nfor statements to be made that could then not be used against the \ncorporation in some frivolous lawsuit.\n  Now, reasonable people, of course, may disagree with the magnitude of \nthe State litigation problem as it exists today. I would be first to \nadmit that as well. I do not want to suggest to my colleagues that we \nhave some overwhelming problem on our hands.\n  But whether you believe that it is a small, medium, or even large \nproblem today, as some do, it is a less important question, in my view, \nthan whether you believe it is a problem that is destined to get worse. \nI think on that everyone can agree.\n  Again, I think the Securities and Exchange Commission survey is \ninstructive on this point. I quote from the report.\n\n       . . . if State law provides advantages to plaintiffs in \n     particular case, it is reasonable to expect that plaintiffs' \n     counsel will file suit in State court.\n\n  The plain English translation: any plaintiffs' attorney worth his \nsalt is going to file in State court if he feels it will give him an \nadvantage.\n  SEC Commissioner Steve Wallman succinctly outlined the harm that the \nproliferation of State class actions is having on securities system \nwhen he said that ``this phenomenon is clearly balkanizing the Federal \nsecurities laws.''\n  In testimony submitted to the Securities Subcommittee in July, \nCommissioner Wallman also pointed out that the debate over establishing \na national standard for litigation on national securities is one that \nshould take place,\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\neven if there was no burgeoning problem on the State level:\n\n       The issue of pre-emption is broader than the potential \n     effectiveness of the reform act, even though the reform act's \n     effectiveness may be the current catalyst for raising the \n     matter.\n       Rather than permit or foster fragmentation of our national \n     system of securities litigation, we should give due \n     consideration to the benefits flowing to investors from a \n     uniform national approach. That analysis can be pursued, and \n     conclusions reached, regardless of whether one believes we \n     now know--or will, within any reasonable time frame, know--\n     the definitive impact of the reform act.\n\n  The idea of creating a national standard for nationally traded \nsecurities is consistent with the recent trend in Congress, the SEC, \nand in the States themselves, to redefine the relationship between the \nStates and the Federal Government on securities issues.\n  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, in discussing securities regulation, \nprovided a perspective that should guide our debate over securities \nlitigation:\n\n       The current system of dual Federal-State regulation is not \n     the system that Congress--or the Commission--would create \n     today if we were designing a new system. While securities \n     markets today are global, issuers and securities firms must \n     still [comply with] 52 separate jurisdictions. . . . It \n     appears that an appropriate balance can be attained in the \n     Federal-State arena that better allocates responsibilities, \n     reduces compliance costs and facilitates capital formation, \n     while continuing to provide for the protection of investors.\n\n  The point is if we are beginning de novo you wouldn't set up this \nsituation. Obviously, we are not going to scrap it all. But we ought to \ntry to reform it in a way that reflects the way we are today.\n  The principle of national treatment for national securities trading \non national exchanges is as solid for legislation on securities \nlitigation as it was for securities regulation.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today, if enacted, will allow \nCongress to address this State litigation problem before it gets \ncompletely out of control.\n  It will do so in a very targeted and narrow way, essentially \npreempting only those class actions that have recently migrated to \nState court, while leaving traditional State court actions and \nprocedures solidly in place.\n  First, the legislation applies only to class actions, which are \ndefined as those actions in which damages are sought on behalf of more \nthan 25 people, one or more parties seek damages on behalf of other \nunnamed parties, or one or more of the parties did not personally \nauthorize the suit.\n  Actions involving less than 25 people would not be affected.\n  Second the legislation is limited only to those securities that are \nlisted on one of the three national stock exchanges--the New York, \nAmerican, and NASDAQ stock market. Our legislation uses the definition \nof ``covered security'' that was used to preempt State regulation in \nlast year's National Securities Markets Improvement Act.\n  The legislation does not affect any State enforcement action, whether \ncivil or criminal. State regulators retain their full authority to \nbring enforcement actions in any venue allowed under State law.\n  In fact, the California Securities Regulator testified very strongly \nin support of establishing uniform national litigation standards for \nnationally traded securities.\n  Let me again emphasize what this bill does not do: it does not affect \nindividual actions in State court; it does not protect penny stocks, \ndelisted securities, roll-ups, or securities sold only within a single \nState; it does not protect bad brokers or investment advisors; it does \nnot impact on State regulators.\n  This legislation has been carefully crafted only to affect those \ntypes of class actions that are appropriately heard on the Federal \nlevel.\n  To the extent that there are technical modifications needed to ensure \nthat no other State actions are impacted, I certainly pledge that we \nwill make those changes to keep the bill focused only on the problem \narea.\n  Mr. President, our capital markets are the envy of the world and \nAmerica is the undisputed leader in the financial services industry.\n  But if we are to remain the global leader, if our markets are to \nremain ahead of those in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo or Hong Kong, we must \ncreate uniformity and certainty.\n  How can we expect to get foreign companies to list on our exchanges \nif we have to explain that they will face not only our very tough \nFederal standards on securities fraud, but also the possibility of 50 \nconstantly changing State standards.\n  That's not a reasonable proposition for a foreign company, or even \nfor an American one.\n  This legislation will create certainty and establish uniformity \nwithout impinging on the traditional and important role that States \nplay in combating fraud.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and I look forward to \nreturning to the floor soon to see this bill pass the Senate.\n  Senator Gramm of Texas and I feel that this is a solid piece of \nlegislation. Again, the problem is not totally out of hand yet. The \ntrend lines are clear. We are not infringing upon State courts or State \nregulators and State traded securities but only nationally traded \nsecurities on the three national markets.\n  So we end up with a national standard which is what we intended when \nwe passed the Reform Act of 2 years ago.\n  With that, Mr. President, I again thank my colleagues for their \npatience. I urge them to take a good look at the piece of legislation \nwhich Senator Gramm of Texas and I have introduced, and urge them to \ncosponsor the bill and join us in passing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 1261. A bill to establish the Education Scholars Block Grant \nProgram; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                       the teacher investment act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to hold \nforums on education across my home State of Tennessee. I traveled to \nNashville, Memphis, and Knoxville to listen to a variety of people with \nexpertise in educational issues, such as teachers, students, \nprincipals, and school board members. These events were a wonderful \nopportunity for me to listen. While a variety of educational issues \nwere explored at each of the forums, the need for an ample, qualified \nteaching force was a predominant theme at each forum.\n  I would like to note that Tennessee's 1997 Teacher of the Year, Ms. \nCathy Pihl, was both present at the Memphis forum on education and is \nhere with us today. I am also pleased that Mr. Jon Hubble, Tennessee's \n1997 Teacher of the Year finalist, is also here. Cathy is a fourth \ngrade teacher at Kate Bond Elementary School in Memphis, TN, with 8 \nyears of teaching experience. Jon, who has 10 years of teaching \nexperience, teaches social studies to seventh and eighth grade students \nat Wright Middle School in Nashville, TN. I am delighted to have both \nof these outstanding teachers here with us today. We must encourage and \nenable more students to follow in Cathy and Jon's footsteps.\n  In addition to what I heard in Tennessee about the need for qualified \nteachers, recent statistics highlight the need for a strong teaching \nforce across the Nation. Elementary and secondary school enrollments \nare expected to reach an all-time high this fall--52.2 million \nstudents. Approximately 2 million more teachers will be needed for the \nnext decade.\n  The Teacher Investment Act, which I am introducing today, would allow \nState education agencies to award scholarships to students who are \nstudying to become elementary and secondary school teachers. These \nscholarships would not need to be repaid provided the students meet \ncertain criteria.\n  Specifically, scholarships may go to both undergraduate and graduate \nstudents who are committed to becoming teachers. In addition, the \nindividual must have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement in \ncollege and must commit to teaching for 2 years in an elementary or \nsecondary school.\n  Quite simply, we need more Cathy's and Jon's. One way to achieve this \ngoal is to invest resources to prepare a new generation of teachers. In \nreturn, the scholarship recipients must invest at least 2 years in the \nteaching field. The Teacher Investment Act makes a serious commitment \nto both our future teachers and students. However, as we discuss our \nfuture teachers, I, again, would like to highlight the important \nachievements and contributions of two\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\nof today's teachers--Jon Hubble and Cathy Pihl, who represent \nTennessee's teachers so well.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today to \nauthorize the Department of Transportation to convey the Coast Guard \nstation,\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\nOcracoke, NC, to the State of North Carolina, when the Coast Guard \ndetermines that it no longer needs to keep the facility.\n  This station is located on the southern end of Ocracoke Island, \nadjacent to the wharf where the ferries to and from Swan Quarter and \nCedar Island dock. It is vital that these limited ferry facilities are \nexpanded to meet the ever-growing demands of more and more traffic, and \nthis Coast Guard station is ideal for this purpose. Since the port at \nOcracoke is the southern termination of State highway 12 on the Outer \nBanks, these ferries are the only way to get residents and tourists \nacross Pamlico Sound in the event of the need to evacuate when \nhurricanes threaten. The only other way off this stretch of the Outer \nBanks is the bridge at Roanoke Island, which is more than 75 miles to \nthe north of Ocracoke.\n  The State also plans to use this surplus Coast Guard facility for \neducational purposes. While the ferry division has a need for the \ngrounds and a portion of the station buildings, the remaining spaces \ncan be used for coastal environmental study. Of course the Coast Guard \nwill continue to have access to the docking facilities to any extent \nneeded.\n  Mr. President, with the safety of the residents and of all our guests \nthat visit the Outer Banks uppermost in my mind, I urge timely \nconsideration and passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The cost of the survey shall be borne by the \n     State.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions with respect to \n     the conveyance under subsection (a), and any easements or \n     rights of way granted under subsection (b)(1), as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests of \n     the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1263. A bill to establish requirements regarding national tests in \nreading and mathematics; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               THE VOLUNTARY NATIONAL TESTING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, today as the House-Senate conferees \nare scheduled to meet again, I am introducing the Voluntary National \nTesting Act of 1997 for two main reasons: to clarify many of the \nmisconceptions that have arisen since the Senate voted in favor of this \napproach, and-- to counter the mistaken impression that support for \nvoluntary national testing has eroded in recent weeks.\n  This legislation simply makes permanent the compromise approach that \nwas approved overwhelmingly by the Senate last month.\n  While the Senate amendment gave NAGB, the governing board, authority \nfor only fiscal year 1998, this legislation would provide permanent \nauthority.\n  Otherwise, the language is identical to that amendment: it prevents \nanyone from being forced to take the test or attach any funding \nconditions on the test; transfers control immediately to the \nindependent board, which will have full power to change any elements it \ndeems necessary; and charges the board with revisiting key issues that \nhave arisen so far, such as whether students should use calculators or \nwhether there should be a test in a student's native language if \nneeded.\n  Contrary to what some may think, there are many signs that support \nfor voluntary national tests remains strong despite scare tactics and \n``education-ese'' being used by its opponents.\n  Public opinion--as well as the views of almost every mainstream \neducation and business organization in the country--remains strongly in \nfavor of making rigorous, standard measures of student achievement \navailable.\n  The most recent polls show that two-thirds of the public favor the \nPresident's proposal--even more are in favor of the general approach \nthat is in this bill.\n  Though two districts have decided not to administer the reading exam, \nall 15 original districts are still planning to administer at least the \nmath test and all 7 States that have signed up remain on board for both \nexams.\n  Contrary to what is being said, I do not think there has been any \nmajor controversy about the NAEP tests we are planning to use as models \nfor the new ones--after all, pretty much everyone can agree on what we \nexpect our children to know about reading and math at fourth and eighth \ngrade.\n  There is not much that's controversial about reading a paragraph from \nCharlotte's Web, or figuring out a word problem in math.\n  The benefits of a voluntary national test are clear to the parents \nand teachers who are most determined to see better schools for their \nchildren.\n  Let us allow State and local communities to decide for themselves, \nrather than making the decision for them here in Washington.\n  Right now, many States currently offer tests and some are quite \ngood--but they have no common standard and many mislead parents into \nthinking their children are doing better than they actually are.\n  Under the new approach, many students would struggle and even fail at \nfirst, it's true. But, through the combined efforts of their teachers, \nparents, and community leaders, far more than anyone expected \nbeforehand would eventually succeed--it's happening in Milwaukee and \nPhiladelphia already.\n  The voluntary national tests are about setting high expectations for \nall children, measuring progress in a way that's widely accepted, and \ndemanding accountability for improvements that we all know are needed. \nThey are not about treating minorities unfairly or usurping local and \nparental control over what is taught in school, which I would never \nsupport.\n  With a common measure of progress it becomes increasingly possible to \nwin additional financial support so desperately needed--it is a \nnecessary step. Voluntary national tests would provide parents new \ninsight so they could push hard for improvements in our public schools \nthat might otherwise not occur.\n  Support in the Senate remains solidly in favor of the compromise \napproach to developing a voluntary national test.\n  Faced with a choice between banning the tests and transferring \ncontrol to an independent board, 87 Senators less than a month ago \nvoted in favor of developing the tests under the governing board.\n  I recently worked with 43 Senators to sign a very strong letter \npledging to filibuster the conference report if it banned development \nof the tests before States or districts could decide. This support \noverwhelms the opposition of a\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\nsmall part of the Senate, led by Senator Ashcroft.\n  If necessary, this is more than enough to block consideration of the \nconference report or support a Presidential veto--regardless of how the \nHouse votes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 1264. A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \nPoultry Products Inspection Act to provide for improved public health \nand food safety through enhanced enforcement; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n          the food safety enforcement enhancement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I along with Senators Leahy, \nDaschle, and Johnson will introduce legislation to enhance the \nenforcement of our Nation's meat and poultry inspection laws and \npreserve consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat. \nEarlier this year, Americans were stunned by the recall of 25 million \npounds of hamburger. They were further amazed when they learned that \nthe Secretary of Agriculture does not have the authority to demand a \nrecall of adulterated product. He does not even have the authority to \nimpose civil fine on a company which knowingly or repeatedly violates \nfood safety laws.\n  Given the recent number of E. coli outbreaks across the country, \nAmericans are demanding that we do more to prevent food-borne \ncontamination and to stop it in its tracks once an outbreak has been \nidentified. Farmers and ranchers expect us to do more to protect \nconsumer confidence in the products from which they make their hard-\nearned living.\n  This legislation I am introducing, which has been developed in \ncooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will give the USDA \nimportant new tools to enforce our food safety laws. The legislation \nwould require processors and handlers to notify the USDA of the \nexistence of adulterated meat and poultry products, allow the Secretary \nto recall adulterated products, and give him the ability to levy civil \npenalties.\n  Currently USDA is limited to the atomic bomb of food safety tools. \nThe Secretary can request a recall of product which is suspected to be \ntainted, withdraw inspection from a processing plant, and issue press \nreleases alerting consumers. In the case of Hudson, a company went out \nof business, several people were hospitalized and consumer confidence \nin beef products was shaken. Clearly we need other tools for the USDA \nto address food safety concerns short of such extreme measures.\n  The Secretary already has civil penalty authority under 11 other \nstatutes. He can issue civil penalties for the abuse of a circus \nelephant, but not for the shipment of adulterated meat. In addition, 68 \npercent of States with State meat inspection systems have civil penalty \nauthority. The number of states with mandatory E. coli 0157:H7 \nreporting requirements has more than doubled since 1992.\n  To be sure, we cannot guarantee that the new enforcement powers in \nthis legislation would have prevented the Hudson recall from occurring \nor that they will prevent future outbreaks. But mandatory reporting of \nadulterated meat and mandatory recall authority just makes good sense. \nWith these powers, the USDA will be able to respond more quickly to \nensure public safety and consumer confidence.\n  I view this bill, however, as only the beginning of a process to \nidentify needs in the meat and poultry food chain that can lead to \nenhanced public safety. All sectors of the food system, from the \nproducer to the consumer need to take responsibility for improved \nsafety. Real food safety cannot be achieved by any one method. We need \nmultiple defenses, using each to their maximum potential. To lower the \nincidence of food-borne illness we must take a number of steps: \nAdditional research into the way that food-borne pathogens infect \nanimals, remain in the meat products and cause illness in humans; \nincreased research into treatments of food-borne illnesses; improved \nidentification and regulation of hazard points in the production and \nprocessing processes; electronic pasteurization as a means of actually \nreducing pathogens in meat and poultry products; and consumer education \non the proper handling and preparation of meat to reduce the risk of \nillness.\n  We are currently making progress toward improving food safety. The \nnew Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points [HACCP] meat inspection \nsystem will begin to go into effect in 1998. This new science-based \ninspection system will specifically target E. coli and salmonella in \nthe meat processing system and is designed to prevent, not just \nidentify contamination. We need to get this system in place and \ninspectors trained as fast and thoroughly as possible.\n  Clearly we need to do more. The events of the past few months \nunderscore that need. We cannot sit around and wait until the next \nfatal food-safety scare. We have to act proactively and decisively. All \nsectors of agricultural economy have a stake in ensuring food safety, \nfrom the producer to the consumer. I will work closely with consumer \nadvocates, producers and industry to develop a comprehensive package of \nlegislation that will raise the standard of food safety in this \ncountry. I believe this bill is a good starting point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Harkin \nand others to introduce legislation that would strengthen the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's ability to protect the public from \ncontaminated meat and poultry products. The United States has the \nsafest food in the world, and this USDA-supported food safety \ninitiative, the Food Safety Enforcement Enhancement Act of 1997, would \ntake important steps to ensure it stays that way.\n  I have considered food safety policy to be of great significance for \nmany years. As chair of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Agriculture \nResearch, Conservation, Forestry and General Legislation in 1993 and \n1994, I held a number of hearings on meat and poultry inspection, \nincluding a 1993 hearing to consider the E. coli crisis in the Pacific \nNorthwest. Subsequent to a series of congressional hearings related to \nthat incident, Senator Leahy and I introduced a bill requiring USDA to \nreplace its old meat inspection process with a modern system called the \nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System [HACCP].\n  HACCP is a major improvement over the old system because it uses \nscientific understanding of harmful bacteria to prevent contamination \nfrom occurring in the first place. Inspectors observe operations at \ncritical control points and test for pathogens in samples \nscientifically collected at meat and poultry processing plants.\n  Because USDA needs the tools to respond swiftly and appropriately to \nviolations, our legislation also would have allowed USDA to fine meat \npacking plants and processors for safety violations, and order \nmandatory recalls of contaminated meat and poultry products.\n  Congress did not pass that bill, but USDA was able to implement many \nof the bill's provisions through administrative means, including the \nnew HACCP system of meat and poultry inspection. USDA did not have the \nauthority, however, to implement provisions of the bill that would have \nstrengthened the agency's regulatory authority. Today USDA lacks the \nregulatory tools that were intended to complement the new inspection \nsystem.\n  The Food Safety Enforcement Enhancement Act of 1997 would amend the \nFederal Meat Inspection Act [FMIA] and the Poultry Products Inspection \nAct [PPIA] by adding three new enforcement sections: First, to provide \nfor mandatory recall of meat and poultry products; second, to provide \nmore explicit authority to refuse or withdraw inspection; and third, to \nprovide the power to assess civil monetary penalties. This bill would \nfurther\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\nensure that the meat in grocery stores and restaurants is free of E. \ncoli, salmonella, and other harmful bacteria.\n  Civil fines and mandatory recall authority are important \nimprovements, and both are employed by other Federal agencies. Civil \nfines deter undesirable practices, can be imposed more quickly than \ncriminal penalties or inspection withdrawal, and can be tailored to \nspecific cases. The Food Safety Enforcement Enhancement Act of 1997 is \ncareful to combine ample due process protection with the potential for \nfines. A hearing before an independent administrative law judge is one \nof the first steps in the process, and an appeals mechanism is also \npart of the process.\n  Mandatory recall is an important improvement to a system that \ncurrently relies on voluntary recalls by industry. Although the \nindustry historically has cooperated by voluntarily recalling products \nwhen food safety has been in question, USDA needs to be able to swiftly \nrecall meat or poultry in the event voluntarism one day fails.\n  Science allows us to know more today about food safety than ever \nbefore in history and to have higher standards than ever before. It is \nimperative that we use this science to identify and implement the most \neffective, efficient production practices. The Food Safety Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 1997 surely would enable USDA to take great strides \nin using HACCP to this end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1265. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to expand the provisions to include construction safety \nrequirements; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n the construction safety, health, and education improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am again introducing the \nConstruction Safety, Health, and Education Improvement Act of 1997. In \n1970, the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act signified a \npledge to American workers that workplaces would be safe and healthy. \nSadly, 27 years later, we still have a long way to go to fulfill that \npromise.\n  Nationally, more than 6,200 people died from work-related injuries in \n1995, as average of 17 people each day. More than 1,000 of those deaths \nwere in the construction industry. In Connecticut, construction deaths \nremain a significant fact of life for men and women who work in this \nfield. But these are not simply statistics. These deaths represent \nfamilies and friends losing loved ones.\n  Construction tends to involve some of the most hazardous work done by \nworkers including roofing, excavation, and trenching. The industry \nfaces many challenges in providing a safe work environment. Often, the \nworksite changes from week to week, or day to day, and workers and \nsubcontractors come and go as a given project moves forward.\n  I will never forget the tragedy that occurred at a construction site \nin my home State more 10 years ago. Twenty-eight people lost their \nlives during the construction of an apartment building called \nL'Ambiance Plaza in Bridgeport, CT, when the floors of the building \ncollapsed. Ten years have not healed the wounds from that tragedy. I \nattended a memorial service earlier this year, and saw many of the same \npeople I saw 10 years ago when this tragedy occurred. They were older, \nbut still carry grief over the loss of a spouse, parent, or friend.\n  Construction disasters are sadly not isolated to a given State or \nregion. In just the last few months, construction workers in Orlando, \nChicago, Indianapolis, Brooklyn, Huntington Beach, and Washington, DC, \nto name just a few, lost their lives in work related accidents.\n  The bill I am offering today is straightforward and offers \ncommonsense solutions. I introduced similar legislation in each of the \npast five Congresses. An office of construction, safety, health and \neducation would be established within OSHA tasked to identify \nconstruction employees with a high incidence of injury and \nnoncompliance. The office would establish training in construction \nsafety for inspectors, establish model compliance programs and a toll-\nfree number for reporting safety concerns. The bill would require the \ndevelopment and implementation of a written safety and health plan for \neach construction project, including an analysis of hazardous \nactivities involved in the project and assurances that all employees \nare notified of these conditions.\n  Whether 1 person dies or 25 die, any life lost is one too many. We \nshould not suffer another workplace tragedy before we put in place \nmeasures to safeguard construction sites. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in sponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

On October 17, 1997 \nuntil October 20, 1997, the greater metropolitan Detroit Armenian \ncommunity and Michigan, welcomes His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the \nGreat House of Cilicia.\n  His Holiness has served as the spiritual leader of the Holy See of \nCilicia of the Armenian Apostolic Church since 1995 and his visit to \nMichigan and the Armenian community is truly a blessing. Prior to his \nconsecration as Catholicos he has served as the prelate of the Armenian \ncommunity in Lebanon for 15 years. His Holiness is to be commended for \nhis spiritual leadership not only in the Armenian Apostolic Church but \nalso in regions of the world which face persistent unrest and violence. \nThrough his ministry, published articles and lectures, His Holiness \ncontinues to impact lives and provide steadfast love.\n  The Armenian community has faced many hardships throughout its \nhistory, yet the spirit of the Armenian people and its leaders has \nnever diminished. I am honored to recognize His Holiness for his \ndedication to religious understanding and the goal of peace throughout \nthe world. May each of us be inspired to seek greater meaning in all \nthat we do. Again, I extend my heartfelt best wishes to His Holiness as \nhe visits Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10487-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10487-S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMPREHENSIVE COAL ACT REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a \ncosponsor of the Comprehensive Coal Act Reform Act of 1997, a \nbipartisan bill introduced by Senators Cochran and Conrad just prior to \nthe August recess. This bill seeks to alleviate inequities and \nunforeseeable hardships caused by the reachback tax provisions of the \nCoal Industry Health Benefit Act of 1992 [the Coal Act], while \nsafeguarding the Combined Fund established under the Coal Act to ensure \nthat retired mine workers get the health benefits they deserve.\n  As part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress passed a proposal \nto help protect health benefits of retired mine workers by allowing the \ntrustees of the newly created Combined Fund to reach back and require \nformer employers of retired coal miners to pay substantial assessments \nto the fund in order to finance such benefits. While its goals are \nlaudable, this sweeping proposal contains some serious shortcomings. \nFor one thing, it unfairly imposes excessive assessments on some \ncompanies, while under-assessing others.\n  Senators Cochran and Conrad have worked for some time to develop a \ncompromise bill that addresses some of the shortcomings in the Coal \nAct. This effort led to the introduction of the Comprehensive Coal Act \nReform Act of 1997, S. 1105, which I think makes a number of needed \nchanges. I applaud efforts of these Senators to find a workable and \nfair solution to the reachback problem. And I've added my name as a \ncosponsor of S. 1105 because I support the primary thrust and goals of \nthis bill.\n  I do not know if the formula adopted in S. 1105 perfectly resolves \nthe problems created by the Coal Act. Some companies will probably \ncontinue to argue that they are paying too much and that others are \npaying too little into the Combined Fund. Retired mine workers will \nundoubtedly be concerned by any bill modifying the Coal Act until it's \nshown that the proposal causes no harm to them.\n  Finally, let me be very clear about one point. My cosponsorship of \nthis bill should not be construed by anyone as a weakening of my \nsupport for retired mine workers and their families. They\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\nworked tirelessly in their jobs--often at substantial risk to their \npersonal health and safety--to help meet the energy needs of this \ncountry. They are entitled to retirement benefits earned for their \ndedicated years of service. Any corrective action we take in Congress \nmust ultimately be consistent with this obligation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10487-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MIDDLETOWN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL\n\n Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I stand before you today to speak \nof a situation which is of great concern. As Iraqi children returned to \nschool last week, they began another year under difficult \ncircumstances. For 7 years, the innocent children and citizens of Iraq \nhave endured hardships and suffering which are immeasurable for many in \nthis country. Economic sanctions imposed upon the country of Iraq by \nthe United Nations were never intended to deprive the Iraqi people of \nthe necessities of life. While some relief has occurred I believe that \nmuch more must be done.\n  Yet, the situation in Iraq is grim. According to the United Nations \nFood And Agriculture Organization [FAO], the Iraqi children are perhaps \nthe most vulnerable and hardest hit. More than 600,000 children have \ndied and it is estimated that 4,500 children are dying each month from \nproblems related to malnutrition and shortages of medical supplies. \nWhile the sanctions continue, the regime prospers. It is time for the \ncitizens and leaders of our country to continue to provide humanitarian \naid to the most innocent of Iraq.\n  The United States Department of State has not objected to the \nissuance of licenses to United States organizations and individuals \ndonating food, medicine, and other materials for essential civilian \nneeds in Iraq. I am pleased that my office was able to assist the \nInternational Relief Association [IRA] based out of St. Clair Shores, \nMI, in obtaining a license to provide much needed supplies to the \nchildren and elderly of Iraq. I believe that it is essential to \ncontinue to seek out organizations and individuals who wish to assist \nin bringing further humanitarian relief to Iraq and to help them in \nobtaining the proper licenses to do so. Let it be known, that I \nencourage my colleagues to invoke the spirit of American \nhumanitarianism and for each of them to examine the simple fact that \naid must continue in this region of the world. I commend each \norganization and individual who has assisted in providing relief to the \npeople of Iraq. May each of us be reminded that political and economic \nsanctions should not affect the lives of those who innocently \nsuffer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10488-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10488-S10489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SUSAN LANDON\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nsorrow about the death of Susan Landon on September 28, 1997. Ms. \nLandon, a citizen of New Mexico and resident of the city of \nAlbuquerque, graduated from the University of New Mexico. She went on \nto fulfill a rich and varied career writing for the Albuquerque \nJournal. I have become familiar with Susan's work, as she reported on a \nrange of issues spanning much of the breadth of contemporary New Mexico \nlife.\n  Ms. Landon worked as the youth page editor, and as a reporter for \ngeneral assignments, education, and State news. She began writing for \nthe Journal's editorial page in 1992, and continued to do so until a \nfew weeks before her death. Susan excelled in her assignments, winning \nnumerous city, State, and national journalism awards. She found \nparticular satisfaction through her work covering various Native \nAmerican issues, and was thanked publicly by the president of the \nNavajo Nation for the sensitivity and understanding which was reflected \nin her writings.\n  I would like to quote from an article written by Jim Belshaw, a \nfriend and colleague of Susan, in which he said ``Susan Landon was \nsmart and fair and irreverent and compassionate and tough; she was a \nnative New Mexican who knew and loved the State and its people. She had \nan unerring ability to cut through rhetoric and get to the heart of a \nmatter, regardless of its camouflage.''\n  Mr. President, I ask today that the full text of Mr. Belshaw's \narticle be printed in the Record, as it provides a unique perspective \non the life of this dedicated individual whom New Mexico will miss very \nmuch.\n  The article follows:\n\n               Prized Reporter Shared Her Gift With N.M.\n\n                            (By Jim Belshaw)\n\n       Susan Landon, my friend and colleague of 20 years, died \n     Sunday. She was 47 years old. She left a gift--a photograph!\n       At first, I believed the photograph spoke only to those of \n     us who toil in journalistic fields. But I was mistaken as \n     well as myopic. The photograph's message, clear and sharp as \n     a New Mexico autumn, is meant not just for the people who \n     worked at Susan's side all these years but for anybody who \n     cares to embrace it.\n       The black-and-white photo shows a young newspaper reporter \n     on the job. She stands in muddy, ankle-deep flood water. She \n     writes in a notebook while the man whose name and words will \n     appear in the next morning's newspaper leans on the shovel he \n     has been using to fling muck out of his flooded home.\n       ``Look who shot this,'' Susan said the first time she \n     showed me the picture.\n       Stamped on the back of the print was the name of the \n     Journal photographer--Jim Nachtwey, a mutual friend who has \n     gone on to renown as one of the world's foremost \n     photojournalists.\n       The picture is dated June 15, 1977; a handwritten note on \n     the back of the photo describes the scene's circumstances.\n       ``My mother wrote this,'' Susan said, smiling at the \n     singular pride only a mother can have in a child.\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\n       ``Famous Journal Reporter,'' the note's formal title \n     announces. ``Susan Landon with David Starkey--covering story \n     when irrigation ditch wall broke in South Valley, flooding 4 \n     homes.''\n       I don't remember how long it's been since that first time \n     she showed me the photograph. After that conversation, I \n     never said anything more about it, though I thought of it \n     often because its message was so clear and irrefutable.\n       Then one day a few weeks ago, after it became clear that \n     she would lose the fight against the cancer that attacked \n     her, Susan handed me the picture and said, ``I want you to \n     have this.''\n       Susan Landon was smart and fair and irreverent and \n     compassionate and tough--all the things a reporter should be.\n       She was a native New Mexican who knew and loved the state \n     and its people. She had an unerring ability to cut through \n     rhetoric and get to the heart of a matter, regardless of its \n     camouflage.\n       She was painfully shy and militantly private, but she never \n     backed away from the demands of the job. At her core lay a \n     righteous anger, a philosophic pilot light ready to ignite \n     when confronted with inequity; the flame burned especially \n     hot when she encountered a bully abusing power.\n       She spent the final years of her newspaper career as an \n     editorial writer, but when she spoke of what she missed most \n     it had nothing to do with the inside of the building.\n       ``I miss the reservation,'' she once said, looking back to \n     the years she covered the Navajo Nation. ``I miss being out \n     there talking to the people. I miss writing about them. It \n     was the best time for me.''\n       When she gave me the photograph, it occurred to me that it \n     should be made into a poster and pinned up on the bulletin \n     boards of journalism schools all over the country. It is a \n     clean, pure image of what this job is supposed to be.\n       Each time I looked at it. I thought about the peripheral \n     circus that follows us these days: Seminars and focus groups \n     and dazzling graphics and endless analysis; the Internet and \n     Web pages and cyberspace prophets issuing incessant \n     revelations predicting the printed world's imminent doom.\n       Then I look again at Susan's photograph and I am reminded \n     of what the job is supposed to be--any job, not just ours. \n     The photograph transcends journalism, its simple eloquence \n     unable to be contained within the confines of a single \n     endeavor.\n       This image of Susan with her pen and note pad is the image \n     of a woman doing the job with no complaints, no excuses, no \n     sleight of hand, no gimmicks.\n       It speaks to anyone engaged in any undertaking. It says the \n     only thing that really counts is getting the job done. \n     Anything else is just an excuse and deep in our hearts we all \n     know it.\n       My dear friend, Susan, has died and left a gift that at \n     first glance seems to be a photograph but is much more. Susan \n     left us a compass. It points to true north.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10488-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHALDEAN FEDERATION OF AMERICA DINNER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an \nimportant event which is taking place in the State of Michigan. On this \nday, October 14, 1997, many have gathered to celebrate the Chaldean \nFederation of America's fifth annual dinner and awards banquet. Each of \nthe individuals in attendance deserve special recognition for their \ncommitment and steadfast support of the Chaldean community.\n  I am pleased to recognize the recipients of tonight's awards: Dr. \nNathima Atchoo--Humanitarian Award, Mayor Gerald Naftaly--Civic \nHumanitarian Award, Hayat Jajonie and Salim Sarafa--Community Service \nAwards, Janan Senawi--Volunteer Recognition Award, Ismael Ahmed and \nSargon Lewie--CFA President's Award, Isam Yaldo--Business/Community \nAward, and Deacon Sadik Barno--Cultural Award. Each of these recipients \nshould take great pride in receiving these distinguished awards.\n  While it is important to pay special tribute to the awardees, it is \nalso essential to honor each citizen of the Chaldean community. In many \nrespects, the Chaldean community of Michigan is a true example of a \nthriving community. Through strong economic growth, inspiring leaders, \nand unwavering dedication, the State of Michigan has greatly benefited \nfrom Chaldean-Americans. One such organization that has exemplified the \nspirit of the Chaldean community is the International Relief \nAssociation.\n  The International Relief Association [IRA] continues to assist in \nsupplying humanitarian relief to the children of Iraq. This association \nwhich is based in St. Louis Clair Shores, MI, has been a tireless \nadvocate for the innocent individuals which have been so deeply \naffected by the trade embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990. According to \nthe United Nations International Children's Education Fund, it is \nestimated that some 4,500 children are dying each month from \nmalnutrition and the shortage of much-needed supplies. I commend the \nIRA for its active participation in the lives of the people of Iraq.\n  While the IRA continues to help to support the people of Iraq, I \nbelieve that each of us must examine what role we can play. It is \nessential that collectively we begin to raise awareness concerning this \nregion of the world. Again, I am deeply honored to lend my support to \nthe work of the IRA and to the countless individuals whose own private \nefforts often go unnoticed.\n  To the Chaldean-American community and to the awardees, I send my \nsincere best wishes and may the spirit of this evening continue to \ninspire each of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10489-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE ST.

Mr. President I rise today to \nhonor the St. Thomas Aquinas School in Drew, NH, for receiving the \nState Champion Award for the President's Challenge on Physical Fitness.\n  The State Champion Award is presented to schools with the highest \nnumber of students scoring at or above the 85th percentile on the \nPresident's Challenge.\n  The five assessments of the President's Challenge measure four \ncomponents of physical fitness: a 1-mile run/walk for heart and lung \nendurance, curl-ups for abdominal strength and endurance, a ``sit and \nreach'' stretch for muscular flexibility, pull-ups for upper body \nstrength and endurance, and a shuttle run for agility.\n  St. Thomas Aquinas is a private Catholic school filled with 300 \nstudents in grades kindergarten through 8.\n  Excelling in physical fitness is a positive step toward making \nhealthy lifestyle choices that will provide lifelong benefits. I am \nvery proud of the students at St. Thomas Aquinas for their \naccomplishments and applaud the efforts and dedication of the \nschool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10489-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10489-S10490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE FIFTH ANNUAL AMERICAN ARAB CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BANQUET\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2378, the Treasury and general Government \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $25.4 billion and new \noutlays of $22.5 billion to finance operations of the Department of the \nTreasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Financial Management \nService; as well as the Executive Office of the President, the Office \nof Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, and other \nagencies that perform central Government functions.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation and generally \nconsistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. I also \ncommend the chairman for his strong support of law enforcement, \nincluding the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.\n  When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $25.4 billion in BA and $25.2 billion in \noutlays. The total bill is $2 million below the Senate subcommittee's \n302(b) nondefense discretionary allocation for budget authority and \noutlays. The bill is at the subcommittee's violent crime trust fund \nallocation for BA and under its allocation for outlays by $8 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a table displaying \nthe Budget Committee scoring of the conference agreement on H.R. 2378.\n  The table follows:\n\n            H.R. 2378, TREASURY-POSTAL APPROPRIATIONS, 1998, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                         [Fiscal Year 1998, $ millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Defense  Nondefense    Crime   Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........     12,604        131     12,713    25,448\n  Outlays..................................................  ........     12,377        118     12,712    25,207\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........     12,606        131     12,713    25,450\n  Outlays..................................................  ........     12,379        126     12,712    25,217\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........     12,960        118     12,713    25,791\n  Outlays..................................................  ........     12,495        105     12,712    25,312\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........     12,401         97     12,713    25,211\n  Outlays..................................................  ........     12,170         94     12,712    24,976\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........     12,466        131     12,713    25,310\n  Outlays..................................................  ........     12,268        112     12,712    25,092\n \n               CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........         -2   ........  .........        -2\n  Outlays..................................................  ........         -2         -8  .........       -10\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........       -356         13  .........      -343\n  Outlays..................................................  ........       -118         13  .........      -105\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........        203         34  .........       237\n  Outlays..................................................  ........        207         24  .........       231\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.........................................  ........        138   ........  .........       138\n  Outlays..................................................  ........        109          6  .........       115\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to an \norganization which is working to help create a better America. On \nSunday, October 12, Focus:HOPE will hold its annual walk. This walk \nraises awareness of the community's needs and reaffirms Focus:HOPE's \ncommitment to metropolitan Detroit.\n  This year has been very challenging for Focus:HOPE. The organization \nwas struck by a terrible tragedy: the loss of Father Cunningham. His \npassing was a blow to not only the program he founded, but to the \nentire Detroit community. The dedication and vigor with which he \npursued his goal of creating an environment where all people live in \nharmony was unsurpassed; his optimism and belief in Detroit was \noverwhelming; faced with the task before him, his spirit remained \nundaunted. Truly, he was one man who made a difference. This year \nFocus:HOPE's spirit was shaken and so too were its foundations. Earlier \nthis year, storms swept through metropolitan Detroit, ravaging the \narea. A tornado sped through the city and left Focus:HOPE's facilities \nseverely damaged in its wake.\n  Now, Focus:HOPE is rebuilding. Although a great part of Focus:HOPE is \ngone, Father Cunningham's vision lives on. The many volunteers and \nsupporters walking this year represent a renewed commitment. Sunday \nwill be an occasion for the organization to rededicate itself to \nhelping provide every needy individual with the means to succeed. Over \nthe years, Focus:HOPE has flourished and grown into a shining example \nof what can be accomplished through dedication and hard work. As much \nas this occasion is a reflection on the past, it is more appropriately \na time to contemplate what the future may hold. The 21st century is \ndrawing near and Focus:HOPE'stands ready to meet all challenges head-\non. I am confident this year's walk will inspire people to follow \nFather Cunningham's lead and help make the city of Detroit, the State \nof Michigan, and the entire Nation a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10490-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, there is in this country a need for \ncampaign reform. Something could well be done but the approach from the \nClinton-Gore administration is in no way a sincere effort. It is a \ngossamer facade at reform. In reality, it is nothing more than an \nattempt to divert people's attention from the flagrant abuses of the \ncampaign finance laws already on the books--laws they have broken on a \nregular basis.\n  It takes absolute unmitigated gall for President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore to talk about campaign finance reform when they cannot \nand\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\nhave not obeyed the existing laws. For the President and Vice President \nto be talking about campaign finance reform, it would be similar to \nJesse James leading a crusade for stricter bank robbery laws. They both \nremind me of two people that have stolen your horses and go flying down \nthe road by your house saying ``lock your barn, lock your barn.'' They \nhave gotten the horses and gone.\n  The truth is that this is a first step in a liberal effort to get the \nAmerican taxpayer to pay for political campaigns. It would be a massive \nmistake to take the electoral process away from the private sector and \nturn it into another Federal Government bureaucracy. And that is \nexactly what this bill would do. What they are hoping to do is to make \ncampaigns a public bureaucracy paid for by the taxpayers whether they \nwant to or not. When they talk about campaign finance reform, there is \none thing they have in mind: Getting their hands into the public till \nto pay for their political campaigns.\n  If you want to see how well public financing works, you can just look \nat the 1996 Presidential campaign. Have you ever seen a more flagrant \ndisregard for the laws of this country than happened in that? President \nClinton and Vice President Gore didn't need to raise money from \nBuddhist monks, Asian temples, international arms dealers, and the \nChinese Government because their general election campaign was already \npaid for by the American taxpayers. But, no, they were so greedy they \nhad to go everywhere and hunt every illegal contribution they could \nfind.\n  They wonder why fewer and fewer Americans are checking off the \ncontribution box for the President's election fund on their tax forms. \nWhy check it off? Simply make a trip to the Buddhist temple and fund \nyour own campaign.\n  The private sector works. If people want to support a candidate with \ntheir contributions, they will. But don't force the taxpayers to fund \nthe ideological campaigns of candidates they don't support. And that is \nexactly where we are heading.\n  Mr. President, as I said, there is a need for campaign finance \nreform. I have supported several specific items which I believe could \nhelp bring some balance to the system. Indexing contributions would be \none. Another is to make sure that workers have an option whether they \nwant to support the union political activities or not. One of the most \nimportant things is to protect their paycheck. We need faster and \nfuller disclosure of contributions, and if we really wanted to do \nsomething for campaign finance reform we could go with term limits, if \nwe were really serious about controlling it.\n  Most importantly, politicians should start obeying the campaign \nfinance laws that are already on the books. Why should we start passing \nmore reform laws when in the past campaign we saw the President and the \nVice President break the ones that were there day in and day out. And I \nam tired of the ``everybody did it'' excuse that we are hearing out of \nthis administration. Even if that were true, it is time for the \nPresident to muster the intestinal fortitude on his own and stop doing \nit. There is no excuse for him to do it because somebody--they were \nsaying this morning in the hearing--20 years ago did it. He should be \nresponsible for himself.\n  It is already illegal to accept contributions from foreign countries. \nWhy do we not enforce the existing law rather than going for new ones? \nMr. President, we need real campaign finance reform but spare us the \nmoral outrage coming from President Clinton and Vice President Gore. We \nhave enough cynicism in politics as it is now. It is time to end it. It \nis time for the President and Vice President to take responsibility for \ntheir personal actions.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/07/senate-section/article/S10490-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

Assuming cloture is not \ninvoked, the Senate will then move to proceed to S. 1173, the so-called \nISTEA legislation.
