Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire has spoken eloquently about young people and the lives of \nyoung people and how we ought to be concerned on their behalf. I would \nlike to spend a moment of the Senate's time speaking about a young boy \nin my State, James Adams, of Fairburn, GA, who is now 5 years old. \nBecause of the rules of his parents' HMO, what happened to him in March \nof 1993, when he was only 6 months old, has changed his life forever.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire was speaking of right and wrong about \nyoung people. What happened to James Adams of Fairburn, GA, was not \nright.\n  James was suffering from a fever of over 100 degrees. Like 160 \nmillion other Americans, his parents were enrolled in a managed health \ncare plan. James' mother took him to his HMO plan pediatrician, who \ndiagnosed only a respiratory ailment and post-nasal drip. He prescribed \nonly saline drops, vaporizer use, and Tylenol every four hours. James' \nmother was told not to worry, that high fevers in young children do not \nnecessarily mean serious illness.\n  Later that night, his temperature was still rising and he was in \ngreat discomfort. James' worried mother called her HMO directly. The \nnurse on duty recommended bathing James in cold water. A pediatrician \nthen placed a follow-up call, advising the parents to bring James to an \nHMO-participating hospital--42 miles away.\n  On the way to the hospital, as his parents' car sped past multiple \nother hospitals in Atlanta not covered by the Adams' HMO, James \nsuffered full cardiac and respiratory arrest, and lost consciousness. \nHis parents decided they simply couldn't wait to get him to the HMO \nhospital--James needed care immediately. His parents pulled into the \nclosest hospital they could find--still 6\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\nmiles from their target destination. Upon his arrival at that hospital, \ndoctors were able to restore his pulse and breathing. But the \ncirculation to his hands and feet was cut off, and never returned.\n  James suffered irreparable damage to his extremities. Both his hands \nand feet had to be amputated. The delay of care caused by driving \nalmost an hour to an affiliated hospital had taken its toll.\n  Today, James is doing really well. He was able to get to a hospital \njust in time enough to save his life, and has worked hard ever since to \nrehabilitate himself. I am confident he will be able to lead a full and \nproductive life. But could things have turned out better for James? \nProbably so.\n  The question I have is, if S. 1890, the Patients Bill of Rights had \nbeen in effect, could it have helped James Adams and his family? The \nanswer: probably so.\n  First, the Patients Bill of Rights would have covered access to and \npayment for emergency services. That is, regardless of what the outcome \nlooked like at the time, since James' parents reasonably believed that \nemergency care was needed, they would have been able to get it, \naccessibly, in time. I believe that an individual should be assured \nthat if they have an emergency, those services will be covered by their \nplan. This bill states that individuals must have access to emergency \ncare, without prior authorization, in any situation that a ``prudent \nlay person'' would regard as an emergency.\n\n  Second, the Adams family's HMO could not have restricted their choice \nin service provider. They would have been able to have their own \ndoctor--a regular doctor--convenient to where they live, and covered by \ntheir HMO plan.\n  Third, the Adams' HMO would have been more clearly liable. Luckily, \nthe lawsuit against the HMO that James' family went through was \nsuccessful, but under current law such an outcome is far from \nguaranteed. The Patients Bill of Rights includes a provision for health \nplans that make medical decisions which result in harm to the patient, \njust as doctors and hospitals are held accountable today.\n  In addition, the Patients Bill of Rights would mandate a fair and \ntimely appeal process both within the plan and to an independent \nexternal body when health plans deny care. It would also provide for \naccess to medical specialists, continued care when a plan or provider \nis terminated and protection for providers who advocate on behalf of \ntheir patients.\n  Most important, the Patients Bill of Rights would help restore some \nof the confidence consumers have lost in their health care plans. It \nwould ensure that Americans receive the care they were promised when \nthey enrolled in their plan, and that they paid for with their monthly \npremiums.\n  I believe it is imperative that as lawmakers, we work with health \nprofessionals, insurance providers and the American people, to create \nthe most efficient, accessible and responsive health care system \npossible. To that end I am cosponsoring S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of \nRights Act of 1998, which would reform the delivery of managed care. We \nhave a responsibility to ensure that the best health care system in the \nworld remains accessible and affordable to all Americans. Though \nmanaged care has changed the nature of the health care industry by \nproviding a more coordinated approach to medical care which reduces \ncosts and waste, many beneficiaries believe, with cause, that their \nquality of care has been diminished.\n  As the debate over health care reform continues, I will continue to \nfight to refocus our health care system on patients--like James Adams--\nand away from the bottom line.\n  The ultimate goal of any health care provider, including managed care \nproviders, should be to provide the best possible care for the patient. \nAnything less is unacceptable. Although the financial aspects are \nimportant, we cannot let patient care be sacrificed just because of a \nbottom line issue. I believe that Congress must take swift action to \naddress the issue of managed care reform and I believe that the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998 is a significant step in that \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. Not \nthat there are not other Senators who are connected to people back in \ntheir States, but the Senator from Georgia, I think, among us, stands \nout as a Senator who is really connected to people he represents. When \nhe uses the word ``fight,'' I think he will be fighting very hard for \npeople and I think we will have really a historically significant \ndebate on this legislation.\n  This is a very personal issue for people we are talking about, I say \nto my colleague, their health and the health of their children. So I \nthank the Senator from Georgia for his very strong words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5665-7", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5666-S5668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BOBBY KENNEDY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on June 6, 1968, at 1:44 a.m., Bobby \nKennedy passed away. I would like to speak about Senator Kennedy. First \nof all, I just recommend for people in Minnesota and our country a \nwonderful documentary that will be shown this week on TV on the \nDiscovery Channel, ``Robert F. Kennedy, A Memoir.'' This was done by \nJack Newfield and Charlie Stewart. My wife Sheila and I had a chance to \nsee 2 hours of this, a preview. It is very powerful.\n  I thought what I would do is read from a book which just came out, \nwritten by one of Bobby Kennedy's children, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy. The \ntitle of it is ``Make Gentle The Life Of The World.'' This is an \nexcerpt from one of Bobby Kennedy's speeches:\n\n       Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many \n     years ago, ``to tame the savageness of man and make gentle \n     the life of the world.'' Thus the title, ``Make Gentle The \n     Life Of The World.''\n\n  Let me just say at the beginning, before quoting from some of Bobby \nKennedy's speeches, that I believe--this is just my opinion--that the \nSenator who really most lives this tradition, of course in a very \npersonal way, but in terms of his just unbelievable advocacy for people \nand the kind of courage and power, the effectiveness of his advocacy \nfor people, of course, is Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  Behind me is the desk of President John Kennedy, which is Senator \nEdward Kennedy's desk. I can't think of any Senator who better \nrepresents the words I am now about to quote.\n  Bobby Kennedy gave a speech. I believe it was at the University of \nKansas. He wanted to talk to students and young people. He wanted to \ntalk about the way in which we measure ourselves as a people. It is one \nof my favorite speeches, and I quote a part of it:\n\n       Yet, the gross national product does not allow for the \n     health of our children--\n\n  In other words, do we measure how we are doing as a country just by \nthe economic indicators.\n\n       Yet, the gross national product does not allow for the \n     health of our children, the quality of their education or the \n     joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our \n     poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of \n     our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. \n     It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our \n     wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our \n     devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, \n     except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us \n     everything about America, except why we are proud that we are \n     Americans.\n\n  Mr. President, another speech that Senator Kennedy gave is relevant \nto our times:\n\n       There are millions of Americans living in hidden places \n     whose faces and names we never know, but I've seen children \n     starving in Mississippi, idling their lives away in the \n     ghetto, living without hope or future amid the despair on \n     Indian reservations with no jobs and little help. I've seen \n     proud men in the hills of Appalachia who wish only to work in \n     dignity, but the mines are closed and the jobs are gone and \n     no one, neither industry nor labor nor Government, has cared \n     enough to help. Those conditions will change, those children \n     will live only if we dissent. So I dissent, and I know you \n     do, too.\n\n  Interesting words about crime:\n\n       Thus, the fight against crime is, in the last analysis, the \n     same as the fight for equal opportunity, or the battle \n     against hunger and deprivation, or the struggle to prevent \n     the pollution of our air and water. It is the fight to \n     preserve the quality of community which is at the root of our \n     greatness, a fight to preserve confidence in ourselves and \n     our fellow citizens, a battle for the quality of our lives.\n\n  About the importance of work:\n\n       We need jobs, dignified employment at decent pay.\n\n  What many today call living-wage jobs.\n\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\n\n       The kind of employment that lets a man--\n\n  And I add, and I am sure Senator Kennedy would add, a woman----\n\n     say to his community, to his family, to his country and, most \n     important, to himself [or herself], ``I helped to build this \n     country; I'm a participant in this great public venture; I am \n     a man''--\n\n  And, I add, ``I am a woman.''\n  The importance of work--\n  Community:\n\n       Today, we can make this a nation where young people do not \n     see the false peace of drugs. Together, we can make this a \n     nation where old people are not shunted off, where regardless \n     of the color of his skin or the place of birth of his father, \n     every citizen will have an equal chance at dignity and \n     decency.  Together, Americans are the most decent, generous \n     and compassionate people in the world. Divided, they are \n     collections of islands--islands of blacks afraid of \n     islands of whites; islands of northerners bitterly opposed \n     to islands of southerners, islands of workers warring with \n     islands of businessmen.\n\n  Government:\n\n       Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the \n     immortal Dante tells us that divine justice weighs the sins \n     of the cold-blooded and the sins of the warm-hearted in a \n     different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government \n     living in the spirit of charity than the consistent emissions \n     of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n\n  Courage--I think the pages will especially like this:\n\n       It is from numberless, diverse acts of courage and belief \n     that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up--\n\n  Or a woman stands up--\n\n     for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes \n     out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope \n     and crossing each other from a million different centers of \n     energy and daring those ripples build a current which can \n     sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\n\n  These are really beautiful words.\n  Mr. President, I had an opportunity about a year ago to travel just \nto a few communities Senator Kennedy visited. I started out in the \ndelta, Mississippi, and actually just this past Friday, a week ago, I \nwent back to Tunica in the delta, just by myself, mainly to teach \nclasses. I went back because there was a marvelous teacher, Mr. Robert \nHall, who said a year ago at a community meeting, ``I wish you could \ncome back around graduation time, because only about 50 percent or just \na little bit more of our students graduate, and our students need to \nhave more hope.''\n  In Tunica, the public high school is all African-American, and the \nprivate schools are all white. So I came back. I landed, and a man \nnamed Mr. Young picked me up at the airport. He said, ``Before you go \nto the high school, you will be addressing the third and fourth \ngraders.'' I say to the Chair, I thought to myself, addressing the \nthird and fourth graders the last day of school, like a policy address? \nIt didn't sound like this was going to work very well.\n  I went to the elementary school, and the third and fourth graders \nwere all sitting in the auditorium. A principal, a young man, \nintroduced me, and we were high on the stage. I told the principal, ``I \nthink I will not stay on the stage.'' I went out to where the students \nwere.\n  This one young girl helped me out so much, because we were talking \nabout education and school and why you like school. She said, ``I like \nit because a good education will help me be all I want to be in my \nlife.'' Then 40 hands went up at one time. That is a teacher's dream, \nand these children had all sorts of dreams--doctors, lawyers, \npsychiatrists, professional wrestlers, boxers, football players--you \nname it--teachers, on and on and on. I thought to myself, this is what \nit is about. The only problem is that for too many children, that is \nthe way they start out, and then this just gets taken away from them. \nThe same spark isn't there later on by the time they get to high \nschool.\n  I then went to East L.A. and to Watts and went to public housing \nprojects in Chicago and inner-city Baltimore and Letcher County, KY, \nand inner-city Minneapolis, Phillips neighborhood, rural Minnesota. The \npoint is there are heroines, and heroines are doing great work. That is \nmy point.\n  The other point is, everywhere I went, I really believe--and these \nare my words, I summarize it--what part of the people were saying with \na lot of dignity was, ``What happened to our national vow of equal \nopportunity for every child? We don't have it in our communities.'' And \nthe jobs--where are the jobs with decent wages? That is what we want to \nbe able to do. Just think about Robert Kennedy's words, about the \nimportance of work. That is what people are saying today. ``We want to \nhave jobs at decent wages so that we can earn a decent living and we \ncan give our children the care we know they need and deserve.''\n\n  Really, Mr. President, as I think about that travel--and travel in \nany community--this is the focus: On jobs and education, health care, \nearning a decent living, being able to do well for your children. That \nis the focus.\n  Different people think about Senator Kennedy's career, Bobby Kennedy, \nand what he stood for, and different people in different ways, to try \nto use that inspiring example to do good work. I want to just raise one \nquestion before the Senate today, as I feel that this is very connected \nto Senator Kennedy's life and what he tried to do for our country. And \nthis is the question. I pose this question for my colleagues and the \npeople in the country: How can it be that in the United States of \nAmerica today--not June of 1968--June of 1998, how can it be the \nrichest, most affluent country in the world, at the peak of our \neconomic performance--we are all writing about how well the economy is \ndoing--how can it be that we are still being told that we cannot \nprovide a good education for every child, that we cannot provide good \nhealth care for all of our citizens, that people still cannot find jobs \nat decent wages that they can support their families on, that we cannot \nat least reach the goal of making sure that every child who comes to \nkindergarten is ready to learn? She knows how to spell her name; she \nknows colors and shapes and sizes; she knows the alphabet; she has been \nread to widely; and she or he is ready to learn. And we are still being \ntold we can't reach those goals as a nation?\n  And how can it be that in our peak economic performance today, one \nout of four children under the age of 3 are growing up poor in \nAmerica--under the age of 3; and one out of every two children of color \nunder the age of 3 are growing up poor in our country? How can this be? \nHow can it be that we have a set of social arrangements that allow \nchildren to be the most poverty-stricken group in America? That is a \nbetrayal of our heritage. The impoverishment of so many children is our \nnational disgrace.\n  I just feel--and I am just speaking for myself--as I think back about \nRobert Kennedy's life, he would surely say today that this is not \nacceptable and that we can do better. He would probably say, ``We can \ndo betta.'' And I think those words are very important.\n  One final point, if my colleague would indulge me.\n  I had a chance to speak at a baccalaureate at Swarthmore College this \nlast weekend. And I was saying to the students--a lot of people have \ngiven up on politics. A lot of people, it is not that they don't care \nabout the issues, they care deeply, they care desperately, but they \ndon't think there is much of a connection between their concerns and \nour concerns. They read all about money in politics, and they just do \nnot think it is that important.\n  A friend of mine was telling me he was teaching a seminar class on \nelectoral politics, and he was talking about Presidential races and \nsome of his involvement in the past, and students said, ``Well, that's \nwhen elections mattered.'' Elections do matter. All of us in public \nservice, I think, believe that, even if we have different viewpoints.\n\n  I said to the students--and I want to conclude this way, in just \ntalking with young people, not at young people--that I read--and \ncertainly this was the case in Swarthmore College--an incredibly high \npercentage of students in our colleges and universities are involved in \ncommunity service, and also high school students. It is not true that \nyoung people do not care about community, do not want to serve our \ncountry. There is a tremendous amount of good work being done. The \nproblem is that I think many young people say community service is good \nand politics is unsavory.\n  I just say today, on the floor of the Senate, to the young people: We \nneed you to be mentors and tutors. We need your community service. We \nneed you to volunteer at battered women's shelters. If my wife Sheila \nwas here, she\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\nwould say, ``Mention that, Paul.'' We need you to be advocates for \nchildren. We need you to help other children. We need you to do \ncommunity work. When you go on to college and universities and get \ndegrees, and you are lawyers and businesspeople, we need you to take \nsome of your skills and give it to the community. We need you to do \nthat. But we also need you to care about public policy. We need you to \ncare about good public policy, and we need you to make sure that our \nNation does better.\n  Mr. President, I want to say today--since I wanted to take a few \nminutes to speak about Robert Kennedy and his life, the meaning of that \nlife, to me and I think to many Americans--I think that the final point \nthat I would want to make--feels right to me, at least--is to say, \nespecially to younger people, the future is not going to belong to \nthose who are content with the present. The future is not going to \nbelong to cynics; it is not going to belong to people who stand on the \nsidelines; it is not going to belong to people who view politics as a \nspectator sport.\n  The future is going to belong to people who have passion and people \nwho are willing to make a personal commitment to making our country \nbetter. And the future is going to belong--these are not Bobby \nKennedy's words; these are Eleanor Roosevelt's words--``The future is \ngoing to belong to people who believe in the beauty of their dreams.''\n  Bobby Kennedy had many beautiful dreams. His life was cut short, and \nhe was not able to realize all those dreams. But his dreams and his \nhope and his work for our country is as important to our Nation today \nas it ever was while he was alive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I returned Wednesday night from my second \ntour of what is left of the small community of Spencer, SD, which was \ndevastated, as many know, by a tornado this past Saturday night. Many \nof you may have seen the media reports and the pictures of the utter \ndestruction in Spencer.\n  After touring the site for the second time on Wednesday, I can \nhonestly say the pictures simply do not do the site justice, and it is \nalmost impossible to fathom the indiscriminate totality of the \ndestruction.\n  This tornado, which hit this small town, has been classified as an F4 \non the Fujita rating scale of the National Weather Service. The rating \nmeans winds have been estimated between 207 to 260 miles an hour.\n  As I toured the remains of this small town, the wind literally blew \nthe bark off the trees--what trees still remained standing.\n  To the community of Spencer, the rating means that the tornado was \npowerful enough to destroy 80 to 90 percent of their town.\n  The grain elevator, service station, post office, and library were \nall destroyed, as were all four churches, an antique store, the fire \nhall, and water tower. The town had no sewer, water or power.\n  All that is left of Spencer's 120-foot tall water tower is the \ncrumpled metal on the side of the street with the word ``Spencer'' \nwritten upside down now. A tan car hung suspended 5 feet off the ground \nin the tower's mangled legs.\n  The grain spilled from the Spencer Grain Company elevator out onto a \nfield. Spiky tops of tree trunks stuck up out of the ground, their \nbranches stripped of leaves--and furniture, bedding, miscellaneous \nitems stuck in the tree tops of what trees did remain.\n  Most tragically, the tornado was powerful enough to injure, out of \nthe 300-some in the community, 150 people--almost half the population--\nand to take the lives of 6.\n  The victims were Bev Bintliff, Elizabeth Burnham, Mildred Pugh, \nGloria Satterlee, Ron Selken, and Irene Yost.\n  Bev Bintliff was 68, a Spencer native. She and her husband, Robert, \nmoved back to Spencer after living in Oklahoma for a number of years. \nShe worked for several local businesses before becoming the city's \nfinance officer. Her husband is a painter. And they also operated a \nmusic shop in the nearby community of Mitchell.\n  Elizabeth Burnham was 85, lived in Spencer most of her life. She was \na widow, and lived alone in her home. She is survived by two daughters.\n  Mildred Pugh, 93, a widow, moved from her home of 60 years in Spencer \nto an apartment in the mid-1980s. She was born on the family homestead \nnortheast of Spencer and lived in the area all of her life. Her husband \nwas a rural mail carrier, and she was a homemaker. Friends say that she \nloved her garden and she loved to deer hunt with her husband. Mildred \nhad lived through other disasters. She survived floods, cyclones, \nfamine, the Depression, wars, but could not survive this tornado. She \nis survived by a great-nephew, a grandson, and two granddaughters, and \na sister.\n  Ron D. Selken, 62, has been described as a quiet man who enjoyed \nspending time with his family. Selken was born in 1936. He attended \nHawthorne Elementary in Sioux Falls. He served in the Korean War. He \nworked as a laborer at Gage Bros. Concrete in Sioux Falls until \nbecoming disabled because of back problems. In his spare time, Selken \nliked to work on his cars, watch sports and fish.\n  He recently became a grandfather for the third time and tragically \ndid not get to hold his new granddaughter who was born May 2. On my \nfirst trip to the tornado site last Sunday, I met Ron's daughter, Kris \nRoelfs, of Sibley, Iowa. I have to say, it was a very touching meeting \nand I felt inadequate that I could only give her my heartfelt \ncondolences. Her father had moved to Spencer about eight years ago from \nSioux Falls. In addition to his daughter, Kris, Ron Selken is survived \nby another daughter, Vicky Selken of Sioux Falls, a son, Kelley of Lake \nBenton, MN. Three grandchildren, two brothers and four sisters.\n  Gloria Satterlee, was in her mid 70's and was an organist and pianist \nat the Nazarene Church where her husband, Ward Sr. has been pastor for \nthe tiny congregation. Reverend Ward Satterlee was hospitalized at \nQueen of Peace Hospital in Mitchell with broken ribs and cuts but on my \nsecond visit to the tornado site yesterday, I had the chance to speak \nbriefly with Ward as he explained his predicament to Vice President \nGore.\n  The Satterlees celebrated their 50th anniversary last year and had \nlived in Spencer for more than 20 years. Mrs. Satterlee was a homemaker \nwho was interested in music and caring for elderly people. In addition \nto her husband she is survived by two children one in Kansas and one in \nnorthern Minnesota.\n  Irene Yost, in her mid 70's was retired and living in a downtown \napartment complex in Spencer. She had been ailing and had just been \ngetting back on her feet when it happened. She was a lifelong resident \nof Spencer, and once owned a business establishment in the community, \nworked as a telephone operator and in a Salem factory and operated a \nBingo Gas Station for a number of years.\n  While we mourn the tragic loss of these people and pray for their \nfamilies, we are grateful for those who survived. Many descriptions of \nthe terror the residents felt last Saturday night and of different \nindividual's determination to survive have been shared with me \npersonally over the past few days or have been shared with the public \nthrough the news media.\n\n  Linda Morehead's first thought was, ``Oh God don't let it be a \ntornado.'' As the tornado hit, Linda tried to open her basement door, \nbut it stuck. She finally got it open and made it down one step when \nthe wall between her dining room and the staircase fell and her roof \nblew off. She said that the roof flew off like a frisbee then it was \nall over and that she was down in a pit with stuff all around me like a \nhill.\n  Linda was trapped in her home after the storm because her left leg \nbecame pinned under cement and a radiator. Her leg was broken in two \nplaces and a chunk of flesh was ripped off when the cement was removed \nby rescue workers. Morehead's arms and shoulders were covered with \nbruises and cuts, but her face was untouched. As rain and marble-sized \nhail began to fall while\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nshe was trapped she covered her face with a nearby pair of sweatpants. \nIn spite of the pain she continues to suffer and the long road ahead to \nrecovery, Linda recognizes her good fortune to have survived and \nremembers moments when she didn't think she was going to live through \nit.\n  Linda has mixed emotions as she said ``I am angry because everything \nyou own is gone. Everything Mom and Dad worked for all their life is \ngone. I get so angry. And then I'm thankful the kids are all right.\n  Late Sunday afternoon Linda was still finding debris in her hair--\nrocks, pine needles, glass, wood splinters.\n  Tammy Kreutzfeldt remembers that she and her family all screamed as \nthe pressure built and the roof of their house blew off. She and her \nfamily looked up and could see the tornado and the sky from their \nbasement. Tammy had cuts on her head inflicted from falling bricks as \nshe huddled with friends and family members in the basement of her home \nduring the tornado.\n  Lucille and Jimmy Mone, 89 and 95 years old respectively, crawled \nover glass to safety. Jimmy who had been blown right out of bed crawled \nwith Lucille on their hands and knees through shards of glass from \nblown out windows and broken pictures to their downstairs where they \nstayed until the storm had passed. Again, these two amazingly strong \nfighters recognized their good fortune as they looked back on their \nminutes of terror and acknowledged that, ``We're still alive and that's \nthe important thing.''\n  Arnold Eldeen was driving Saturday night when he spotted the tornado \nthat demolished much of his hometown. He raced home and arrived about \n15 minutes after the tornado hit. While Arnold had been able to call \nhis two sons before the tornado hit Spencer, it took almost three hours \nfor him to find them to ensure they were both alive--thankfully, his \nsons had been able to make it out of Spencer before the tornado ravaged \nthe community.\n  Amanda Stevens, 85, was in a corner of her basement when the tornado \nstruck and she prayed that she would not be pulled out of her basement. \nThe tornado ripped the roof off her home, but miraculously the ceramic \ntile remained in place which she tediously laid on the walls 27 years \nago as she and her now-deceased husband built their home.\n  On Sunday, South Dakota's Governor William Janklow acted \nexpeditiously to request a disaster declaration for the Spencer area \nfrom President Clinton. I was extremely pleased that the President \nacted swiftly and responded positively on Monday with a declaration for \nMcCook County. While the declaration opens up a lot of assistance to \nhelp the victims start rebuilding their lives, the assistance certainly \nwon't make anyone whole.\n  I was also pleased that on Monday, Vice President Gore and FEMA \nDirector James Lee Witt both announced they would tour the tornado \nravaged area. I was pleased to join them on their tour Wednesday. I \ntruly believe their visit helped lift the spirits of many of the \nvictims.\n  South Dakota has been hit by many devastating acts of Mother Nature \nin recent years. While the natural disasters South Dakota has faced in \nthe recent past have all been different, two things are consistent in \nthe wake of every disaster my state has experienced:\n  First, the victims of the disaster always have a positive spirit and \nare determined to survive and rebuild their lives. Having met with \nresidents of Spencer twice in the past 6 days, I have been moved by \ntheir resilence and their ability to remain focused on the future, \nafter an act of Mother Nature wiped away the town they called home and \na lifetime of personal possessions in a matter of minutes. The victims \nhave shown a quiet determination to rebuild their lives and I commend \nthem for their attitude. It can't be easy and I am committed to doing \nwhat I can to help each and every resident of Spencer move forward with \ntheir lives.\n  I am always impressed and heartened by the selfless giving of \nconcerned individuals coming to the aid of their fellow South Dakotans. \nSouth Dakotans have made it through tough times before and I think \nSouth Dakotans rush to reach out to our neighbors in need because we \nall realize that the next disaster could hit us.\n  The response was tremendous. The tornado hit Spencer at approximately \n8:45 pm on Saturday night. By 10 pm 300 emergency rescue workers and \nmedical personnel were on the scene.\n  Volunteers came from almost every city in the region to assist and \nhelp ease the shock from Kimball to Stickney to Dell Rapids. As a \nstream of ambulances entered city limits packed with volunteers, water, \nand blankets, other ambulances screamed out, loaded with wounded en \nroute to hospitals in Mitchell and Sioux Falls.\n  Members of the National Guard and the State Highway Patrol were also \non the scene immediately to assist victims.\n  While almost all families had their homes destroyed, very few victims \nhave had to seek shelter provided by the Red Cross of FEMA because \nfamily and friends in the area have opened their homes to the victims.\n  Within a day of the devastating tornado in Spencer, businesses and \nindividuals from across South Dakota provided tornado victims with \nfinancial and moral support to help them rebuild their lives. I have \nbeen extremely touched--though I must say not surprised--by the many \nexamples of generosity and compassion exhibited by individuals all over \nour state.\n  The community is working together to assist victims, including \ncollecting items needed by tornado victims. The Chapter of the American \nRed Cross has set up a fund. The United Methodist Church in Huron will \ngive their entire offering of the next weekend to assist the victims. A \ntelevision telethon raised over $500,000 in a matter of hours. Some \n8,000 volunteers--more, frankly, than could be efficiently utilized--\nshowed up at the Spencer city limits to volunteer. Many other \ncommunities around the State have set up funds for the disaster \nvictims. The South Dakota Community Foundation, which grants money to \nworthy causes, announced it will give $1,000 to every Spencer resident.\n  Two nights ago, KELO TV conducted an impromptu telethon to collect \nfunds for the victims. The effort collected over $500,000 in a matter \nof hours.\n  Perhaps most impressive, in response to a request by Governor Janklow \nfor volunteers to come to Spencer yesterday morning, again an estimated \n8,000 people showed up to volunteer in this small town. Governor \nJanklow originally asked for 1,000 volunteers.\n  The leaders of Spencer, South Dakota have continued their commitment \nand loyalty to their community all throughout the disaster. Mayor Rocky \nKirby, owner of the destroyed grain elevator, has spent day and night \ndealing with not only his own personal loss of his business but working \nwith Governor Janklow and FEMA officials to get their town back \ntogether.\n  City Council member Donna Ruden stayed up the entire first night \nputting together a map of the community with the names and locations of \nall citizens to assist Governor Janklow, the National Guard, and the \ncleanup crews. As an employee of the Security State Bank, which was \nalso destroyed with only the vault left standing, opened her home \nimmediately as a make-shift bank, a meeting place for citizens and \ntheir insurance companies and a place to stop and share their accounts \nof the storm. She placed a sign on her front door, ``please come in''.\n  The Red Cross and Salvation Army have done a remarkable job and I \nwould be remiss if I did not recognize these people.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I just want to again commend the victims \nfor their resilience and positive spirit in the wake of this tragedy. I \nalso want to assure them that in the coming weeks as the tv cameras and \nmedia leave and they are left to the day-to-day effort of rebuilding \ntheir lives, I will not forget about them. I am committed to working \nwith individuals and with the different federal agencies offering \nassistance to ensure aid comes when people need it and with as few \nbureaucratic strings attached as possible.\n  Again, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who \nlost their lives in this tragedy and my best wishes to all of the \nsurvivors during the next few critically important weeks as they take \nsteps to rebuild their lives.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Johnson, for drawing the attention of this body \nto the extraordinary tragedy in South Dakota. I think all of us were \nstunned to see those photos of this town, the town of Spencer, which \nwas just wiped out. It really is stunning to see the complete \ndevastation of that small town.\n  I remember seeing the press reports and seeing the pictures and being \nreminded of the devastation we suffered in North Dakota last year with \nthe 500-year flood, on top of the worst winter in history, the most \npowerful winter storm in 50 years, and in the middle of all that, the \nfires that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks, ND.\n  Our hearts go out to the people of South Dakota. Our hearts go out to \nthe people who have suffered this extraordinary tragedy, to those who \nlost their lives, to those whose lives have been disrupted forever. And \nI think it is important for them to know that those in this body on \nboth sides of the aisle will reach out and will help. We certainly saw \nthat in our tragedy, and we will never forget the assistance of our \ncolleagues. We want our friends in the South Dakota delegation to know \nthat we are prepared to help and to reach out and to be of assistance, \njust as they were of help to us in our disaster. So we want to say to \nour colleague, Senator Johnson, when you are back home talking to the \npeople who have suffered, they can count on this Federal Government to \nreach out and be there to help in their time of need, just as they were \nthere to help others when they were afflicted.\n  I also want to say to Senator Daschle, the other Senator from South \nDakota, obviously, those of us in the Dakotas have a special bond. We \nwill do everything we can to help as you go through this difficult \nprocess of rebuilding.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is interesting how each of our \nStates has experienced disasters in the last several years--you a 500-\nyear flood, we a 500-year flood, and now this devastating tornado. In \nApril, we have had four natural disasters in Georgia: a flood, an early \nfreeze wiping out the entire first peach crop, and three separate \ntornadoes. No matter how many times you experience it, the power of it \nis just mind-boggling. I remember years and years ago, on the eve of my \nhigh school graduation in Lee's Summit, MO, being hit by one of these \ntornadoes that leveled 700 homes to the foundation. I have never seen \nanything like it. It was like a bomb hit.\n  You are right. All of our colleagues have been so responsive, and it \nmakes an enormous difference when you are faced with that kind of \nsituation when neighbors and friends across the country are there to \nhelp. So I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from South Dakota and \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5668-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1415.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2433 (to Amendment No. 2420), to \n     modify the provisions relating to civil liability for tobacco \n     manufacturers.\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2434 (to Amendment No. 2433), in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n       Gramm motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance with instructions to report back forthwith, with \n     amendment No. 2436, to modify the provisions relating to \n     civil liability for tobacco manufacturers, and to eliminate \n     the marriage penalty reflected in the standard deduction and \n     to ensure the earned income credit takes into account the \n     elimination of such penalty.\n       Daschle (for Durbin) amendment No. 2437 (to amendment No. \n     2436), relating to reductions in underage tobacco usage.\n       Lott (for Coverdell) modified amendment No. 2451 (to \n     amendment No. 2437), to stop illegal drugs from entering the \n     United States, to provide additional resources to combat \n     illegal drugs, and to establish disincentives for teenagers \n     to use illegal drugs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2451\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are returning to the tobacco \nlegislation, by previous order, and specifically to the amendment that \nI introduced last evening along with Senator Craig of Idaho and Senator \nAbraham of Michigan, which is now commonly called the drug amendment.\n  To put this in context, Mr. President, the point that we are making \nis that you cannot talk about teen addiction and be silent on the No. 1 \nteen addiction problem, which is drug abuse. So the purpose of this \namendment is to make certain that any legislation being considered by \nthis Chamber about teen addiction and teen problems must also include a \ntitle to deal with the raging epidemic in our country--teenage drug \nabuse.\n  Mr. President, in the last 6\\1/2\\ years, teenage drug abuse has \nincreased by 135 percent. Well, what does that mean? Does that mean \nthat 10 more youngsters are using drugs than were 6 years ago? No. It \nmeans that almost 2 million teenagers are using drugs today that were \nnot 6\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  This is a massive problem and it is a consequence, unfortunately, of \naltered Federal policy. We decided early in this administration that \nthe battle against drug abuse would be altered, changed, downsized. The \ndrug office was virtually closed, interdiction facilities were \ndrastically reduced, the Coast Guard was diminished in the Caribbean, \nand we quit talking about the problem. Simultaneously, we entered into \nnew trade agreements with Mexico, which enormously increased the amount \nof travel between the two countries, upwards to 4 million vehicles now. \nSo that interdiction apparatus was down and the transportation across \nthe border was up, and we quit talking about the problem. Well, \nconsequently, massive amounts of new drugs came into the country, and \nbecause they were coming in such quantities, the price fell. So we had \na product that was everywhere, inexpensive, and very, very dangerous.\n  You can go into any school in the Nation and ask students and they \ncan tell you the name of all these designer drugs; they can tell you \nexactly where to buy them, and in most cases, it doesn't take over 30 \nminutes. As I have said, the price plummeted 50, 60, 70 percent. \nDropped interdiction, increased border crossings, flooded the market \nwith drugs, the price falls, and the targets are kids, age 8 to 14 \nyears of age. What happened? It doubled and almost tripled drug abuse \namong teenagers.\n  Today, in high schools across the country, one in four are using \ndrugs regularly. In junior high, it is 1 in 10. We now have almost 2 \nmillion more kids caught up in this lethal snare, drug abuse. To be \nspecific about the numbers, in 1979 at the peak of the last epidemic, \n14.1 percent of the entire teenage population ages 12 to 17 was using \ndrugs regularly. The Nation said we can't tolerate this. And from the \nPresident to the sheriff, the whole Nation began to fight this \nepidemic. And what happened?\n  By 1992, we had reduced drug use among this population by two-thirds. \nInstead of 3.3 million teenagers using drugs, we drove it down to 1 \nmillion. This is very important because it demonstrates that we can \ncorrect this problem. There are some in our society, and very powerful \npeople, who would like Americans to believe you can't do anything about \nthis. That is an utter absurdity. We have proven, and very recently, \nthat you can attack this problem and make a difference. But in 1992, as \nI said a moment ago, we quit talking about the problem. And so today, 2 \nmillion-plus are back using drugs regularly. It is a very, very \ndisturbing situation. It just sort of snuck up on us.\n  A lot of our parents are not talking to their children about this \nproblem, which is very unfortunate, because we know that if parents are \ntalking to their children about this issue, the odds of the children \nusing drugs are cut in half. It is cut in half. But if you went into a \nclassroom, and there are 100 students out there, and say, ``How many of \nyou talk to your parents about this problem?'' you would be lucky if 10\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nheld up their hands. There is just not that interplay, which explains a \nlittle bit here this recent survey. It is most interesting. Forty-three \npercent of parents believe their teens could find marijuana easily. \nSixty percent of the teenagers said it is easy to find. Thirty-three \npercent of the parents thought their children viewed marijuana as \nharmful. But only 18 percent of the kids thought it was harmful. It is \njust a complete disconnect going on here. Forty-five percent of parents \nfelt teens had a friend who smoked marijuana. But if you ask the kids, \n71 percent know somebody smoking marijuana. It is just a total \ndisconnect.\n  So one of the purposes and reasons of this amendment is to assert \nFederal policy, bold Federal policy that attacks this drug epidemic at \nevery level--at the border, in our communities, in our law enforcement \nagencies--everybody. It substantially increases funding for \ninterdiction and for education, and it attacks it at every level. If \nthis is put into play, within 24 months there will not be a poll that \nhas 21 percent thinking their teenage children knew someone who \nexperimented with marijuana while 44 percent of the teens said they \nactually had. This disconnect will be ended in America, and you will \nbegin to drive the numbers of teenagers using drugs down. But not if we \nbring a major bill about teenage addiction to the Senate and before the \nAmerican public and never mention drugs and just totally be silent on \nit as if that is not a problem.\n  Teenage drug abuse is the No. 1 teenage problem. It is No. 1. Myself, \nmy colleague from Idaho, and my colleague from Michigan felt this \nalmost is damaging if it is so much focused on teenage smoking, which \nis a problem, but it is a fourth problem. The first one is teenage \ndrugs. So you would almost be saying, ``Look, we are accomplishing \nsomething here,'' and looking completely away from the fact that we are \nin the midst today in this country of one of the most singular alarming \nepidemics we have ever faced: teenage drug abuse.\n  I am going to yield, because I see the Senator from North Dakota is \nprepared to talk here in a minute on the bill.\n  But one of the saddest things about this whole teenage drug abuse \nepidemic is that in the last epidemic, in the 1960s and 1970s, most of \nthose teenagers were 16 to 20 in age. Now they are 8 to 14. The cartels \nhave focused. We talked about tobacco focusing on teenagers. It is an \nunconscionable policy. But the narcotic cartels are totally focused on \na young teenage market 8 to 14, as vulnerable a market as could be.\n  We will pay an unbelievable price--and are--if we do not attack this \nproblem forcefully with the Nation's will, and boldly; not deja vu, \njust another day. We have to turn this thing around.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to speak on a number of \nsubjects this morning. I am going to talk about a Web site contest that \nI sponsored in North Dakota on this question of tobacco. I am going to \ntalk about the marriage penalty debate that we have ongoing. Then I am \ngoing to file a cloture motion on behalf of the leader.\n  First of all, I want to say to my colleague from Georgia that there \nare some of us who agree that dealing with drugs as part of this \nlegislation makes some sense. We hope we are able to work together and \nsee if we can't find a formula that works so it can be included here. \nWe know there are others who do not think it is appropriate to include \nit here, and we respect their views. But some of us do believe it is \nappropriate to deal with the question of other drugs in this bill. \nHopefully, we can find a way to be successful at the end of the day. \nThere is no question that it is a serious problem, just as tobacco is a \nserious problem that imposes enormous health and financial costs on \nsociety. Illegal drug use is also creating enormous difficulties.\n  When we are in Washington, my wife and I live eight blocks from the \nCapitol. From the steps of the Capitol, we can look right down the \nstreet that leads to the house we live in here in Washington. In 1991, \nmy wife was abducted at gunpoint by a crack addict. I tell you, I will \nnever forget the trauma it caused our family. It is an epidemic in many \nparts of our country. I am proud to say it is not an epidemic in North \nDakota, but even there we have a problem.\n  I think all of us who are serious about improving the lives of people \nwe represent want to address this problem in this bill if we possibly \ncan. So I thank the Senator from Georgia for the effort he has made.\n  Mr. President, I sponsored a Web site contest for kids from my State \non the question of tobacco use. I asked them to create electronic \npages, or electronic posters, to help spread the word that tobacco use \ncauses problems. We just had an outpouring of kids from around the \nState who entered the contest. One of the winners was Justin Grueneich \nof Ellendale, ND. His Web site said, ``Smoke Is No Joke.'' He is right. \nHis Web site was packed with statistics and information.\n  One of the things that impressed us was, we found there was more \ninformation there than we have heard on the Senate floor. He actually \nfound facts that we haven't heard in the debate on the Senate floor.\n  So Justin did a superb job.\n  Another person who did excellent work was Anne Erickson, a senior at \nCavalier High School. She was very creative. Her graphic design was \ngreat, and her messages were right on target. She wrote, ``To smoke or \nnot to smoke, there is no question.'' She also posted that in addition \nto being unhealthy, smoking was also unattractive.\n  As we know, the tobacco industry has tried to present smoking as cool \nand attractive and sophisticated. She wasn't buying it.\n  So thank you, Anne, for seeing through those advertising gimmicks by \nthe industry.\n  Six fifth graders from Dakota School in Minot joined forces and \ncreated a Web site they called ``The Healthiest Web Site in North \nDakota.''\n  Congratulations to Cierra Bails, Christina Leyrer, Mikey Perron, Jr., \nNicole Rogers, Jessica Sarty, and Nicki Taylor for their excellent \nwork.\n  These fifth graders designed a colorful and informative Web page that \nincluded links to North Dakota facts and laws on tobacco. They did \nreally a great job in reminding kids that buying tobacco is illegal and \nit is unhealthy.\n  Now, younger students also entered the contest and published \nelectronic posters on the Internet. I brought some of them here to the \nfloor to share with my colleagues today. These are from third graders \nat North Hill Elementary School in Minot, ND. These are very young \nchildren, some as young as 7 years old. This one was done by Annie \nKirchofner. It has a very simple message. Fruit is healthy, yes to \ngrapes and apples, no to cigarettes. That is Annie Kirchofner.\n  Devin Blowers doesn't think that smoking is cool. He says, ``Smoking \nis bad for you. Be cool. Don't smoke.'' And then he has down here this \nalligator figure. I guess this is his alternative to Joe Camel, and he \nhas sunglasses on the top of his head here and he says ``Yuk'' to \ntobacco.\n  That is pretty good for 7- and 8-year-old kids. They certainly have \nthe message.\n  Courtney Sluke, another third grader, produced this poster: ``Do not \nsmoke.'' She is saying to her friend, ``Hey, you should not smoke.'' \nAgain, a third grade student from Minot, ND.\n  The next was Nicole Belgarde. She had a very interesting message. She \nsays, ``Don't always take the advice off T.V.'' That is a pretty good \nmessage. She realizes. Here is the television and it is sending the \nmessage that ``Smoking is cool.'' And a fellow youngster is picking up \nthat message saying ``Smoking is cool'' and she is countering it \nsaying, ``No, smoking is not cool.''\n  Alex Deck gets right to the point. He says, ``Smoking is bad.'' He \nhas the universal symbol here, the crossing out of the cigarette, and \nhe has this little figure who is chanting ``Smoking is bad.''\n  Bryan Moe, he also was able to get right to the heart of it. He says, \n``Don't smoke cause you might die.'' He put the victim right in his \ndeathbed. He was on top of this. And he has X's for his eyes. Pretty \ntough message. If you smoke, you die. That poor victim is right on his \ndeathbed.\n  The first place winner--the first place winner is Amanda Roise. She\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nshows that price does matter. I really like very much what she did.\n  Now, remember, these are 7- or 8-year-old children who designed \nthese. And these are electronic posters. It is just amazing; these kids \nposted them on the Internet after we had a call statewide: Send us your \nideas. And really we got a tremendous response from all around the \nState.\n  Her theme is, ``Don't waste your money on cigarettes.'' And here they \nhave a price of $2.95 and a customer saying, ``I don't have enough.'' \nAnd here is a sign ``Don't do drug.'' She ran out of room so she put \nthe ``S'' down here. ``Don't do drugs.'' And it is a store, obviously, \nand one of my favorites is she has excellent coloring, wonderful \ncoloring. These are Cheerios boxes, and I like to eat my Cheerios every \nmorning, so I thought this was especially good. Amanda Roise, the first \nplace winner in our contest for electronic posters.\n  Congratulations to all of the winners and all of the contestants. We \nare going to be having fun with this when we go back home presenting \nthe awards to not only these very young children but older ones as well \nwho participated in this web site contest. Gee, we have had so much fun \nwith this. I can tell you, we had a number of distinguished judges make \nthe determinations, and my thanks to them as well.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to direct my main remarks this morning to the \nquestion of the marriage penalty because that has become an important \npart of the debate here as to what alternative we ought to pursue in \naddressing the marriage penalty. I thought it might be helpful to \ndiscuss for a moment what the marriage penalty is, who is really being \nhurt by it, and what we could do to address it in some rational way.\n  Let's put up the first chart that shows the question of who really is \nfacing the marriage penalty. This is according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, and it shows that 51 percent of noncorporate filers in \nthis country are singles. So, of course, they don't face the marriage \npenalty. Of all the noncorporate filers, 51 percent are single people. \nThey don't have a problem with the marriage penalty. And 3.5 percent \nare joint returns that are unaffected by the so-called marriage \npenalty, so we don't need to focus on them.\n\n  Then when you look at the rest, what you find is that 24.5 percent, \nin fact, face the marriage penalty; that is, they pay more taxes \nbecause they are married than if they were filing separately. \nInterestingly enough, 21 percent get a bonus by being married; that is, \nthey pay less by being married than they would pay if they filed \nseparately as single individuals.\n  I want to indicate that the Democratic alternative to the Gramm \namendment focuses its relief on those taxpayers who are actually being \npenalized. That seems to make sense. Unfortunately, Senator Gramm's \noffering deals not only with those who are actually being penalized but \nhe also gives relief to those who are getting a bonus. I am not quite \nsure what logic there is to that, but that is, in fact, what the \namendment of the Senator from Texas would do, and as a result there are \ninsufficient resources to help those who are really hurt by the \nmarriage penalty. What sense that makes escapes this Senator.\n  What we have done is instead of diluting the relief that would go to \ncouples paying a marriage penalty, we focus on those who are paying the \nmarriage penalty. It seems to me that tax fairness would require that \nmarried couples with equal incomes ought to be taxed equally. That \nseems to be a basic kind of concept, one that makes common sense.\n  The Democratic alternative recognizes, as did the Congress in 1981 \nwhen it enacted the Kemp-Roth tax cuts, that to eliminate or reduce the \nmarriage penalty, it is necessary to draw a distinction between one-\nearner and two-earner couples. As in 1981, the most efficient way to \nprovide relief to couples who are incurring a marriage penalty is to \nallow a percentage of the earned income of the spouse with the lower \nearnings to be, in effect, free from income tax. Because the \nalternative offered by the Democrats is targeted on low- and moderate-\nincome couples, we can make this two-earner deduction more generous \nthan the one that was enacted in 1981. At that time, they provided the \n10-percent deduction. Our alternative, when fully phased in, will \nprovide a 20-percent deduction from the lower earner's income. This \nrepresents a much more potent assault on the marriage penalty than \neither the 1981 provision or the proposal offered by the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Let me direct my attention for a moment to the proposal of the \nSenator from Texas. His proposal is a one-size-fits-all approach that \nscatters the modest relief that it provides to all joint filers, \nwhether they actually incur a marriage penalty or not. He gives it to \nthose who have a bonus from being married instead of focusing on those \nwho actually are penalized by being married. As a result, he gives much \nless help to those who actually are paying a penalty. Again, the logic \nof his approach I do not think holds up under scrutiny.\n  In fairness, there is marriage penalty relief in the Gramm proposal, \nbut there is also a considerable tax cut for people who are already \ngetting a marriage bonus. I just do not think that makes sense. The \nSenator from Texas would spend about half of the revenue he is all too \nwilling to take away from health research and public health efforts in \norder to spend the money on tax relief for people who already enjoy an \nadvantage under the system and, in the process, shortchanges the \ncouples who are actually being penalized.\n\n  The next chart demonstrates the weakness of the Gramm approach in \ncomparison to what we are offering. This looks at the alternative that \nwe are proposing on the Democratic side to cut the marriage tax penalty \nmore than the Gramm proposal does for most families. This would be in \n2002, when fully phased in. The first example is for a couple earning \n$35,000 a year, split, with one member of the couple getting $20,000 a \nyear of income and the other, $15,000 a year of income. The Gramm \namendment would provide a tax deduction of $1,650. Our proposal would \nprovide a deduction of $3,000--far more generous, because it makes much \nmore sense, in order to provide actual relief to those who are being \npenalized by the marriage penalty.\n  The second alternative is a couple earning $50,000, evenly split \nbetween the two. Again, the Gramm amendment, the one-size-fits-all \napproach, gives a deduction of $1,650. That doesn't really make much \nsense because, again, he is conferring benefits not only on those who \nare being penalized by the marriage penalty but he is conferring \nbenefits on those who are already getting a bonus, those who are being \ngiven favorable treatment. He treats them all alike. Those who are \nhelped, those who are hurt--he treats them all alike. We say you ought \nto focus the resources you have on those who are hurt, so we say a \n$5,000 tax deduction for that couple who has $50,000 a year of income, \nevenly split between the two.\n  By the way, this is precisely the situation in which the largest \nmarriage penalties occur, yet Senator Gramm treats them the same way as \nthe others. And, in addition, he is giving that same benefit to couples \nwho are actually advantaged by being married because of their tax \ncircumstances under the current Tax Code. Again, the Gramm approach \njust does not stand up under much scrutiny.\n  I think if we analyze what has happened here, the fact is that we \nknow who the taxpayers are who face a marriage penalty and we know that \nsome penalties are harsher than others. Why should we opt for an \napproach that treats everybody the same, especially when it is \nsubstantially more expensive than a tailored approach that responds to \nthe marriage penalty in a proportional way on a couple-by-couple basis?\n  Senator Gramm calls our approach a figleaf. I think moderate-income \nfamilies who are struggling on two incomes would welcome our figleaf \nwhen they compare it with the pine needle the Senator from Texas would \nprovide. The fact is, ours is far more generous to those who are \nactually experiencing a marriage penalty. If we are going to call it \nmarriage penalty relief, we ought to target it to those who are \nactually facing a marriage penalty.\n  I think it is also important to say that when the Senator from Texas \nasserts that this bill which is moving through Congress is regressive \nand imposes a harsh penalty on those who are\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nat the lowest end of the income continuum in this country, that there \nis another side to the story that he is not telling. The fact is, \nsmoking is a huge tax on low-income Americans. An average pack-a-day \nsmoker will spend more than $25,000 on cigarettes over his lifetime. An \naverage pack-a-day smoker will have an additional $20,000 in medical \ncosts over his or her lifetime. And the average low-income American, \nboth smokers and nonsmokers, will pay his or her share of the $4.7 \ntrillion in costs that smoking will impose on society over the next 25 \nyears. That is something that has been left out completely by the \ndiscussion of the Senator from Texas.\n  He talks a lot about tax increases, but he does not mention the \nhidden tax that is being imposed on members of this society every year: \n$130 billion that this industry is imposing in costs on society--$60 \nbillion in health costs, $60 billion in lost productivity, and $10 \nbillion in other costs. The fact is, low-income workers' payroll taxes \nare paying for about $18 billion a year in Medicare costs; low-income \nworkers' income taxes are paying for about $12 billion a year in \nMedicaid costs. Those are hidden taxes that low-income people are \npaying each and every year because of the costs being imposed by the \ntobacco industry in this society. The fact is, low-income workers are \nalso paying higher health insurance costs and getting lower wages as a \nresult of the costs to our health care system of smoking.\n  Again, let me stress the bottom line: $4.7 trillion in costs being \nimposed on this society over the next 25 years. The biggest tax cut \nthat we could give low-income Americans is to reduce that cost. The \nMcCain bill will cut smoking by about a third. That would produce \nsavings of about $1.6 trillion for this society from the $4.7 trillion \nprice tag imposed on us by the tobacco industry. That is the smart way \nof helping low-income Americans. Obviously, when we couple that with \nthe proposal of the Democrats to focus on the marriage penalty, not to \nbe giving the same treatment to those whether they are hurt or helped \nby the current tax system, we have a potent combination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan analysis by the Congressional Budget Office describing what causes \nthe marriage penalty and what causes the marriage bonus, so people \nmight see how it comes about, the situations in which people are \nadversely affected by the marriage penalty, and how others benefit by \nbeing married and actually pay less taxes than they would pay if they \nwere filing as singles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTABLE 3.--FACTORS DETERMINING WHETHER COUPLES FACE MARRIAGE PENALTIES OR\n                              BONUSES, 1996                             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Conditions leading    Conditions leading \n  Tax parameter or feature     to marriage penalty    to marriage bonus \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPersonal Exemptions ($2,550   None................

I thank my colleague from Georgia for his indulgence and \nhis patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suspect this most recent cloture \nmotion has the potential of engendering some controversy. It puts into \nrather tenuous circumstances the amendment we are discussing, because \nif we cannot vote--if cloture were secured, this amendment would not be \nin order, along with a number of other very core components of the \ndebate about this very contentious legislation. So I hope that is being \nthought through very carefully by all parties concerned, that this is a \nvery significant piece of legislation that has an enormous effect on \nour country and there are some very important amendments that cloture \ncould arbitrarily remove from the debate.\n  I will leave that to the leadership and another day.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2451\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, returning to my amendment for a few \nminutes--I see Senator Graham has been waiting--I will take a couple of \nminutes and then yield the floor. But I want to reiterate the \nimportance of this amendment that puts teenage drug addiction in the \nmix.\n  I have said repeatedly throughout the debate that I think it is \nunconscionable policy to be talking to the country about teenage \naddiction and skip the No. 1 problem of teenage addiction, which is \ndrug abuse. It almost is an extension of the silence that we have \nwitnessed over the last several years about this problem. This Senator \ndoes not intend to allow that silence to occur here. In other words, \nthe idea being we will pass a bill that deals with teenage smoking and \nsomehow will have comfortably addressed teenage addiction problems is \nthe wrong message. It certainly should be part of the message that we \nare dealing with teenage smoking, but we cannot--I repeat--cannot \nignore the teenage drug issue which is, of course, related to smoking.\n  I point out here, someone who smokes marijuana regularly may have \nmany of the same respiratory problems that tobacco smokers have. These \nkids may have daily cough and phlegm, symptoms of chronic bronchitis \nand more frequent chest colds. Continuing to smoke marijuana can lead \nto abnormal functioning of lung tissue injured or destroyed by \nmarijuana smoke. Regardless of the THC content, the amount of tar \ninhaled by marijuana smokers and the level of carbon monoxide absorbed \nare three to five times greater than among tobacco smokers. This may be \ndue to marijuana users inhaling more deeply and holding the smoke in \nthe lungs.\n  A very large component of teenage drug abuse is directly related to \nthe smoking of the most prominent drug abused by teenagers, which is \nmarijuana. When they smoke marijuana, the effects and damage are far \ngreater.\n  Again, I reiterate, as I will repeatedly, you cannot talk about \nteenage addiction without the two. You have to talk about teenage \nsmoking of tobacco, but you cannot be silent on the smoking of \nmarijuana or the other drug-related abuses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I look forward at the appropriate time to \ndiscuss the amendment of the Senator from Georgia because I agree with \nhis premise that there is a relationship between tobacco smoking and \nthe use of drugs. I have spent a great deal of my time in public office \ntrying to increase our ability to deal with illicit use of drugs, both \nin terms of effective enforcement at all levels of government and those \nthings that will reduce the likelihood of persons desiring to use \ndrugs.\n  Let me say the most fundamental relationship between the tobacco \nissue that we debate today and the amendment of the Senator from \nGeorgia is that virtually no one starts with the use of illicit drugs. \nTobacco is the gateway to the use of illicit drugs. So our ability, by \neffective legislation or otherwise, to substantially reduce the number \nof persons who commence the process of experimentation, use and then \naddiction to tobacco will make one of, if not the most, fundamental \ncontributions to the reduction of the use of illicit hard drugs. That \nis an issue that we will have an opportunity to discuss in more detail \nlater.\n\n  My concern today is a series of ads that are being run, ads that are \nbeing run either under the specific sponsorship of the tobacco industry \nor by organizations which we know are supported by the tobacco \nindustry.\n  Typical of these ads is one in which there is a lady, a waitress who \nis looking into a television camera and is stating how much her cost of \nsmoking will increase if legislation such as that proposed by the \nSenate Commerce Committee were to become the law.\n  There are other ads that make the same point through other appealing \nmessages. There is a fundamental error in those ads. There is a \nfundamental deception. There is the latest example of the manipulation \nfor which this industry has become so well known. What is that error? \nWhat is that fraud? What is that manipulation? It is the assumption \nthat the status quo is an option. It is the assumption that we can roll \nback the events of the last several years and go back to 1970 and \neverything will be as it was then; that that lady in the ad will not be \nthreatened with the possibility of higher prices for her cigarettes.\n  The fact is that the status quo is not an option. There are two basic \noptions that are before us as we continue this debate, and I think that \nit is important that we reassert what our real alternatives are.\n  Our alternatives are either comprehensive, and I believe as Senator \nChafee and Senator Harkin and I have believed for many months, that it \nalso must be bipartisan, health-oriented national legislation. That is \none alternative.\n  The other alternative is not the status quo. The other alternative is \na continuation of the pattern of State-by-State litigation, a pattern \nwhich has already increased the price of cigarettes in America between \n17 to 20 cents per pack to pay for the settlements that have been \nreached thus far in only four States--Mississippi, Florida, Texas and \nMinnesota.\n  It is projected that if the increase in cigarettes that will be a \nresult of the other 46 States successfully pursuing litigation against \nthe tobacco industry is at the same per capita level as these first \nfour States, Mr. President, that the cost per pack will go up by an \nadditional dollar or to a level higher than that which is being \nproposed by the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  So the option that we have is not one of whether there is going to be \nan increase in the price of cigarettes; the question is whether it will \ncome through a comprehensive, bipartisan, health-oriented national \nlegislation, or whether it will come by a series of State-by-State \nlitigations augmented by the kinds of litigations that are now being \nbrought by Blue Cross-Blue Shield as an example of insurance carrier \nlitigation, being brought by labor unions on behalf of their members \nand, Mr. President, I believe eventually will be brought by the Federal \nGovernment to secure its appropriate compensation for the additional \ncost that it has paid for tobacco-related illnesses through programs \nsuch as Medicare, the Veterans' Administration, CHAMPUS--the health \ncare program for military personnel and their dependents--and a variety \nof other programs in which the Federal Government is either the total \nor a substantial contributor to their financing.\n  The choice is either we do this through comprehensive, bipartisan, \nhealth-oriented national legislation, or it occurs on a State-by-State, \nlitigation-by-litigation basis.\n  My personal feeling is that by every criteria that we have used to \nassess what is the public interest, that the public interest would be \nbetter served by a comprehensive, bipartisan, health-oriented national \nlegislation.\n  What are some of those interests? Our most fundamental interest, the \nissue that has brought us here today and for the last several days and \nwill for several more to come, has been our concern over teenage \nsmoking. We know that every day 3,000 American youth, under the age of \n18, commence the process that will eventually lead to the regular use \nof tobacco. We know that of that 3,000, that a third--1,000--will \nbecome so addicted to tobacco that they will die, that they will die \nprematurely of a tobacco-related affliction.\n  That is the fundamental objective of this legislation, to reduce this \nunnecessary carnage of America's youth and adult population because of \nthe continuation of a youthful introduction to tobacco.\n  Which of the two approaches is most likely to achieve the objective \nof reducing youth smoking? We know some things, Mr. President, as to \nwhat is the effective combination of initiatives. We know that the most \neffective plan will be a broad-based, comprehensive public health-\noriented plan. It will include items such as the funding of smoking \ncessation programs and the funding of education programs on the \nconsequences of the use of tobacco. It will include limitations on \nmarketing and promotion. It will include penalties against the industry \nand individual companies which fail to meet national standards for the \nreduction of teenage smoking. It will include, and probably most \nsignificantly, a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes, \nbecause it is that increase in price that will have the greatest \ndeterrent effect on the use of cigarettes.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that in the initial \nstages of an increase in price, that for every 10-percent increase in \nprice, there is a 7-percent reduction in use. Those relationships begin \nto change as you reach higher levels of price increases. But the \nlegislation that the Senator from Arizona has presented to us is \nprojected to have, by the price alone, a reduction in teenage use of in \nthe range of 40 to 50 percent.\n  It is also important, Mr. President, that that price be instituted on \na shock basis. If the price increase is gradual, incremental, drop by \ndrop, then it is more likely to be absorbed, become the norm, and set \nthe foundation for acceptance of the next increase. But if that price \nincrease is dramatic--is imposed quickly--it will have the greatest \naffect in terms of achieving our objective of reducing teenage smoking.\n  It is obvious that on all of those counts, comprehensive, bipartisan, \npublic health-oriented national legislation will better achieve our \nobjective of reducing teenage smoking than will the pattern of State by \nState, litigant by litigant courtroom action that will be the \nalternative to a national, comprehensive, bipartisan public health-\noriented resolution of this issue.\n  On the standard of enforcement, much is made in these ads that the \ntobacco industry is promoting that there will be a burgeoning of black-\nmarket sales if there is a substantial increase in the price. The fact \nis that by a legislative settlement--which among other things will \nprovide the funds for those areas of enhanced enforcement that may be \nnecessary, a national settlement that can contain provisions for \nstrengthening our enforcement, a national settlement that will result \nin less variation State to State in terms of the price of cigarettes, \nand therefore less likelihood of black-market sales domestically within \nthe United States--that a national legislative settlement will reduce \nthe potential of black-market activities to a substantially greater \ndegree than the alternative of State-by-State litigation.\n\n  We also know that, on the issue of tobacco farmers, there is great \nrecognition of the necessity to provide some\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\ntransition. That transition is contained in every serious piece of \nlegislation that has been introduced in the national Congress.\n  There will be a debate over which of those alternatives is preferred, \nbut the fact that it is a recognized part of a national, comprehensive, \nbipartisan health-oriented tobacco resolution is unanimously agreed to. \nBut, Mr. President, that has not been included in the State-by-State \nsettlements, and will not likely be included. Only a relatively small \nnumber of States are directly affected by the issue of tobacco farmers \nand, therefore, could not be expected to include, in their settlements \nwith the tobacco industry, funding for tobacco farmers.\n  If there is going to be a transition, it has to be done at the \nnational level, not at a State-by-State level. So the interest of that \nconstituency and that important part of this overall complex issue will \nbe much better served by national legislation than they will be by a \nState-by-State settlement.\n  Finally, having a rational distribution of the funds, yes, this is \ngoing to raise a substantial amount of money. It may raise more money \non the State-by-State basis, it may impose higher costs on the \nindustry, and eventually on the users of this product than national \nlegislation, but in either event there will be a substantial amount of \nfunds raised by either national legislation or by State-by-State \nlitigation. But it is at the national level that we will have a better \nlikelihood of being able to allocate the funds to important programs, \nsuch as research in our national health institutes so that we will \nlearn more about the consequences of past tobacco use and an effective \nmeans of avoiding such use in the future.\n  It is less likely that the States will be equitably treated through a \nseries of State-by-State matters as opposed to doing it on a national \nbasis. There will not be the funds likely to be available for effective \ncounteradvertising, which will require a national program just as the \nnational program that the Federal Government is now underwriting as it \nrelates to advertising against the use of illicit drugs.\n  So, Mr. President, based on our principal objective, which is the \nreduction of youth smoking, and other important subissues of this \ncurrent effort, including appropriate use of the funds, enforcement \nagainst black marketing, the effect on tobacco farmers, it is much more \nlikely that we will achieve our objectives through a national \nlegislative settlement than what is the real alternative, which is for \nus to do nothing and then allow the course of action which is already \nin place, State by State, private, soon to be, I hope, Federal \nlitigation against the tobacco industries to be the alternative.\n  So, Mr. President, as we conclude this week's debate, I hope as we \nreturn next week we will be prepared to focus on what the real options \nare and get the business of America done and stop the carnage of \nAmerican children that is resulting every hour we delay in this effort \nto mitigate the carnage of American youth that occurs as they take up \nthe use of tobacco.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Jason Westin of my \nstaff be allowed floor privileges for the remainder of the \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a question? I compliment the \nSenator on his outstanding statement and thank him for all of his \ndiligence and hard work on the whole issue of cutting down on teen \nsmoking. I know the Senator from Florida has made that one of his key \nprinciples, which is in this bill. Really, the essence of this bill is \nto cut down on teen smoking. I appreciate all of the work he has done, \nand with Senator Chafee and with me on this.\n  I know Senator Chafee will be speaking next. We hope to engage in \nsome colloquy here on the Senate floor to talk about some of the issues \nthat have come up that are extraneous--important issues, but extraneous \nto the bill.\n  I just want to basically ask the Senator from Florida--before I know \nSenator Chafee will make his opening statement--about that aspect, \nabout the other issues that seem to be coming up on this bill and \nwhether or not we could address those later on and just keep the focus \non the main issue here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator, I agree with your statement. We have one \nprincipal objective with this legislation, and that is to reduce \nteenage smoking, to reduce this unconscionable level of death and \ndamage that is inflicted upon our young people by their early addiction \nto tobacco.\n  There are other issues that are being suggested--from reforming the \ntax law to an enhanced enforcement effort against illicit drugs--which \nare all important issues, and many of us have supported and advocated \nand led the charge on those issues on other days and in other forums.\n  Our concern is--and I will not impugn the motives of any of the \nadvocates of those other provisions--that some outside, and maybe a few \ninside, this Chamber would be pleased at the objection of these \n``tantalizing but extraneous issues'' because they would see them as a \nmeans of delay, obfuscation, and, eventually, defeat of comprehensive \nnational legislation.\n  What stuns me is that they don't also see what the alternative is. \nThe alternative is not that defeat here will mean the American public \nwill throw up its hands and say, ``I guess we have to accept the fact \nthat 125 American young people will take up smoking every hour of every \nday of the 365 days of the year.'' That will not be the alternative. \nThe alternative will be that the American public, having disdained of \nour ability to deal with this problem, will go to their States, will go \nto their labor unions, will urge their insurance carriers to enter the \nfray, as they have in other States, and we will have a 50-State \nshootout in the courts on this issue.\n  We will move toward our objective, but not nearly as effectively as \nif we accept the responsibility and the opportunity to probably make \nthe greatest contribution to the enhancement of public health of \nAmericans that has occurred in this century by the adoption of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, over the past several days it seems to me \nthat the Senate debate on the tobacco bill has taken a very unfortunate \nturn. It is a turn away from what I strongly believe are the purposes \nand objectives of the legislation. I want to remind my colleagues that \nthe very name of the bill that we are dealing with is the National \nTobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. I want to accent the \n``Youth Smoking Reduction Act'' portion of the title.\n  Now, the purpose of this tobacco legislation is to fundamentally \nchange the way tobacco products are marketed and sold in this country. \nClearly, there is an epidemic sweeping the Nation. That is the rapid \ngrowth of teenage smoking and tobacco use. The Centers for Disease \nControl, as has been said many times on the floor, estimates that every \nday 3,000 young American children, teenagers, take up smoking and that \none-third of these 3,000 will die prematurely because of smoking-\nrelated diseases.\n  Thus, if you multiply that out, it is a million children a year, a \nmillion young American children under the age of 18, who join the ranks \nof adult smokers, and more than 300,000 of them will die prematurely. \nOver a 25-year period, that amounts to 8 million Americans dying early \nbecause of smoking. That is more Americans than were lost in all the \nmajor wars that our Nation has been involved with.\n\n  As has been pointed out also frequently, tobacco use is the largest \npreventable cause of death in America today. In other words, if we want \nto look where can we do something about preventing deaths in our \ncountry, and should we tackle alcohol or should we tackle accidents or \nshould we deal with illegal drugs or automobile accidents--yes, all of \nthose are important, but none of them compares with the reduction in \nfatalities that would occur if we could eliminate smoking among the \nyoung people.\n  The statistics are chilling. Tobacco-related deaths are four times \nthe number of Americans who die every year from alcohol-related deaths. \nTobacco-related deaths kill 9 times the number who die from accidental \ndeaths and 44 times the number of Americans who die from illegal drugs. \nIn America\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nalone, 419,000 deaths occur as a result of tobacco-related illnesses, \ndiseases. Nearly half a million every year in our country die from \ntobacco-related diseases.\n  So, obviously, the way to prevent and discourage young people from \ntaking up tobacco is in the beginning and doing all we can to encourage \nadults to cease smoking.\n  Some of the amendments before us would take us far afield from that \npurpose. In other words, the objective of the exercise is to reduce \nteenage smoking, prevent it if possible, and to encourage adults to \ngive up smoking. But these amendments we have before the Senate now go \nfar afield from that.\n  Let me begin with the drug amendment currently pending. This \namendment would take $3 billion annually out of this bill to combat \nillegal drugs, which means we will have $3 billion less per year \navailable for the war on tobacco. Now, we already have a war on drugs, \nand we are spending billions of dollars every year to combat the \nserious problems of illegal drugs. This may be a meritorious amendment. \nMaybe we should spent $3 billion more fighting drugs. But this isn't \nthe place to do it. If there is an antidrug amendment to be brought up, \nbring it up as a freestanding amendment. See if the money is there \nsomewhere to fund this initiative. If it is all that important, let's \nfind the money for it. But it doesn't belong on this bill.\n  Now, the next one, Mr. President, the marriage penalty tax relief \nproposal. Now, maybe that is a good proposal, but it has no place in \nthis legislation. Correcting a bias in the Tax Code may make sense, but \nnot on this bill. As the fiscal year 1999 budget process advances, we \nwill have a chance to consider the marriage penalty. Indeed, the Senate \nbudget resolution which we adopted here has $30 billion provided for \ntax cuts. That is the place where marriage penalties should go if it is \nthat important. The budget resolution reported from the House Budget \nCommittee calls for $100 billion in tax cuts. There is ample \nopportunity to do something about tax cuts and the marriage penalty.\n  Now, I know one of the arguments for doing a tax cut in this bill is, \nit is enunciated they want to return some of the money that will be \npaid in the form of higher cigarette prices paid by smokers. It is said \nthat the great majority of smokers are in the low-income or the middle-\nincome group and that we ought to do something for them. Somehow that \nhas a twist to it that isn't really sensible. I reject the argument \nthat these individuals somehow need to be reimbursed. The fact is, \nbecause of the smoking of individuals in America, we all are paying \nvastly higher taxes than we ever would otherwise. We are paying higher \nMedicare costs, we are paying higher Medicaid costs, we are paying \nhigher private health insurance premiums, because smokers insist on \nsmoking, and they are the ones in whom, unfortunately, so many smoking-\nrelated illnesses occur.\n  The fact of the matter is, smoking is a hidden tax on all taxpayers. \nThe direct medical costs of treating smoking-related illnesses exceed \n$60 billion a year. We are all paying that--higher premiums on our \nhealth insurance, as I mentioned before. The current Federal excise tax \non cigarettes does not begin to approach offsetting these additional \ncosts. Thus, in my judgment, it is perfectly proper that smokers pay \nmore than they are currently paying in taxes on cigarettes.\n  Now, let me conclude by making a simple point. Here, the original \nMcCain bill provided an increase in revenues of $65 billion. How is \nthat money to be spent?\n  It was to be spent with $26 billion going to the States. This is over \n5 years--$26 billion to the States. NIH is to get $14 billion plus. In \nother words, cessation and prevention programs were to receive $14 \nbillion. Agriculture, $10 billion over 5 years. This is the total; it \ncomes to $65 billion.\n  But now what is happening, Mr. President, is a whole series of things \nhave been added on. Yes, the States stay at $26 billion. In comes \nillegal drugs, $15 billion, and marriage penalty, $15 billion. \nVeterans--we adopted that already--is at $3 billion, agriculture at $18 \nbillion, public health at $14 billion, and NIH at $14 billion. In other \nwords, the spending equalling the revenue--the revenue being $65 \nbillion over 5 years, and suddenly it is up to $105 billion. Obviously, \nthe traffic can't bear that. That is not what the taxes are going to \nproduce. So something has to give.\n  Mr. President, I remember this: There is a strong constituency for \nthe States. Oh, yes, they want their money. The marriage penalty is \nvery enticing and veterans has already been adopted. In agriculture, \nthere is a strong constituency. What is going to fall out is the NIH \nand the public health programs.\n  Mr. President, I think that is terribly unfortunate. And we see here \nwhat is going to lose. When we talk about health-related programs, we \nare talking not only about NIH, which is a separate thing, but there \nare cessation, prevention/education, counteradvertising, antismuggling, \nand youth access restrictions. Those are the things that are so \nimportant if we are truly concerned with reducing smoking amongst our \nyoung people, as the very name of this legislation provides. These are \nthe things that will go out if we adopt these other proposals, \nattractive though they may be, for marriage penalty and antidrug \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, the point is there won't be resources for these \nprograms that are so important. So I don't think that is where we want \nto be at the end of the day. I don't think we want to end up with these \nprograms losing out because we have adopted the others. If the others \nare all that important--the antidrug provisions, illegal drugs, the \nmarriage penalty relief--there will be a chance at another time to \naddress those. But in this legislation let's stick with the objective, \nwhich is to reduce teenage smoking, prevent it from occurring in the \nbeginning, and do all we can to encourage those who are smokers to give \nup that unfortunate habit.\n  So for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the antidrug and \nthe tax cut amendments. They are not about tobacco; they should not be \nin this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I listened with great interest to the \ncomments of the Senator from Rhode Island about these two amendments. I \nurge him to think about the end game and not just look at this vote or \nthis amendment at this time. Like everybody else around here, people \nare assuming that if we have a bad bill at this point--which we do--or \nif we add an amendment here or there, that is going to become law. \nSomebody needs to think about how do we get to an end result that will \nachieve the things we want.\n  If there ever is a bill, it will have a teenage smoking cessation \ncampaign and it will have a drug abuse cessation campaign. It is very \nappropriate that we tie these two together. It will have additional \nhelp for health programs that have been affected by smoking. NIH, \nobviously, would be a major beneficiary, and it should be. We need \nresearch on the health problems caused by smoking. Medicaid and \nMedicare--that would be the end result. Somebody better think about how \ndo you ever get an end result. If we don't add something on marriage \npenalty, tax relief, and on drugs, there won't be a bill. There will \nnot be a bill.\n\n  I want to remind everybody how we got to this point. First of all, \nSenator McCain, the manager of the bill, chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, had hearings; his committee met. They reported the bill out. \nI think it was 19 or 20-1. Republicans and Democrats voted for it. All \nof them had to sort of hold their noses, knowing there were too many \nthings in here that were the wrong thing to do, and they had gone too \nfar. They had some problems, but they got it done. It was a Republican \nchairman and every Republican but one voted to report it out of that \ncommittee.\n  I want the record to show, once again, that I am the guy that called \nup this legislation for it to be considered. But I am here to say that \nat this point it looks to me like it is over because of the games that \nare being played. Now, efforts were being made this very morning to \nwork out a reasonable compromise on the tax cut proposal by Senator \nGramm. We were going to have to have a good debate and a vote on\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nthis drug-related amendment. There were going to have to be additional \nvotes on the attorneys' fees issue. There is going to have to be votes \non the substitutes, if offered, by Senators Hatch, Gramm and Domenici. \nAt that point, perhaps cloture could begin. That is not what has been \nhappening.\n  Yesterday, Senator Daschle filed a cloture motion and, frankly, I did \nnot appreciate the way that was being done. We are not ready for \ncloture on this. We have some other issues that have to be considered \nbefore cloture would ever be invoked. And now, for the information of \nall Senators, the junior Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has \nfiled a cloture motion on the pending committee amendment to the \ntobacco bill. Now, who else is going to file a cloture? We have a good \nman back here in the cloakroom, Tiny; maybe he can file cloture on this \nbill. Is everybody going to wander in and file a cloture? Do we want \ntwo cloture votes on Tuesday, or one every day, or do we want a bill?\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I am offended by this. I consider it a breach \nof the good faith that we have worked in within this Chamber. I was not \nnotified this was going to happen until 5 minutes after 11. I never had \na discussion with my counterpart on the other side, and then Senator \nConrad files his cloture motion at about 11:20. I resent it. I don't \nappreciate it. It is counterproductive and it is killing this bill. So \nI truly regret this action by our minority colleagues.\n  As all Senators know, rule XXII, the cloture rule, is one of the most \nrigid of our rules, as far as imposing an arbitrary schedule for the \nconsideration of a bill. Amendments and even dictating the convening \ntime of the Senate with respect to the time of a cloture rollcall vote \nare locked in under this rule. The bill before us would require eight \ncloture motions--that is an important point--to be invoked and each of \nthe eight cloture items to be disposed of with up to 30 hours of debate \non each.\n  They are as follows: cloture on the Commerce Committee amendment; \ncloture on the bill, S. 1415; cloture on the motion to proceed to a \nHouse revenue bill; cloture on the substitute amendment to insert the \nSenate text into the House revenue bill; cloture on passage of the \nHouse revenue bill; cloture on the motion to insist on the Senate \namendment required to send the bill to conference; cloture on the \nmotion to request a conference with the House on disagreeing \namendments; and cloture on the appointment of conferees.\n  I am not the only guy in the Senate who knows where all these cloture \nmotions can be filed. Of course, that is assuming you get cloture, \nwhich then would require 30 hours and hundreds of amendments. This is a \nvery complex, very important piece of legislation, no matter what your \nviewpoint is, for or against. Everybody has to acknowledge that it has \nmany moving parts, is very complex, and there are many opportunities \nfor amendments to be offered and for mischief to be caused. It could \ntake forever or, in fact, never, as far as this bill being completed, \nunless we have some modicum of cooperation on both sides of the aisle \nand some effort to be fair to Senators that do have amendments that \nthey think should be offered.\n  So I am disappointed. But if this is the way we are going to proceed, \nif it is going to be done this way, then I will join the ranks of those \nthat are going to use every procedural parliamentary tool to work \nagainst this legislation, and we can just go ahead and admit that it \nwas a good thought.\n  We tried our best. It didn't work. I think that is unfortunate. But \nthe way that this is set up now, that is exactly where we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority \nleader has taken the floor to criticize what has occurred this morning. \nI notified the majority leader last night of our intention to file \ncloture again. We have been on the bill 42 hours, 39 minutes as of \n11:53. Eight days we have been here debating. We have sought some \ncooperation from our colleagues on the other side in terms of reaching \nsome agreement on how we can proceed on amendments. We have attempted \nto do that. We were getting nowhere. It was only after we filed cloture \nlast night that we were able to get a vote finally on the Durbin \namendment.\n  The majority leader talks about fairness being the criterion by which \nwe judge a Senator's right to offer an amendment. In the name of \nfairness, we need to offer Senators their opportunity to come to the \nfloor to offer amendments. I wish we would use the same standard. Let's \nuse the same standard for the tobacco bill as we used for the Coverdell \nbill, as we used for all other bills that we have had before the Senate \nthis year. We were arguing fairness when Senators were denied the \nopportunity to offer amendments. In fact, somebody said, ``Can you \nbelieve they are offering a tax amendment on the Coverdell bill?'' We \nsaid, ``Well, this is a tax bill.'' But we were accused of destroying \nwhat harmony there may have been to reach some agreement. And Senators \non this side of the aisle were precluded from offering amendments on \nthe Coverdell bill even though it was a tax bill, because they said \nthis is an education bill. Do you remember that debate? Because it was \n``an education bill,'' we were not supposed to offer tax amendments. \nBut it was a tax bill.\n  Now we have the tobacco legislation, and our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are saying we want to offer a tax amendment. We are \nsaying this is a tobacco bill. They say it doesn't matter. We are going \nto offer this tobacco amendment, and you are not being fair unless you \nensure that we have a right to offer tax amendments.\n  I am just asking, let's play fair. Let's use the same standard. That \nisn't too much to ask. Once we have agreed on what that standard is, \nlet's accommodate Senators on both sides who have amendments they wish \nto offer. We have a tax amendment. We don't understand why it would be \nthat difficult for us to come to some agreement about having a vote on \ntwo competing ideas on the same exact issue. Let's have our debate. \nLet's lay the amendments down. Let's have a vote back to back on the \namendments, and let's move on. We will have an amendment to the \namendment that has now been offered by the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia. We laud him for many of the things that are incorporated in \nhis amendment. There are some concerns that we have. If we can't work \nthrough those, we will certainly have an alternative there as well.\n  But it seems to me that we have a double standard here, Mr. \nPresident. When it was in circumstances in the past, we had one set of \nrules. Now, with circumstances with this bill, there is another set of \nrules. Let's play by the same rules. Let's work together and see if we \ncan't find some resolution of this problem. I think that can be done, \nbut we have a ways to go.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened with interest and great \nattention to the words spoken by the majority leader. He used the \nphrase, ``Let's keep in mind the end game.'' I go back to what my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Graham, and Senator Chafee just spoke \nabout before the two leaders took the floor. What is the ``end game''? \nIt is right here. This is the end game. The number of high school \nstudents smoking is going up at a precipitous rate, higher than ever. \nThe end game of this bill is to cut down on teenage smoking. That is \nthe end game.\n  The majority leader says if there is no marriage penalty tax in there \nand no illegal drug money, then there is going to be no bill. I hope I \nstill have some rational reasoning power. I have to ask, Why? Why is \nthat? The majority leader didn't expound on why that would be. You mean \nto say that we are holding these teenagers being addicted every day--\n3,000 teenagers every day being addicted to tobacco--hostage to the \nmarriage penalty tax provision or illegal drug money? Holding them \nhostage? Yet, the majority leader says there will be no bill unless we \nhave this. I don't understand that. The committee-reported bill didn't \nhave them in it. The committee-reported bill that was reported out by a \nhuge vote under the leadership of Senator McCain didn't have that in \nit.\n  And the majority leader went on to say--I don't understand where he \nis\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\ngetting his figures--that we are going to have money for research, we \nwill have money for cutting down teenage smoking. I don't know where he \nis going to get the money. Look, I am using the same chart that Senator \nChafee used just a minute ago. Here is the original McCain bill: $65 \nbillion over 5 years for public health, NIH, health research, States, \nand agriculture. Add it up--$65 billion. If we keep the States at $26 \nbillion, we keep agriculture, we add in illegal drugs, the Coverdell \namendment, the marriage penalty, and veterans, we are up to $65 \nbillion, and we have no money for NIH and no money for public health, \nperiod.\n  Does the majority leader mean to say that he is going to bring \nanother bill on the floor to magically find some money floating around \nsomeplace for NIH research and for public health for cutting down on \nteen smoking? I am sorry. The facts are simple.\n  If you put in the $15 billion on the illegal drugs, the $15 billion \non the marriage penalty, the veterans' $3 billion, agriculture $18 \nbillion, you can forget about public health and NIH. There is no money \nleft, unless, of course, the majority leader is going to come back on \nthe floor with a provision to raise the price of tobacco to even more \nthan $1.10 a pack. Maybe the majority leader would like to raise the \nprice of cigarettes to $1.50 a pack or $2 a pack. That might get you \nthe money. But with the $1.10 a pack you have in there now, you are not \ngoing to have the money, period.\n  So I just do not understand what the majority leader can possibly be \ntalking about and where he could possibly be finding all of this money \nthat he is going to have.\n  The majority leader said he was offended. Enough happens around here \nto offend each and every one of us every single day of the year, I \nsuppose. But I have learned after 13 years here--14, I guess--that you \ncan't be too offended too much by what goes on around here.\n  I guess you have to look at the reality of the situation, and the \nreality is very simple. There are those in this body who do not want a \ntobacco bill, period. They do not want the tobacco companies to have to \nshell out this money. They don't want to have a bill that will provide \nfor an increase in the price of cigarettes per pack. That is \nlegitimate. That is their viewpoint. They are welcome to it. They can \ndefend it all they want. Maybe they have good reasons they can defend \nit. But that is the reality of the situation.\n  For example, the Senator from Texas, I believe, propounded the \namendment on the marriage penalty tax, doing away with that. I \nbelieve--I think I am correct--that he even said if this amendment was \nadopted he would still vote against the bill.\n  So what kind of games are being played around here? I don't take \noffense at that; I just simply point it out for the reality of the \nsituation. The reality is that we have a battle going on on this Senate \nfloor, a big battle, and it is a battle between those who want to stop \n3,000 kids a day from starting to smoke, 1,000 who will die from it, \nand those who say business as usual; the tobacco companies, that is OK; \nlet them go ahead; it is a legal product.\n  We don't have to do anything to them. And if we just add all these \namendments on, it is going to fall of its own weight.\n  That is the game being played around here. It's a game that is played \nall the time. That is just sort of the way the Senate operates. What I \nguess we have to do is continually point out what is in fact being \ndone.\n  Now, let's talk about at least illegal drugs. We all want to stop \nillegal drugs. I have been here 13 years, 14 now. It seems like every \nyear we have a bill to do something about illegal drugs: We are going \nto beef up the Border Patrol; we are going to raise the penalties; we \nare going to have mandatory sentencing. Year after year after year we \ngo after illegal drugs because it makes nice headlines and we know that \n100 percent of the American people are against it so it is kind of an \neasy thing. It makes you feel good. You can hit at illegal drugs. It \ngets popular support. It gets in the newspapers. That's all well and \ngood.\n  But, Mr. President, what are we talking about? When you are talking \nabout death and illness to the youth of America, illegal drugs doesn't \nhold a candle to tobacco. And here are the figures. I welcome anyone to \ndispute the findings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nIf someone would like to take the Senate floor and dispute this, please \nlet me see the data you have. But the data we have from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention says, ``Tobacco kills more Americans \nthan alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs \nand fires combined'' every year. Here is tobacco over here: 418,000 \ndeaths in 1 year. Here is illegal drugs, 9,463. What's important? Year \nafter year we come here going after illegal drugs, and we let the \nbiggest killer and destruction of youth in America go by--tobacco. Let \nit go by every year. And we are about to do the same right here by \nloading on all these amendments.\n  Now, the marriage penalty needs addressing. I think I would agree \nwith others who have said it before, yes, it needs to be addressed. \nYes, it is an unfair tax. But we are going to have a tax bill later \nthis year. It is not going to take effect until next year anyway. \nAddress it at that time.\n  Illegal drugs, we can address that at another time. Keep our eye on \nwhat the majority leader said, ``the end game.'' Is the end game of \nthis bill to go after homicides or illegal drugs? No. It is go after \ntobacco. That is the end game. And the end game is to make sure that we \nhave the money to fight it.\n  That is what this is all about. It is not just about getting tobacco \ncompanies to put a lot of money into the Federal Government. If that is \nall that was happening, I would be opposed to it. What it is about is \nsaying to the tobacco companies you have for years through your \nadvertising, through covering up the health risks, you have for years \nhooked a whole generation of Americans on tobacco. You know that it is \ncarcinogenic. You know that nicotine is addictive. You know that it \ncauses emphysema and cancer and heart disease. And yet through your \nslick advertising year after year you hook more young Americans.\n  We know what the tobacco companies have known for years, that smoking \nbegins early, that by age 18, 89 percent of all adult smokers have \nstarted smoking. We know that. Tobacco companies know that. Oh, they \nhave said for years, no, no, we advertise for brand selection, to get \npeople off of one brand and onto another. Hogwash. They know that if \nthey can hook someone when they are young, they have them later on.\n\n  As I have said many times, Joe Camel never appealed to me. Joe Camel \ndoes not appeal to someone my age. Neither do all these slick \nadvertisements of young people on the beach and having a lot of fun and \nthey are all looking healthy and they are out there. They don't appeal \nto older people. The Marlboro gear that you can get with your coupons, \nthat doesn't appeal to older people. They are after young people. How \nmany older people do you see wearing the Joe Camel beach togs. You \ndon't see that. How many older people do you see wearing Marlboro gear. \nYou see teenagers wearing it but not older people.\n  The tobacco companies systematically for years have been targeting \nyoung people because they knew if they got them hooked young, they got \nthem later on.\n  What we are saying today is no, tobacco companies, don't dump a lot \nof money into the Federal Government so we can take care of the \nmarriage penalty, illegal drugs, this and that. We are saying, we are \ntelling you that you are going to have to pay money in so that we can \nput the money out for public health, to help take care of those people \nyou hooked years ago, to bring money in so we can put it into NIH on \nresearch, so we can put money into the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention on research on how to cut down on smoking, how to keep kids \nfrom smoking, have smoking cessation programs and prevention programs \nin all of our schools.\n  That is what we are after right here. NIH Health Research. End game: \nNIH health research, smoking cessation programs, smoking prevention and \neducation in our schools, counter advertising, which we know is very \neffective and which the tobacco companies probably dread more than \nanything else, antismuggling, and youth access restrictions.\n  This is the comprehensive bill that we are talking about. You add in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nadd-ons that are now before us and all of this is gone. Every single \none of these is gone because you don't have the money for them unless \nagain can someone please get on the floor and tell me where are we \ngoing to find the money if in fact we adopt all of these extraneous \nprovisions.\n  So that is what the end game is about. It is saying to the tobacco \ncompanies it is time for you to cough up, cough up enough money to take \ncare of those you have addicted through your advertising and that you \ndid not warn about the health aspects even though you knew what the \nhealth aspects were going to be. It is time for you to cough up enough \nmoney for research in heart disease and lung cancer and emphysema and \nall the illnesses that tobacco plagues us with. It is time for you to \ncough up enough money so we can go out to our schools and we can have \nprevention programs and education programs for our kids. It is time for \nyou, tobacco companies, to cough up enough money so we can have counter \nadvertising, not the slick ads that tell you how good smoking is but \nads that really tell you how death and illness will occur if you do in \nfact take up smoking.\n  That is what this money is all about. It is not about the marriage \npenalty or illegal drugs or anything else. It is about taking care of \nthe youth of America who have been hooked on tobacco. For the life of \nme, I don't understand why it is the majority leader can say that if \nthese add-ons are not adopted, the tobacco bill is dead. I would like \nto see a vote out on the Senate floor. I think we ought to vote on the \namendment by the Senator from Texas on the marriage penalty. Let's vote \nit up or down. Let's vote on all these amendments. Let's just vote on \nthem. And then let's have a final vote on this bill and see where we \ncome down. Let's cut out the games. Let's cut out all this game \nplaying.\n  I bet the tobacco industry CEO's today, Mr. President, are slapping \neach other on the back and they are laughing all the way to the bank, \ngleefully watching us hack away at the programs designed to prevent \nyoung people from smoking and to help those smokers quit who have \nalready taken it up.\n  They must be really happy watching us go through all of this when \nthey know that tobacco is the biggest killer of youth.\n  This is the end game right here. This is the end game. I have used \nthis chart before on the floor. Two young, attractive women coming in \nto buy cigarettes. Which one is 16? You don't know. You don't know \nwhich one is 16. Melissa and Amy--it turns out Melissa is 16 and Amy is \n25.\n  We want to keep Melissa from taking up tobacco, and if Amy has taken \nit up, we want her to quit. That is what the end game here is all \nabout. It is not about marriage penalty or anything else. To those who \nsay it is, to those who say, as the majority leader said, that if we \ndon't have these extraneous measures on here the bill is going to die, \nI say, come out and explain to the American people why it is we had a \nbill reported from the Commerce Committee under the leadership of \nSenator McCain that came out with one dissenting vote, out of \ncommittee, and we cannot have a vote on that bill here on the Senate \nfloor; why it is we are going to have all these extraneous measures, \nand they have to be adopted, according to the majority leader, or the \nbill will not pass? These were not in the committee bill, and it passed \nout of committee with only one dissenting vote.\n  So, I don't know what the majority leader is talking about, unless \nwhat the majority leader is talking about is that he really wants this \nbill killed, that he wants no tobacco bill, that he wants to load it \ndown with a number of amendments that will surely mean the end of any \ntobacco legislation this year.\n  I hope that is not the case. As I said, I do not know what the \nmajority leader had in mind. All he said was if these amendments are \nnot adopted, the bill is dead. I don't know what he means by that. \nHopefully, in the coming days, he will explain himself further in that \nregard.\n  Mr. President, our charge is clear and simple here. Our charge is \nonly one--cut teen smoking. We know what does it. The Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, spoke about it. It has to be a comprehensive \nbill encompassing a rapid and significant increase in the price of \ntobacco; and, second, smoking cessation and education programs, \nresearch, and counteradvertising. If you do all of those, you will cut \nteen smoking. You can save those lives. You will save a lot of illness \nin America. That is what we have to be about.\n  Senator Chafee and Senator Graham and I have worked very hard on this \nlegislation in a bipartisan manner going back several months. I think \nwe can still, hopefully, have a good bipartisan bill come out. The \ncommittee bill was bipartisan. I am sorry to see that we have gotten \nnow into this partisan wrangling over the marriage penalty, or motions, \ncloture motions and things like that. I think our leader, Senator \nDaschle, had it right. We ought to have one set of rules and we ought \nto abide by those rules. Whatever those rules are for one bill, we \nought to attach them to the other bill.\n  I think the best course of action for us here is to vote on these \namendments, move on, and vote on final passage. Let's exercise the \nSenate's will. We have been on the bill long enough. Hopefully, we can \nfinish it next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senator \nCoverdell and Senator Craig in offering the Drug Free Neighborhoods Act \nas an amendment to the tobacco bill.\n  I fervently believe that we must do everything we can to reduce \nteenage smoking. But we are not here to deal with one issue a year. We \nare here to deal with the priorities of our constituents and our \ncountry. So I think we also must address the serious problem of teenage \ndrug use in America today as well.\n  In my view it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on \ndrugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all \nAmericans, and to our children in particular, that the use and sale of \nillegal drugs is dangerous, wrong, and will not be tolerated.\n  As the father of three young children, I am deeply disturbed by \nrecent trends in drug use. Indeed, since 1992 Washington has been \nlosing important ground in the war on drugs. Let me cite just a few of \nthe alarming statistics:\n  First of all, over the past five years, the average number of Federal \ndrug defendants prosecuted has dropped by almost 1500 cases from the \n1992 level. And the average number of drug convictions has gone down by \na similar amount since 1993.\n  The drug interdiction budget was cut by 39 percent from 1992 to 1996 \nand drug surveillance flights were cut in half.\n  The impact on our kids has been serious. In the last six years, the \npercentage of high school seniors admitting that they had used an \nillicit drug has risen by more than half.\n  Incredibly, 54 percent of the Class of 97 had used an illicit drug by \ngraduation.\n  For 10th graders during that same time, drug use has doubled.\n  And--perhaps worst of all--nearly 20 percent of our 8th graders use \nillegal drugs.\n  Faced with this bad news, this year the Administration finally \nsubmitted a comprehensive long range National Drug Strategy to \nCongress.\n  Unfortunately, it took them nearly five years to take this step. And, \nas the numbers show, our children have been paying the price.\n  That is why today we are offering the Drug Free Neighborhoods \namendment. This amendment addresses the alarming trends in drug use \namong teenagers. Let me describe briefly what this amendment entails:\n  First, it provides additional resources for drug interdiction \nprograms in the U.S. Customs Service, the Coast Guard, and the \nDepartment of Defense. It would double the interdiction budget for each \nof these departments.\n  Second, this amendment provides additional resources to combat drugs \nthat reach our schools and neighborhoods. For example, it authorizes \n$50 million per year for the Drug Free Communities Act. It also \npromotes drug free schools by allowing federal funds to be used for \nvoluntary random drug testing programs--and to provide school choice \nfor K-12 students who are victims of drug-related school violence.\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\n  Third, the amendment increases disincentives for teens to use illegal \ndrugs through the Drug Free Student Loans Act. This act would deny \nstudent loans to those convicted of drug possession. In addition, the \namendment's Drug Free Teen Drivers Act, would provide grants to States \nthat enact and enforce laws to crack down on teen drivers who use \ndrugs.\n  Finally, this amendment would ban taxpayer funding for needle \nexchange programs. In my judgment, Washington must constantly reinforce \nthe message to our kids that drugs are dangerous, and drug use is \nunacceptable.\n  Federal funding of needle programs sends the wrong message. And the \nstatistics gathered from programs in Vancouver, Montreal, Zurich and \nManhattan all clearly show that these programs significantly increase \ndrug use. Every program studied has shown a significant increase in the \nuse of narcotics among those receiving free needles--every study.\n  Mr. President, we owe it to the thousands upon thousands of families \nstruggling to protect their children from the scourges of drugs and \ndrug violence to stay tough on the criminals who prey on their \nneighborhoods.\n  Washington has to renew the war on drugs. We must provide needed \nresources, and we must reinforce the message that drugs aren't \nacceptable and that drug dealers belong in prison--for a long time.\n  Our kids deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, let me close by just commenting briefly on the \nmajority leader's earlier remarks. There are, obviously, a lot of \nissues that are on this floor. I don't want to attempt to address every \none of them. But I think the point the majority leader is trying to \nmake, as he outlined some of his thinking as to the final version this \nlegislation might take, is a very important point for us to remember, \nwhich is that the tax dollars we are talking about here are not coming \nfrom tobacco companies. They are coming from taxpayers. They are coming \nfrom citizens. They are coming from people, for the most part, in \nlower-income categories. So I think we do have a responsibility to \ndetermine, if we are going to increase taxes on working families in \nthis country, exactly how those resources ought to be spent.\n  The notion that we cannot, in any sense, change any of the formula \nfor the expenditure of those resources or we are somehow undermining \nthis legislation, I think is an incorrect conclusion. This bill, like \nevery other bill we have, is about priorities. In offering the \namendment that we are offering, that the majority leader spoke to in \nhis comments, we are trying to establish as a priority of this Congress \nthat we will do more in the battle against illegal drugs.\n  There may be some Members--I am not sure in which States--but there \nmay be some Members in some States where illegal drug use is not a \nsignificant problem in their communities, where they are not hearing \nfrom their constituents about this, where this is not a serious \nproblem. Maybe that is the case. I do not know. I cannot speak for \nother States, but I can speak for my State, and when I go around my \nState I hear families in virtually every corner of Michigan talking \nabout the problems, the threat to their kids, of drugs.\n  If we are going to tax the families of this country to the tune of \nbillions of dollars a year--not the tobacco companies but the \nfamilies--billions of dollars a year, and the notion we are not going \nto do anything about illegal drugs, that this is somehow inappropriate \non this legislation, that the majority leader is wrong to come to the \nfloor and say there needs to be a drug component here--I don't know \nwhat State that represents, but it doesn't represent mine.\n  I think the majority leader is right on target, and I think this \namendment is a critical part of this legislation. I think it makes \nsense for us to do this now. We are not going to have many more \nopportunities to do this, and I think we will be sending a terrible \nmessage to the people of this country and our kids if we pass this \nlegislation and say we are worried about tobacco and we are worried \nabout smoking, but drugs can wait for another day. In my State, that \nwon't sell. Maybe it will in other places. The majority leader is \nright, Senator Coverdell is right, Senator Craig is right, and I am \nhappy to join them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Michigan. I think his comments on the \nappropriate nature of this amendment as it relates to teenage drug \nabuse is absolutely correct.\n  I was taken aback by the suggestion by a couple of our colleagues \nthat somehow teenage addiction to drugs was something that ought to be \nleft for another day. I suggest my colleagues need to ask Americans \nwhat they think the most important teenage problem is today. When you \nask American families, not CDC or some think tank, but you ask American \nfamilies what they think the No. 1 teenage problem is, it is drug \nabuse--No. 1, and there is not even a close 2.\n  The Senator from Iowa has a chart from CDC that shows the numbers of \ndeaths. Of course, that is over a lifetime of the entire population. It \nshows substantial more deaths related to tobacco than to drug abuse on \nan annual basis. I don't dispute the numbers, but I do dispute the \npoint he is trying to make. He is trying to say that tobacco is the \nmost significant problem, and I guess just measured against deaths, he \nis correct. But I wonder if he would be interested in looking at \nAmerica's prison population, the millions of Americans in prison today. \nThere is just one little kernel, one nugget that would be of interest \nto him, and that is that 80 percent--80--8 out of 10 prisoners in \nAmerica are in prison on a drug-related charge, direct or indirect--80 \npercent of the prison population.\n  Drugs are fueling havoc in our cities, in our States and communities \nbecause they fuel crime and they fuel violent crime, disconnected \nmindless crime. We all know that the nature of criminal activity, \nparticularly among our juveniles, is becoming more violent. We have had \na lot of discussions about it. It is drug driven. The fact that we are \ntalking about addiction and silent on the most pressing problem facing \nteenagers, in my judgment, isn't even debatable; it is unconscionable.\n  The Senator from Michigan alluded to it when he said we will be \nsending the wrong message, it will be sending a message, ``Well, we've \ngotten to the most prominent, most difficult problem for teenagers \nbecause we have passed a program dealing with teenage smoking.''\n  Teenage smoking is up. It is up about 40 percent, and it needs \nattention. Drug abuse among teenagers is up 135 percent and escalating \nas we stand here, fueling not only enormous personal disruption, family \ndisruption, but community disruption as it expands itself into criminal \nbehavior.\n  Not long ago, I was at a youth detention center in my State. It was a \nfemale center. There were about 20 young people aged 12 to 16. They \nwere in this detention center for prostitution, assault and battery, \nauto theft, attempted murder, and the root of every one of the crimes \nwas drugs. The real reason they were there was drugs. You can walk into \nany school, I venture to say in any State, and you ask the children \nwhat the No. 1 problem is--alcohol, cigarettes, drugs? Ninety-five \npercent, drugs.\n  If we are going to talk about addiction of teenagers, we have to talk \nabout the combined problem. Yes, tobacco. It is not healthy for them to \nuse tobacco products, and we want to direct our guns at that. But the \nmost important problem, Mr. President, for teenagers is drugs. It is \nalmost an extension of the message coming out of this city for the last \n6 months: We don't want to talk about drugs; we will shut the drug \nczar's office; we will cut the interdiction in half. And we are \nsurprised because suddenly we are in an epidemic of teenage drug abuse? \nThe message was silence. To let a teenage addiction bill come through \nthis Senate and be silent on drugs is unconscionable.\n  I, along with my colleagues, Senator Craig of Idaho and Senator \nAbraham of Michigan, are not going to allow that to happen. We are \ngoing to talk about teenage addiction, yes; we are going to talk about \ntobacco, but we are going to put drugs in the mix because it is the No. \n1 problem.\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 244 \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Collins, Lott, Hutchison, and \nAbraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 244) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the ninth anniversary of the massacre of \n     prodemocracy demonstrators on Tiananmen Square by military \n     forces acting under orders from the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, yesterday was the ninth anniversary of \nthe massacre of hundreds of prodemocracy students on Tiananmen Square \nin Beijing by troops acting under the orders of the Communist \nGovernment of China. In memory of the brave students who suffered and \ndied there for speaking out peacefully against political repression, \nand in memory of those who are imprisoned still, last night I attempted \nto introduce this resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that \nour Government should remain committed to honoring the memory of these \nvictims of oppression and also that supporting China's peaceful \ntransition to democracy should be a principal goal of our foreign \npolicy.\n  I know that such sentiments are shared by all Members of this body. \nAfter all, who could possibly object to honoring the Chinese student \nmartyrs to democracy on the ninth anniversary of their massacre? After \nall, our most cherished political ideals are those of inalienable \nrights and democratic self-rule. Unfortunately, however, we were unable \nto get the resolution cleared last night on the Democratic side. This \nobjection prevented the Senate from making any statement in memory of \nthe victims of Tiananmen Square on the ninth anniversary of their \nmurder.\n  I am pleased, however, to report today that the cold light of morning \nhas helped bring some perspective to this issue and that the objection \nto my resolution has now been withdrawn. I am very grateful for the \ncooperation of the Democratic leader in resolving the issue on his \nside.\n  I spoke at some length last night about the purpose of this \nresolution, so I will not repeat those remarks now. Let me merely say \nthat it is deeply gratifying to see all of us join together in \nexpressing our heartfelt commitment to democracy and human rights in \nChina and in honoring the memory of those slain in the pursuit of these \nideals. It may be 24 hours late, Mr. President, but history will not \nfind the U.S. Senate to have been voiceless in remembrance of the \nvictims in the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 244) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 244), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 244\n\n       Whereas in the spring of 1989, thousands of students \n     demonstrated in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in favor of \n     greater democracy, civil liberties, and freedom of expression \n     in the People's Republic of China (PRC);\n       Whereas these students' protests against political \n     repression in their homeland were conducted peacefully and \n     posed no threat to their fellow Chinese citizens;\n       Whereas on the evening of June 4, 1989, these students were \n     brutally attacked by infantry and armored vehicles of the \n     People's Liberation Army (PLA) acting under orders from the \n     highest political and military leadership of the PRC;\n       Whereas hundreds of these students were killed by the PLA \n     in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for offenses no more \n     serious than that of seeking peacefully to assert their most \n     basic human, civil, and political rights;\n       Whereas many of the leaders of the student demonstrations \n     thus attacked were subsequently imprisoned, sought out for \n     arrest, or otherwise persecuted by the Government of the PRC;\n       Whereas during or shortly after the brutal assault of June \n     4, 1989, at least 2,500 persons were arrested for so-called \n     ``counter-revolutionary offenses'' across China and dozens of \n     persons were executed;\n       Whereas the Chinese government has never expressed grief \n     for its actions on June 4, 1989, still imprisons at least 150 \n     persons in connection with the Tiananmen Square \n     demonstrations, and has continued to deny its citizens basic \n     internationally-recognized human, civil, and political \n     rights;\n       Whereas the Government of the PRC, as detailed in \n     successive annual reports on human rights by the United \n     States Department of State, still routinely and \n     systematically violates the rights of its citizens, including \n     their rights to freedom of speech, assembly, worship, and \n     peaceful dissent; and\n       Whereas the Tiananmen Square Massacre has become indelibly \n     etched into the political consciousness of our times as a \n     symbol both of the impossibility of forever denying a \n     determined people the right to control their own destiny and \n     of the oppressiveness and brutality of governments that seek \n     to do so: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, in the interest of expressing support for \n     the observance of human, civil, and political rights in China \n     and around the world, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should remain committed to \n     honoring the memory and spirit of the brave citizens of China \n     who suffered and died in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for \n     attempting to assert their internationally-recognized rights; \n     and\n       (2) supporting the peaceful transition to democratic \n     governance and the observance of internationally-recognized \n     human, civil, and political rights and the rule of law in \n     China should be a principal goal of United States foreign \n     policy.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for \nallowing me to precede him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the state of things at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a period of morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in view of the fact \nthat my statement may require more than 10 minutes--it may not--that I \nmay use as much time as I may consume, with the understanding that I \nwill not use more than 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object, I wonder if the Presiding Officer might entertain a consent \nrequest that I be allowed to follow Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5681-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5681-S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ``POLITICAL CORRECTNESS''--ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it seems that concern with so-called \n``political correctness'' has been elevated to a near religion in \nrecent years.\n  I thought it might be well to speak on this subject this afternoon \nwhen we\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nare not overly busy with other matters. I am sure it is a subject on \nwhich not everyone will agree with me. But that doesn't necessarily \nconcern me. I feel that I have something to say, and I am going to say \nit at this point.\n  It seems, I say, that concern with so-called ``political \ncorrectness'' has been elevated to a near religion in recent years. \nWell, I have long been puzzled by the doctrine, if it may be termed as \nsuch, the doctrine of political correctness. When it comes to benefits \nof this overtly patronizing assault on thought patterns and \ncontemporary speech, I have to admit that I guess I just don't get it.\n  It has always seemed to me that one of the intrinsically valuable \nthings about America is its ``melting pot'' aspect. I heard about the \nmelting pot when I was a boy, and there have been many, many, many \nvaluable aspects of the melting-pot policy.\n  The phenomenon of American life and culture has been its uncanny \nability to absorb a reasonable number of people from all around the \nglobe of different races, religions, nationalities, abilities and \ntalents, and inspire them to embrace the ideals of freedom, and work \ntoward the common good of the Republic, without destroying their \nindividuality.\n  But today's trendy, misguided urge to vigorously emphasize in \ncontemporary thought, and speech, not the value and worth of individual \ndifference, but merely the inoffensive security of ``sameness'' seems \nto be going against the time-honored grain that has facilitated the \nsuccessful achievement of a richly diverse, yet united nation.\n  The gross, linguistic overreaching for the goal of being perfectly \npolitically correct that goes on in most public discussions, both \nwritten and spoken, is not only insultingly gratuitous, but, at times \nsublimely ridiculous as well. It is as if everyone who writes or speaks \nin the public arena today is making a concerted and rather forced \neffort to banish from the face of the Earth the obvious differences in \ngender, race, religion and genetic codes inherent in all human beings \nthrough the clumsy device of disavowing verbally all dissimilarities. \nAnd the results are often either humorous or downright sad.\n  In order to avoid offending anyone in anyway we have come up with \nsuch linguistic acrobatics as Chair or Chairperson to replace chairman.\n  When I think of the Chair there in the front of the Chamber, I think \nof the position. I address the Chair. I am thinking of the position. \nBut the person who is in the chair is not a chair. He is not a piece of \nwood; he is not a piece of furniture; he is the chairman.\n  Well, one may say what if it is not a ``he,'' what if it is a lady? \nThen I would say ``Madam Chairman.'' I would still refer to the person \nas the chairman. That has been the case for centuries --eons of time. \nAnd here in this latter part of the 20th century we have decided we \nhave to change all that. So, I don't think of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio, who presently presides over the Senate in a very dignified \nand efficient way--I don't think of him as a piece of wood. If I would \nrefer to him personally, I would not call him ``the Chair.'' I would \njust as soon that nobody referred to me as a piece of wood, as a \n``chair.'' I was the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. If we \nwant to address the Chair, that is the position. I have no problem with \nthat. But don't refer to me as ``the Chair.'' I may object to it.\n  I see letters that come to my office with reference to the ``chair.'' \nAnd I have told my staff, when you respond to such a letter, you should \nuse the word ``chairman.'' Don't use the word ``chair.'' I am not going \nto get in that parade and go down that road, falling into that pothole \nof ``political correctness.''\n  So, we have come up with other linguistic acrobatics, in order to \nreplace any reference to skin color other than white; and Native \nAmerican to replace American Indian. Well, I am a native American. I \nwas born in North Carolina. If I am not a native American, of what \ncountry am I a native? I am a native American. I have no problem with \nreferring to the Indians as ``original'' Americans. But when they are \nreferred to as ``Native'' Americans, I think that is demeaning to the \nIndians. I am a native American. But I don't pretend to be an original \nAmerican--the American Indian.\n  Some day, in the misty future when political correctness is dead and \ngone, (may that day come with all speed) our descendants may remark on \nthe peculiarity of such terms as ``Chairperson.'' Did it mean that the \npoor unfortunate soul possessed a body like a chair? Could it refer to \nthe quality of one's intellect? Or maybe it was related somehow to \none's lack of mobility--perhaps akin to the popular expression, ``couch \npotato.''\n  Gender neutrality, which is an absolute fetish in our country at this \ntime, produces a plethora of strange choices for its adherents. What, \nfor example, to be gender-neutrally correct, do we call a man-hole \ncover? How do we neutralize the very necessary ``his'' and ``her'' \ndesignations on restrooms? And whatever do we do to purge such common \nexpressions as ``man-alive,'' ``he's a macho-man,'' ``he's a ladies \nman,'' and ``man overboard'' from the population at large?\n  If one stops to think about such things, it becomes absolutely \nridiculous. It is laughable, indeed.\n  This insane preoccupation has even been carried so far as to apply to \nthe good Lord and his words as related in Holy Scripture, as some ``new \nage'' Bibles have done.\n  I don't want any of them in my house. They won't find a resting place \nin my house. That kind of Bible will find its way to the wastebasket if \nit ever gets to me or to anybody in my family. We will stick with the \nKing James version.\n  Personally, I think enough is enough when it comes to political \ncorrectness. I think we should all stop this unhealthy preoccupation \nand consider what effect it has had on the content of public dialogue \nin general. Far from erasing differences from the public mind, I think \npolitical correctness in all of its suspect forms has tended to overly \naccentuate them. In order not to risk offending anyone, we spend so \nmuch time focusing on race, gender, country of origin or whatever \naspects of an individual we have to tiptoe around, that we then tend to \nignore all of the other truly valuable and important aspects of that \nindividual, such as brainpower, level of achievement, talent or quality \nof character. In other words, our anxious efforts not to emphasize such \nsurface differences as race and gender have, in my view, paradoxically, \nhad precisely the opposite effect.\n  On a more subtle level, political correctness has encouraged us to \nbecome much less honest with one another and with ourselves and, as a \nresult, much less willing and able to come to grips with the troubling \nproblems which beset our land. In our obsequious efforts not to offend \nanybody, we in public life thereby mentally partition our population \ninto groups by race or by gender or by some other category, obscuring \nthe inarguable fact that we are all citizens of the United States of \nAmerica, that our fates hang together, and that public debate should, \nin the best of all worlds, be about what is good for the country, not \nwhat may appease this group or that group or this individual. That is \none reason why I absolutely abhor hyphenated-American designations. \nThey separate and divide us into arbitrary categories which are based \nfor the most part solely on what the eye can readily see. And we find \nthe same problem in our textbooks in the schools.\n  How can we help the entire population of our land, the men, the \nwomen, the blacks, the Hispanics, the white or the Asian populations, \nif we submerge honest and forthright discussions of what is best for \nthe Nation in favor of pandering to the sensibilities of this group or \nthat group? The answer is we can't. And the real answer is we don't \nwant to. It is far easier to observe the customary taboos and the \npopular, awkward, and thoroughly phony norms of political correctness \nthan to actually grapple with real problems in a meaningful and \nsubstantive way.\n  Personally, Mr. President, I hope that ``political correctness'' will \nsoon go the way of high-button shoes or the lace-up corset. It is shop-\nworn window dressing far, far too constraining for a fast-moving, \ndifficult age, crying out for courageous leaders, frank discussion, and \ninnovative solutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, we have been debating the tobacco bill in \nthe U.S. Senate and will continue to debate that piece of legislation \ninto next week and perhaps even beyond. I will begin a discussion on \nthe subject of kids and smoking, and I will read into the Record pieces \nof information from the tobacco industry itself. Then, at the \nconclusion, I will ask the question and have all Americans ask the \nquestion: Were the tobacco companies and was the tobacco industry in \nAmerica targeting our children as customers for their tobacco products?\n  If the answer is yes, then the question is not any longer whether \nthere should be tobacco legislation; the question will be exactly what \nkind of legislation must we pass and how quickly can we enact it.\n  Let me begin with a few quotes. These are quotes from the tobacco \nindustry that have been unearthed in various lawsuits and discovery \nproceedings.\n  Brown & Williamson, a 1972 company document:\n\n       It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. \n     Honey might be considered.\n\n  Talking about the potential of adding honey to cigarettes to make \nthem more appealing to teenagers.\n  RJR tobacco company, 1973:\n\n       Comic-strip-type copy might get a much higher readership \n     among younger people than any other type of copy.\n\n  Talking about advertising, clearly a strategy that says--how do we \nadvertise to kids? This from the RJR tobacco company.\n  Brown & Williamson, 1973:\n\n       Kool--The brand Kool--has shown little or no growth in \n     share of users in the 26-and-up age group. Growth is from 16- \n     to 25-year-olds . . . at the present rate, a smoker in the \n     16- to 25-year-age group will soon be three times as \n     important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad-age \n     category.\n\n  Is this a company interested in getting kids addicted to cigarettes? \nSure sounds like it to me.\n  Philip Morris, 1974:\n\n       We are not sure that anything can be done to halt a major \n     exodus if one gets going among the young. This group--now \n     speaking of the young, according to Philip Morris--follows \n     the crowd, and we don't pretend to know what gets them going \n     for one thing or another . . . Certainly Philip Morris should \n     continue efforts for Marlboro in the youth market . . .\n\n  R. J. Reynolds, 1974:\n\n       They represent tomorrow's cigarette business . . . As this \n     14- to 24-age group matures, they will account for a key \n     share of the total cigarette volume--for at least the next 25 \n     years.\n\n  In a 1975 report, a Philip Morris researcher writes:\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . age 15 to 19 years old . . . my own \n     data, which includes younger teenagers, shows even higher \n     Marlboro market penetration among 15- to 17-year-olds.\n\n  That is a 1975 report from a researcher in Philip Morris. These are \ninternal company documents:\n\n       To ensure increased and longer-term growth for Camel \n     filter--This according to a 1975 RJR memo--the brand must \n     increase penetration among the 14- to 24 age group which has \n     a new set of more liberal values and which represent \n     tomorrow's cigarette business.\n\n  RJR Nabisco, 1975, talking about increasing penetration among 14- to \n24-year-olds.\n  R. J. Reynolds, 1976:\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate the 14- to 18-year-\n     old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. \n     RJR-T must soon establish a successful new brand in this \n     market if our position in the industry is to be maintained . \n     . .\n\n  Fourteen to 18-year-old kids. This is a tobacco document that says, \n``We have to go after this to maintain our position.''\n  1978, Lorillard cigarette company:\n\n       The base of our business is the high-school student.\n\n  Philip Morris, 1979, writes:\n\n       Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger category, \n     capturing over 50 percent of this market.\n\n  What a cause for celebration at Philip Morris in 1979!\n\n       Marlboro dominates the 17-and-younger category, capturing \n     over 50 percent of this market.\n\n  Marlboro Red, 1981, a Philip Morris researcher writes:\n\n       . . . the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to \n     smoke while in their teens. At least part of the success of \n     our Marlboro Red during its most rapid growth period was \n     because it became the brand of choice among teenagers who \n     then stuck with it as they grew older.\n\n  Does this sound like a set of documents--and I am going to go on at \nsome length to talk about these documents from the industry--does it \nsound like a set of documents from an industry without morals, without \nvalues? From an industry that sees 14-year-olds with dollar signs \npainted on their baseball cap?\n  Is that a company or an industry without values? I think so.\n  The Tobacco Institute, 1983. It says:\n\n       [Brown & Williamson] will not support a youth smoking \n     program which discourages young people from smoking.\n\n  Well, there it is, I guess. They know who their customers are, and \nthey target their customers. They try to addict these kids to \ncigarettes. And then they say, ``We will not support a youth smoking \nprogram discouraging young people from smoking.''\n  ``Strategies and Opportunities,'' by R.J. Reynolds, 1984:\n\n       Younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the \n     growth and decline of every major brand and company over the \n     last 50 years. They will continue to be just as important to \n     brands [and] companies in the future for two simple reasons: \n     The renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-\n     old smokers. No more than 5 percent of smokers start after \n     age 24. . . . Younger adult smokers are the only source of \n     replacement smokers. . . . If younger adults turn away from \n     smoking, the industry must decline, just as a population \n     which does not give birth will eventually dwindle.\n\n  That is according to a strategies memo from R.J. Reynolds.\n  R.J. Reynolds, 1986, Camels.\n\n       [Camel advertising will create] the perception that Camel \n     smokers are non-conformist, self-confident, and project a \n     cool attitude, which is admired by their peers. . . . \n     Aspiration to be perceived as cool [and] a member of the in-\n     group is one of the strongest influences affecting the \n     behavior of [young adults].\n\n  Well, those are just some, and the list is long.\n  After reading what has been unearthed from the bowels of the records \nof the tobacco industry about their attempts to addict our children to \ncigarettes, starting with a single sentence by one cigarette company \nthat says ``the base of our business is the high school student,'' does \nanyone doubt that we have a tobacco industry who, for years in this \ncountry, has decided that their customers must be children? Because \nwhen you reach age 30--just as one of the researchers suggested, and \nwonder what will further enrich your life that you are now missing, you \nwill not conclude that smoking is the activity you have missed. No \nadult that I know says, at age 30, ``Gosh, if I could just start \nsmoking, I would further enrich my life.'' The only opportunity for new \ncustomers for the industry is to addict a child.\n  That brings me to the point of the legislation on the floor of the \nSenate. Some say this is punitive. Some say, ``What's all the fuss \nabout?'' Well, fuss is about a country that says to the tobacco \nindustry:\n\n       Tobacco is a legal product, but for adults, and it is \n     amoral to try to addict our children, and we want to stop it. \n     We want to say to the industry, ``We will not allow you to \n     continue to profit by trying to addict America's children to \n     nicotine. We will simply not allow it. And if you don't like \n     it, tough luck. And if you lose money, too bad. But you \n     cannot continue with impunity in this country to try to \n     addict America's kids to cigarettes.' ''\n\n  There have been a lot of claims about this legislation. I want to \ntalk about a couple of those claims. We know from statistics that \nAmerica is full of a lot of wonderful people. I do not know anyone that \nI am acquainted with who would want to live elsewhere. It is not that \nthe rest of the world isn't wonderful--this is just a great place. And \nwe are blessed to be able to live here in this time.\n  But there are challenges. Among those challenges is that every day \n3,000\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nadditional kids in our country start to smoke, and 1,000 kids will die \nbecause they started to smoke today. Today, and every day, when those \n3,000 take their first cigarette, they consign --one-third--all with \nnames, all with families, all with potential careers and dreams and \nhopes and aspirations--one-third will be consigned to die because they \ntook up a habit that can kill you. And 300,000 to 400,000 people a year \ndie in this country from smoking and smoking-related causes.\n  Smoking rates among high school students--10th and 12th graders--have \nincreased for the last 6 years in a row. In my State of North Dakota, \naccording to statistics 39 percent of high school kids under age 18 \nsmoke.\n\n  We can do something to stop this, and that is the genesis of the \ntobacco legislation. Senator McCain, from the Commerce Committee, the \ncommittee on which I serve, passed a piece of legislation to the floor \nof the Senate. I voted for it. Senator Conrad, my colleague from North \nDakota, has done exceptional work in this area working with Senator \nMcCain.\n  Incidentally, Senator Conrad produced his own piece of legislation \nwith a task force.\n  But we are attempting, on the floor of the Senate, to pass a piece of \nlegislation that tells the tobacco industry: ``You cannot addict \nAmerica's children. We won't allow it.''\n  In this debate, we are describing the record of the industry, because \nsome still deny that the industry is targeting our kids. I do not think \nthey can deny it any longer with any credibility. I think unearthing \nall of these memos, strategies, and words of the industry itself, \nsaying--``We're going after your kids''--I think that destroys any \ncredibility anybody had who says that the tobacco industry isn't \ntargeting America's kids.\n  What does this legislation do? The legislation will increase the cost \nof a pack of cigarettes. The legislation on the floor will increase it \nby $1.10 a pack over 5 years.\n  What is going to happen with this money? Let me describe how the \nmoney will be used. First of all, the largest share of the money, 40 \npercent, will be returned to the States to compensate the States for \nthe costs they have incurred as a result of tobacco-related illnesses--\nfor example--the substantial increase to health costs, Medicaid, and \nothers. The substantial increased costs that the States have incurred \nas a result of tobacco-related causes will be reimbursed by this price \nincrease of tobacco.\n  The medical costs of smoking are estimated to be somewhere around $50 \nbillion a year annually. Lost economic productivity, as a result of the \nmedical conditions caused by smoking, is somewhere around $47 billion a \nyear. The States incur medical costs of about $4 billion just caring \nfor smokers. This legislation will reimburse them and their taxpayers \nfor that range of costs that I have just described, somewhere close to \n$100 billion.\n  Twenty-two percent of the funding--aside from funding I have just \ndescribed that will go to States--will be devoted to public health \nprograms. Half will be dedicated to educate children about the dangers \nof smoking, to fund programs to reduce youth smoking, and a \ncounteradvertising program to offset the extensive marketing efforts of \nthe industry.\n  Rather than create the big bureaucracies that the tobacco industry \nclaims would happen, what will happen is, these funds will be used by \nthe States to try to develop efforts and coordinate advertising and \nother smoking cessation programs that we are convinced will work to \nteach and to persuade America's kids not to begin smoking.\n  Twenty-two percent of the funding will go to health and medical \nresearch largely through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \nFrankly, I cannot think of anything we do in this country that has more \nimpact, value and importance to every American than investments in \nhealth research.\n  What is happening at the National Institutes of Health is really \nquite remarkable. From breathtaking changes and breakthroughs in health \ncoverage to health remedies which attempt to deal with disease and \nproblems. And what we are trying to do is to increase the amount of \ninvestment and research for health care at the National Institutes of \nHealth. That makes a great deal of sense to me.\n  So we are talking about a range of things--offsetting the costs the \nStates have, smoking cessation programs, counteradvertising programs, \nprohibition on the industry's advertising, substantial investments in \nthe National Institutes of Health, and a range of other things--that I \nthink will be very beneficial. It will also allow someone 20 years from \nnow to say that these companies were unable to devote advertising and \nunable to devote efforts to try to addict 14-year-olds. First, because \nyou cannot advertise to them, and second, because we are going to \ncounteradvertise, and we are going to have smoking cessation programs \nand other efforts to try to prevent you from addicting America's \nchildren to cigarettes.\n  There is in this piece of legislation some assistance for farmers, as \nwell, because tobacco farmers will be impacted by this legislation, and \nwe should be mindful of the problems caused for tobacco and to tobacco \nfarmers as a result of this piece of legislation. Senator Ford has \ncrafted an amendment that I think goes a long way in addressing the \nissue that will affect tobacco farmers from this legislation. We will \nbe talking about that, I think, next week.\n  We have liability issues that are dealt with in this piece of \nlegislation. I mentioned advertising restrictions. We had a problem \naffecting veterans that I think has been solved thanks to the work of \nSenator Rockefeller from West Virginia and Senator Warner, as well as \nthe Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  Those are the issues that I think are very important to our country \nwith respect to the tobacco bill. My hope is that in the coming days, \nwhether it be 3 or 5 days or a week and a half, that we will pass in \nthe Senate a piece of legislation that all of us can be proud of.\n  I defy anybody, I defy one person of any political persuasion or of \nany philosophical bent, I defy one person to stand up on the floor of \nthe Senate and defend this sort of behavior: Page after page after page \nof evidence that this industry knew that the teenagers of this country \nwere their target audience and deliberately tried to addict children to \nsmoking. I defy anybody to read this evidence and then tell me that is \nnot the case. If you believe, as I do, that this industry has seen \ndollar signs on the heads of America's kids, and you believe that is \nwrong, then we must believe, together, that we have a responsibility to \npass legislation of this type.\n  I am not saying every word is sacrosanct. There are plenty of ideas \nhere to add to this that perhaps can improve it. I say at the end of \nthe day we had better pass a piece of legislation that acknowledges the \nbankruptcy, the moral bankruptcy approach we have seen when we \nunearthed the information from the bowels of the tobacco industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5683-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5684-S5685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMPANY MERGERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I spoke 2 weeks ago on a subject that I \ncare deeply about. I want to just make a couple of additional points \nabout it, and that is this orgy of mergers that is occurring in America \ntoday. You can't wake up and take a look at the business section of any \nnewspaper in the country without seeing another big megamerger \nannouncement.\n  I come from, I believe, the Jeffersonian side of my party and share \nvery deeply the notion that the broad-based political freedoms in this \ncountry are nurtured by broad-based economic freedom. Broad-based \neconomic freedom comes from dotting the landscape all across this \ncountry with individual entrepreneurs, businesses, broadly based and \nowned businesses all across this country. That represents the free \nenterprise system, people having dreams and hopes and starting a \nbusiness and nurturing this business.\n  It doesn't mean to say that big is always bad or that small is always \nbeautiful. It is just to say this country works best, our free \nenterprise system works best and the market system works best when this \nis not dominated by enterprises that choke competition. We have decided \nin law a long, long while ago those that are choking down competition \nand trying to clog the arteries of the marketplace are violating\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nthe law. There is precious little enforcement these days. Antitrust \nactivities are kind of out of favor. But we are seeing an alarming \ngrowth of mergers in this country.\n  As I start, let me again say not every merger is bad. I am not here \nto say that. There are times when the mergers of a couple companies \nmake sense. But what is happening now is a wave of mergers that ought \nto be alarming to this country. Former Senator Hart, Phil Hart from the \nState of Michigan, did a lot of work on this issue. There is a building \nnamed after him here on Capitol Hill. He is probably the last person in \nCongress to talk much about merger activity and antitrust enforcement. \nIt is not sexy and it does not win any friends. But it does lose \nfriends.\n\n  Let me describe what happens. This chart shows merger completions in \nthe last 15 years. Take a look at the exponential growth of mergers. \nThis merger mania means you have fewer enterprises. They are buying \neach other, merging, some hostile takeovers, and two become one. It is \nlike getting married. You have two people that court each other; you \nhave two companies that court each other and they get married. You read \nit in the paper, but you don't even know they are dating. Sometimes it \nis a forced marriage as the case with hostile takeovers.\n  Here on this chart are all the marriages going on in corporate \nAmerica--two become one. The railroad industry--we used to have a lot \nof railroads. Now we have a very few railroads. They tell us what they \nare going to haul and how they are going to haul it. If you don't like \nit, tough luck. The airline industry--we used to have a lot of airlines \nin this country. Now we have a few. They have retreated into regional \nhubs and dominate the hub and say here is where we will fly and here is \nwhat it will cost. If you don't like it, go buy a jet. The \ntelecommunications industry--you talk about what is happening in \ntelecommunications. All of these big telecommunications companies are \nlooking around for suitors to find out who they can romance and who \nthey can add to their collection. Pretty soon, ten companies become \nfive and five become one. We have Baby Bells--they are not so baby \nanymore. Now they are getting married. So there are fewer Baby Bells \nbecause they are combining.\n  Let me just go through a couple of other charts to describe this \ncircumstance. Here we have the value of merger activity in this \ncountry. In 1998, $1.7 trillion. It is moving up exponentially. Those \nwho say that we believe in the free enterprise system, those who say \nthat the market system is critically important to the success of this \ncountry ought to be concerned about this.\n  Let me show a chart briefly with respect to the largest mergers. I \nshowed this 2 weeks ago and it has since changed because we had a \nchemical company and a pharmaceutical company that started dating and \nthen they decided to announce they were getting married--Monsanto and \nAmerican Home Products. On this chart are the 25 largest corporate U.S. \nmergers through June 2, 1998. Seventy billion, CitiCorp wants to join \nwith Travelers Group. Fifty-nine billion, BankAmerica wants to join \nwith National Bank.\n  While I am speaking about it, the banks, they of course, are a go-go \nindustry with respect to mergers. Last year, there were 599 bank \nmergers. The biggest banks are merging as quickly as you can open your \npaper these days. About 75 percent of the domestic banking assets are \nheld by 100 of the largest banks. The Federal Reserve Board has a \npolicy. In fact, if you are big enough, they call it ``too big to \nfail.'' If you are big enough, you are never going to be allowed to \nfail because the consequences of the failure would be too detrimental \nto the country. There used to be 11 too-big-to-fail banks. Eleven is \nnow 21 because all the big banks are getting bigger. So the next merger \nyou see with one of those banks, there is no risk to them. They can't \nfail. The American taxpayer has to pay the risk of a merger that turns \nsour.\n  Small community banks especially understand this problem. Let me talk \nabout the testimony of the president of the Independent Bankers \nAssociation of America. He says ``The evidence shows that increased \nconcentration in banking has not benefited bank customers.'' He adds \nthat ``larger banks charge higher fees, bank mergers have an adverse \neffect on consumer deposit prices, and small business lending receives \na short shrift in a world of ever-larger banks.''\n  Banks are just one area. I just stop to say that if you take a look \nat this list, it is banks, railroads, telecommunications companies, \ndefense companies. Frankly, I think it is alarming. I think Congress \nought to pay some attention to this.\n  I represent a lot of farmers. Family farmers aren't merging. They are \nout there fueling up a tractor, trying to plow in seeds, hoping to get \na crop. But when they market, they market back up through the neck of \nthe bottle. If they market meat, if they are raising a cow and are \ngoing to market the meat from the cow. In 1980 the big four packing \nplants had 36 percent of the market. In 1994, the big four meatpacking \nplants in this country had 82 percent of the market. This means that if \nyou are a farmer trying to market up through the neck of that bottle, \nthe products of meat--in this case perhaps pork or beef--you are \ndiscovering that you are marketing up towards a monopoly. On the top \nthey tell you what they will pay you for it. The same is true for the \ngrain farmer.\n  My point is it doesn't matter whether you are on Main Street or \nrunning a family farm. If you are operating in an economy in which big \ninterests are clogging the marketplace arteries, you have to be \nconcerned that this system doesn't work for you. Congress has a \nresponsibility and there are laws on the books that would require us to \nlook carefully and closely at merger proposals to see, is this in the \nbest interests of the country or will this injure the marketplace? Will \nthis injure the free enterprise system? In some cases, maybe not; in \nsome cases, maybe it will. In those cases, Congress has a \nresponsibility to act.\n\n  We had a circumstance with respect to airlines. For example, not too \nmany years ago we had a whole raft of merger proposals go to the \nDepartment of Transportation. The then-Secretary of Transportation \nnever met a merger she didn't love. It didn't matter what it was. \n``Just bring them up, and we'll try to merge them. We say amen, and we \nstamp `Approved.' '' The result is that we have had fewer airlines that \nretreated into regional monopolies. I think whether it is railroads, \nairlines, meatpacking plants, banks, or telecommunications companies, \nthis country functions best and our market system and free enterprise \nsystem functions best when you have robust, aggressive competition. I \nworry very much that those who are supposed to be minding the store are \npaying precious little attention to some of these issues.\n  Finally, let me say an encouraging word about one person who is \npaying some attention, and that is Joel Klein over in the Justice \nDepartment. I will not talk about any of the specific cases before \nthem, because I am not interested in doing that. But he is someone who \nheads the Antitrust Division. I hope this Congress provides substantial \nresources so that he has the capability and the people over there to \ninvestigate these mergers to determine whether they are in the best \ninterest of the country or whether they violate the law with respect to \nantitrust. I want those who are supposed to be the referees with \nrespect to the market system to make sure that competition abounds and \nthe market system works. I want Mr. Klein, head of the Antitrust \nDivision at Justice, to have the resources necessary to do that, and I \nhope my colleagues agree with me.\n  I am going to speak at greater length at another time. I apologize to \nthe Senator from Arizona. He has been waiting. I wanted to make the \npoint on mergers. I hope my colleagues on both the Republican and \nDemocratic sides who have an interest in this issue and an interest in \nmaking certain that those mergers that are fine proceed unimpeded, but \nthose that restrict and constrict and impede the market system ought to \nbe looked at with a fine-tooth comb to determine whether they ought to \nbe approved or rejected. I will have more to say on this at some point \nlater.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I want to discuss today the matter pending \nbefore us, S. 1415, the tobacco legislation. It is, as we have been \ntold by many people, one of the most expensive, complex, far-reaching \nlegislative proposals ever considered by the U.S. Senate. The stated \ngoal of the proposal is, of course, nonpartisan and universally \nrecognized--the reduction of teenage smoking. We all agree on that.\n  What a parent wants is for his or her children to grow up healthy and \nstrong. No parent really desires that their children become addicted to \ntobacco use. The issue is, what is the best way of achieving that goal, \nto go about discouraging teen smoking and highlighting the dangerous \nhealth risks associated with tobacco while also preserving individual \nadult liberties.\n  At the Federal level, I think we should also remind ourselves that \nunderage smoking is, at this time, illegal in all 50 States by State \nlaw. I think that as the Senate considers this legislation, we should \nkeep some fundamental principles in mind and they should be part of any \nlegislation we should eventually adopt.\n  Specifically, I think our legislation should include the following \ncomponents:\n  One, we should ensure that teen smoking is reduced. There are a \nvariety of mechanisms for doing that, including making vending machines \ninaccessible to children, conducting an advertising campaign \nspecifically directed toward children's tobacco use. I think we should \nensure that any tobacco tax increase does not create a black market. It \nis very difficult to know the magic point at which you have raised the \nprice enough to discourage its use without having, however, raised it \nso much that you create a black market. I think it is probably very \ndifficult to do that, as testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has confirmed.\n  I think we need to ensure that proceeds raised by any tax increase \nare primarily used for health-related purposes, such as Medicare, \nresearch for NIH, reimbursement to the States for their Medicaid \nexpenses, particularly associated with tobacco illnesses, and \nincreasing the self-employed health care tax deduction to 100 percent. \nIn that regard, incidentally, if there are excess moneys left over from \na tax, I think we should return it to the people. We could do that, \namong other ways, by significantly reducing the marriage penalty which \nis currently built into the Tax Code, that proposal already having been \nmade by Senator Gramm.\n  I think another principle that should be embodied in this legislation \nis to ensure that proceeds not be used to create new, or expand \nexisting, non-health-care-related Federal programs. One of the worst \nthings this body could do is to impose a huge new tax ostensibly \nrelating to tobacco use and curing its effects but, in fact, generating \nmoney to serve totally unrelated purposes, as some of our colleagues \nsuggest. That would be wrong.\n  I think another principle that should be embodied in any legislation \nwe adopt is that attorneys involved in the litigation regarding tobacco \nnot reap windfall profits at the expense of these education and smoking \nprevention programs, particularly when they are established for kids.\n  Finally, I think we should ensure that no provisions are included \nthat are virtually certain to later be adjudged to violate the first \namendment's protection to speech or other constitutional provisions.\n  Mr. President, the rest of the time I would like to address the link \nbetween tobacco use and drug use, especially by children, because while \nthere has been much legitimate concern expressed about the dangers of \nteenage smoking--and about that, as I said, I think there is no \ndisagreement--I think there has been insufficient attention paid to \nchildren's use of drugs and abuse of drugs and the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to deal with that problem as well. There is an even \ngreater danger of drug addiction, and the relationship between tobacco \nand drugs makes it clear that, in dealing with one, we can and should \ndeal with the other. I think our outrage should have some perspective \nhere, and if it does, we should all agree that drug use among children \nis much more dangerous than tobacco use, as bad as it is.\n  Now, I noted the connection between the two. Ironically, it appears \nto work both ways. For example, we have known for some time that \ncigarette smoking is often a precursor to drug addiction. So, \nobviously, this is another reason to deal with the problem of youth \ntobacco use. For example, a survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Administration reported that almost 75 percent of teens surveyed \nhad tried cigarettes before marijuana. Moreover, a 1996 national health \nsurvey on drug abuse showed that current smokers are more likely to be \nheavy drinkers and illicit drug users.\n  Equally disturbing is the apparent innovation by youth in combining \ntobacco and drugs. For example, some teens are now smoking cigarettes \nafter they smoke marijuana in order to enhance their high. I learned \nlast night that the reason for this is that apparently the methanol in \nsome cigarettes physiologically allows greater absorption of the THC in \nmarijuana and therefore does prolong or enhance the high. Others hollow \nout cigars and replace the tobacco with marijuana in order to maintain \na better high. This behavior illustrates the undeniable connection \nbetween tobacco and drugs. For this reason, I support linking our \neffort to reduce teen smoking with that expanded antidrug effort.\n\n  I believe we have to keep in mind recent polls which show that the \nparents of this country are much more concerned about drug use than \ntobacco use. Their No. 1 fear is their children will become involved in \nillegal drug use. By contrast, in the May 1998 survey published by The \nPolling Company, a very recent survey, parental concern about juvenile \ntobacco use ranks No. 6 on the list. Only 3 percent of the parents \ncited that, whereas with respect to the No. 1 concern, drug use, 39 \npercent of the parents mentioned that as their primary concern with \nrespect to their children.\n  According to Centers for Disease Control research, recently speaking \nto the New York Times, some kids maintain an illegal drug high by using \ntobacco, the same point that I had made earlier. And, obviously, what \nthis means is for these kids illegal drugs are the gateway to tobacco \nuse, and not the reverse, as I indicated earlier.\n  Drugs should be taken at least as seriously as tobacco. The two are \nundeniably linked. In dealing with one, we should deal with the other. \nI believe, therefore, that our effort to reduce teen smoking has to be \ntied to a renewed Federal commitment to reduce marijuana, cocaine, \nheroin, and methamphetamine use among both youth and adults. \nIncidentally, if we do that by a comparable amount, we will be \nreflecting the purpose of the Ashcroft proposal that has been presented \nto the Senate.\n  Let us look at some of the disturbing statistics. Prior to 1992, \nillegal drug use by high school seniors had fallen sharply, from 30 \npercent in 1985 to 14 percent in 1992. This is a very important \nstatistic, because today people say we are losing the war on drugs, we \ncan't win it, and therefore we ought to give up. Obviously, if we had \nsaid the same thing about tobacco use, we wouldn't be engaged in this \nimportant effort today to try to reduce tobacco use. But the people who \nsay we have lost the war on drugs are wrong because of the statistic \nthat I just cited. Once this country became engaged in the war on \ndrugs, particularly trying to reduce the use of drugs in schools, the \nuse by schoolkids of drugs dropped dramatically. It was cut in half.\n  Again, remember the statistics I am talking about. When we began this \neffort in about 1985, remember we created a drug czar's office, and \nBill Bennett and others went out and campaigned fervently against drug \nuse by kids. From 1985 to 1992, illegal drug use by high school seniors \nfell from 30 percent to 14 percent. So we were clearly making progress. \nWe had made substantial progress. We were doing good.\n  What happened after 1992? The process reversed. And, frankly, the \nreason for that is inattention, and in some\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\ncases downright hostility to the effort by the Clinton administration, \nand only recently reversed by the appointment of Gen. Barry McCaffrey \nas the drug czar. I think we can see that once we began to reassert our \neffort, we have begun to just barely see a little bit of progress.\n  During the first Clinton administration, illegal drug use among high \nschool students doubled. Heroin use for 8th and 12th graders has more \nthan doubled in the last 5 years. By 1996, one in four high school \nseniors and sophomores reported using drugs in the previous 30 days; 15 \npercent of 8th graders reported using drugs in the previous 30 days.\n\n  So the point of these statistics is that once we became engaged in \nthe war on drugs, we dramatically reduced their use by kids. We cut it \nin half. What happened when we stopped? It went right back to where it \nhad been.\n  Equally disturbing about our inattention to this problem over the \nlast 5 years is the fact that, as a result, drug users are getting \nyounger and younger. A survey last year by the Center for Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University showed that 500,000 eighth \ngraders began using marijuana in sixth and seventh grades. As we all \nknow, there are more victims, incidentally, in this drug use than just \nthe user because, of course, drugs are linked to crime. According to \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics, 36 percent of convicted jail inmates \nsaid that they were using drugs at the time of their offense in 1996. \nThat was compared to 27 percent in 1989.\n  So by a third we found more drug use among those people committing \ncrimes. Moreover, 16 percent of convicted jail inmates said they had \ncommitted their offense to get money for drugs. We believe the \nstatistics are much higher. But at least it is astonishing that that \nnumber would admit that they committed their crimes in order to get \ndrugs. We know one in four property and drug offenders had committed \ntheir crimes to get money for drugs. And in a place like Arizona, where \nyou have such high property crime rates, we know the strong connection \nbetween the two. In my hometown of Phoenix, for example, we lead the \ncountry in another kind of theft--postal theft by addicts in order to \nget money.\n  According to the postal inspector, 90 percent of these thefts are \ncommitted by meth addicts. It is their preferred method of maintaining \ntheir high.\n  I also note, Mr. President, that in reminding ourselves of the \nconnection between drug use and crime, to make the point that drug use \nis not a victimless crime, we should also think of the individual drug \nuser and his or her family.\n  I recently held a field hearing in Phoenix primarily on the subject \nof methamphetamine use and the costs to society of having to clean up \nthe meth laboratories and the environmental concerns and the dangers to \npeople as a result of these toxic substances in their midst. But one of \nthe witnesses was a young woman named Heather, a student, who told us \nabout her beginning the use of drugs, starting with a free offer of \ndrugs when she was in grade school, and working on up through the use \nof harder and harder drugs until, by her own words, she was a ``mess'' \nby the time she was in high school. She noted the fact that she wasn't \nthe only person who was affected by her drug use. Her friends, her \nfamily, and, in particular, her mother were deeply affected by what she \nwent through and what they had to bear as a result of her drug use. \nFortunately, she was one of the ones who decided to try to kick the \nhabit, and, after several difficult tries, appears now to be on a path \nof recovery and abstinence and of getting her life turned around.\n  But it is a terrible, terrible struggle for anyone, but certainly \nincluding kids who have become addicted to drugs, to try to get off of \nthe drugs and turn their life around. In the context of the tobacco \ndebate, I just ask everyone to think about this for a minute. We all \nget used to doing certain things that we know aren't good for us. It is \nhard to change our habits. We all, most of us at least when you get to \nour age, would like to lose a little more weight. We don't like the \nfact that gravity has its inevitable impact on our bodies, and we begin \nto not quite look like we did when we were 20 years old. We would like \nto eat a little less and have more self-discipline about our weight. It \nis hard to do. We would like to discipline ourselves to do other \nthings. It is hard to do. We get to tobacco use, and we know it really \nbecomes hard because there are physiological addictive qualities to \nnicotine that makes us crave tobacco. For many people, it is very, very \nhard to stop using tobacco as a result of that addictive quality. But \nas hard as that is, it is orders of magnitude more difficult for hard \ndrug users and even soft drug users to stop their behavior to get over \ntheir addiction. It is much, much harder.\n  When you hear the story of a young woman like Heather and what she \nhas gone through and how difficult it was for her, I think it makes it \ncrystal clear to us that as we are focused on tobacco and because of \nthe connection between tobacco and drugs it is also very important for \nus to take this opportunity at this time to also recommit ourselves to \nfight this war on drugs for the sake of the people who are becoming \naddicted to drugs every day, for the sake of their friends and the sake \nof their families, as well as the rest of us in society who end up \nbearing the costs of their addiction.\n\n  Because of the seriousness of this increase in drug use by our youth, \nI am very troubled that the goal of the administration in its 1998 \nNational Drug Control Strategy is not more ambitious. What is its goal? \nIts goal is to get us back, a couple of years after the turn of the \ncentury, to where we were when President Clinton took office. That is \nnot only not very ambitious, but I think we could say it does not even \nbegin to express the degree of commitment that we ought to be making.\n  For the sake of the kids who at least are of junior high age today, \nwe have to do better than that. That is why I am an original cosponsor \nof the Gramm-Domenici-Kyl Teenage Health Preservation Act. Let me just \ntell you a little bit about what the Teenage Health Preservation Act \nwill do and why we think it is so important to be included within this \ntobacco legislation.\n  Because of the link between underage tobacco use, illegal drugs, and \ncrime, as I indicated earlier, we have established several important \nprovisions in this legislation that I think get to each of those \nproblems.\n  First, we would establish a $5 billion antismoking, antidrug \nadvertising campaign. We know that kids watch a lot of television. We \nknow that they are susceptible to advertising. We know that there can \nbe some very effective, good advertising telling them why they should \nnot take on drugs or tobacco use. We would establish a five-member \ncommission, with members nominated by the President, confirmed by the \nSenate, responsible for developing a comprehensive antidrug and \nantismoking advertising campaign. This $5 billion over 5 years would be \nfunded out of the National Teenage Health Security Trust Fund \nestablished under the legislation.\n  We also establish some antidrug and antismoking provisions and \npenalties, increasing, for example, by 50 percent the drug interdiction \nbudgets of the Customs Service, Coast Guard, and the Department of \nDefense for activities along the U.S.-Mexican border and the Caribbean \nregion; doubling the number of Border Patrol agents to achieve a level \nof 15,000 over the next 5 years; increasing the law enforcement budgets \nof the DEA and FBI by 25 percent; adopting the McCain antismuggling \nlanguage which directs the Treasury Department to require the placement \nof a unique serial number on each pack of cigarettes to assist in \ndetermining the location and date of production. It would impose \npenalties of not less than 10 years of imprisonment for any adult who \nsells drugs to a minor, and a second offense would be life in prison.\n  We would establish a Federal penalty of not less than 20 years for \nany person convicted of smuggling illegal drugs into the United States \nand, again, for a second offense, a penalty of life imprisonment. We \nwould impose a fine of up to $100,000 and a term of imprisonment of up \nto 5 years for smuggling cigarettes into the United States. Those who \nwould knowingly sell smuggled cigarettes to teenagers would face up to \na year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n  Mr. President, let me just note, some of these fines may sound very \ndrastic,\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\nbut if we are going to get serious about this problem we have to do \nsome very different kinds of things. I don't think it is too much to \nsay that a fine up to $10,000 and up to a year in prison is too much \nfor people who are smuggling cigarettes and selling them to teenagers, \nif we are really serious about this problem.\n  We would suspend Federal student loan eligibility for teenagers who \nuse drugs or purchase cigarettes. The penalty for drug convictions \nwould be a year's suspension of eligibility for Federal student loans, \nand a second offense would be a permanent loss of eligibility for \nstudent loans. For teen cigarette purchase, it would be a warning the \nfirst time around, a 6-months suspension of eligibility for the second \noffense, and a year's suspension for the third offense. So there would \nbe important penalties attached to all of these.\n  We would establish a Teenage Health Security block grant program to \nthe States. The distribution of the funds is linked to State adoption \nof sanctions for teenage tobacco use. The States themselves need to do \nmore to enforce their already existing laws against youth smoking.\n  We would adopt the McCain requirement that warning statements on \ncigarette packages take up not less than 25 percent of the upper space \non the pack on the front and back of each package. Importantly, as I \nsaid before, vending machine sale of cigarettes would be restricted to \nareas that are not accessible to children or teenagers.\n  The payment that would be called for here, we think, should be capped \nat a per-pack amount that is estimated to be below the trigger point of \nsignificantly increased black market activity. After financing the tax \nreductions--in other words, the self-employed health insurance \ndeduction that we talked about earlier--all of the remaining amounts \nwould be deposited in a new National Teenage Health Security Trust \nFund. We think the total amount of the tax that would be required in \nthis case would be on the order of 75 cents per pack.\n  We think that full deductibility of health insurance and smoking \ncessation programs is called for, and therefore under this legislation \nwe would provide for an accelerated phase-in of a 100-percent \ndeductibility of health care insurance for the self-employed, to be \neffective January 1, 1999. We would allow all workers not covered by an \nemployer-provided insurance to deduct fully the cost of health \ninsurance. This is the Roth proposal on the above-the-line deduction, \nso to speak.\n  In addition, low-income working taxpayers who are eligible for the \nearned-income tax credit could take advantage of the health insurance \ndeduction. Specifically, the cost of health insurance premiums would be \nexcluded from their modified adjusted gross income for purposes of the \nearned-income tax credit. This would not apply to an individual covered \nby employer-provided health insurance or by Medicaid. The cost of an \nFDA-approved smoking cessation program would be deductible and treated \nas an above-the-line deduction as well.\n  I mentioned the National Teenage Health Security Trust Fund in this \nproposal. It would finance all the programs and initiatives which are \ncreated by the legislation. The Department of the Treasury would \nestablish an accounting mechanism necessary to ensure that the trust \nfund deposits and outlays are credited properly, and all expenditures \nfrom the fund would be outside the spending caps, but all would have to \nbe appropriated on an annual basis. There would be no new entitlement \nor mandatory spending programs.\n  No distributions or expenditures from the fund would be permitted for \nany purpose other than a specific authorization provided in the Teenage \nHealth Preservation Act. Any moneys remaining in the Trust Fund after \nthe annual appropriations process has concluded would be transferred to \nMedicare.\n  I mention the increased funds for the National Institutes of Health. \nThis legislation would earmark an additional $5 billion over the next 5 \nyears from the trust fund to the NIH in addition to--in addition to--\nthe $15.5 billion increases over 5 years already provided in our budget \nresolution of this year.\n  With regard to the State settlements with tobacco companies, we would \nguarantee the right of tobacco companies and the individual States to \nenter into legally binding--within the border of each State--settlement \nagreements, including limiting liability if that is what the States \nnegotiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you. I will conclude with this brief description.\n  The windfall profits tax on lawyers' fees that I mentioned earlier \nwould provide, for States where there have been tobacco settlements \nreached, lawyer fees above $1,000 per hour but below $1,500 an hour \nwould be subject to a surtax of 20 percent, and fees in excess of \n$1,500 an hour would be subject to a surtax of 40 percent.\n  Bear in mind the level of fees I am talking about. While a good \nlawyer today might charge up to $200, $250 an hour--you know, the \nreally superstars, maybe even $300 or $400 an hour--we are talking \nabout $1,500 an hour here before this would kick in. But, amazingly, \nthere are some lawyers who are getting far more than that in these \ntobacco settlements.\n  There are some other provisions in here, but I will not go into the \ndetails in the interests of time. Also pending before us right now is \nthe Coverdell-Craig-Abraham Drug Free Neighborhoods Act. I also \nstrongly support that legislation. That legislation has been adequately \ndescribed by Senator Coverdell a little bit earlier this afternoon. It \nhas the drug-free teen drivers provision, the drug-free schools \nprovision, which is very important. It emphasizes drug-free workplaces. \nI think it is very important for us to recognize that we are not going \nto be able to have drug-free workplaces if it is possible for people in \nthis country to use drugs legally. Finally, there are key provisions \nfor drug-free communities support.\n  I might just note, too, a couple of the very specific provisions of \nthe bill that I particularly like. It bans free needles for drug \naddicts and has a very important money laundering provision and a \nregistration of convicted drug dealers.\n  These are some important things that we can be doing to enhance the \ntobacco legislation before us to apply to the drug problem that also \nfaces our youth today.\n  We can't let this opportunity slip to address the national drug \nproblem at the same time that we are addressing the important tobacco \nissue. Underage smoking is a serious problem, but smoking doesn't \nresult in the crimes against the person and property that illegal drug \nuse does. We have to focus at least as much attention on the problem of \nillegal drug use as on the problem of underage smoking. It is important \nto remember, Mr. President, that underage smoking represents only 2 \npercent of all smoking occurring in the United States. Teenage drug \naddiction is a critical and growing problem within this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nbe speaking in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business \nwith speakers allowed to speak up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5686-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5688-S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VETERANS AND HIGHWAY TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will address two subjects, \nprimarily veterans and the highway technical corrections bill. But in \nthis morning's Congressional Daily, the majority leader, when referring \nto the question of the matter of the treatment of disabled veterans who \nhave been addicted to smoking and have become disabled because of that, \nsaid, ``Where was Rockefeller when we passed this bill?'' And that is a \nquote.\n  The majority leader has publicly questioned my record on the issue of \nveterans' smoking-related disability rights, and I really thought I had \na duty to set the record straight.\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\n  The Clinton administration has met with me on several occasions on \nthe veterans smoking issue. I told the Director of OMB and I told the \nSecretary of Veterans' Affairs at least a year ago that I would \nvigorously oppose their proposal to deny veterans' disability rights. I \nhave maintained that exact position all along.\n  When the Senate considered this year's Republican budget resolution \nin March, I offered an amendment to strike the budget language which \nwould have transferred the smoking disability rights issue to the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee and assumed denial of \nsmoking-related disability rights--assumed denial of those rights. My \namendment was defeated, frankly, fairly much along party lines.\n  When the ISTEA bill was brought to the floor by the committee, there \nwere no provisions at all in that highway bill which would have denied \nveterans disability rights. I support, therefore, highways and I \nsupported the ISTEA bill. I voted for it.\n  But in the course of the highway bill conference, language was \ninserted to deny smoking-related disability rights in the deep of the \nnight, with no consultation--nothing. Of course, as we know now, even \nthis midnight raid was not done correctly and requires major \ncorrections, and I refer to the highway technical corrections bill. \nSince the conference report was not amendable, there was nothing that I \ncould do about that. There was no opportunity to reverse at that point \nthe injustice that was being done. I could not offer an amendment. It \nwas called a conference report.\n  The corrections bill on TEA 21 provides for the first time, \ntherefore, the opportunity to fully protect highways and veterans. We \nno longer need to make a choice of one over the other. Highways will \nremain fully authorized. They will not lose a dime. Veterans' \ndisability rights will be preserved.\n  The Republican leader asked where was Rockefeller? I am pleased to \nrespond that I have been busy protecting the rights of disabled \nAmerican veterans. That is where I have been.\n  Further, Mr. President, I rise to urge the Republican leader to bring \nup H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill, for immediate floor \nconsideration in the Senate. Our failure to have this corrections bill \nconsidered immediately will have a devastating impact on veterans' \ndisability rights.\n  As I indicated yesterday to my colleagues, when H.R. 3978 is \nconsidered, I plan to offer an amendment--and nothing will stop me from \noffering an amendment if that bill comes up, and I will object to other \nbills coming up in order to force that bill to come up if I am able to \nso exercise my due parliamentary rights --I plan to offer an amendment \nto strike the veterans' disability compensation offset from the \nunderlying conference report on H.R. 2400. I have asked for a very \nlimited time agreement of 30 minutes equally divided--15 minutes for \neach side does not seem to me unreasonable--and then a vote.\n  As the Presiding Officer is very well aware, adoption of my amendment \nwill have the effect of preserving current law; that is, it will \npreserve existing disability rights for veterans, the status quo. It \nwill simply preserve what already exists--nothing new--what already \nexists, and will fully preserve each and every highway project that was \nincluded in the ISTEA bill. That is such an important point to make.\n  Some people think we are talking about removing billions of dollars \nfrom highways. We are not. Not one dime will be lost to highways. All \nof that money is going to have to be appropriated by the Appropriations \nCommittee in any event. Let me repeat that: Every highway project in \nISTEA, now TEA 21, will remain fully authorized after my amendment is \nadopted, if adopted. They will be in law, so to speak.\n  The highways will be in law. If the leadership permits the TEA bill \nto stand as is by failing to raise the corrections bill, veterans' \ndisability rights will be eliminated and the current law will be \nchanged. Smoking will be considered an act of ``willful misconduct'' in \nthe military, and we will be cutting smoking-related disability \nbenefits for veterans who became ill on active duty and those who \nbecame ill due to exposure to Agent Orange and those who became ill due \nto exposure to ionizing radiation. This goes far beyond the intended \nscope of even the conferees, I have confidence in that.\n  Mr. President, roads and bridges are, obviously, very important to \nthe State of West Virginia, which is only 4 percent flat. I support \nhighways. I support highway funding. Not a single project in West \nVirginia or in any other State--I repeat and repeat again--will be \naffected in any way by the amendment which I will put forward if given \na chance.\n  This amendment is a proveteran amendment. It is simply whether we are \ngoing to deny disabled American veterans the rights they now have under \nthe law. There has been a great injustice done to America's veterans, \nand this corrections bill is an opportunity to remedy that injustice.\n  Existing law requires the payment of disability compensation to \nveterans who can prove in a very complicated process that they became \naddicted to tobacco while in military service, if that addiction \ncontinued without interruption and resulted in an illness and in a \ndisability. Addiction is the illness; addiction is the issue. The \nconference report on the highway bill rescinded--that is, cut--this \ncompensation to disabled veterans for tobacco-related illnesses \nresulting from nicotine addiction that began in service.\n  This cut in veterans' disability compensation generated $17 billion \nin what only can be called the most extraordinary paper savings that I \nhave come across in my 13 years in the Senate, and these paper savings \nwere literally stolen from veterans and used to partially fund an \nunprecedented increase in the ISTEA fund.\n  Of course, anyone familiar with these claims for compensation for \ntobacco-related illnesses, and there will be few who are, knows that \nOMB's cost estimate is just a guess. They just guessed, and they sort \nof guessed in a way that they could pay for a lot of the other \nPresident's program ideas. I didn't appreciate that, but that is the \ngame they decided they were going to play, and so that is what they \ndid. They tried to talk me out of my objections to it, and they could \nnot. That is my administration, not the Presiding Officer's. The so-\ncalled savings we are spending on highways are just that, they are \npaper savings.\n  Since 1993, the Veterans' Administration has only received less than \n8,000 claims--the Presiding Officer will be interested in this; since \n1993, there have been only 8,000 claims for these tobacco-related \ndisability illnesses-- and has granted only 200 to 300--200 to 300. So \n27 million veterans and only 200 to 300 disability claims for smoking-\nrelated illnesses granted by the Veterans' Administration.\n\n  In arriving at its $17 billion estimate, the administration, for some \nunexplained reason, estimated that 500,000 veterans would apply for \ntobacco-related claims every year, Mr. President. It is absurd; it is \nridiculous. It is a shell game. It was intended to pay for some of \ntheir other programs. And in the process, they wanted to cut off \ndisability claims for veterans who are owed them. It is make-believe.\n  The amendment that I offer would maintain current law as is by \nreversing the highway bill's raid on veterans.\n  My amendment strikes no highway project. My amendment merely \npreserves VA's disability compensation for tobacco-related conditions \nas is.\n  I am sure we will hear a good deal of doomsday projections about the \neffect of this amendment. Again, here are the facts. The amendment does \nnot otherwise affect the highway bill or the projects that it \nauthorized. They remain the same. They are unaffected. My amendment \nwill not bring down the highway bill, will not create a sequester. I \ncan read you law on that. But I will spare the Presiding Officer that. \nBut those who say that, ``Oh, this will cause a sequester and a cut in \nMedicare, Social Security,'' the Presiding Officer and others will hear \nthat argument--that argument is wrong. That argument is wrong. Those \nare the contentions of those who would deny disability benefits to \nveterans.\n  When we argued this issue 2 months ago, when my amendment to the \nbudget resolution was debated, I warned my colleagues that veterans \nwould be justifiably outraged by this raid on their disability \ncompensation program, and they are.\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\n  America's veterans perceive that Congress has turned its back on the \nGovernment's responsibility and promise to care for its veterans and on \nthe role it played in fostering their addiction to tobacco--that is \nwell known to the Presiding Officer and all other Members--distribution \nof free cigarettes in C-rations and K-rations; reduced prices; and they \ndelayed the warning that appeared on tobacco in the military cigarettes \nuntil 5 years after it had been done at the civilian level.\n  Mr. President, we have spent weeks talking about addiction to tobacco \nand how powerful that addiction is and how that addiction has been \nfostered. Why is it when it comes to the issue of veterans and tobacco, \nit is viewed solely as a matter of personal choice? Why is it that this \nadministration and this Congress believe that veterans should have had \ngreater knowledge about tobacco's addictive properties when they began \nsmoking than the general public did?\n  Veterans believe in doing their share and carrying their weight. They \nalways have; they always will. But the Congress is not asking for cuts \nin all accounts this year, oh, no. In fact, we are not even demanding \nthat others, such as Social Security disability recipients, lose \nsmoking-related compensation. Again, only veterans are singled out for \nthis treatment.\n  There has been a lot of talk about veterans and smoking in the last \nfew months. So I want to make sure that my colleagues are not confused. \nThe amendment that was adopted on Tuesday to direct a portion of the \nproceeds from the tobacco bill to VA health care in the tobacco bill, \nby voice vote, is only for health care. The tobacco-related amendment \ndoes not deal with disability benefits, compensation; only with health \ncare, not compensation, benefits for tobacco-related illnesses. That is \na major point.\n  Those of my colleagues who will seek refuge in the tobacco \nlegislation need to reconsider. And, in fact, in some sadness I am not \neven sure there will be tobacco legislation. I hope otherwise. But one \ncannot be confident at this point.\n  In any event, some will say--and I close on this point--that the \ncorrections bill puts in $1.6 billion for other veterans programs. And \nindeed it does. But our friends in the veterans community speak with \none voice on this issue. And I agree. They cannot support the increase \nin benefits to one set of veterans to be paid by the cutting of \nimportant benefits to another set of veterans.\n  Veterans across this Nation reject this attempt to buy them off. That \nis why I urge support of my amendment. It is a simple choice. Again, \nthe choice is not highways versus veterans. Highways are fully \nprotected. Veterans are not. Please choose veterans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for the next 25 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5688-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5690-S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TOBACCO LEGISLATION AND THE COVERDELL-CRAIG AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to support the \nCoverdell-Craig amendment. As the Chair knows, and Members know, the \nCoverdell-Craig amendment was offered yesterday to the underlying \nMcCain tobacco bill. I congratulate my colleague from Georgia and my \ncolleague from Idaho for this very worthwhile amendment.\n  Let me first, though, begin by saying, again, what I have said \nnumerous times on the Senate floor in the last few weeks, and that is I \nsupport the underlying McCain bill.\n  It represents a unique and critical opportunity to change attitudes \nand to save young lives from the debilitating effects of smoking. All \nof us know, Mr. President, all too well, that youth smoking is a \ncomponent of an even larger and more dangerous reality, the tragedy of \nyouth drug use.\n  If we had to talk about the health problems in this country today, \nparticularly if we want to talk about the preventable health problems \nin this country, we would talk about illicit drug use, we would talk \nabout smoking, and we would talk about abuse of alcohol. Those three \nare clearly the three biggest, the things that will ultimately kill \ntens of thousands of Americans. They prey on our young.\n  So I think it makes sense, as we struggle in this Senate to come up \nwith a comprehensive bill that deals with our tobacco problem in this \ncountry, that we also use this as an opportunity to deal with another \nproblem, and certainly a related problem, and that is the use of \nillicit drugs. So I congratulate my friends and colleagues from Georgia \nand Idaho, Senator Coverdell, Senator Craig, for this very good \namendment.\n  I think we need to use this unique opportunity to address youth \nsmoking. But we also need to take it one step further and address youth \ndrug use. Doing so would make this even more effective, this current \nbill, the McCain bill, even more effective in changing the young lives \nfor the better.\n  Mr. President, drug trafficking remains a tragic reality of life in \nthis country today. Let me share some facts with my colleagues.\n  Fact: Recent reports suggest that heroin trafficking from Mexico has \ndramatically increased.\n  Fact No. 2: The Caribbean is fast becoming once again a major illegal \ndrug transit route.\n  Fact: While drug production and trafficking have been on the rise, \nour resources we, as a country, have dedicated for drug interdiction \nhave dramatically declined.\n  In 1987, approximately 27 percent of the entire national drug control \nbudget was dedicated to interdiction. During that period of time, the \nUnited States did, in fact, make a dent in the trafficking of \nnarcotics. Cocaine seizures, for example, were significantly up.\n  However, Mr. President, starting in the early 1990s, the percentage \nof drug control funds devoted to interdiction has declined \ndramatically. In fact, by 1995, only 10 percent of the national drug \nbudget was dedicated to interdiction--a very significant drop. By 1998, \nthe percentage still remained at 10 percent. Looking at it another way, \nin 1992, over $2 billion was dedicated to interdiction purposes. But by \n1995, only $1.2 billion was set aside for this specific matter.\n  Mr. President, let me be very clear. I strongly support--strongly \nsupport--increased funding to deal with the demand side of the drug \nsituation that is finding ways to persuade Americans, particularly \nyoung Americans, that doing drugs is wrong, that it destroys lives, and \ndestroys families, schools, and communities.\n\n  In a sense, Mr. President, we could argue that in the end reducing \ndemand is the only real effective way to ultimately overcome the threat \nof drugs in this country today. As long as there is a demand for drugs, \nthere will always be a supply. That is why education as well as drug \ntreatment remains central long-term goals.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Georgia and the Senator \nfrom Idaho recognizes the need to invest in demand-reduction efforts, \nas well as the need to invest in interdiction efforts. However, \nreducing the demand for drugs is not going to be achieved overnight. It \nwill take years, if not generations, to change minds and attitudes \nregarding the use or abuse of drugs.\n  I believe one way to reduce demand is to have an effective \ninterdiction policy, one that will put a serious dent into the flow of \ndrugs into this country. We must find ways to raise the cost of \nnarcotics trafficking, making it far more difficult for drug lords to \nbring these drugs to our Nation and making the cost of drugs on the \nstreets--whether that be the streets of New York, Los Angeles or \nCleveland--making the cost of those drugs go up. Just like the \nunderlying bill, we can impact demand by raising the street value of \ndrugs, and we can do that by going after the supply routes.\n  There is an inverse relationship between the cost and consumption. I \nbelieve that is true with drugs. I believe that is also true with \ncigarettes. That is the basic principle of the McCain bill. I think it \nis logical to extend that principle, as my colleagues have done, \nSenator Coverdell and Senator Craig, in this amendment.\n  As I mentioned, I do want to make it very, very clear: Drug \ninterdiction,\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nwhich I am talking about this afternoon, is only one of the things that \nwe have to do. We have to have good domestic law enforcement. We have \nto deal with the problem of treatment. Treatment does work. It is tough \nbut it can, in fact, work. We can save lives. We have to continue to \ninvest in treatment. Education prevention--that works, as well, as long \nas we are consistent. As long as we do something consistently through a \nchild's life, it works. So we need to focus on that, as well.\n  Let me turn now to what I was talking about a moment ago, that is the \nneed to increase our emphasis on drug interdiction. As I mentioned \nbefore, the Caribbean is becoming more and more the transit route of \nchoice for drug traffickers. I made two visits to this transit zone in \nthe Caribbean in the last several months. During my last visit, I \nlearned that our agents in the Bahamas have seized more cocaine in the \nfirst 3 months of 1998 than in the past previous 3 years combined. With \nsufficient funding, interdiction efforts can make a huge difference. \nClearly, drastic funding reductions have drastic consequences when it \ncomes to results.\n  I had the chance on these visits to meet with the soldiers on the \nfront lines, or sailors on the front lines of our war on drugs. I \nwitnessed our strategy in action. I sat down with the experts, both \nmilitary and civilian, the people who are actually on the front line, \nthe people who are charged with carrying out the monitoring, the \ndetection, and the interdiction of drugs. Given what I have learned \nduring these visits and the conclusions I have reached, the amendment \nby the Senators from Georgia and Idaho could not have come at a better \ntime. There is a dire need for a renewed commitment, a rededication of \nresources toward drug interdiction.\n\n  With energy and with adequate resources, our drug interdiction \nefforts can be improved. We cannot ask those tasked to implement our \ndrug interdiction strategy to conduct their missions without the proper \nlevel of resources to do the job. One reason why is simple: This drug \ninterdiction puts the lives of these law enforcement officers in \ndanger. That is the nature of the business. We have to ensure that they \nhave the best equipment, the best resources and the best intelligence \nso that they can carry out this mission, not only so they can be \neffective, but so they can do it in as safe a way as humanly possible. \nThe men and women charged with interdicting drugs face a ruthless enemy \nwho will go to great lengths to protect their cartel. We are dealing \nwith millions and millions of dollars.\n  When I visited the Caribbean last month, I saw videos of drug \ntraffickers in ``go-fast'' boats--that is what they are called, go-fast \nboats--that are made almost exclusively for the only purpose of \nbringing drugs up from Colombia, bringing up drugs from that part of \nthe world. I saw videos of the go-fast boats literally running over \nCustoms vessels in the shallow waters south of Florida during a \nnighttime interdiction pursuit. I believe we owe it to these law \nenforcement officers to ensure they have the proper equipment and \nmanpower to do the job they were asked to perform. After all, it is \nunfortunate reality that the drug cartels don't have a budget process \nor a bureaucracy to slow them down. These drug cartels, these drug \nlords, are constantly adjusting to their environment and updating their \nequipment.\n  What kind of resources are we talking about? What kind of resources \ndo I believe we are lacking? Let me use the U.S. Customs Service \noperating in south Florida as just one example. In 1986, Customs had 77 \nvessels and 124 maritime officers. Today, they are now down to 30 \nvessels and 23 officers. Funding for the Maritime Enforcement Program \nis down from $13.25 million--that was the figure in 1992--to $5.2 \nbillion. So we have gone from $13.25 million in 1992 to $5.2 million in \n1997.\n  Further, Customs no longer has a 7-day, 24-hour operation. To make \nmatters worse, Customs not only lacks basic resources, they also lack \n1990s technology. A Colombian go-fast boat can go between 80 and 90 \nmiles per hour, while the few Customs go-fast boats that are available \nonly top about 70 miles per hour. So not only does Customs lack \nresources in general, they lack the state-of-the-art equipment needed \nto match those of the drug lords.\n  On my most recent trip, I visited the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force \nlocated in Key West, FL. This is the primary hub for detection, \nmonitoring, and interdiction efforts. During these visits, I saw \nfirsthand that our government agencies there--and there are many--have \ntremendous monitoring and detection capability, and they are doing a \ngood job. They can detect when a small, drug-carrying aircraft is \nleaving Colombia and making the journey across the Caribbean.\n  Unfortunately, however, while we may have the capability to detect \nand monitor drug trafficking in the Caribbean airspace, we do not have \nadequate resources and capabilities for the end game--the actual \nseizing of illegal drugs in transit. And the drug lords know this. For \nexample, I was informed that of the total drug air events in the \nBahamas from April of 1997 until April 1998, our U.S. agents state that \nthere was only an 8-percent success rate of stopping drug air flights \nthat have been detected--8 percent. That means approximately 92 percent \ngot away. And though cocaine seizures are up, their concern is the \nhigher amounts seized represent probably a fraction of the total amount \nof drugs coming through the area.\n  While in Key West, I was also briefed on specific interdiction \nefforts in the eastern Pacific. I was surprised to find out that in the \neastern Pacific, off the coast of Mexico and Central America, up this \nregion that is cut off on the map, the coast is virtually, literally \nclear for drug lords to do their business. Mr. President, this is \nsimply not acceptable.\n\n  The U.S. Government--and I am talking about us--is not effectively \ndealing with this increasingly large threat in the Eastern Pacific. We \nhave virtually no presence because of the lack of funding. I was \nbriefed about an operation called Caper Focus, which would have focused \non interdiction efforts in the area. We would have had a number of \nsurface assets and aircraft to patrol the waters and interdict. This \noperation, unfortunately, was canceled before it started because of a \nDepartment of Defense decision to send the needed surface assets \nelsewhere. To date, this issue has not been resolved, and the coastal \nwaters in the Eastern Pacific are open for drug business.\n  Mr. President, our men and women who work on interdiction matters on \na daily basis are committed to success, but they are not getting the \nsupport that they really need from us. Because of limited resources, we \nare selectively spending resources--a little bit here and a little bit \nthere, a little bit at a time, and in different places. This, of \ncourse, has tremendous negative consequences.\n  With more limited resources, we could seal off one or two of the so-\ncalled ``drug corridors,'' but the reality is that drug routes are \nconstantly in flux, as the traffickers always seek to exploit the \nchinks in the armor of law enforcement. This phenomenon has been \ncompared to the squeezing of a balloon--squeezing it at one end and it \npops out on the other. That is the problem we have constantly run into \nin this antidrug effort. When we step up efforts in one area, like \nsqueezing a balloon on one end, the traffickers just move to another \narea.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example of this. On one of my recent \ntrips I saw that, in particular, Haiti has become an attractive rest-\nstop on the cocaine highway. Haiti is strategically located about \nhalfway between the source country--Colombia--and the destination \ncountry--right here in the United States. Haitian law enforcement, \nthough slowly getting better, is really unequipped to put a dent in the \ndrug trade. What's more, their coast guard fleet, while it is improving \nand we are working with it, consists of a handful of boats. And as it \nis the poorest country in the hemisphere, by far, Haiti is extremely \nvulnerable to the kind of bribery and corruption that the drug trade \nneeds in order to flourish. It is not surprising that the level of \ndrugs moving through Haiti has dramatically increased.\n  According to a U.S. Government interagency assessment on cocaine \nmovement, in 1996, between 5 and 8 percent of the cocaine coming into \nthe U.S. passed through Haiti. By the third quarter of 1997, the \npercentage jumped 12 percent, and then it increased to 19 percent by \nthe end of that year.\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\n  Mr. President, accordingly, because of that, we responded to this \ncrisis with a military operation called Operation Frontier Lance. \nOperation Frontier Lance utilized Coast Guard cutters, speedboats, and \nhelicopters to detect and capture drug dealers on a 24-hour per day \nbasis. Incidentally, Mr. President, this operation was modeled after \nanother successful interdiction effort off the coast of Puerto Rico, \ncalled Operation Frontier Shield. However, unfortunately, funding for \nFrontier Lance ran out and the operation just ceased. In fact, it \nceased on Monday of this week. I had the opportunity to be on one of \nthe cutters that was off the coast of Haiti and talk to the men and \nwomen who were so proud of the tremendous job they were doing. This \npotential roadblock on the cocaine highway is no more. Again, it ceased \nto exist this past Monday. The reality also is that Coast Guard funding \nhas been slashed in the past several years. I think this is a mistake.\n\n  It is my hope that by passing the Coverdell-Craig amendment, we can \njump start Operation Frontier Lance, and other similar programs. We \nneed to get back into the game.\n  Now, Mr. President, our first and best resource in this antidrug \neffort, of course, is people. We are lacking in personnel in areas \nwhere we need it the most. Of the more than 100 U.S. drug enforcement \nagents authorized to be in the Caribbean, I was surprised to find only \none agent in Haiti last March when I visited. Since my March visit, the \nDEA has agreed to add six more agents; that is clearly the direction in \nwhich we ought to go. But we also need additional manpower, men and \nwomen, to go to the Dominican Republic, and other areas of the \nCaribbean as well.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, one of the major problems \nregarding our current interdiction efforts is that we are using scarce \nresources sparingly. The drug traffickers know that if we place \nresources in one or two selective places, they will just switch their \nroutes and go elsewhere. A more logical approach, more funding \npermitting, would be to have more manpower and resources at different \nkey places at the same time; or, in other words, ``squeeze the \nballoon'' at different ends--all at the same time. I believe that we \ncan do that by passing the Coverdell-Craig amendment. That is why I \nsupport this timely amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time to rededicate ourselves to an \neffective interdiction strategy. A lot of good work is now going on. \nBut we can do a lot more and we can do better. I have had the \nopportunity to see our efforts firsthand. We are competing with an \nenemy that has increased its resources to do the job, while we \ntragically have cut our resources by more than half. Having said that, \nI also believe that we must have a clear idea what we should expect \nwith increased funding. In short, we need to ascertain from the \nrelevant agencies, whether it be from the Navy, Coast Guard, Customs, \nDEA, FBI, or whatever the agency may be, what we can expect to \naccomplish with more resources, and we have to look to them to tell us \nwhat they think they can do. I believe it is our obligation to give \nthem those resources and to give them the direction. My point is that \nwe need to make sure that the Government agencies have the necessary \namount of money and that they indeed strictly use the funds for \ncounter-narcotics efforts.\n  Again, I want to commend my friend from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, \nas well as Senator Craig, for their efforts in this regard, their \nefforts in combating the drug threat both within and beyond our \nborders. I look forward to working with them and other colleagues on \nthis important, new initiative.\n  In conclusion, let me just say again how important I believe it is \nthat we pass the McCain bill. It has been a struggle. No one should \nhave expected it not to be a struggle. This is a big bill. It is \ncomprehensive legislation. It is tough sledding. We knew that when we \nstarted. But we should not be discouraged. The stakes, I think, are \nvery high. What are the stakes? The stakes are whether or not we are \ngoing to seize this historic opportunity to pass legislation that will, \nin fact, have a significant impact on reducing the number of young \npeople who start smoking every day. The consequence of this legislation \nwill affect not only young people today, it is going to impact our \nsociety for years and years to come. So we should continue, we should \npush on, and we should get the job done.\n  The amendment that I am speaking about this afternoon--I am sure we \nwill be back on it again next week--which was brought to the floor by \nSenator Coverdell, is an amendment that I believe will improve the \nMcCain bill. It will improve it by taking some of the resources from \nthe bill and using it in the antidrug effort, using it on drug \ninterdiction, which I believe is so urgently needed. With some \nadditional resources, I am convinced that the men and women who I have \nhad the chance in the last several years to meet with, to see, that are \non the front lines, along our borders--and I have had the chance to \nvisit our borders--as well as in the Caribbean and other areas, I \nbelieve they can get the job done.\n  I believe that they can impact the drug trade. They can only do it \nthough if we are willing to give them the resources and give them the \nbacking to allow them to do that job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5692-S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL DRUG COURT WEEK\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I begin my statement today thanking the \nvarious individuals and organizations that support the drug court \nprograms. I have always been a strong supporter of drug court, and wish \nto express my pleasure with the ``National Drug Court Week'' events \nthat are scheduled in Washington, DC this week. Recognizing the \nimportance of practitioners who work on drug courts and the significant \ncontributions that drug courts have made, and continue to make, in \nreducing drug use and crime in our communities is extremely important. \nI believe in the success of the drug courts and wish to acknowledge the \ndedicated efforts of drug court professionals.\n  Drug Courts are revolutionizing the criminal justice system. The \nstrategy behind drug courts departs from traditional criminal justice \npractice by placing nonviolent drug abusing offenders into intensive \ncourt supervised drug treatment instead of prison. Some drug courts \ntarget first time offenders, while others concentrate on habitual \noffenders. They all aim to reduce drug abuse and crime.\n  Drug court programs have expanded from the original 12 in 1994 to \naround 400 today. Drug courts provide comprehensive judicial \nmonitoring, drug testing and supervision, treatment and rehabilitative \nservices, and sanctions and incentives for drug using offenders. The \nsuccess of the drug court system is well documented. More than 70% of \ndrug court clients have successfully completed the program or remain as \nactive participants. Additionally, the cost of drug court programs are \nsignificantly less than the cost of incarceration and traditional court \nsystems.\n  In my home state of Colorado the drug court movement is growing. \nStarted in 1994, the Denver Drug Court assigns defendants to one of \nthree tracks. Tracks 1 and 2 are community supervision and treatment \ntracks. Track 3 is a serious offender incarceration track. These tracks \nestablish the different type of programs that are offered to various \noffenders.\n  Approximately 75% of all drug cases are appropriate for the community \nsupervision track. At any given time, approximately 1500 cases are \nunder court supervision. An analysis of post-conviction progress \nreviews of offenders under Track 1 or Track 2 demonstrates that 67% of \nthose individuals complied with the Drug Court Program and did not use \nany illegal substances. Since the graduation of the first class in July \n1995, the Drug Court has successfully graduated over 500 individuals. \nOf the 100 graduates who have been out of the Drug Court for one year \nor longer, only 10% have been rearrested for a felony offense.\n  Last year, General McCaffrey and I had the opportunity to observe the \nDenver Drug Court. Through this experience I was able to see first hand \nthe judicial procedures surrounding drug\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\ncourts. I was impressed with Denver's Drug Court procedures, and \nbelieve in the success they will yield.\n  I am pleased with the success of the Denver Drug Court program and \nsupport the growing programs within Colorado. I believe the success of \ndrug courts is well documented and strong Congressional support should \nbe given to the rehabilitation of future drug offenders. Traditional \nincarceration has yielded little gains for our drug offenders. Costs \nare too high and the rehabilitation rate is minimal. The drug courts of \nAmerica are an excellent way to make strides forward in our fight \nagainst drugs. I commend the National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals (NADCP) in their planning and sponsoring of ``National \nDrug Court Week'' events here in Washington. The recognition of this \nexcellent program and promotion of its initiatives is well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5692-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the passing of \nour former colleague, Senator Barry Goldwater--one of the giants of \ntwentieth century American politics.\n  There is no doubt that Barry Goldwater was a transformational \npolitical thinker whose courage and conviction never wavered despite \nenduring a defeat in 1964. For in that defeat were sown the seeds of \nthe Republican revolution that ultimately brought Ronald Reagan to the \nPresidency in 1980 and Republicans to control of Congress 14 years \nlater.\n  Senator Goldwater was a man who never minced words. He was honest, \nopen and forthright. After his 1964 Presidential hopes were completely \nvanquished, he observed ``When you've lost an election by that much, it \nisn't the case of whether you made the wrong speech or wore the wrong \nnecktie. It was just the wrong time.'' In fact, Barry Goldwater was far \nahead of his time and had the opportunity to see his beliefs vindicated \nwhen Ronald Reagan was elected President.\n  Barry Goldwater did not base his political views on focus groups or \npoll results. He had core beliefs and was not willing to bend them for \ntemporary political advantage. He warned of the dangers of big \ngovernment and the welfare state precisely at the time that Lyndon \nJohnson was constructing the largest expansion of government since the \nDepression. He preached a strategy of winning the cold war through a \npolicy of peace through strength while the conventional wisdom argued \nfor peaceful coexistence with a de-emphasis on military strength.\n  When the American Presidency was in crisis in 1974 after the Supreme \nCourt had ruled against President Nixon's claims of Executive \nPrivilege, Senator Goldwater joined several Congressional colleagues in \na visit to the White House to give counsel to the President. Although \nhe had long supported President Nixon throughout the ordeal of \nWatergate, most observers believe that his words were decisive in \npersuading the President that the case was hopeless and for the good of \nthe Nation he must resign.\n  Mr. President, there are certain quotations that live on decades and \ncenturies after a man has died, yet they capture the spirit of the time \nand the man. Two centuries ago, when America was heading into \nrevolution, that spirit was best captured in the words of Patrick \nHenry: ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' The words of Barry \nGoldwater spoken 34 years ago at the Republican convention best sum up \nthe spirit, clarity and wisdom that he will forever be remembered for: \n``Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and moderation in the \npursuit of justice is no virtue.''\n  We will all miss this decent and honest man who made such a \ndifference for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5693-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GOVERNMENT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am compelled to rise today to comment \nonce again on what I consider to be the troubling path that the Federal \nGovernment has taken with respect to this nation's high-tech industry. \nIt has come to my attention that on Monday, the Federal Trade \nCommission will vote on whether to bring an antitrust action against \nIntel Corp.\n  In November of last year I warned the Senate Judiciary Committee \nduring a hearing on the Department of Justice's investigation of \nMicrosoft of the slippery slope of more government regulation of, and \nintrustion into, America's high-technology sector. Monday's proposed \nvote makes clear to me that we are well into our slide. We are now \nwitnessing a revolution in antitrust action in which it appears the \nfederal government seeks to influence the very terms on which \nintellectual property is shared within an industry. We already have an \nentire field of laws that deal with this Mr. President. They are called \n``patents,'' and to the extent that there are deficiencies in patent \nlaw, this Congress is attempting to address those concerns through \nlegislation.\n  We do not need the Federal Trade Commission's help in this endeavor. \nLet me make clear, I do believe in appropriate antitrust enforcement. \nIn this industry, however, overzealous pursuit of alleged antitrust \nviolations sends a chilling signal to one of this nation's most prized \nindustries: Success is illegal, violators will be punished.\n  It is extremely important to keep in mind that our antitrust \nregulation is intended to protect consumers. I believe our central \nconcern in looking at antitrust as it relates to the high-tech industry \nshould be to ensure that consumers continue to see prices go down as \nthe quality and variety of products go up.\n  American consumers are presented with a vast number of choices in the \nhigh-tech marketplace. One need only walk into one of the thousands of \ncomputer and software stores in America to find an enormous, even \nbewildering selection of hardware for every imaginable need. The \noverwhelming evidence indicates that competitiveness is alive and well \nin the high-tech industry--indeed, virtually the only monopolies that \nexist today are those that have been created by government.\n  Mr. President, it is time for Washington to get out of the business \nof picking winners and losers in the free market, and I am deeply \nconcerned about the FTC's actions to this effect. I intend to closely \nmonitor this matter, and I encourage my colleagues to join with me in \nexpressing their concerns about the increasing amount of government \nintrusion into this sector of the economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5693-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Kalbaugh, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5693-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5693-S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees to \nthe report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of \nthe two Houses on the amendment of the House of Representatives to the \nbill (S. 1150) to ensure that federally funded agricultural research, \nextension, and education address high-priority concerns with national \nor multistate significance, to reform, extend, and eliminate certain \nagriculture research programs, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3433.

A bill to amend title 42, United States Code, to protect \nhuman life; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   LEGISLATION TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE\n\n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Ashcroft):\n  S.J. Res. 49. A joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment \nto protect human life; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, our Nation's founding \ndocument, the Declaration of Independence, ultimately proclaimed that \nthe right to life comes from God and that it is unalienable. Life \nitself, the declaration\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nheld, is the fundamental right without which the rights of liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness have no meaning. As the author of the \ndeclaration, Thomas Jefferson, wrote, ``The care of human life and not \nits destruction . . . is the first and only object of good \ngovernment.''\n  It is important and I think proper to note that without that basic \nright of life, there is no liberty, there is no opportunity to pursue \nhappiness in any way, shape, or form.\n  One hundred ninety-seven years after that Declaration of \nIndependence, in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court violated this most sacred \nprinciple of the declaration. In Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court \nheld that the entire class of unborn children--from fertilization to \nbirth--have no right to life and may be destroyed at will. As we know, \nthe statistics are pretty dramatic. Thirty-five million children since \nRoe versus Wade were denied the opportunity to be born. Without getting \ninto the reasons or the explanations or the rationale, the result is \nthat 35 million children were denied that right.\n  In subsequent cases, the Court has zealously guarded the right to \nabortion that the Court created. The Court has repeatedly rejected all \nmeaningful attempts by the States to protect the unalienable right to \nlife of unborn children since that decision in 1973.\n  Mr. President, those of us who support the pro-life cause must never \nlose sight of our ultimate goal. Our objective is very simple. It is \nnot complicated. It is to keep the promise of the Declaration of \nIndependence. There is only one way to do that, Mr. President, and that \nis to overturn Roe versus Wade and restore to unborn children their \nGod-given right to life, a God-given right that our Constitution. I \nbelieve, and certainly the declaration, gave them. And the Court took \nit away--a court, by the way, that is sworn to uphold the Constitution.\n  In order to keep that hope alive in the Senate today, Mr. President, \nI am introducing two legislative proposals, and I am pleased and \nhonored that the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, \nand the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, are joining \nme as original cosponsors of both measures.\n  Senator Helms for many, many years--long before my time in the \nSenate--had the courage to stand here on the Senate floor day after \nday, week after week, taking insult after insult but supporting the \nlives of unborn children. I believe history will judge Senator Helms \nvery prominently in this regard. And Senator Ashcroft, with less time \nin the Senate, is certainly a strong proponent and advocate of the \nright to life of unborn children.\n  Let me talk specifically about the bills--first, a bill, the Human \nLife Act of 1998. The human life bill sets forth the findings of \nCongress that ``the right to life is the paramount and most fundamental \nright of a person'' and that ``the life of each human being begins at \nfertilization.'' Based on these findings, and in the exercise of the \npower of Congress under section 5 of the 14th amendment, my bill \nestablishes that the word ``person,'' as used in the Constitution, \napplies to all human beings, including unborn children, because, Mr. \nPresident, an unborn child is a human being.\n  I have never been able to understand the rationale, as many times as \nit has been debated here on the floor, how one can say that an unborn \nchild is not a human being. Remember, if it is a human being, it \ndeserves the right of protection under the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  As one Senator, I will freely admit that when fertilization occurred, \nI was created. There was a sequence of time that occurred after that \ncaused me to be here today, standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nIf it had been interrupted at any stage from that moment of \nfertilization until today, I wouldn't be here.\n  The effect of this legislative determination that the unborn child is \na human being and, therefore, a ``person'' would be to place unborn \nchildren under constitutional shield of due process and equal \nprotection clauses of the 14th amendment. Thus, the right to life of \nevery unborn person would be protected to the same extent that the \nright to life of all born persons is guaranteed by our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, today we have seen in this day and this age a number \nof violent acts: School shootings, violence of children upon children, \nof children upon parents, terrible violence. I think we have a cultural \nproblem. Most Americans would not deny that.\n  I think it is fair to say that we need to set an example as adults--\nthose who are supposedly leaders of our country not only here in the \nSenate, or in the White House, or in the Congress, but also at the head \nof our communities, our families, whatever else. Whatever the role we \nmay play as parents, as citizens, or husbands, or wives. I think we \nhave a role to set an example. I would ask here on the floor of the \nSenate my colleagues: Are we setting an example for young people to \nfollow when, at the will of any individual at any time after \nfertilization occurs, we say or we tolerate that that unborn child's \nlife may be ended? It is an innocent life. It is a life who can't speak \nhere on the floor of U.S. Senate. No child who is unborn has the \nopportunity to stand up on the floor and say, ``I'd like to live; I'd \nlike to have the opportunity to raise a family, to be a leader, to be a \npreacher, be a Senator, be a doctor, to cure cancer, to be a teacher, \nbe a good mom, a good dad. I would like to have that opportunity.'' I \nthink they would say if they could speak that they do not have that \nopportunity.\n  I think of those 35 million children, I say to my colleagues, since \n1973 whose lives have been ended. How many of those children may have \nlived to find that cure for cancer or may have lived to have made a \ndifference in a life--perhaps one of those lives of those children who \ntook the lives of others? Perhaps one of these children who died may \nhave been a counselor, may have been somebody on the spot who may have \nmade a difference. We will never know, because those 35 million lives \nare gone--never had the opportunity to be happy, never had the \nopportunity to be successful, never had the opportunity to live--gone. \nAnd we did it. We did it because of that Supreme Court decision. It is \nwrong.\n  I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln--a totally different issue but very \nsimilar in terms of its scope. Abraham Lincoln didn't take polls when \nhe stood up in the United States of America in the 1860s and said: \nSlavery is wrong. It is wrong to enslave an American, or any \nindividual, because of the color of their skin. And he spoke out \nagainst it. He spoke out eloquently against it, and he didn't take \npolls. He didn't stand up at a press conference and say to his aide, \n``I am going to examine the feelings of my constituents on this. Would \nyou please take a poll and find out whether the majority of the \nAmerican people favor slavery or oppose slavery?''\n  I am reminded of what Lincoln said. I don't have the exact quote in \nfront of me. I am going to paraphrase it from memory. He said: They \ntell me not to oppose slavery in the slave States, because they have \nleft the country, so it is not our concern. They tell me not to oppose \nslavery in the free States, because we don't need to because they are \nfree. They tell me not to oppose slavery from the pulpit, because it is \nnot religion. And they tell me not to oppose slavery in politics, \nbecause it causes too much of a fuss.\n  Substitute abortion for slavery in each of those four examples and \nyou have the same situation. If we can't oppose it in any of the 50 \nStates, if we can't oppose it in politics, if we can't oppose it in \nreligion, where does that leave the unborn children who will never have \nthe opportunity to stand up here and debate this issue?\n  The right to life of every unborn person should be protected to the \nsame extent as the right to life of all born persons. How can anybody \nin America, any Christian in the Judeo-Christian culture of America, \nnot believe that?\n  I know the insults. I have been the victim of them. I know the \ntaunts. I know the recriminations that come from standing up here and \nmaking these comments. But it is nothing--nothing--compared to what \nthose unborn children endure because they have been denied after they \nhave been created by God himself. Man denies them the right to life, \nthat life.\n  I am reminded of Gianna Jesson, a young woman, perhaps 23 or 24 now, \nwho was aborted. She was aborted. I saw her sing ``Amazing Grace''in \nfront of 1,000 people a couple of years ago in which she said ``I am \nthankful to my\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nGod to be where I am today, and I forgive my mother.'' Well, I say that \nis powerful, Mr. President. I have never seen anything to equal it. Not \nfrom the lips of any politician or any pastor have I ever seen \ntestimony stronger or more powerful than that young woman crippled by \nabortion standing up before 1,000 people and singing ``Amazing Grace.'' \nThere was not a dry eye in the place. That woman deserved the right to \nlive. So did every one of those other 35 million children who have been \ndenied.\n\n  There is only one way to stop this. We can preach about it. We can \ntalk about it. We can debate it in politics. We can sing, or be quiet \nand be silent. But there is only way to stop it. We have to change the \nCourt. The Supreme Court is wrong. In 1857, the Supreme Court said in \nthe Dred Scott decision that a slave could not sue in federal court \nbecause he was property and not human. Chief Justice Roger Taney made \nthat decision. The Supreme Court is not omnipotent. Roger Taney was \nwrong in that decision. He was wrong. And Roe v. Wade was wrong. And we \nneed to change it.\n  My bill provides that nothing--nothing--in it ``shall prohibit a law \nallowing justification to be shown for only those medical procedures \nrequired to prevent the death of either the pregnant woman or her \nunborn offspring as long as such a law requires every reasonable effort \nbe made to preserve the lives of both of them.''\n  I am also introducing a joint resolution that would submit the human \nlife amendment to the States for ratification as part of the \nConstitution of the United States. Specifically and more directly, I am \nintroducing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to \nprotect the lives of unborn children. It has been done before. It has \nbeen introduced before, and it has gone nowhere. It doesn't mean that \nit should not be introduced again and again and again and again until \nsomehow, someway the message is received in this country that we have \nto protect the lives of these innocent children.\n  Let me explain why I am proposing a human life amendment in addition \nto the human life bill. If the human life bill were to be enacted into \nlaw and its constitutionality upheld by the Supreme Court, it could be \nweakened or repealed by some Congress of the future. But a human life \namendment to the Constitution could not be altered or repealed except \nby another constitutional amendment. Thus, my human life amendment \nwould provide more durable protection to the fundamental right to life \nof unborn children.\n  Like the human life bill, the human life amendment restores the word \n``person'' in the Constitution to its original and natural meaning by \nmaking clear that it includes all human beings--all human beings--born \nand unborn.\n  I have witnessed the birth of three of my children. It is a privilege \nthat I am glad I had. I will tell you something. There is no difference \nbetween the 15 or 20 minutes before the child was born, when it was in \nthe womb and I could not see it, and 15 or 20 minutes after the child \nwas born when I saw my daughter and my two sons for the first time. \nThere is no difference. Why is it right and proper under the law to \nkill that child 20 minutes or 20 days or 20 months before that \nwonderful time when the child comes into the world? Why is it right to \ndo that and wrong to do it 20 minutes or 20 months or 20 years after? \nIt is wrong in both cases. It is wrong in both cases.\n\n  So the human life amendment includes the same language as the bill \nregarding medical procedures required to prevent the death of either \nthe pregnant woman or her unborn offspring.\n  I introduce these two legislative proposals and I realize as I stand \nhere today that there is not sufficient support in the Congress to \nrestore legal protection of the right to life of unborn children in \nthis country, but I believe ultimately we will prevail. When the \nabolitionists stood in this Chamber in the 1820s and the 1830s and the \n1840s and they said that slavery was wrong, they did not prevail \neither, but ultimately they did because they were right. And we are \nright. It is wrong to take the lives of unborn children, and someday, \nsomeway, somehow, the American people are going to come to realize \nthis, and they are going to throw everybody out of here who will not \nsupport the changing of that court. That is what they are going to do.\n  One of our Nation's greatest Presidents, in my estimation, Ronald \nReagan, had the same confidence that the right-to-life cause someday \nwill prevail. He believed it deep into his being. I can remember \nmeeting personally with President Reagan and discussing this issue with \nhim. I know how deeply he felt about it, and I also know the attacks he \nhad, but I would ask my colleagues who somehow are a bit timid to stand \nup; when this issue comes up, they hide, many of them. They are worried \nabout the political repercussions. Well, those repercussions of \npolitics are not as bad as what Gianna Jesson went through when she was \naborted. Here is what Reagan said 14 years ago in a book called \n``Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation.''\n\n       Despite the formidable obstacles before us, we must not \n     lose heart. This is not the first time our country has been \n     divided by a Supreme Court decision that denied the value of \n     certain human lives.\n\n  This is a reference to what I talked about earlier.\n\n       The Dred Scott decision of 1857 was not overturned in a \n     day, or a year, or even a decade. At first, only a minority \n     of Americans recognized and deplored the moral crisis brought \n     about by denying the full humanity of our black brothers and \n     sisters; but that minority persisted in their vision and \n     finally prevailed. They did it by appealing to the hearts and \n     to the minds of their countrymen, to the truth of human \n     dignity under God. From their example, we know that respect \n     for the sacred value of human life is too deeply ingrained in \n     the hearts of our people to remain forever suppressed.\n\n  Mr. President, I close by addressing my colleagues in the Senate. \nEach one of us, every one of us, started out in life as an unborn \nchild. We were once, all of us, very small human beings living in our \nmother's wombs. As President Reagan wrote, ``Abortion concerns not just \nthe unborn child, it concerns every one of us,'' because we would not \nbe here if our parents had made that awful decision.\n  The English poet, John Donne said, ``Any man's death diminishes me, \nbecause I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for \nwhom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.''\n  ``It tolls for thee.''\n  My colleagues, regardless of where you have stood on abortion in the \npast, regardless of the acrimonious debate, regardless of the hard \nfeelings, regardless of the political pressures, the contributions, the \npolitical attacks, I urge you to search your conscience and to search \nyour soul and ask yourself, is it right, is it really right to kill an \nunborn child?\n\n  I am not interested in hearing about all of the social conditions of \nthe person who is having the child. That is another issue. I am not \nasking you to comment about the plight of that child when it is born. \nThat is another issue. I am asking you to think, reach down in your \nsouls like you would have if you stood on this floor in 1840 talking \nabout slavery, if you were an abolitionist. I am asking you to search \nyour soul and I am asking you to say, Is it right; is it right? And if \nit is not right, then you have an obligation to support this amendment \nand to help me to right a wrong.\n  I am pledging here today in this Chamber that as long as I am a \nSenator, and as long as I am alive, I am going to work for the passage \nof this amendment. I have two cosponsors this morning. That is all I \nhave. But I know there are more people who agree with me in both \npolitical parties. Frankly, I am going to be talking to them, every one \nof them. It is not an in-your-face situation. This is an in-your-heart \nsituation--not the face, the heart. Is it right or is it wrong? If you \ncan look me in the eye and tell me it is right to take the life of an \nunborn, innocent child, then I will not bother you anymore. But if you \ndon't tell me that, then I am going to keep on bothering you and try to \nget your support.\n  I hope you will decide to join me in cosponsoring both of these \nmeasures and place the lives of the unborn children of our Nation once \nagain under the protection of our great Constitution. The only way to \ndo that, in my opinion, is through the amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in America today, a great debate--a \ngreat division--exists over the issue of abortion. For some, abortion \nis about the so-called ``right to choose.'' For others, it is \nultimately about control. For me, it is about something completely \ndifferent. It is about life.\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\n  Abortion is, at its core, about the destruction of an innocent human \nlife; a life that is unique in the history of the world--formed and \nshaped in the image of God; a life that has never been and will never \nbe again.\n  ``Abortion,'' said the late Mother Teresa, ``is the great \ndestroyer.'' And so it is. More than thirty-five million lives have \nbeen lost in the terrible years since Roe versus Wade became the law of \nthe land. It is a tragedy unmatched in modern times. For mother, for \nfather, for child, abortion is never a real resolution. It is but a \ntemporary answer that inflicts a permanent pain. It is a wound that \ndoes not heal; a wound, alas, that cannot heal.\n  Senator Smith and I come to the floor this morning to stand against \nabortion and to stand for life. For we believe that the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution protect every \nperson's ``life.'' The protection designed by James Madison and adopted \nby the People is universal in scope. Its protection is unequivocal. It \nadmits of no exception. ``No Person shall . . . be deprived of life.''\n  As this is the Constitution's ``plain meaning,'' I believe our \nproposed Human Life Act is a legitimate exercise of Congressional power \nunder Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, while I \nsupport a statutory approach, I would, as I said before Senator East's \nJudiciary Subcommittee in 1981, go farther. For I also believe it \nnecessary to amend the United States Constitution to restore its \noriginal meaning.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court's efforts to create an abortion \njurisprudence from whole cloth demonstrate the difficulty of deviating \nfrom the view that life begins at conception. Every judicial effort to \nestablish a time when constitutional protections magically kick in has \nbeen undermined by medical reality.\n  Earlier this year, I held a Constitution Subcommittee hearing to mark \na profoundly sad occasion--the 25th anniversary of Roe versus Wade. At \nthat hearing, we heard testimony about the relentless progress of \nmedical technology in pushing forward the date of viability.\n  More recently, we have learned how judges in striking down bans on \npartial birth abortions have undermined birth as a clear line for when \nthe constitutional protection for life begins--effectively legalizing \ninfanticide.\n  Clearly, the Supreme Court, unguided by any constitutional text, has \nwritten themselves into a position that is legally, medically and \nmorally incoherent. The experience of the past twenty-five years \nconfirms the desperate need for the legislation and the proposed \namendment we introduce today.\n  In thinking about this morning, I was reminded of my first run for \nCongress. I supported a Human Life Amendment in 1972--fully a year \nbefore Roe versus Wade was handed down. In 1981, as Missouri Attorney \nGeneral, I argued before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of \nthe unborn in Planned Parenthood versus Ashcroft. As Governor, I signed \nthe pro-life law which became the basis for the Webster decision. And \nso, like Senator Smith and Senator Helms, I am not a newcomer to this \ndebate.\n  But I stand before the Senate this morning not to discuss my past, \nbut to talk about our future--about the kind of America we want to have \nin the next century.\n  Abortion makes a statement not only about the life of the unborn \nchild, it makes a statement about the life it leaves behind. Sadly, it \nsends a message that life is expendable: life that is too young, too \nold, ailing, or tenuous. It says, ``You are worthless.'' It says, ``You \nare not important.''\n  To all who might hear my voice, I say, ``That is not the kind of \nstatement America wants to make.'' It is not the message American wants \nto send. It is not the kind of America we want to be. Recall \nDeuteronomy, ``I have set before thee this day, life and death, \nblessing and cursing; therefore, choose life that both thou and thy \nseed may live.'' That both thou and thy seed may live, Mr. President. \nFor an America that can be again--America the beautiful.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2136. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain land in the \nState of Washington; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     i-90 land exchange legislation\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1984, I spoke in this Chamber to \nchampion passage of a bill that would dramatically expand the Alpine \nLakes Wilderness Area. The bill became law, and the wilderness area now \nboasts more than 390,000 acres of alpine and subalpine forests, 450 \nmiles of trails, more than 500 lakes and countless peaks and pinnacles. \nIt offers year-round opportunities for hikers, campers, skiers, \nfishermen, or those who simply want time away from urban life. It is \narguably one of Washington's favorite recreational sites.\n  Today, I introduce legislation that would dramatically enhance the \nvalue of this recreational and environmental jewel--a bill to complete \nthe I-90 Land Exchange between the Forest Service and Plum Creek Timber \nCompany. The land exchange would bring up to 60,000 acres of forest \nland adjacent to the wilderness area into public ownership, creating a \nstretch of publicly owned forest from the southern border of the \nwilderness area to I-90.\n  Plum Creek would trade up to 60,000 acres of its land on the I-90 \ncorridor of the Central Cascades for up to 40,000 acres of Forest \nService land in three different forests. The benefits of the exchange \nare immense. It will place into public hands some of the last large \nblocks of privately owned old growth forest and increase publicly owned \nspotted owl habitat by 22,000 acres. It will bring into public \nownership 14 miles of Pacific Crest Trail. It would eliminate much of \nthe complicated checkerboard land ownership pattern, under which public \nand private entities each owns every other square mile of land. And it \nwill fulfill a long-sought priority of Washington's environmental \ncommunity--the public acquisition of prized sites such as Silver Creek, \nScatter Creek, and Thorp Mountain.\n  There is a long history of controversy surrounding these lands. \nAlthough the land exchange has been under consideration in one form or \nanother for more than a decade, this is the closest it has ever come to \ncompletion.\n  Conservationists began pushing for a resolution to the checkerboard \nownership pattern back in the late 1970's. In 1986, the Forest Service \nand Plum Creek considered an exchange in the Silver Creek basin, the \nheart of the land exchange package under consideration today.\n  In 1988, with the support of local environmental groups and Plum \nCreek, a legislative proposal to complete the exchange was brought to \nCongress. When the bill was not considered, the Forest Service and Plum \nCreek launched an attempt to complete the exchange administratively. \nHowever, the listing of the spotted owl put the project on hold.\n  Since that time, some parcels have been acquired using the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, but with such limited federal resources and \nsuch a vast amount of land, an exchange has proven to be the only way \nto bring a final resolution to the Central Cascades' checkerboard.\n  In fact, the Conference Report that accompanied the 1996 fiscal year \nappropriation for the Forest Service stated:\n\n       The managers continue to encourage strongly the use of land \n     exchanges as a way in which to protect important recreational \n     or environmentally significant lands, in lieu of the Federal \n     Government acquiring lands. The managers believe that land \n     exchanges represent a more cost-effective way in which to do \n     business and encourage the Forest Service to give high \n     priority to those exchanges either nearing completion, or \n     where land management decisions are made particularly \n     difficult due to checkerboard ownership.\n\n  In August of 1995, Plum Creek and the Forest Service went back to the \ndrawing board, and agreed to initiate the I-90 exchange. By mid-June of \n1996, when Plum Creek signed a 420,000 acre Habitat Conservation Plan, \nPlum Creek and Secretary Glickman entered into a two year agreement to \nfinish the exchange. Plum Creek agreed to withhold harvest on most of \nthe exchangeable lands worth approximately $200 million during the two-\nyear period, and although that deadline has now passed, Plum Creek \nagreed to extend it through the end of this year.\n  But we're still running out of time. If we fail, we will lose this \nopportunity to maximize the public benefits of this exchange. Neither \nPlum Creek nor the\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\nForest Service has the financial resources to continue endlessly this \nprocess. No one can reasonably expect Plum Creek to have the patience \nto continue on with this arduous and difficult process indefinitely.\n  If the I-90 Land Exchange is not completed by year's end, the \nexchange will begin to fall apart under the weight of an endless \nappeals process and litigation battles that could go well into the next \ncentury. And it's not reasonable to expect Plum Creek to sustain \noperations on the exchangeable lands through the indefinite and \nuncertain appeals process.\n  To put it bluntly, if the exchange is appealed, this current \nopportunity will be lost forever and we won't have another chance to \nacquire such a large block of some of Washington's premier forest land.\n  That's why I am introducing this bill. We need to keep all options \nopen for finishing the land exchange on time. I understand that both \nPlum Creek and the Forest Service are still committed to the \nadministrative process, and that's important. With the introduction of \nthis bill and companion legislation in the House by Congressman Doc \nHastings, we now have two options for finishing this land exchange on \ntime and getting the most value out of the trade.\n  Ultimately, public support or public opposition will determine the \noutcome of the exchange, regardless of how it is completed. Passing a \nbill though Congress and earning the President's signature demands \npublic support.\n  The building blocks are in place. In March, Washington State Governor \nGary Locke wrote to President Clinton urging completion of the exchange \nby the end of the year. The State Legislature unanimously passed a \nresolution in support of the exchange. Recreational enthusiasts see the \nlong-term value of bringing these lands into public ownership. \nEnvironmentalists recognize the value of blocking up these lands to \ncreate a habitat corridor for wildlife and to protect some of the last \nlarge blocks of privately owned old growth forest. And major newspapers \nhave endorsed it.\n  Earlier this spring, the Seattle P-I described the dire consequences \nif this land swap was not completed this year. The PI-'s editorial \nstated: ``None of the land exchanges is apt to satisfy everyone \ninvolved. But if the lands are not consolidated, however imperfectly, \nit will be next to impossible to preserve them effectively for salmon \nor wildlife habitat. And that's a real lose-lose.''\n  Under the administrative process, however, it only takes one voice of \nopposition to file an appeal and kill the proposal for good.\n  The lands package outlined in this bill is not final as discussions \nand negotiations continue back in Washington state. I appreciate that \nall parties are at the table working towards a lands package that \neveryone can support, and I know from experience that these discussions \ntake time and patience.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize once more that the legislation I am \nintroducing today is only a placeholder. It represents a starting \npoint--albeit an excellent one--to achieve a consensus-based end \nproduct. I encourage the parties now at the table to continue their \nefforts and to expedite the completion of this large and vital \nexchange.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Close land trade or everyone loses\n\n       The parties to the Plum Creek timberland swap need to \n     conclude their negotiations and get on with the next such \n     trade.\n       The company, the Forest Service and environmentalists have \n     spent more than two years negotiating a land swap in the \n     Cascades that involves 100,000 acres now scattered in \n     unmanageable public and private checkerboard ownership. The \n     Sierra Club in particular gets high marks for taking a \n     leadership role in making a priority of consolidation of \n     checkerboard forest lands in this state.\n       But company officials now say that if the deal isn't closed \n     by the end of the year, it's off. They have 20 percent of \n     their harvestable timber base in this state tied up in the \n     swap.\n       They also say they may go to Congress to get the deal \n     immunized from lawsuits. That could poison environmental \n     groups' enthusiasm for such trades in the future.\n       Conservationists and other groups are accusing the firm of \n     high-handed tactics. They also complain that the deal doesn't \n     give them all they want.\n       Not many such deals do. But this one leaves nearly \n     everybody who wants something from Plum Creek better off than \n     if the deal falls through and the company makes good on its \n     threat to start logging the stands conservationists want to \n     preserve.\n       If the deal doesn't go through, the company plans to build \n     logging roads in 53 different areas. If it does, that number \n     will be reduced to eight.\n       None of the land exchanges is apt to satisfy everyone \n     involved. But if the lands are not consolidated, however \n     imperfectly, it will be next to impossible to preserve them \n     effectively for salmon or wildlife habitat.\n       And that's a real lose-lose.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2139. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Yesterdays Dream; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    certificate of documentation for the vessel ``yesterdays dream''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndirect that the vessel, Yesterdays Dream, official number 680266, be \naccorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued a coastwise \nendorsement under 46 U.S.C. sections 12106 and 12108.\n  This vessel was purchased in 1984 by Duncan MacRae of Columbia, SC, \nfor a pleasure boat. In attempting to establish a charter service, he \ndiscovered that the boat could not be used in a chartering business \nbecause the vessel was foreign built. For this reason, the boat did not \nmeet the requirements for coastwise trading privileges in the United \nStates. When Mr. MacRae bought his boat, he was unaware that it could \nnot be legally used for its intended purpose.\n  Therefore, Mr. MacRae is seeking a waiver of the existing law because \nhe wishes to use the vessel for charters. If he is granted this waiver, \nhe intends to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety \nrequirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to \nallow Yesterdays Dream to engage in the coastwise trade and fisheries \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

App. 289), and sections \n     12106 and 12108 of title 46, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate of \n     documentation with appropriate endorsement for employment in \n     the coastwise trade for the vessel YESTERDAYS DREAM, United \n     States official number 680266.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2140. A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of the Denver \nwater reuse project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 denver water reuse water authorization\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take the time today to introduce a \nbill that will help millions of water consumers throughout my state. \nThe Denver Water Department has developed a unique plan to re-use non-\npotable water for irrigation and industrial uses. This bill would \nsimply authorize the Denver Water Department to access federal funds to \nassist in the implementation of this plan. The Mayor of Denver has \nfully endorsed this legislation. I am delighted to assist the Mayor and \nthe great City of Denver.\n  Denver Water Department serves over a million customers and is the \nlargest water supplier in the Rocky Mountain region. Due to uncertain \nwater supplies in the semi-arid west, it is critical to make wise use \nof every drop of water. With this in mind, over the past several years \nDenver Water has developed a plan to treat and reuse some of its water \nsupply for uses not involving human ingestion, such as irrigation and \nindustrial purposes. In this manner, Denver will stretch its\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nwater supply without the cost and potential environmental disruption of \nbuilding new reservoirs. It will also ease the demand on fresh \ndrinking-quality water supplies.\n  The Denver Nonpotable Reuse Project will treat secondary wastewater, \nthat is water which has already been used once in Denver's system. It \nis an environmentally and economically viable method for extending and \nconserving our limited water supplies. The water quality will meet all \nColorado and federal standards. The water will still be clean and \nodorless, but since it will be used for irrigation and industrial uses \naround the Denver International Airport and the Rocky Mountain Wildlife \nRefuge, the additional expense to treat it for drinking will be \navoided.\n  The nonpotable project is constructed in three phases and ultimately \nwill result in an additional useable water supply of 15,000 acre feet. \nThe use of the nonpotable water for irrigation and industrial customers \nwill free potable water supplies for up to 30,000 homes.\n  Construction will include a treatment plant and a distribution system \nthat is separate from the potable water system. Phase I will serve \ncustomers in the vicinity of the reuse plant, including a Public \nService Company power plant, other industrial users and other public \nareas. Phase II will add irrigation for parks and golf courses in the \nformer Stapleton Airport and the recently closed Lowry Air Force Base \nredevelopment areas. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which is being \nconverted to a national wildlife refuge, will also use the reuse water \nto maintain lake levels on-site and to provide water for wildlife \nhabitats. Phase III will service existing parks as well as new \ndevelopment of a commercial corridor leading to the Denver \nInternational Airport. With the construction of Phase II, the \nirrigation, heating and cooling, and car washing facilities at Denver \nInternational Airport will convert to reuse water, where a dual \ndistribution system has already been installed.\n  This plan would benefit many Coloradans, and would help relieve many \nof the water burdens faced in the Denver region. Again, I'd like to \nthank Mayor Webb for his support, and I am hopeful this bill can be \nquickly passed and put into effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Mayor's letter and the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2140\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: Please accept this letter as a \n     statement of my support of the Denver Water Nonpotable Reuse \n     Project. Your willingness to sponsor this worthwhile \n     legislation adding the Denver project to the Title XVI \n     authorized list is appreciated by the City and County of \n     Denver. Nonpotable reuse has been identified as a critical \n     element in the Denver Water Department's recent Integrated \n     Resource Plan. Coupled with conservation and system \n     refinements, it forms the core of the water supply needs for \n     the Denver system for the next 20 years.\n       As you are well aware, the water resources in Colorado are \n     limited and valuable. Reuse conserves potable water sources. \n     This project will help to fulfill Denver's obligations under \n     water decrees that provide for the importation of water from \n     the Colorado River Basin. Those obligations require Denver to \n     exercise reasonable steps which, in view of legal limitations \n     and economic feasibility, provide for the reuse of imports so \n     as to reduce or minimize Denver's demands on Colorado River \n     sources.\n           Yours truly,\n                                               Wellington E. Webb,\n                                                            Mayor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2141. A bill to require certain notices in any mailing using a \ngame of chance for the promotion of a product or service, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   honesty in sweepstakes act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Honesty in \nSweepstakes Act of 1998.\n  Every day millions of senior citizens and other innocent consumers \nreceive sweepstakes announcements that boldly announce that they have \njust won millions of dollars or some other prize, perhaps a luxury \ncruise, when in fact they have not. Millions of Americans also receive \ncashier's check look-alikes, made out to their name, and written for \nthousands of dollars, as a ploy to get them to purchase some product or \nservice. But upon close scrutiny, these cashier's check look-alikes are \nactually worthless.\n  These two tactics are some of the most pervasive deceptive direct \nmail marketing ploys being used today. Theses slick direct mail \nmarketing ploys prey directly upon the better elements of the American \ncharacter: optimism, good nature, trust, and natural tendency to accept \nthings at face value.\n  The recent increase of news reports detailing how American consumers \nare being deliberately misled into believing that they have just won a \nhuge prize, only to find out later that they were taken advantage of, \nclearly shows that the problem is getting worse. All across our \ncountry, families' home mail boxes are being stuffed with increasingly \ndeceptive direct mail marketing ploys, and senior citizens are \nparticulary vulnerable to these deceptive tactics.\n  Something needs to be done to restore honesty in sweepstakes.\n  This legislation has two key provisions. The first ensures accuracy \nand honesty in direct mail sales promotions that use sweepstakes or \nother games of chance to entice consumers to buy their products or \nservices. The second provision promotes honest forthrightness when \ncashier's check look-alikes are used in direct mail sales promotions. \nTogether, this legislation's two key provisions will benefit American \nconsumers, the U.S. Postal Service, and the direct mail marketing \nindustry.\n  First, my bill will protect American consumers from deceptive \nmarketing practices. It will accomplish this by requiring that direct \nmail marketers provide consumers with honest, up-front and clear \ndisclosure of what is being sent to their mail boxes. These new \ndisclosure standards will enable consumers to quicky separate mail that \nis truly important from mail that is deceptively designed to look \nimportant by masquerading as something that it is not.\n  Second, the bill helps the Postal Service do its job better. This \nbill will strengthen the Postal Service's efforts by enabling it to \nhalt the delivery of deceptive mass mailings. This legislation will \nreassure the American people that the Postal Service is on their side, \nand not on the side of those who would\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\nuse the Postal Service to deliver deceptive marketing ploys.\n  Finally, this legislation will benefit the direct mail marketing \nindustry as a whole. It will enhance the public image of the majority \nof direct mail marketers that are honest by compelling companies that \nuse deceptive marketing practices, and whose activities taint the \nentire industry, to either clean up their act or get out. For many \nyears, direct mail marketers have successfully sold their products \nwithout resorting to deception. Let's return to those days.\n  The Honesty in Sweepstakes Act is built on a solid foundation of \nprecedents. The key principle for the sweepstakes portion of this \nlegislation is based on the way in which lotteries clearly disclose \nimportant information, like the total chances of winning. As for \nachieving the same goal for the printed materials used in direct mail \nmarketing, this honesty is achieved through requiring the disclosure to \nbe printed on top and in easy to read font sizes. It is also similar to \nfood labeling, letting you know what is inside the product. The \ncashier's check look-alike portion of this bill is founded on precedent \nin current law that allows the Postal Service to dispose of, or \notherwise refuse to deliver, government look-alike materials. My bill \nsimply expands this current statutory provision to include cashier's \ncheck look-alikes.\n  This bill addresses deceptive sweepstakes in two important ways. \nFirst, it requires an announcement to be clearly printed on the face of \nthe envelope to state that ``This is a sweepstakes. You have not \nautomatically won.'' This announcement must be clearly printed in a \nlarge 16 point font, or in an even larger font in some circumstances, \nso that it is crystal clear and easy for everyone to read. Many of our \nnation's seniors will especially benefit from this large font size \nrequirement. Second, this bill requires that important information be \nprinted clearly on the top of the first page of enclosed material, \nincluding the chances of winning the big prize being promoted and that \nno purchase is necessary to participate. For cashier check look-alikes, \nthis bill calls for a 16 point font notice that ``This is not a check. \nThis has no cash value.'' The days of deceptive marketers burying all \nof the important information and other disclaimers in fine print are \nnumbered.\n  Enforcement is triggered by the consumers themselves. When people \nreceive sweepstakes and cashier's check look-alikes that do not meet \nthe honesty guidelines laid out in this bill, they should contact the \nPost Office and register a complaint. These consumer complaints can \nthen trigger a postal investigation of the materials in question. If \nthe Postal Service finds that the materials do not live up to the \nHonesty in Sweepstakes guidelines, the Postal Service can then dispose \nof the mail accordingly, either by disposing of it or returning it to \nthe sender. As a result, marketers who are not complying with the \nHonesty in Sweepstakes standards will then take a loss on the \nproduction and postage costs associated with that mailing. Needless to \nsay, the company will quickly learn its lesson and produce marketing \nmaterials that are more forthright and honest.\n  I have consulted with the Attorneys General of both my home state of \nColorado, and of the state of Florida, which is in the forefront of the \neffort to fight deceptive sweepstakes practices. These two offices \nexpressed support for both this bill's goals and new approach. The \nAttorneys General were also glad to hear that this bill contains a \nclause stating that nothing in this bill will preempt state law. This \nimportant clause gives each of our respective states the freedom to \nenact its own additional guidelines as it sees fit. I appreciate the \nhelpful feedback and support these two states' Attorneys General have \nshown.\n  For too long, too many of our senior citizens and other innocent \nconsumers have been victimized by deceptive sweepstakes and cashier's \ncheck look-alikes. This bill will end this practice, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \nthe facilities of the Pine River Project, to allow jurisdictional \ntransfer of lands between the Department of Agriculture, Forest \nService, and the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, and \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                vallecito reservoir transfer legislation\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will allow \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to transfer the title to the Vallecito \nReservoir in southwestern Colorado to the Pine River Irrigation \nDistrict. This transfer has been developed after close consultation and \nextensive meetings with the Pine River Irrigation District, the Bureau \nof Reclamation, the U.S. Forest Service and the Southern Ute Indian \nTribe.\n  This bill contributes toward my ongoing goal of developing local \ncooperation and control of public resources, while addressing the \nconcerns of managing site-specific resources, recreation, and \nenvironmental protection. It fits with my long-held belief that we need \nto downsize the role of the Federal Government, while allowing the \nState and local entities which are most affected to manage valuable \nresources.\n  For the past twenty-five years, the District has managed the \nVallecito Reservoir for the Bureau of Reclamation. This bill will allow \nthe District, which has developed extensive expertise and knowledge, to \npurchase the reservoir which they manage. The concerns of the public \nare addressed through provisions which require certain conditions be \nmet before the title can be transferred. Once the transfer is complete \nthe Pine River District will continue to manage the reservoir in \ncompliance with State and Federal law.\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\n  This bill is a companion bill to H.R. 3715 introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by our colleague Congressman Scott McInnis. The House \nalready has held a hearing on this legislation. Therefore, I am hopeful \nthat the Senate can move rapidly to complete this transfer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5694-6", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Dodd] was added as a cosponsor of S. 834, a bill to \namend the Public Health Service Act to ensure adequate research and \neducation regarding the drug DES.\n\n\n                                S. 1252\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Lieberman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1252, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount of \nlow-income housing credits which may be allocated in each State, and to \nindex such amount for inflation.\n\n\n                                S. 1309\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kerry, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Levin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1309, a bill to provide for \nthe health, education, and welfare of children under 6 years of age.\n\n\n                                S. 1325\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Robb] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1325, a bill to authorize \nappropriations for the Technology Administration of the Department of \nCommerce for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brownback, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1392, a bill to \nprovide for offsetting tax cuts whenever there is an elimination of a \ndiscretionary spending program.\n\n\n                                S. 1413\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from Washington \n[Mr. Gorton] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1413, a bill to provide a \nframework for consideration by the legislative and executive branches \nof unilateral economic sanctions.\n\n\n                                S. 1481\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the names of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Durbin] and the Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1481, a bill to amend the Social Security Act to \neliminate the time limitation on benefits for immunosuppressive drugs \nunder the medicare program, to provide for continued entitlement for \nsuch drugs for certain individuals after medicare benefits end, and to \nextend certain medicare secondary payer requirements.\n\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Ms. Collins] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1868, a bill to express \nUnited States foreign policy with respect to, and to strengthen United \nStates advocacy on behalf of, individuals persecuted for their faith \nworldwide;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 244\n\n       Whereas in the spring of 1989, thousands of students \n     demonstrated in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in favor of \n     greater democracy, civil liberties, and freedom of expression \n     in the People's Republic of China (PRC);\n       Whereas these students' protests against political \n     repression in their homeland were conducted peacefully and \n     posed no threat to their fellow Chinese citizens;\n       Whereas on the evening of June 4, 1989, these students were \n     brutally attacked by infantry and armored vehicles of the \n     People's Liberation Army (PLA) acting under orders from the \n     highest political and military leadership of the PRC;\n       Whereas hundreds of these students were killed by the PLA \n     in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for offenses no more \n     serious than that of seeking peacefully to assert their most \n     basic human, civil, and political rights;\n       Whereas many of the leaders of the student demonstrations \n     thus attacked were subsequently imprisoned, sought out for \n     arrest, or otherwise persecuted by the Government of the PRC;\n       Whereas during or shortly after the brutal assault of June \n     4, 1989, at least 2,500 persons were arrested for so-called \n     ``counter-revolutionary offenses'' across China and dozens of \n     persons were executed;\n       Whereas the Chinese government has never expressed grief \n     for its actions on June 4, 1989, still imprisons at least 150 \n     persons in connection with the Tiananmen Square \n     demonstrations, and has continued to deny its citizens basic \n     internationally-recognized human, civil, and political \n     rights;\n       Whereas the Government of the PRC, as detailed in \n     successive annual reports on human rights by the United \n     States Department of State, still routinely and \n     systematically violates the rights of its citizens, including \n     their rights to freedom of speech, assembly, worship, and \n     peaceful dissent; and\n       Whereas the Tiananmen Square Massacre has become indelibly \n     etched into the political consciousness of our times as a \n     symbol both of the impossibility of forever denying a \n     determined people the right to control their own destiny and \n     of the oppressiveness and brutality of governments that seek \n     to do so: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, in the interest of expressing support for \n     the observance of human, civil, and political rights in China \n     and around the world, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should remain committed to \n     honoring the memory and spirit of the brave citizens of China \n     who suffered and died in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for \n     attempting to assert their internationally-recognized rights; \n     and\n       (2) supporting the peaceful transition to democratic \n     governance and the observance of internationally-recognized \n     human, civil, and political rights and the rule of law in \n     China should be a principal goal of United States foreign \n     policy.\n       Sec. 2.

FINDINGS.\n\n       To demonstrate the need for restrictions on the marketing \n     and advertising of tobacco products, and to demonstrate that \n     the restrictions contained in this subtitle are \n     constitutional and meet the requirements of the Central \n     Hudson case that the asserted governmental interest is \n     substantial, directly advances the governmental interest, and \n     is no more extensive than is necessary to serve that \n     governmental interest, Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The sale of tobacco to minors is illegal in the United \n     States. Therefore, forms of marketing and advertising that \n     appeal to children must be restricted accordingly.\n       (2) Substantial restrictions on tobacco marketing and \n     advertising are necessary to protect the public health, \n     reduce the illegal sale and purchase of tobacco products by \n     minors, and reduce the cost of tobacco-related illnesses on \n     Federal and State health care programs.\n       (3) As recognized in New York v. Ferber, protecting the \n     physical and psychological well-being of children is a \n     compelling, not merely a substantial, interest of the \n     government.\n       (4) The cost of tobacco on public health care programs is \n     substantial as evidenced by a 1995 study by Columbia \n     University that found that the estimated cost of tobacco on \n     the medicare and medicaid programs was $25,500,000,000 and \n     $8,200,000,000 respectively. Therefore, reducing these costs, \n     which absorb substantial public resources, by reducing the \n     utilization of tobacco would serve a substantial government \n     interest.\n       (5) According to the 1994 Surgeon General's Report, nearly \n     90 percent of all adults who have ever been regular smokers \n     began smoking at or before the age of 18, and, according to a \n     Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Survey, the average smoker \n     begins smoking at age 13 and is hooked by age 14\\1/2\\. \n     Therefore, reducing the attractiveness of tobacco to children \n     will reduce the likelihood that a child ever tries tobacco, \n     and ensure that the long-term costs of tobacco-related \n     illnesses will be averted.\n       (6) Marketing and advertising plays a significant role in \n     attracting teens to tobacco and determining the brands that \n     they use. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 86 percent of children who buy their own \n     cigarettes choose one of the 3 most heavily advertised brands \n     (Marlboro (60 percent), Camel (13.3 percent), or Newport \n     (12.7 percent)). In contrast, most adult smokers opt for \n     generic or ``value category'' cigarette brands that rely on \n     little, if any, image advertising.\n       (7) Tobacco industry documents and memorandums make clear \n     that the industry considers children a key market, studied \n     the smoking habits of children, and developed products and \n     marketing campaigns that are directly intended to attract \n     children to the purchase and use of their products.\n       (8) According to a 1995 study by The Journal of the \n     National Cancer Institute, tobacco marketing has a greater \n     influence in spurring children to take up smoking than \n     exposure to parents or peers who smoke, and must be \n     restricted accordingly.\n       (9) Children are more sensitive to tobacco advertising than \n     adults, as evidenced by a 1996 study in the Journal of \n     Marketing that found that children are 3 time more sensitive \n     than adults to cigarette advertising.\n       (10) Tobacco advertising in magazines and periodicals \n     influences the decision of children to use tobacco, as cited \n     in the proceedings of the Food and Drug Administration and \n     its supporting documents, In addition,\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\n     children who report seeing cigarette advertising in magazines \n     are more likely to experiment with tobacco.\n       (11) Cartoon images in advertising greatly enhance the \n     appeal of tobacco to children, as evidenced by the ``Joe \n     Camel'' marketing campaign. According to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, when advertising for the \n     ``Joe Camel'' campaign rose from $27,000,000 to $43,000,000 \n     between 1989 and 1993, Camel's market share among youth \n     increased by more than 50 percent while it's share among \n     adults was unchanged. Therefore, because cartoon advertising \n     has been demonstrated to be a direct appeal to minors and not \n     adults, such images should be banned.\n       (12) Children as young as 3 to 6 years of age can recognize \n     a character associated with smoking at the same rate as they \n     recognize cartoons and fast food characters.\n       (13) Human and animal images in tobacco advertising, and \n     the themes that these images portray, have a profound impact \n     on children, as evidenced by the ``Marlboro Man'' and the \n     ``Marlboro Horses''. The image of independence and freedom \n     conveyed by these images has led to Marlboro cigarettes \n     capturing nearly 60 percent of the youth market even though \n     the brand accounts for only 12.7 percent of cigarette \n     advertising overall. Therefore, images portraying human and \n     animal images should be restricted to adult-only venues.\n       (14) Event sponsorships by tobacco companies increase the \n     likelihood that children will use tobacco as these events \n     connect the product to individuals and activities that are \n     admired and respected by children.\n       (15) According to a report in the American Journal of \n     Public Health, the observation of tobacco marketing in stores \n     is a significant predictor of a child's likelihood of \n     experimenting with tobacco, increasing the probability by 38 \n     percent. Therefore, in-store marketing should be restricted \n     accordingly.\n       (16) Tobacco promotions greatly enhance the likelihood that \n     children will use tobacco products, as evidenced by a \n     November 1996 study in the American Journal of Public Health. \n     This study found that a child who was simply aware of tobacco \n     promotions was twice as likely to use tobacco as a child who \n     was not. In addition, it found that a child who is aware of \n     tobacco promotion, has knowledge of an adolescent friend with \n     promotional items, and participates in a promotional activity \n     is 9.3 time more likely to use tobacco.\n       (17) A 1998 study of teenagers in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association showed that tobacco industry \n     promotional activities influenced previously non-susceptible \n     non-smokers to become susceptible or to experiment with \n     smoking.\n       (18) Restrictions on the number and placement of point-of-\n     sale advertisements in stores and other outlets that are \n     permissible for children to enter are necessary to reduce the \n     appeal of tobacco products to children, while ensuring that \n     consumers who can legally purchase these products are able to \n     receive useful information.\n       (19) As demonstrated in the Food and Drug Administration \n     rule, billboards and other forms of outdoor advertising that \n     are located near schools and playgrounds can affect the \n     decision of children to use tobacco products. Therefore, bans \n     on these forms of advertising near these facilities, and \n     within distances that are frequently traveled by children to \n     access these facilities, would be a narrowly-tailored method \n     of fulfilling the government interest, while still allowing \n     information to be provided in this format to consumers who \n     can legally purchase these products at other locations that \n     are less-frequently viewed by children.\n       (20) Through advertisements during, and sponsorship of, \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (21) Because children are influenced by the images, habits, \n     and mannerisms depicted by actresses and actors in movies and \n     other forms of print and film media, tobacco companies should \n     not be permitted to receive payments for the inclusion of \n     logos, symbols, or mottoes in these types of venues if they \n     will be viewed by children under the age of 18 without the \n     supervision of a parent or guardian.\n       (22) Because children are influenced by the behavior of \n     musical and other live entertainers whom they admire, \n     payments by tobacco companies to live entertainers or their \n     agents should be restricted at events in which individuals \n     under the age of 18 are permitted to attend, and a \n     substantial number of these individuals would reasonably be \n     expected to attend.\n       (23) To ensure that advertising and marketing efforts are \n     not deceptive or misleading, descriptors such as ``light'' \n     and ``low tar'' should be accompanied by a disclaimer that \n     the product is not less hazardous than any other tobacco \n     product.\n       (24) Restrictions on the placement of advertisements in \n     buses, subways, and other forms of public transportation that \n     are reasonably expected to be utilized by a significant \n     number of children on a daily basis will ensure that children \n     are not exposed to such advertising for an extended period of \n     time during a commute, and will reduce the susceptibility of \n     children to tobacco advertising accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 1422. ADVERTISING PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A tobacco product may not be sold or \n     distributed in the United States--\n       (1) if its advertising or labeling (including the \n     package)--\n       (A) contains a cartoon character;\n       (B) except as provided in subsection (b), contains a human \n     image or animal image;\n       (C) appears in an enclosed stadia during events that are \n     conducted with a reasonable expectation that 5 percent or \n     more of the attendees will be under the age of 18 years;\n       (D) appears within 5000 feet of any elementary or secondary \n     school, playground, or public park containing playground \n     equipment;\n       (E) appears in public transportation, including buses, \n     subways, and trains, that is reasonably expected to be \n     utilized by 5 percent or more of passengers under the age of \n     18 years on an average daily basis; or\n       (F) contains words such as ``light'' or ``low tar'' and is \n     not accompanied by a disclaimer that words such as ``light'' \n     or ``low tar'' describing the product do not render the \n     product less hazardous than any other tobacco product, in \n     addition to such other requirements as the Secretary may \n     impose;\n       (2) if a logo, symbol, motto, selling message, recognizable \n     color or pattern of colors, or any other indicia of the \n     tobacco product that would be readily identifiable, and \n     therefore appealing, to individuals under the age of 18 years \n     is contained in a movie, program, or video game that an \n     individual under the age of 18 years is able to attend or \n     utilize without the accompaniment or consent of a parent or \n     adult age 18 years or older for which a direct or indirect \n     payment has been made to ensure its placement; or\n       (3) if a direct or indirect payment has been made by any \n     manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to any entity for the \n     purpose of promoting the image or use of a tobacco product \n     through print or film media that is recognizable, and \n     therefore appealing, to individuals under the age of 18 years \n     and at which individuals under the age of 18 years are \n     permitted to attend without the accompaniment or consent of a \n     parent or adult age 18 years or older, or through a live \n     performance by an entertainment artist where individuals \n     under the age of 18 years are permitted to attend without the \n     accompaniment of a parent or adult age 18 years or older, and \n     would reasonable expect that 5 percent or more of the \n     audience will be under the age of 18 years.\n       (b) Exception.--The prohibition contained in subsection \n     (a)(1)(B) shall not apply to a tobacco product advertisement \n     that appears in an adult-only facility, or in any publication \n     which the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer demonstrates \n     to the Secretary is a newspaper, magazine, periodical, or \n     other publication whose readers under the age of 18 years \n     constitute 15 percent or less of the total readership as \n     measured by competent and reliable survey evidence, and that \n     is read by less than 2,000,000 persons under the age of 18 \n     years as measured by competent and reliable survey evidence.\n\n     SEC. 1423. POINT-OF-SALE RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), no \n     manufacturer, distributor, or retailer shall engage in point-\n     of-sale advertising of any tobacco product in any retail \n     establishment (other than an establishment that sells only \n     tobacco products) in which an individual under the age of 18 \n     is present, or permitted to enter, at any time.\n       (b) Exception.--\n       (1) In general.--A retailer may place 1 point-of-sale \n     advertisement in or at each such location for its brand or \n     the contracted house retailer or private label brand of its \n     wholesaler.\n       (2) Display area.--The display area of any point-of-sale \n     advertisement permitted under paragraph (1) (either \n     individually or in the aggregate) shall not be larger than \n     576 square inches and shall consist of black letters on white \n     background or another recognized typography.\n       (3) Limitation.--A point-of-sale advertisement permitted \n     under paragraph (1) shall not be attached to or located \n     within 2 feet of any display fixture on which candy is \n     displayed for sale.\n       (c) Audio and Video.--Any audio or video format permitted \n     under regulations promulgated by the Secretary may be \n     distributed at the time of sale of a tobacco product to \n     individuals over the age of 18 years, but no such format may \n     be played or shown in or at any location where tobacco \n     products are offered for sale and individuals under the age \n     of 18 years are permitted.\n       (d) Definition.--As used in this section, the terms \n     ``point-of-sale advertisement'' and ``point-of-sale \n     advertising'' mean all printed or graphical materials bearing \n     the brand name (alone or in conjunction with any other word), \n     logo, symbol, motto, selling message, or any other indicia of \n     product identification identical or similar to, or \n     identifiable with, those used for any brand of cigarettes or \n     smokeless tobacco, which, when used for its intended purpose, \n     can reasonable be anticipated to be seen by customers at a \n     location where tobacco products are offered for sale.\n\n     SEC. 1424.

According to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, when advertising for the \n     ``Joe Camel'' campaign rose from $27,000,000 to $43,000,000 \n     between 1989 and 1993, Camel's market share among youth \n     increased by more than 50 percent while it's share among \n     adults was unchanged. Therefore, because cartoon advertising \n     has been demonstrated to be a direct appeal to minors and not \n     adults, such images should be banned.\n       (12) Children as young as 3 to 6 years of age can recognize \n     a character associated with smoking at the same rate as they \n     recognize cartoons and fast food characters.\n       (13) Human and animal images in tobacco advertising, and \n     the themes that these images portray, have a profound impact \n     on children, as evidenced by the ``Marlboro Man'' and the \n     ``Marlboro Horses''. The image of independence and freedom \n     conveyed by these images has led to Marlboro cigarettes \n     capturing nearly 60 percent of the youth market even though \n     the brand accounts for only 12.7 percent of cigarette \n     advertising overall. Therefore, images portraying human and \n     animal images should be restricted to adult-only venues.\n       (14) Event sponsorships by tobacco companies increase the \n     likelihood that children will use tobacco as these events \n     connect the product to individuals and activities that are \n     admired and respected by children.\n       (15) According to a report in the American Journal of \n     Public Health, the observation of tobacco marketing in stores \n     is a significant predictor of a child's likelihood of \n     experimenting with tobacco, increasing the probability by 38 \n     percent. Therefore, in-store marketing should be restricted \n     accordingly.\n       (16) Tobacco promotions greatly enhance the likelihood that \n     children will use tobacco products, as evidenced by a \n     November 1996 study in the American Journal of Public Health. \n     This study found that a child who was simply aware of tobacco \n     promotions was twice as likely to use tobacco as a child who \n     was not. In addition, it found that a child who is aware of \n     tobacco promotion, has knowledge of an adolescent friend with \n     promotional items, and participates in a promotional activity \n     is 9.3 time more likely to use tobacco.\n       (17) A 1998 study of teenagers in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association showed that tobacco industry \n     promotional activities influenced previously non-susceptible \n     non-smokers to become susceptible or to experiment with \n     smoking.\n       (18) Restrictions on the number and placement of point-of-\n     sale advertisements in stores and other outlets that are \n     permissible for children to enter are necessary to reduce the \n     appeal of tobacco products to children, while ensuring that \n     consumers who can legally purchase these products are able to \n     receive useful information.\n       (19) As demonstrated in the Food and Drug Administration \n     rule, billboards and other forms of outdoor advertising that \n     are located near schools and playgrounds can affect the \n     decision of children to use tobacco products. Therefore, bans \n     on these forms of advertising near these facilities, and \n     within distances that are frequently traveled by children to \n     access these facilities, would be a narrowly-tailored method \n     of fulfilling the government interest, while still allowing \n     information to be provided in this format to consumers who \n     can legally purchase these products at other locations that \n     are less-frequently viewed by children.\n       (20) Through advertisements during, and sponsorship of, \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (21) Because children are influenced by the images, habits, \n     and mannerisms depicted by actresses and actors in movies and \n     other forms of print and film media, tobacco companies should \n     not be permitted to receive payments for the inclusion of \n     logos, symbols, or mottoes in these types of venues if they \n     will be viewed by children under the age of 18 without the \n     supervision of a parent or guardian.\n       (22) Because children are influenced by the behavior of \n     musical and other live entertainers whom they admire, \n     payments by tobacco companies to live entertainers or their \n     agents should be restricted at events in which individuals \n     under the age of 18 are permitted to attend, and a \n     substantial number of these individuals would reasonably be \n     expected to attend.\n       (23) To ensure that advertising and marketing efforts are \n     not deceptive or misleading, descriptors such as ``light'' \n     and ``low tar'' should be accompanied by a disclaimer that \n     the product is not less hazardous than any other tobacco \n     product.\n       (24) Restrictions on the placement of advertisements in \n     buses, subways, and other forms of public transportation that \n     are reasonably expected to be utilized by a significant \n     number of children on a daily basis will ensure that children \n     are not exposed to such advertising for an extended period of \n     time during a commute, and will reduce the susceptibility of \n     children to tobacco advertising accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 1422.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and insure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSES AND GOALS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to ensure \n     that, in the event that other measures contained in this Act \n     prove to be inadequate to produce substantial reductions in \n     tobacco use by minors, tobacco companies will pay additional \n     assessments. These additional assessments are designed to \n     lower youth tobacco consumption in a variety of ways, \n     including by triggering further increases in the price of \n     tobacco products, by encouraging tobacco companies to work to \n     meet statutory targets for reductions in youth tobacco \n     consumption, and by providing support for further reduction \n     efforts.\n       (b) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required performance objectives for percentage \n     reductions in underage use of tobacco products set forth in \n     this title are achieved.\n\n     SEC. 203. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SURVEYS.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning not later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (e)(1), to determine for each type of tobacco product--\n       (1) the percentage of all children who used such type of \n     tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of children who identify each brand of \n     each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of the type \n     smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Use of Product.--A child shall be considered to have \n     used a manufacturer's tobacco product if the child identifies \n     the manufacturer's tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     tobacco product smoked or used by the child within the past \n     30 days.\n       (c) Separate Types of Products.--For purposes of this \n     subtitle cigarettes and smokeless tobacco shall be considered \n     separate types of tobacco products.\n       (d) Confidentiality of data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information, or described in the information, being \n     identifiable, the information may not be used for any purpose \n     other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     use for such other purposes. The information may not be \n     published or released in any other form if the individual \n     supplying the information, or described in the information, \n     is identifiable unless that individual (or that individual's \n     guardian) consents to its publication or release in other \n     form.\n       (e) Methodology.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (C) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (D) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) based on \n     the point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     the tobacco products of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(D) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) for the \n     purpose of measuring compliance with percent reduction \n     targets and calculating surcharges provided that the \n     precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of children reporting use of a type of tobacco \n     product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of the tobacco products of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95 percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n\n     SEC. 204. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Baseline Level.--The baseline level for each type of \n     tobacco product, and for each manufacturer with respect to \n     each type of tobacco product, is the percentage of children \n     determined to have used such tobacco product in the first \n     annual performance survey (in 1999).\n       (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--For the \n     purpose of determining industry-wide non-attainment \n     assessments, the performance objective for the reduction of \n     the percentage of children determined to have used each type \n     of tobacco product is the percentage in subsection (d) as \n     measured from the baseline level for such type of tobacco \n     product.\n       (c) Performance Objectives for Existing Manufacturers.--\n     Each existing manufacturer shall have as a performance \n     objective the reduction of the percentage of children \n     determined to have used each type of such manufacturer's \n     tobacco products by at least the percentage specified in \n     subsection (d) as measured from the baseline level for such \n     manufacturer for such product.\n       (d) Required Percentage Reductions.--The reductions \n     required in this subsection are as follows:\n       (1) In the case of cigarettes--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 20 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 40 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 55 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 67 percent.\n       (2) In the case of smokeless tobacco--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 12.5 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 25 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 35 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 45 percent.\n       (e) Performance Objective Relative to the De Minimis \n     Level.--If the percentage of children determined to have used \n     a type of the tobacco products of an existing manufacturer in \n     an annual performance survey is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level, the manufacturer shall be considered to have \n     achieved the applicable performance objective.\n       (f) Performance Objectives for New Manufacturers.--Each new \n     manufacturer shall have as its performance objective \n     maintaining the percentage of children determined to have \n     used each type of such manufacturer's tobacco products in \n     each annual performance survey at a level equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level for that year.\n       (g) De Minimis Level.--The de minimis level shall be 1 \n     percent of children for the applicable year.\n\n     SEC. 205. MEASURES TO HELP ACHIEVE THE PERFORMANCE \n                   OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Annual Determination.--Beginning in 2001, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall, based on the annual \n     performance surveys conducted under section 203, determine if \n     the performance objectives for each type of tobacco product \n     under section 204 has been\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\n

SCHRIEVER\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGeneral Bernard A. Schriever, a modern-day pioneer whose legendary \ncontributions to our nation's defense will be appropriately recognized \non Friday, June 5, 1998, when Falcon Air Force Base will be renamed in \nhis honor. General Schriever, a retired four-star general, is widely \nregarded as the father of the ICBM.\n  General Schriever was born in Bremen, Germany, on September 14, 1910. \nHis family immigrated to the United States when he was seven years old, \nand he became a naturalized citizen at age 13 and finished his early \nschooling in San Antonio, Texas. His flying career began in the late \n1920s, as a mail-carrier flying between my home state of Utah and \nWyoming. In 1931, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Texas \nA, and a reserve appointment in the Field Artillery. He earned his \nwings as a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps Reserve in June \n1933.\n  After obtaining his Master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from \nStanford University in 1942, he gained rapid promotions and positions \nof increasing responsibility during World War II. He was Chief of Staff \nof the 5th Air Force Service Command and later Commander of the \nAdvanced Headquarters for the Far Eastern Air Force Service Command. \nAfter the war he became the Chief of the scientific Liaison Section at \nHeadquarters USAF and held other scientific evaluation jobs as they \npertained to military weaponry.\n  Beginning in 1954 when he assumed command of the Air Force Ballistic \nMissile Division and later with the Air Research and Development \nCommand, General Schriever pushed forward research and development on \nall technical phases of the Atlas, Titan, Thor and Minuteman ballistic \nmissiles. He also provided for the launching sites and equipment, \ntracking facilities, and ground support equipment necessary to the \ndeployment of these systems.\n  With the expansion of the Air Research and Development Command, he \nbecame Commander of the newly created Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). \nAmong the many creative programs he conceived and directed at AFSC was \nProject Forecast I, completed in 1964, which enlisted the best \nscientific and technological minds of that period in the projection of \nthe aerospace world for the future.\n  After retiring from the Air Force on August 31, 1966, with more than \n33 years of active military service, General Schriever became a \nconsultant to government and industry where he could most effectively \nuse his knowledge and experience pursuing technology and its management \ninto military operational capabilities.\n  General Schriever has had several important government advisory \nassignments since his retirement in 1966, including: by Executive \nOrder, Chairman, President's Advisory Commission on Management \nImprovement (PACMI); member, National Commission on Space; member, \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board; member, Strategic \nDefense Initiative (SDI) Technical Advisory Committee; Chairman, SDI \nInstitute, and various ad hoc advisory committees and panels involving \nnational security (DoD) and space (NASA).\n  General Schriever has been awarded four honorary Doctor of Science \ndegrees, one honorary Doctor of Aeronautical Science degree, one \nhonorary Doctor of Engineering degree, and one honorary Doctor of Laws \ndegree, by various colleges and universities, including Utah State \nUniversity. Inducted into Aviation Hall of Fame in 1980. Elected \nHonorary Fellow AIAA, recipient of James Forrestal Award 1986. Member \nof NAE. He received the National Air and Space Museum Trophy for \nLifetime Achievement in November 1996.\n  General Schriever remains very active even today, and continues to \nserve on several important advisory boards to government, industry, and \neducation. He currently chairs the Guidance Council for the Space \nDynamics Lab at Utah State University in my home state. Several years \nago, I was honored to have General Schriever participate as the \nfeatured speaker at my annual conference, SpaceTalk.\n  General Schriever's patriotism, intelligence, and vision have served \nour country well. The United States is more secure thanks to his many \ncontributions and achievements. Thank you, General Schriever, for your \ndedication to the nation's well-being. I congratulate you and wish you \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5731-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5731-S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RACE FOR THE CURE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, fifteen years ago the first Susan G. \nKomen Breast Cancer Foundation Race For The Cure was held in Dallas. \nThis year, at least 500,000 participants in more than 85 communities \nnationwide will host 5-K runs and 1-mile fitness run/\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nwalks to raise money for national breast cancer research efforts and \nlocal breast cancer initiatives.\n  I am proud to be honorary co-chair for this year's Vermont Race For \nThe Cure, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Jeffords. The \nrace will be held in Manchester on July 26. Last year our race was a \nwonderful community event, with more than 2,300 Vermonters running or \nwalking in the race and with others joining in support through pledges \nand by cheering racers on. That effort led to $84,000 in grants for \nnine projects throughout Vermont to support breast cancer treatment, \neducation and survivor support.\n  The Race For The Cure is an important and successful effort to raise \nprivate funds for breast cancer screening, education, and treatment to \nreduce and one day eliminate this terrible disease. One woman somewhere \nin the United States is diagnosed with breast cancer every three \nminutes and one of its victims dies from the disease every twelve \nminutes. One in eight women will suffer from breast cancer in her \nlifetime, and it is the leading cause of death for women between the \nages of 35 to 54.\n  The private contributions raised by the Race For The Cure are a vital \ncomplement to the efforts of those of us in Congress who strive each \nyear to secure federal funding to fight breast cancer.\n  We in Congress have made it clear that we plan to continue to \nincrease research funding at the National Institutes of Health.\n  And just yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to \nguarantee at least $135 million for Fiscal Year 1999 for the Department \nof Defense breast cancer research program. This program continues to \nspawn far-reaching innovations in medical research, and the seven-year \ntotal allocated under this program will rise to $872 million, if this \nprovision is enacted this year.\n  Seven years ago, working with the breast cancer survivor community, \nseveral of us launched this crusade to earmark a portion of the defense \nbudget for this breast cancer research program, and over the years it \nhas become a crucial supplement to other federally and privately \nsponsored research efforts.\n  Working together on these initiatives, and by supporting such private \nefforts as the annual Race For The Cure, we are drawing closer, year by \nyear, to the day when we can eliminate the destruction and the pain of \nbreast cancer from the lives of our wives, mothers and sisters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5731-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF OSSABAW ISLAND FOUNDATION AND IMPORTANCE OF WORKING TO \n                       PRESERVE NATURAL HABITATS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nOssabaw Island Foundation and the Georgia Commissioner of Natural \nResources for their efforts to preserve Ossabaw Island, Georgia's first \nHeritage Preserve.\n  Georgia's high rate of population and economic growth have created \nstatewide expansion into previously uninhabited areas. Efforts to \npreserve and protect endangered natural areas is vital to the well \nbeing of Georgia's environment.\n  Ossabaw Island is one of the few remaining barrier islands on the \nAtlantic Coast. The fragile ecosystems of the island should be \npreserved so that natural areas along the coast will work to protect \nestuaries, wildlife, marshes, and coastal shorelines. If Ossabaw Island \nremains in its natural state, it will provide needed protection for the \nmainland from Atlantic storms, permit the functioning of marshes which \nprovide water and air purification essential to habitation of Georgia's \nmainland, and provide conditions not tainted by human intervention for \nenvironmental research.\n  I would like to commend the Ossabaw Island Foundation, a public/\nprivate partner with the State of Georgia's Department of Natural \nResources, for diligently serving as a voice for the preservation of \nthe island. The Foundation has worked to incorporate educational and \ncultural programs in the island's historical buildings and to provide \nappropriate access and utilization of the Ossabaw Heritage Preserve.\n  Through the efforts of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation, \nOssabaw Island was included on the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation's Eleven Most Endangered Properties List of 1995. The \nisland was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places by \nthe United States Department of the Interior in 1996.\n  The importance of preserving natural habitats is a common belief \namong the members of the Senate. We must not allow the natural beauty \nand resourcefulness of our nation to be sacrificed for lesser purposes. \nThe benefits of protecting and preserving areas of natural habitat \nrange from aesthetic to practical and must not be ignored.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing the partnership and hard work of the Georgia Commissioner \nof Natural Resources and the Board of Trustees of the Ossabaw Island \nFoundation. Their combined efforts have protected and will continue to \nprotect and ensure a beautiful environment on Georgia's Ossabaw Island \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5732-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to express my support \nand admiration to small business owners and entrepreneurs during the \nfirst week of June, otherwise known as National Small Business Week. It \nis appropriate that during this week of recognition that we honor the \nmany contributions entrepreneurs have made to strengthen our \ncommunities and our national economy.\n  As the Ranking Democrat of the Small Business Committee, I have \nfollowed the dramatic growth of thousands of small businesses and have \nworked to champion their success by increasing access to capital, \nexpanding Women's Business Centers, improving business education and \ntechnical assistance, and reducing capital gains taxes. Under \nDemocratic Leadership, the Small Business Administration now annually \nguarantees about $10 billion in loans to small businesses, and has \nincreased loans to women business-owners by 86 percent.\n  Small businesses are changing the face of the economy by creating \njobs and bringing prosperity to small towns and cities across the \ncountry. Nationwide, small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all \nemployers and provide 67 percent of workers with their first jobs. \nSmaller firms are also more likely to be flexible and hire workers from \nmany segments of the economy, including younger workers, older workers, \nwomen, minorities, and people interested in working part time.\n  In the state of Massachusetts, we have two outstanding business \nowners that deserve special recognition. Cassie Farmer, President and \nRoberta Adams, Vice President/Treasurer of New World Securities \nAssociates, Inc, have been named State Small Business Persons of the \nYear by the Small Business Administration, and have been honored this \nweek here in Washington.\n  Ms. Farmer and Ms. Adams began their security business just eight \nyears ago with fifteen employees, one patrol car, and a few clients. \nThey invested their personal savings to get the company off the ground. \nBy 1997, their company has grown to employ 240 people with annual sales \nof $5 million. The Dorchester-based company is not only the largest \nemployer within the Dorchester/Roxbury/Mattapan area, but is also the \nlargest women/minority owned security company in Massachusetts. I \ncongratulate them on their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5732-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5732-S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          JESS AND SELMA KAUFMAN CELEBRATE GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GLENN.

Mr. President, on June 30, 1998, Alfred Healy, \nM.D., professor emeritus of pediatrics and special education at the \nUniversity of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa will conclude a distinguished \n41-year career of clinical service, teaching, research, and \nadministration of innovative programs supporting individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities. His career at the University of Iowa \nincludes 21 years of directing three entities: the Division of \nDevelopmental Disabilities in the Department of Pediatrics, the \nUniversity Hospital School of the University of Iowa Hospitals and \nClinics, and the Iowa University Affiliated Program. He also provided \nleadership to numerous national and international programs promoting \nthe independence, productivity, and community inclusion of people with \ndisabilities.\n  Dr. Healy gained firsthand knowledge of physical disabilities as a \nyoung teenager, during his recovery from two prolonged episodes of \nrheumatic fever that later severely restricted his participation in \nsports and other physical activities. Seeking other ways to participate \nin athletics, he earned his bachelor's degree in physical education in \n1956 from the University of Notre Dame while concurrently serving as \nAssistant Athletic Trainer for all Notre Dame athletic teams.\n  A Master of Arts Degree in physical education followed in 1957 from \nthe University of Iowa, where for three years he served as a teacher at \nthe Iowa Hospital School for Severely Handicapped Children, assisting \nchildren with cerebral palsy, the residuals of poliomyelitis, and other \nphysical disabilities in their rehabilitation process. This experience \nled him to pursue a medical degree, which he earned from the University \nof Iowa in 1963. Following residency training in pediatrics and \nfellowship training in disabilities, he joined the pediatric faculty at \nIowa in 1967, achieving full professorship in 1980. In 1977 he was \nappointed director of the Division of Developmental Disabilities, the \nrenamed University Hospital School, and also of the Iowa University \nAffiliated Program.\n  As a professor of pediatrics, he served as director of the Division \nof Developmental Disabilities, and over the years he supervised the \ntraining of countless numbers of medical students, physical and \noccupational therapy students, pediatric and family practice residents, \nand community physicians. Of the fourteen physician fellows trained \nunder Dr. Healy's leadership, nine are now sharing their expertise and \nunderstanding of the interdisciplinary process with another generation \nof trainees in other university training programs. As a professor of \nspecial education, Dr. Healy has taught several courses relating to \ndisabilities on an on-going basis each year for the College of \nEducation.\n  As director of University Hospital School, Dr. Healy has provided \nclinical care in both inpatient and outpatient settings to thousands of \ninfants, children and adults with physical disabilities. He presided \nover the transition of University Hospital School from a residential \nschool, founded prior to the passage of P.L. 94-142, to its current \nrole as a tertiary level diagnosis and evaluation center supporting \ncommunity education and human service programs throughout Iowa. The \nhallmark of Dr. Healy's administration of University Hospital School \nhas been his commitment to the interdisciplinary process as the most \neffective response to meeting the clinical needs of individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  As director of the Iowa University Affiliated Program, Dr. Healy \nexpanded the breadth of University Hospital School programs to also \nemphasize pre-service training, community education, technical \nassistance to state and local agencies, and information sharing \nprograms. Most of these activities were implemented through grants and \ncontracts that were awarded in no small part because of his leadership. \nCurrent examples include the statewide Iowa Program for Assistive \nTechnology, the Iowa COMPASS information and referral service, the Iowa \nTelemedicine Project from the National Library of Medicine, the Iowa \nPrevention of Disabilities Policy Council, and the Maternal and Child \nHealth funded Iowa Leadership in Neurodevelopmental and related \nDisabilities Project.\n  Dr. Healy has also participated in a wide range of national and \ninternational initiatives. Responding to a request from the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics in 1978, Dr. Healy secured federal funding, and \nthen served as chair of the National Advisory Committee, for the $3.9 \nmillion, four-year New Directions training course for pediatricians \nthat dealt with Public Law 94-142. In 1986, also on behalf of the \nAcademy of Pediatrics, he secured funding, and chaired the National \nAdvisory Committee for the $3.2 million, four-year Project BRIDGE \ntraining program for pediatricians and therapists that focused on the \nuse of the interdisciplinary process in early intervention for children \nwith physical and other disabilities. This led the academy to award him \nthe Ross Award for Lifetime Accomplishment in Pediatric Education in \n1986.\n  Following service in a number of committee and task force roles, Dr. \nHealy was elected president of the American Association of University \nAffiliated Programs in 1984, and was presented their ``Distinguished \nService Award'' in 1995. He served as president of the American Academy \nfor Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine in 1989. He served two \nthree-year terms as a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics \nNational Committee for Children with Disabilities, followed by two \nthree-year terms as chairman. These offices provided many opportunities \nto significantly influence federal legislation and funding for programs \nserving children with physical and other disabilities, and he provided \nverbal testimony on eight occasions to various committees of the U.S. \nCongress. In addition, he served as a member of the federal Social \nSecurity Administration panel selected to devise a federal response to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court Zebley versus Sullivan decision regarding SSI \nbenefits, which affected hundreds of thousands of children with \nphysical and other disabilities in America.\n  On the international level, Dr. Healy has provided consultations to \nIreland, Saudi Arabia, and Russia regarding ways to improve their \nnational programs for children with physical and other disabilities. He \nwas also instrumental in helping to establish a University Affiliated \nProgram in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, and he has now completed two \ntrips to Belfast, Northern Ireland, to assist Queens and Ulster \nUniversities in establishing similar programs.\n  During the four decades of his career, Dr. Healy has seen, and \ncontributed to, unprecedented changes in society's response to people \nwith disabilities. According to Dr. Healy, the most rewarding aspect of \nhis work has been participating in a dynamic systems change that now \naffirms that people with disabilities, and their families, must be at \nthe center of service planning, setting goals, and identifying the \nmeans to achieve them. He repeatedly acknowledges that his greatest \nteachers have been individuals with disabilities and their families. My \ncolleagues are particularly pleased, I know, to join me in expressing \nprofound appreciation for the career of this remarkable American--\nclinician, teacher, researcher, and leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5733-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5733-S5734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3433\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to consideration \nof Calendar No. 369, H.R. 3811.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3811) to establish felony violations for the \n     failure to pay legal child support obligations, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of final passage \nof the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act authored by my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Herb Kohl from Wisconsin. Senator Kohl has worked \ntirelessly to strengthen our child support laws, and I have been happy \nto lend my support to this effort.\n  The House bill we pass today mirrors the Senate-passed version that \nwe sponsored earlier this session. I believe children should not have \nto suffer twice for the decisions of their parents to divorce; once \nwhen they decide to divorce, and again when one of the parents evades \nthe financial responsibility to care for them.\n  Let me tell you just one story from my home state of Ohio. Marcia \nWalsh, the mother of seven children, became one of the working poor \nwhen she and her husband divorced, and he neglected his child support \norder. He left Ohio, leaving Marcia to support seven children, ages 6 \nto 15, on food stamps and a $14,000-a-year night job. When Marcia \nturned to our federal Child Enforcement Program, she discovered a \nfailed program whose collection rate is only about 19.4 percent.\n  Mr. President, people like Marcia and her children deserve better \nthan that.\n  Our bill will help address situations like theirs, in two ways. \nFirst, the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act gives federal law \nenforcement an incentive to bring more of these cases against deadbeats \nby making this offense a felony. Second, this legislation would make \nmovement from state to state to avoid child support payments a crime. \nToday, nonpayment of child support is a class B misdemeanor, and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation is frustrated at having to chase \ndeadbeats for just a class B misdemeanor. Federal prosecutors are \nequally discouraged about trying misdemeanor cases.\n  It is currently not a crime to move to another state to avoid having \nto pay child support. Under this bill, not paying child support for two \nyears, owing more than $10,000 in back child support, or going to \nanother state to avoid child support payments would be penalized by a \nfine or two years in jail, or both. If the parent flees the state where \nthe child resides, and owes more than $5,000, the same penalty \ndescribed above would apply.\n  Mr. President, making sure parents live up to their financial \nresponsibilities for their children is a very important national \npriority. We have serious laws in this country protecting life and \nproperty--it's highly appropriate that we protect with equal \nseriousness the interests of our most precious national resource, \nAmerica's children.\n  I thank Senator Kohl for his work on this important bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nfinal passage of our Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act and to commend \nSenator DeWine, cosponsor of the Senate version which we passed last \nNovember, along with Chairman Hyde and Congressman Hoyer for their \ncommitment to promoting the welfare of children and to strengthening \nour child support laws. In sum, this measure sends a clear message to \nthe deadbeat parents of America: pay up or go to jail.\n  Mr. President, when the original Child Support Recovery Act of 1990 \nwas first enacted, Senator Shelby and I hoped to make a real impact on \nthe non-payment of support orders. And we did make some progress. Over \n200 more cases of nonpayment were prosecuted. Over 50 went to jail. Of \nthe 150-some remaining cases, many were dropped when the defendant \nagreed to pay the support arrears. And some very high profile cases \nprosecuted under this law have also made some potential deadbeats think \ntwice before not paying. But for some deadbeats the threat of a \nmisdemeanor sentence still isn't enough to keep them paying. Many would \nrather ``risk it.'' They know that if they get caught for a first \noffense--no matter how big their debt and no matter how long they went \nwithout paying--they aren't facing a felony conviction.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are not trying to throw people into jail. We'd \nrather they paid their child support on time and in full. And many \nparents--mothers and fathers--do just that. But some need a little \nextra incentive to fulfill their responsibilities. The threat of a year \nin prison and a felony conviction on their records, contained in this \nbill, provides that much needed incentive.\n  It has been estimated that if delinquent parents fully paid up their \nchild support, approximately 800,000 women and children could be taken \noff the welfare rolls. In fact, Mr. President, since our original \nlegislation was signed into law in 1992, collections have increased by \nnearly 50 percent, from $8 billion to $11.8 billion. Moreover, a new \nnational database has helped identify 60,000 delinquent fathers--over \nhalf of whom owed money to women on welfare.\n  Although we should be proud of these efforts, they are merely a point \nof departure, not a final destination, It seems to me that in passing \nthis legislation, we all recognize that we can not simply stop and rest \non our laurels. We must continue to work on behalf of children and \nfamilies. We must give police and prosecutors the tools they need to \nmake a real impact on the non-payment of child support. And today, we \nhave taken that next step, we have done these things, and we have \ncontinued this important work. I look forward to the President's \nsigning this bill into law, which will help ensure that deadbeats \nacross the country sign more child support checks.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to notify the Senate that this \nis the bill that is commonly referred to as the Deadbeat Parents \nPunishment Act, and I appreciate the cooperation that we received on \nboth sides of the aisle today to get this legislation through, because \nit is clearly something that should be passed. We should have felony \nviolations for failure to pay legal child support obligations. I am \nglad to move the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed at the appropriate place in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3811) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/05/senate-section/article/S5734-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
