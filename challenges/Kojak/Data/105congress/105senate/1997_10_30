CHARLES LEVER, GUEST CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Senate is honored today to have Dr. \nCharles Lever with us. Dr. Lever is the senior minister at the Lake \nMagdalene United Methodist Church in Tampa in my home State of Florida. \nWe are also happy to have his wife, Xiommy, who works as a \nhematopoeitic product specialist at Ortho Biotech and is also active in \nthe church as a certified lay speaker and is involved in Disciple Bible \nStudy and the Walk to Emmaus. They have two sons--Chaz who is in the \nseventh grade, and Chapman, who is in the first grade.\n  Dr. Lever was called to the ordained ministry as a young man. He \nbegan his education at Wofford College in South Carolina, where he \nearned a bachelor of arts degree. He earned a master of divinity from \nthe Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, and a \ndoctor of ministry from Vanderbilt University in Nashville. He has also \ndone continuing education work at the Jerusalem Center for Church \nStudies in Israel, and the Robert Schuller Institute in Garden Grove, \nCA.\n  Among his many educational and leadership awards and honors are the \nAmerican Legion Award, induction into Phi Beta Kappa, Blue Key, and \nnumerous other honorary fraternities and societies.\n  Mr. President, with some 3,200 members, Lake Magdalene Methodist is \none of the largest churches in Florida. But Dr. Lever's accomplishments \nhave always extended far beyond the santuary of his church. He is a \nleader in numerous organizations serving the people in his local \ncommunity. Among these are the 90-unit apartment complex for the \nelderly, 125-unit child care center for low-income families, and the \nLife Center for older adults that he served as minister at the \nRiverside Park United Methodist Church of Jacksonville, FL.\n  He is active in both district and conference affairs of the United \nMethodist Church in Florida. He has served on the board of the \nChristian Enrichment School, the district committee on finance, and the \nConference Council on Ministries.\n  The list of Dr. Lever's church and community leadership achievements \nis impressive and quite extensive. I ask unanimous consent that his \nbiography be printed in the Record in its entirety at the end of my \nstatement.\n  Let me say again, Mr. President, the Senate is honored and very \npleased to have Dr. Lever with us today, and we appreciate his opening \nprayer this morning. I'm sure all my colleagues wish him and his family \nall the best in his ministry to the members of Lake Magdalene United \nMethodist Church of Tampa, FL.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Dr. Charles C.

He met \n     his wife, Xiommy, on a double-date in high school (they were \n     both dating other individuals as the time) and ended up \n     dating their senior year in high school. Their common love \n     for the church and of one another made them an ideal match \n     for each other. Today, Xiommy is active in Disciple Bible \n     Study and the Walk of Emmaus. She also serves as a Certified \n     Lay Speaker in the United Methodist Church.\n       Dr. Lever is excited to be sharing in the ministry of Lake \n     Magdalene UMC.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport to the DOD authorization bill. One of the issues which held up \nthe resolution of the conference was the high performance computer \nissue. This matter certainly was not resolved to my satisfaction, and I \nunderstand that this is one of three issues that may cause the veto of \nthis legislation.\n  On July 10 the Grams-Boxer amendment passed in the Senate by a vote \nof 72-27. It created a GAO study on the national security concerns \nrelated to computer sales between 2,000-7,000 MTOPS to tier 3 \ncountries. Those countries include China, Russia, and Israel.\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\n The amendment was a second degree amendment to an amendment which \nsought to license exports of these mid-level computers, after they had \nbeen decontrolled 2 years ago. Rather than creating an unwise barrier \nto US-made exports, 72 of my colleagues believed we needed more study \nof this issue before passing this new regulation on the Senate floor \ncircumventing the usual committee debate and consideration.\n  Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International \nFinance, of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over export \ncontrol matters, I strongly opposed this attempt to circumvent the \nnormal committee process. Chairman D'Amato joined me in vigorously \nopposing the underlying amendment, paving the way for a strong Senate \nvote on the issue.\n  After the vote, Chairman D'Amato and the Subcommittee Ranking Member \nCarol Moseley-Braun joined me in sending a letter to the Conferees \nrequesting we be consulted prior to any attempts to modify the Senate \nprovision in conference. I regret that at no time in the months-long \nprocess did any consultation occur, even though the issue was clearly \none of Banking Committee jurisdiction.\n  I was informed by the conferees that they had accommodated my request \nfor a GAO study. What I determined from other sources was that language \naccompanying my study essentially accomplished the same thing as the \nunderlying amendment my second-degree amendment defeated. And I was \nsupposed to be satisfied because my study remained in the bill.\n  I applaud my colleagues who worked hard in the conference committee \nto complete the report. There were many difficult issues effectively \nhandled. In total, the bill is a good one. However, because this bill \nmay be vetoed, I would like to make a strong case for further \nresolution of this issue once it is returned to conference.\n  My specific concerns with the provisions of the conference report are \nthe following:\n  First, rather than a mandate to obtain export licenses for computers \nbetween 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries, the conference \nreport would require a 10 day notice to Commerce of a proposed sale. If \nno government entity opposes, the shipment can be made. This not only \ncreates a bureaucratic nightmare taking scarce resources away from \nreview of truly sensitive export license applications, but the reality \nwould be that there would be an objection to each one of them--if for \nno other reason that the Government needs more time to look at them. So \nthe 10-day notice requirement essentially implements the intent of the \noriginal amendment the Senate defeated. This is not acceptable. The \nreason we decontrolled in the first place, requiring licenses between \n2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS only to questionable end users in tier 3 \ncountries, was to free up needed resources to analyze exports of higher \nperformance computers, including those computers between 20,000 and \nwell over 1 million MTOPS--which are the real supercomputers. Opponents \nof my amendment insisted on defining computers between 2,000 and 7,000 \nMTOPS as being supercomputers, but supercomputer technology has long \nago passed this level of computers. They are now the kind of computer \nsystems we have in our offices. They are not supercomputers used to \ndesign nuclear weapons.\n  There is a 180-day layover for future decontrol of computer level \nchanges and a 120-day layover for any changes in which countries remain \non the tier 3 list. I believe the President should have flexibility to \ncontinue to exercise current authority to make these changes. These \nlayovers will give opponents plenty of time to prevent these changes--\nand will ensure that no changes will be made in the future even though \nrapid technology advancements challenge us to maintain a system for \ndecontrols in the future.\n  Mr. President, there is also a requirement for end-user verification \nthat could be unenforceable and also create a strain on limited \nresources. This language should be worked out with the Administration. \nCertainly post shipment checks should not be required over 2,000 MTOPS \nregardless of whether decontrol is made in the future. Even by next \nyear that level of computer will be found in the local computer store, \nso it is unlikely that all of these verifications could be made. Also, \nthere should be some discretion regarding whether verification in every \ncase is even necessary if the exporter maintains service on the \ncomputer.\n  Mr. President, I am just as concerned about selling sensitive high-\ntechnology equipment to military end users, but I don't think this is \nthe right way to stop the few diversions that brought about the \noriginal amendment. There is adequate enforcement authority now to \naddress diversions. Those that have occurred are being addressed.\n  Mr. President, my floor amendment also asks Commerce to work more \nclosely with companies to identify questionable end users than they are \ndoing now. The GAO study will help us study national security interests \ninvolving sales of computers at this mid-level. There simply is no need \nfor the provisions added in conference that will compromise our efforts \nto remain competitive with other nations which do not have these type \nof requirements. Anyone who will tell you that an export license takes \nonly a short time is wrong. It takes months. And sales have been lost \nbecause of our lengthy, burdensome licensing process.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference report. \nI also ask unanimous consent that a copy of my statement at the time my \nsecond-degree amendment was offered be printed in the Record. That \nstatement relates all of my reasons for opposing the underlying \namendment reimposing export licenses of these midlevel computers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, July 10, 1997]\n\n       Mr. Grams. Mr. President, I understand that there is a lot \n     of concern in this body about United States computer sales \n     being diverted for military use to either China or Russia. \n     None of us wants that to occur. But we have to consider \n     whether the Cochran amendment solves the problem. I believe \n     that it does not.\n       The Cochran amendment would require export licenses for all \n     midlevel computers. Now, these are not supercomputers, these \n     are not high-end computers. You are going to hear that term, \n     but they are not supercomputers. These are midlevel \n     computers, and they are shipped to China, Russia, Israel, and \n     47 other countries. We talk about the Third Tier countries. \n     They involve 51 nations, like Russia, China, India, Pakistan, \n     Saudi Arabia, Israel, Romania, and the Baltic States. Some of \n     our future NATO Allies could also be involved. Mr. President, \n     export licenses do not solve end-user problems. These are \n     diversions that would not have been caught during the export \n     license procedure. Export licenses do require end-user \n     certification, but if the end user chooses to ignore the \n     agreement, or if the computer is stolen, that possibility \n     will not be evident in the licensing process. In my judgment, \n     the current system works.\n       Just yesterday, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen sent us a \n     letter opposing the Cochran amendment. He said the current \n     law and system can deal with unauthorized exports and \n     diversions. This is from the department that has been very \n     conservative on all export decontrol matters. Secretary Cohen \n     further states that we should focus our controls on \n     technology that can make a national security difference, not \n     that which is widely available around the world and is \n     obsolete.\n       Yes, Mr. President, there have been three diversions, but \n     that was out of 1,400 sales. But, no, this is not the right \n     way to address those problems. The right way is to force the \n     administration to publish as many military end users as \n     possible and then to work with the industry to identify all \n     military end users. We have been able to identify diversions \n     through our capable intelligence sources. Mr. President, \n     there is no evidence that there are dozens of computers out \n     there used by military end users. It is just not there.\n       Further, I don't believe that the industry irresponsibly \n     ignores available information about military end users. They \n     have too much at stake. A company which violates export \n     control laws takes a very big risk. The penalties are \n     prohibition of all exports for 20 years or more, 10 years in \n     prison, and up to a $5,000 fine for each violation. This \n     doesn't include the blemish that would remain on the \n     company's reputation or the great difficulty that company \n     would have in the future seeking an export license. No \n     company, Mr. President, can afford that risk.\n       What we would be doing here this morning is handing this \n     midlevel computer business over to the Japanese and other \n     allies. Now, again, I want to emphasize that these are \n     midlevel computers, they are not supercomputers. Next year, \n     they will be the kind of systems that we will be able to have \n     in our offices here in the Senate, or what you could find in \n     a small company or in a doctor's office. These are not the \n     computers that are sought after for nuclear weapons \n     production or design. Again, we are looking\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\n     at midlevel computers, between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS, which \n     are widely available around the world.\n       Supercomputers, which are sought after for weapons design, \n     start at the 20,000 MTOPS level and go all the way up to \n     650,000 this year, and they will go beyond the 1 million \n     MTOPS level next year. By the way, China already produces a \n     computer at 13,000 MTOPS. No other country considers these \n     computers to be anything but generally available and will \n     step in to take over the business that the Cochran amendment \n     will hand to them. The question is, is that what we want?\n       Also, anyone can purchase upgrades, by the way, to raise a \n     PC, a current PC, above the 2,000 MTOPS level. We can't \n     control the box. We can't control the chips around the world \n     that can be put in it. We can't control the upgrades. There \n     is no way to control these low-level PC's under the 2,000 \n     MTOPS threshold, again, since they are available in nearly \n     every country in the world.\n       Further, the chips that make up these computers are also \n     available and produced around the world. They were \n     decontrolled during the Bush administration. Our chip \n     producers have markets throughout the world, and they need to \n     maintain them to remain competitive. Chip producers cannot \n     control who receives their end product.\n       Also, how do you prohibit a foreign national from using a \n     computer even above the 7,000 level here in the United States \n     and taking the results back, or faxing it back?\n       Our friend Jack Kemp has written to us also this week \n     stating that the Cochran amendment would ``establish a policy \n     that is destined to fail and would hurt American computer \n     manufacturers without protecting our national security. The \n     American high-technology sector is critical to the future of \n     this country and must be protected from overly intrusive \n     Government restrictions.''\n       I wish there was something we could do to effectively \n     control some of these exports, but it is just not possible at \n     these lower levels. We cannot convince our allies to reverse \n     2 years of their own decontrol. In fact, Europe has tabled a \n     decontrol proposal at 10,000 MTOPS, which proves that they \n     have no intention of even respecting our 7,000 level. We \n     cannot pull all the PC's and upgrades off the retail shelves, \n     and we cannot close our borders to prevent all foreign \n     nationals from entering this country and using our computers.\n       We must concentrate our resources on keeping computers \n     above the 7,000 level from reaching military end users; \n     that's for sure. But I fear that an increased license burden \n     in the administration would steer resources away from efforts \n     to locate diversions and investigate them.\n       Now, Mr. President, in an earlier statement, I also \n     countered a claim that an export license requirement would \n     not slow down these computer sales. I have heard that someone \n     made the comment that an export license would take 10 days. \n     Well, anyone who knows how the licensing process works knows \n     that it can take many, many months to obtain one. This will \n     only earn our industry a reputation as an unreliable \n     supplier, and it will cost us sales and it will cost us many, \n     many U.S. jobs. The administration admits that a computer \n     license application averages 107 days to reach a decision. I \n     have seen it take far longer. Even 107 days, by the way, is \n     enough to convince the end user to go out and seek a buyer in \n     another country.\n       Since so many of the Tier 3 countries are emerging markets, \n     we need to be in there early to maintain a foothold for \n     future sales. When we hear about the 6.3 percent of sales to \n     Tier 3 countries, that is misleading. It is in an area where \n     the market is expanding rapidly. If we leave our companies \n     out of those markets, they will not be there to compete in \n     the future. They will not be there to provide sales and jobs \n     for the United States.\n       Another argument I have heard is that there is no foreign \n     availability over 3,500 MTOPS. Well, last year, NEC of Japan \n     tried to sell a supercomputer to the United States Government \n     at a level between 30,000 and 50,000 MTOPS. They match our \n     speeds all the way to the top.\n       Mr. President, I believe that all of us are proud of our \n     computer industry, that our industry remains the state of the \n     art in so many areas, particularly in the levels above 7,000. \n     We have made progress to facilitate exports without \n     compromising our national security, progress which began back \n     in the Reagan and Bush administrations, but here is an effort \n     today to reverse all of that progress.\n       Our industry has to survive on exports, and it has to \n     pursue commercial business with these 50 countries to remain \n     competitive. All computer sales over the 7,000 MTOPS level do \n     require license now. We have not sold any computers above \n     that level. And, again, the 7,000 MTOPS are not \n     supercomputers--they are not--they are midlevel computers. We \n     have not sold any computers above that level to Tier 3 \n     countries; nor do our allies, to my knowledge. However, we \n     should not restrict the sales of these midlevel and, again, \n     generally available computers to commercial end users. We \n     should simply maintain the current licensing requirement for \n     the questionable end users. I firmly believe that there will \n     be improved cooperation between the Government and industry \n     on end-user information, particularly those for Russia and \n     China.\n       Now, I also commend the Commerce Department for starting to \n     publish information on end users and to examine all sales \n     that are made to the Tier 3 countries within these computer \n     speeds.\n       The Grams-Boxer amendment requests the GAO to determine \n     whether these sales affect our national security. That is \n     very important. It will look into the issue of foreign \n     availability. It will also require the publication of a \n     military end-user list, and it requires Commerce to improve \n     its assistance to the industry on identifying those military \n     end users.\n       There will be some that vote today solely to express their \n     dissatisfaction with China's alleged military sales to our \n     adversaries. Let me remind you once again that there is no \n     evidence that U.S. computers were involved in any of those \n     cases. I also urge you to look at the merits of this issue. \n     Pure and simple, the Cochran amendment would hand the sales \n     of midlevel computers over to the Japanese and the Europeans \n     at the expense of an industry that we have sought to protect \n     and to promote and an industry that we are proud of.\n       As chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of \n     Banking, the committee that has jurisdiction over this issue, \n     I strongly, this morning, urge my colleagues to vote for my \n     substitute and let us continue this debate in the normal \n     manner, through committee consideration. At the same time, \n     the administration should step up its efforts to express to \n     the Chinese and the Russians our grave concerns regarding \n     efforts to divert commercial sales to military end users \n     without knowledge of the United States seller.\n       Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of my colleague \n     from Mississippi to address these diversions. I want to work \n     with him in my role as chairman of the subcommittee of \n     jurisdiction to ensure that the current system does work or \n     on how we can improve it once we have better information \n     regarding the extent of the problem.\n       I urge the support of my colleagues for the Grams-Boxer \n     substitute as a compromise to this very, very controversial \n     issue. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11396-7", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11398-S11399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n1998 Agriculture appropriations conference agreement that was passed \nlast night. There is much to be proud of in the conference agreement \nand I feel it is another step forward in implementing the 1996 farm \nbill.\n  I am particularly pleased with the inclusion of the Grams-Feingold \namendment directing the Office of Management and Budget to conduct a \nstudy of the economic impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact.\n  I will not reiterate my long-standing opposition to implementation of \nthe compact or the history surrounding its inclusion in the 1996 farm \nbill. But along with my colleagues in the House and Senate who have an \ninterest in equitable and lasting dairy reform, I remain committed to \nbringing fairness to Minnesota's dairy farmers.\n  There has been some disagreement as to what should be included in \nsuch a study. I know the senior Senator from Vermont has addressed us \non more than one occasion in defense of the compact. More recently he \noutlined his concerns regarding what he felt should be included in the \nOMB study.\n  However, I must stress that these are the remarks of one Senator and \nshould not be misconstrued by OMB or anyone else as the official \nposition of the U.S. Senate.\n  The conference agreement clearly calls for a comprehensive economic \nevaluation of the direct and indirect effects of the compact. I welcome \nthe results of a study I expect to be free of outside influences. I am \nconfident this compact will be exposed as a misguided, ill-fated \nattempt at market manipulation.\n  Mr. President, the OMB study in this conference agreement will help \nus assess the compact's effects on the poor, needy senior citizens and \nchildren, as well as the Nation's dairy producers.\n  It is to be completed by December 31, 1997, and I will closely \nobserve its progress in order to ensure that the study is conducted in \na fair and equitable manner and is not manipulated by outside \ninterests. I expect the administration to allow an independent study \nthat is not influenced by any USDA or White House political agenda.\n  Another provision I am pleased was included will prohibit Agriculture \nMarket Transition Act [AMTA] payments to a producer who plants wild \nrice on contract acreage, unless the payment is reduced proportionally.\n  As it currently stands, producers of other commodities who choose to \nplant wild rice on land designated for other crops can receive both \ntheir AMTA payment and the proceeds for sale of\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\ntheir wild rice. This has placed wild rice farmers at a disadvantage. \nIt violates the intent of the law and it also results in unfair \ncompetition.\n  I am pleased the House and Senate conferees agreed with my amendment \nand chose to include it in this agreement. The provision clarifies \ncongressional intent and restores fairness to our farm payment system.\n  I also want to make special note of the research funding contained in \nthis bill for fusarium head blight, commonly known as scab, and \nvomitoxin.\n  During a recent trip through Minnesota's Red River Valley, wheat and \nbarley producers stressed time and time again the economic impact these \ndiseases have had on their crops. Minnesota is again experiencing an \nepidemic of scab which marks the fifth straight year the disease has \nbeen seen to some degree in the Northern Plains.\n  When added to contributions producers and the State of Minnesota have \nmade to scab and vomitoxin research, I believe that the provisions \ncontained in the research titles of this agreement are an appropriate \napproach to the Federal commitment regarding long-term basic research.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated many times both here and in \nMinnesota, we must give our farmers the tools to manage their business \nand not hamstring their creativity and productivity from Washington.\n  Although there is much work to be done regarding dairy and regulatory \nreform and risk-management, this conference agreement is a step in the \nright direction. I look forward to its immediate passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the state of the \nbusiness of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak up to 5 minutes each.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I inquire when that expires?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve o'clock.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that, joined by my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, we be allowed to speak in \nmorning business for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11398-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11399-S11402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS AND AMERICA'S POSITION AS A WORLD LEADER\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the Senate floor \ntoday, joined by my friend from our neighboring State of Arkansas, \nSenator Tim Hutchinson.\n  As the 21st century approaches, Senator Hutchinson and I both share a \ndesire to see the United States maintain its position as a world \nleader--a world leader that emphasizes opportunity and freedom. A \nstrong America abroad preserves the safety of our citizens at home and \nhelps advance the ideals of liberty around the world.\n  The United States is involved internationally in very substantial \nways, and in some of those settings it is my fear that, instead of \nexhibiting strong leadership, we have demonstrated that we are \nincapable of demanding integrity and of requesting that others deal \nwith us honestly.\n  We are in the waning moments of a summit meeting between the \nPresident of China, Jiang Zemin, and President Clinton. Summit meetings \ncan be very important times. They can provide opportunities for the \nUnited States to demonstrate leadership, to demonstrate a commitment to \nfreedom and integrity in international relationships. Or they can do \nthe converse and they can demonstrate that America will not demand \nintegrity, will not demand a commitment to freedom and fair play. \nSummits can indicate that America does not have the kind of care for \nthe rights of individuals generally around the globe that we would be \nknown for historically in this country.\n  When we have summit meetings, we need to advance America's security \nand economic interests. Summit meetings should be times of structural \nadvance for the United States, when we put in place the kind of \nframework that will result in our country being stronger--the kind of \nframework that will preserve our security and advance freedom around \nthe world.\n  If statesmanship is not present, summits can become transactional \nrather than address the critical structural issues in a bilateral \nrelationship. We have seen that during the United States-China summit \nthis week, where the President of the United States has been eager for \ncertain businesses to sell their goods to China, and has, in this \nparticular summit, made it possible for the Chinese to gain access to \nsome of the most important and sensitive nuclear technology in the \nUnited States. But the real issues in United States-China relations, \nhowever, have been deferred. Critical national security challenges, a \nstaggering trade deficit, and an appalling human rights record in China \nall took a backseat to business contracts.\n  Summits can turn into shallow media events when the critical \nbilateral issues are ignored. The United States-China summit was worse \nthan just a shallow event. Unfortunately, it was an event which \ndemonstrated that we were willing--in order to acquire certain business \ncontracts--to look past what ought to be clear, structural issues that \nought to galvanize our attention. China did not come to the summit to \nmake real concessions on any front, and we responded with accommodation \nand appeasement. We agreed to have the summit anyway, in spite of the \nfact that China didn't come to provide genuine progress for the people \nof China or for the people of the United States.\n  Whenever we don't achieve structural change, such as progress in our \ntrading relationships, which would be a reduction in tariffs or \nnontariff barriers from China; whenever we don't see an improvement in \nthe human rights situation in China so that personal freedom is \nadvanced; whenever we don't have a clear record which demonstrates that \nChina will cease proliferating nuclear and chemical weapons and mass \ndestruction technology--we have lost the ability to advance our \nnation's fundamental interests and we have traded principle for a few \ncommercial contracts.\n  The real opportunity of summitry is the opportunity for structural \nchange--not of transactions alone. It is an opportunity for \nstatesmanship--not just salesmanship.\n  I don't think it is wrong for the President of the United States to \nwant to sell our goods abroad. But when we sell our goods and our \nprinciples along with them--the kind of commitment we have to freedom, \nthe kind of commitment we have to integrity, the kind of commitment we \nhave to stopping the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons \naround the world--I think the price is too high.\n  I think we will have to ask ourselves when we look at the record of \nthis summit, ``Has this been an exercise in statesmanship, or has this \nbeen an exercise in salesmanship?'' If it has just been an exercise in \nsalesmanship, what have we sold? Have we bartered away our credibility, \nour commitment to freedom and liberty, and our demand for fair and \nbalanced trade? Have we compromised our position when it comes to \ncombating the proliferation of chemical and nuclear weapons? In my \njudgment, I think we have to ask those questions very, very soberly.\n  Did the summit advance America's economic and security interests? Did \nit put United States-China relations on a firmer footing by addressing \nthe critical issues in our bilateral relationship, or was it centered \naround accommodation and big-ticket commercial deals? Have we, instead \nof engaging in statesmanship, just found ourselves engaged in \nsalesmanship and perhaps selling some of the things which we hold most \ndear in the process?\n  My distinguished friend from Arkansas has shared many of these same \nconcerns about our policy towards China. Senator Hutchinson has looked \nat this situation. He has grasped, I think, what is happening pretty \nwell.\n  Senator Hutchinson, is there any indication that the administration's \nChina policy is defending American security, economic, and human rights \ninterest? Or has this been something that\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\nsimply ended up as being a transactional experience where we sold some \ngoods and apparently were sold a bill of goods in return?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. First, may I say I am glad that I am able to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri.\n  When he speaks of ``statesmanship'' on the issue of foreign policy, I \nthink he exemplifies that term.\n  To answer the Senator's question, I think it is unfortunate that \nafter the summit the whole issue of human rights has really taken a \nback seat to commercial interests and that the attention that has been \ngiven to human rights is primarily attributable to those who have been \nwilling to protest the presence of Jiang Zemin in our country, coming \nto the United States with the kind of attention at a state dinner, with \na 21-gun salute, and with the red carpet treatment he has been \naccorded.\n  So I am glad for those who have pushed the issue of human rights.\n  The President was praised yesterday for chiding Jiang for the human \nrights record in China. But I think the chiding at whatever level it \nmay have occurred and to what extent it may have occurred is greatly \nundermined when it is accompanied by 21-gun salutes, red carpet \ntreatment, and state dinners, that, in fact, the ultimate end result of \nthis summit will be to give greater acceptance of the Chinese Communist \nGovernment and greater willingness to accept and condone the oppressive \npractices that have become characteristic of this regime.\n  So instructive engagement has degenerated, I am afraid, into an \nexercise of appeasement. I think ``appeasement'' is a very strong word \nto use. But when we look at the last 4 years, I think it is not too \nstrong a term to use to describe what the administration's policy has \nbeen.\n  The logic behind constructive engagement, as my colleague well knows, \nhas been that expanded trade would lead to political liberalization and \nthat economic freedom frequently leads to political freedom.\n  I have had meetings with a number of dissidents this week from China, \nthe most famous of whom in this country is probably Harry Wu. When I \nraised this issue with Harry Wu, I said, ``Harry, when they talk about \neconomic liberalization leading to political liberalization and that \ntrade ultimately always leads to political liberty if we will just give \nit time, that greater trade opportunities, the higher standard of \nliving, and what they experience with economic prosperity has to \nultimately lead to political liberalization and greater freedom,'' his \nresponse was if the administration were sincere in that, if they were \ngenuine in that conviction, why not use that in North Korea, why not \nuse that in Cuba? If, in fact, trade ended totalitarianism, we would be \npracticing that in other places.\n  I would be delighted to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. Wu is a person who speaks with some experience as \nit relates to the human rights situation in China because he spent some \nconsiderable time in Chinese jails as a result of speaking openly, \ndidn't he?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is correct. I believe Mr. Wu spent a total of 19 \nyears in Chinese prisons.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is this because he attempted to rob a bank, or launched \nan assault on the Government?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. His incarceration was because he was drawing \nattention to something that China is sensitive to, which is the slave \nlabor camp system that exists within China, and most recently, of \ncourse, his drawing attention to the Chinese Government's policy of \nselling organs from those who have been executed within those prisons.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So for telling the truth in China, he spent 19 years in \nChinese prisons.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Simply for being willing to express a dissenting \nopinion.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. During the time when he was in prison, was there \nexpanding trade or contracting trade with the United States?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. As the Senator knows, trade has consistently \nexpanded. I might also add that our deficit in trade with China has \nexpanded as well, so that this year it is anticipated we will have a \n$44 billion trade deficit.\n\n  But I think at the time Harry Wu was first incarcerated, it was down \nin the single digits.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The expanded trade didn't expand his rights very \neffectively. He is free, and has to be outside of China to be confident \nof his ability to continue to speak freely.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I believe what underscores that even more is during \nthe 8 years since Tiananmen Square and during the 4 years since we have \nadopted this so-called policy of instructive engagement, by every \nmeasure, human rights conditions in China have deteriorated, which \nseems to me to greatly undermine this approach that economic trade will \nlead to greater political liberty.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. So the administration's decision not even to consider \nhuman rights abuses when dealing with China has proven, I think, \ndisastrous for the people of China and they have been removed from the \nthreat of any repercussions; that is, the Chinese Communist government \nin their trade relationship with the United States and the Chinese \nCommunist leaders have succeeded in jailing every last dissident in a \ncountry of over 1 billion people. So rather than seeing expanded \nliberties, we have seen those contracted by the jailing of every last \ndissident as our country has turned a blind eye to the atrocities that \nhave escalated, and the oppressive government in China has strengthened \nits hold on fully what is one-fourth of the world's population.\n  Since the United States formally delinked American trade with China \nfrom its human rights performance of abuse, much has changed, but \nnothing has changed for the better.\n  I had in my office yesterday--I share this with the Senator from \nMissouri--a number of Chinese political dissidents, democracy \ndissidents, those who had raised their voices on the side of freedom. \nOne was a former editor with the People's Daily, a Communist Chinese \nnewspaper. He resigned that position because they would not allow him \nto speak the truth.\n  But the one I remember the most and that made such an impression upon \nme was the young man who said that on the very day that President \nClinton announced his policy of delinking in which he said no longer \nwill we tie human rights abuses and violations to our attitude toward \ntrade with Communist China, it was on that very day that they came and \nrounded him up and his incarceration and his prison term began.\n  So the policy of constructive engagement has simply failed. It has \nproduced more persecutions of Christians, more forced abortions, more \nsterilizations to the mentally handicapped, more incarcerations of \npolitical dissidents, and the near extinction of the expression of any \nopinions contrary to that of the Communist regime.\n  I participated yesterday, I believe it was yesterday, in the ``Adopt \na Prisoner of Conscience'' Program that began on the House side in \nwhich Members of the House and Senate were invited to adopt a \nparticular individual who today is languishing in a Chinese Communist \nprison for no other reason--not because they robbed a bank or because \nthey mugged somebody, or they robbed--for no other reason than they had \nexpressed their own conscience contrary to that of the Communist \ngovernment.\n  The ``prisoner of conscious'' whom I adopted, and whose name I do not \nseek to say, was charged with this crime: Helping Christians. That was \nthe charge. That is why he is incarcerated. The date of release is \nunknown. How long he will stay in prison we don't know. But his crime \nwas simply helping Christians.\n  So I suggest, as I yield to the Senator from Missouri, that this \npolicy of constructive engagement has failed, and at some point, if \ntime allows, I would like to talk about how this foreign policy \ncontrasts so poorly with the very firm foreign policy that we had under \nRonald Reagan.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator.\n  I have to say in response to the Senator that the contrast between \nthe rights of man in America and the kind of lip service given to \nfreedom by the Chinese leadership could not be more striking.\n  When asked about the nature of liberty, Chinese President Jiang said \nthat liberty, in and of itself, is not an absolute, that it is a \nrelative thing. He\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\nanalogized it to Einstein's theory of relativity. For President Jiang, \nliberty is something that can grow or shrink depending on the need, or \nthe circumstance of the moment. Freedom might be something to be \ncherished; it might not.\n  In contrast, the United States of America was founded on the concept \nin our Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator \nwith inalienable rights. And this means a couple of things. One, that \nthese rights are not relative, they are not adjustable; they are \nimmutable, they are unchangeable--that these are given to us by God. It \nalso suggests to us that they are given to everybody because it is the \nCreator that gives the right. It is not even governments which give \nrights. Rights are something that we are given by virtue of being \ncreated, and these rights are for the benefit of people all across the \nglobe.\n  We have on the one hand a Chinese leader that would have total \nlatitude to adjust rights based on a theory of relativity. That is \nprecisely what is happening in China. Someone being an accessory to \nChristianity, helping a Christian, finds himself in jail for an \nindeterminant length of time; someone who not only is not engaged in \ndomestic unrest or criminal activity, but is just assisting other \npeople in their own ability to recognize the existence of a Creator in \naccordance with their beliefs. In China, accessories to Christianity \nare criminals.\n  That is the extent to which liberty can be withheld or granted in \nChina, and that makes it very difficult to deal with such a goverment. \nThe administration invites the Chinese delegation to the United States \nand we talk to them about human rights issues. While those officials \nare here in this country, it is very easy for them to make commitments \nto human rights in China. Since rights are relative, promises can be \nmade now, but when the delegation returns to Beijing, the commitments \ntake on new meaning.\n  The truth of the matter is that I think America has it right about \nrights, that rights are something granted by the Creator, guarded \nperhaps by government, sometimes threatened and taken away by \ngovernment. But rights are something we have because of our creation \nand our existence. They are not relative. They are not dependent upon \nwhether someone thinks the condition is favorable to the rights of man. \nThese are things which we are born with, we are created with. They are \ninalienable. They are immutable.\n  President Jiang often says the right thing on human rights. Even \nChina's constitution provides for fundamental human rights. China \nsigned the U.N. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \nRights this week. Signing documents is painless, but if you really \nbelieve that rights are relative, that circumstances determine rights, \nwhat does the signature mean? It means that the rights will be granted \nso long as we want them to be granted.\n  The 1996 State Department human rights report says, ``All public \ndissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by \nintimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative \ndetention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at \nyear's end.''\n  Now, that is a sobering concept, when our own State Department says, \n``No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.'' That has a \nvery sobering tone. I believe that we ought to demand and expect a \nbetter human rights record from the Chinese Government.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I was impressed with the Senator's comments as he \nreminds us of what Jiang has said concerning rights, that they are \nrelative, that they are not absolute. And how do you deal, how do you \nnegotiate, how can you trust a leader that has that concept of \nliberties, and how that contrasts in fact with our own Founding \nFathers--the attitude that they seem to have that rights are like \naspirins to be dispensed as needed by the government and to expand or \nto contract as the situation may require?\n  The ideals of the American Revolution were not narrow. They were not \nculturally limited appeals without relevance beyond our shores. Our \nFounding Fathers recognized that when God gave rights, when the Creator \ngave rights, he didn't just give them to Americans; that he gave them \nto all human beings. And so the efforts of the Chinese leadership to \ndepict Western democracy as being only a Western phenomenon, that it is \na Western cultural thing like business suits or like eating with knives \nand forks is I think contrary to the reality that in fact rights are \nabsolute and that civil liberties, that human rights transcend cultures \nand they transcend societies and they even transcend various forms of \ngovernment.\n  The young students in Beijing 8 years ago who defied the tanks, I say \nto the Senator, were not there making papier-mache models of Chairman \nMao but of Miss Liberty. They didn't quote from Marx. They were quoting \nfrom Thomas Jefferson. And we may not be able to save the lives of \nevery young, brave student in the world, but we should always make it \nclear that our prayers and our policies are on the side against the \ntanks of terror and that we should never sell out his cause of freedom \nfor trade opportunities.\n  I recall, as does the Senator, when the copyright issue came up with \nChina and that China was violating American copyright laws. It was at \nthat point that the administration threatened sanctions against China. \nWhen I was talking with Harry Wu, he replied as only Harry Wu could, \nthat copyright equals sanctions, human rights equal no sanctions. And I \nthink it really puts in perspective the attitude of the administration \nthat profits seem to be more important and will bring greater \nrepercussions and consequences with the Chinese Government than will \nthe violation of human rights.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. I see that our time is fast \nfleeting. I thank the Senator for making the case against China's human \nrights record.\n  There are other points to be made about the inequities in the \nrelationship between the United States and China. Not the least of \nthose is trade. The average tariff that China has on our goods is about \n23 percent. The average United States tariff on Chinese goods is about \n4 percent. That it is basically a 6-to-1 ratio. And as a result there \nis a staggering trade deficit with China. The Chinese citizens do not \nbuy nearly as much from us as other countries do.\n  The average Chinese buys 10 dollars worth of United States goods \nevery year compared to $1,000 for the Taiwanese, $550 for every South \nKorean. Our trade deficit with Japan is troubling, but it only grew by \n10 percent between 1991 and 1996. The United States trade deficit with \nChina grew by more than 200 percent during that same period.\n  But as important as trade and human rights are, there is another \nimportant issue: the national security of the United States. China has \nbeen the worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction technology, \naccording to a CIA report. Today's Washington Times headline reads, \n``Clinton Jiang Reach Nuclear Accord.'' This is an accord which is \ndesigned to give China the very best of the nuclear information we have \nin this country, much of it sponsored with taxpayers' dollars as a \nresult of governmentally assisted research. And not far from the \n``Clinton Jiang Reach Nuclear Accord'' headline is, ``China Aided Iran \nin Chemical Arms.'' This second article talks about a report from our \nGovernment that indicates that China has helped Iran develop a chemical \nweapons capacity--weapons of mass destruction for the kind of Third \nWorld rogue regime that we find in Iran.\n  To see these things juxtaposed on the front page of a newspaper sends \na chill, and it should, through my spine. To think that we are signing \nhigh-level nuclear accords with governments that are helping terrorist \nstates like Iran acquire weapons of mass destruction technology is \nincomprehensible.\n  To have that article right there, the nuclear accord, right beneath \nthe story on China aiding Iran in the development of chemical weapons, \nis a dramatic illustration of this administration's failing China \npolicy. The CIA report released this past summer said that China was \nthe worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction technologies in \nthe latter half of 1996. A greater degree of caution is needed in \ndealing with such governments.\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\n  U.S. credibility was at stake in the nuclear cooperation debate. What \nkind of leadership are we providing to the rest of the world? Other \ncountries will not take their responsibility to restrain proliferation \nseriously if the United States enters into nuclear cooperation with the \nworld's worst proliferator of nuclear and chemical weapons \ntechnologies.\n  I thank the Senator for coming to the floor. If there are other \nquestions or comments, I invite them.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator for taking the leadership on this \nissue so forcefully. If I could ask unanimous consent for just 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not object but I would ask in the \nunanimous consent that after the 2 minutes I be recognized for a \nstatement. I have been waiting for that time to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection? The Chair \nhears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In closing, may I say it is my understanding that \nJiang will be in Philadelphia, PA, today at the Liberty Bell, this \ngreat cradle of liberty, this great cradle of democracy in our country. \nI hope he reads well the words that are inscribed in the Liberty Bell \nbecause it is from the Scriptures. I think it is from the Book of \nDeuteronomy. It says, ``Proclaim liberty throughout the land.'' I hope \nhe takes it to heart, that this is a concept he needs to bring back to \nChina, and there is much he can do, starting with no longer jamming \nRadio Free Asia. If he believes in liberty, let the message of freedom \ncome into his country.\n\n  Among the dissidents I met with this week was an elderly Tibetan lady \nwho had been arrested and spent 28 years in prison. She said that all \nof those who were arrested when she was arrested are now dead. And she \nsaid she has asked repeatedly, why only her? Why did she live? Why did \nshe survive those 28 years in prison? And as we met right over here in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee room, she looked around--there were 10 \nSenators there, and she looked at those Senators and said, ``That's why \nI survived, so I could tell my story.''\n  I thank Senator Ashcroft for helping tell her story to the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have different things I want to talk \nabout. One of the things I might talk about is the beauty of the great \nState of Montana, but I know I would only embarrass the Presiding \nOfficer if I did that. So I will hold that for another occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11399-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11402-S11403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REVERSING FCC TOWER-SITING RULES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have strongly objected to the proposed \nFederal Communications Commission rules that I believe essentially rob \nStates and communities of the authority to decide where unsightly \ntelecommunications towers should be built, and I want to renew my \nobjection to those proposed rules.\n  Back when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed, there were only \nfive Senators who voted against it. I was one of the five. One of my \nfears was that the will and voices of States and of local communities \nwould be muzzled.\n  As a lifelong Vermonter, I didn't want to see that happen to my \nState. Unfortunately, the fears I had at that time have been confirmed. \nUnder the so-called telecommunications reform bill, Vermont towns and \ntowns in other States have very little say when big and unsightly \ntowers are proposed. Towns can no longer just say, ``No, you can't put \nthat awful tower in our community, blocking our scenic vistas.'' It is \nunfortunate that 91 Senators said they were willing to see the rights \nof towns and cities trampled that way.\n  The bill also prohibits towns and cities from having stricter health \nand safety standards regarding environmental effects of radio frequency \nemissions.\n  Here is what has happened in Vermont. Keep in mind, Mr. President, \nthat our State is one of the most beautiful States in the country. \nPeople come to our State because of the magnificent views. And those of \nus who were born there want to remain there because of this beauty. Now \nwe are being told that no matter how much we have done to promote this \nbeauty, if somebody wants to just slap up telecommunication towers \nright in the middle of the most magnificent vista there may be little \nwe can do about it.\n  The State of Vermont, from Gov. Howard Dean to the Vermont \nEnvironmental Board and local zoning officials and mayors and citizens, \nis concerned that it is losing control of the siting and design and \nconstruction of telecommunication towers and related facilities.\n  These people have written to the FCC opposing this rule, and I \nendorse their comments. They have done an excellent job representing \nthe views of all Vermonters. As a matter of fact, I also submitted a \nlengthy petition, something I rarely do but I did this as a Vermonter \nhoping that we will influence the FCC.\n  I think these tower siting rules should be stopped once and for all. \nWe ought to tear them out by their roots which were planted in the 1996 \ntelecommunications bill.\n  To make sure that they can be torn out, I am introducing legislation \nthat repeals the authority given to the FCC in 1996 to preempt State \nand local regulations on the placement of new telecommunication towers. \nI don't want Vermont turned into a giant pin cushion with 200-foot \ntowers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and in every \nvalley, ruining the view that most of us have spent a lifetime \nenjoying.\n  I might note that my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Mr. \nJeffords, is going to join me as a cosponsor of this legislation\n  The backbone of Vermont's beauty is its great mountains, surrounded \nby magnificent views of valleys, rivers, and streams. Vermonters do not \nwant these scenic vistas destroyed by towers, bristling with all manner \nof antennas and bright lights, strobes, flashes, and everything else \nthat destroy this vista.\n  I think of my own home, my tree farm in Middlesex, VT. When I step \nout the front door of my home, I look 35 miles down a valley ringed by \nmountains. I live on a dirt road, and I literally cannot see another \nhouse or another dwelling in any direction. I look at some of the most \nbeautiful scenery of Vermont. Frankly, Mr. President, each time I am \nback home this renews my soul and my spirit.\n  I am sure all Vermonters and all those who visit us in Vermont feel \nthe same way I do about the scenic wonders of our State. Because of \nthat, we Vermonters have determined that we want to move with care to \navoid the indiscriminate placement of towers that would jeopardize one \nof our State's most precious assets. We Vermonters want some say in our \nown life. We Vermonters want some say in protecting what is the best in \nour beautiful State.\n  Vermont citizens and communities should be able to participate in the \nimportant decisions that affect their families and their future. The \nlocation of large transmission towers have significant effects on \nproperty values, on health, and enjoyment of one's home, in fact even \nthe ability to sell one's home.\n  I say the Telecommunications Act went far too far toward preemption \nof local control and now this proposed FCC implementation goes even \nfurther. Vermont has enacted landmark legislation, Act 250, to preserve \nour environment while permitting growth.\n  Understand, when I sit in my home in Vermont, I am connected by \ncomputer to my office in Washington and my offices in two other \nlocations in Vermont. I can communicate with my children wherever they \nare by telephone or by computer. I pull up newspapers that are not \navailable to me immediately in Vermont off the Internet. I am for \nprogress. I think that is something Vermont has always supported, but \nnot for ill-considered, so-called progress at the expense of Vermont \nfamilies and homeowners.\n  It is important that Vermont not be left out of technological \nprogress, but that is the whole reason Vermont enacted the Act 250 \nprocess. Vermont communities and the State of Vermont have to have a \nrole in deciding where these towers are going to go. Vermonters should \nbe able to take into account the protection of our scenic\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nbeauty. It is not enough just to have technological advances.\n  So by requiring the companies to work with Vermont towns, acceptable \nalternatives can be found. My bill, again, affirms where the burden of \nproof should be: with the applicant, not the community. I trust \nVermonters to do what is right to protect our State's beautiful \nscenery. All I am saying, Mr. President, is let Vermonters decide what \nto do with our scenery. The FCC rules should not stand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, under the order, I believe we had 30 \nminutes reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Several of my associates and I want to take that time to \ntalk about the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act, which we \nthink is very important to Medicare recipients and to the system. We \nwant to talk about that. However, before we begin, and we will then \nshare our time, I yield to the Senator from Kansas for several minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nWyoming for yielding a couple minutes. I will be very brief about this \nand pointed.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1334 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, we would like to scoot back now on to this \nfocus on Medicare, the idea that Medicare patients certainly have an \nopportunity to choose, that we are able to strengthen the Medicare \nProgram through this function. I will first yield to the sponsor of the \nbill and, frankly, the person who has carried the weight and continues \nto, the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will you please advise me when I have spoken \nfor 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We shall grant the Senator 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Wyoming taking this time \nto discuss what we think is one of the most important matters yet to be \ndecided before the end of this legislative session. I know we have some \nappropriations bills to pass to ensure that the Federal Government is \nfunded for next year, and perhaps a couple of other items, like the \nfast-track legislation. But in terms of important principles, I can't \nthink of anything more important than ensuring that the American people \nhave the right to go to the doctor of their choice.\n  You heard me right. I said to ensure that the American people have \nthe right to go to the doctor of their choice. You mean they don't have \nthat right? Well, Mr. President, unless we fix a part of the balanced \nbudget bill that we passed earlier in this session, as of January 1, \nsenior citizens in this country will not be guaranteed the right to go \nto the physician of their choice. Here is the problem.\n  The Clinton administration interprets the Medicare law to require \nthat a Medicare patient be treated under Medicare; that that person \ncannot go to a doctor who may see some Medicare patients but is not \ntaking anymore Medicare patients and, therefore, is unwilling to treat \nthe patient as a Medicare patient. Here is the exact situation, a real-\nlife story that happened to one of my constituents in the small town of \nPrescott, AZ.\n  She just turned 65. She is diabetic. She was having complications. \nShe wanted to see a physician who could take care of her, and there \nweren't very many specialists in that small town. She found one who \ncould take care of her. She went to him and he said, ``Now, you are \n65.''\n  She said, ``Yes.''\n  He said, ``Then I don't think I can take care of you.''\n  She said, ``Why not?\"\n  He said, ``I'm not taking anymore Medicare patients, you're Medicare \neligible.''\n  She said, ``That is all right, send me the bill, I will pay you. We \nwill save Medicare money.''\n  He checked with HCFA, the entity that runs Medicare, and sure enough, \nhe could be prosecuted for a Federal crime if he entered into what is \ncalled a private contract with her.\n  That is the way the Clinton administration interprets the law and, in \nfact, Mr. President, that is the way they want the law to read because \nthey don't want any competition for Medicare. Once you turn 65, it is \ntheir view that everybody should have Medicare and only Medicare. One \nof my colleagues said it is Medicare or no care.\n  That is an unacceptable choice for senior citizens in this country. \nWhy should you become second class when you turn 65 and not be able to \ncontract privately with a physician of your choice?\n  I am on a Federal health care plan. I happen to like Blue Cross, so I \nsigned up with the Blue Cross plan. But I still go to a doctor that is \noutside of that plan and pay for it myself. I have that right. Why \nshouldn't a senior citizen have the same right that I do under my \nFederal health care plan? Why should someone, merely because they turn \n65, be denied the right to privately contract with the physician of \ntheir choice? Maybe they have been seeing the same doctor for 40 years \nand they want to continue seeing that doctor but he is not taking \nanymore Medicare patients, why shouldn't they be able to go to him and \nwhy shouldn't he be able to contract directly with them?\n\n  We passed it 64-35 in the Senate. It went into the balanced budget \nbill, but the administration said, no, they would veto the balanced \nbudget bill unless we took that provision out or unless we changed it. \nHow did they insist it be changed, without my approval by the way? They \nsaid, OK, the patient can have the choice but no doctor can serve such \na patient unless in advance he opts out of Medicare for 2 years.\n  Let's be realistic, only 4 percent of the nonpediatricians don't \nserve any Medicare patients. Most doctors have some Medicare patients. \nDo we want to literally force those doctors to dump all of their \nMedicare patients just so they can privately contract? That is not the \nway to encourage more doctors to see more Medicare patients. Why \nshouldn't a physician be able to both treat patients under Medicare and \nnot treat patients under Medicare?\n  There is only one argument, other than the fact this presents some \ncompetition to Medicare. In that regard, I don't see how it hurts \nMedicare, because to the extent that anybody would choose not to take \nadvantage of Medicare, they are saving Medicare money. It doesn't hurt \nMedicare. It actually helps Medicare, they don't have to pay as much.\n  There is some concern that some unscrupulous doctor somewhere might \ntake advantage of a Medicare patient. ``I'm not going to treat you \nunder Medicare; you have to enter into a private contract with me, and \nI am going to gouge you.'' I don't think that is going to happen.\n  Just to be sure, we built into the bill which I introduced a \nprovision against fraud. It requires a written contract, and the \npatient can get out of it at any time. HCFA gets information from the \ndoctor which tells them exactly what is going on. So if there is any \nfraud, that doctor can be prosecuted. So we have taken care of the \nmajor problem that has been raised.\n  I don't think there is any reason why our bill should not pass. I \ndon't think this Congress should go on record as standing for the \nprinciple that when you turn 65 in the United States of America, you \ndon't have the choice to go to the doctor of your choice, and that \ndoctor doesn't have the choice to care for you if he wants to do that. \nIt is wrong, it is un-American, it is a violation of fundamental \nrights, and before this Congress adjourns, Mr. President, we need to \nfix the law so that\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\nsenior citizens in this country have a fundamental right to the medical \ncare that they deserve.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his sponsorship of this \ntime for us to discuss this issue. I hope we have a chance before this \nlegislative session is over to act upon this bill to get it passed and \nthat the President will sign it. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Wyoming \ncontrols the time, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I request 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be here with my \ncolleagues from Arizona and Wyoming, because I share in their concern \nthat this is a fundamental issue of our freedom and that is the right \nof the seniors to privately contract their own health care.\n  Quite frankly, I am surprised we are having to debate this issue on \nthe Senate floor. It is amazing to me how far we have strayed from this \nprinciple of some fundamental freedoms that the individual should \nenjoy.\n\n  Again, I compliment particularly my colleague from Arizona for his \nleadership on this particular issue and also my colleague from Wyoming.\n  The notion that in America we have a group of citizens who would be \neffectively prohibited by law from paying for their own health care is \nabsurd.\n  In order to fully understand the issue, I think it is important to \nreview a bit of the history about this particular issue.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration has interpreted current law \nto restrict voluntary, private contracts between physicians and \nMedicare-eligible beneficiaries. HCFA has issued threats of fines and \nexclusion against doctors who violate this arrangement and enter into \nprivate agreements. HCFA has created a situation where doctors must \ncomply with regulations stipulated by Medicare if they accept even one \nMedicare beneficiary as their patient. Medicare, as we all know, is the \nonly federally funded health care program that prohibits private \ncontracting by the participants.\n  During the balanced budget debate, Senator Kyl offered an amendment \nthat would have allowed for seniors to use their own money for their \nhealth costs. Unfortunately, through deliberations in conference, this \nprovision was stricken and a new law that takes effect in January \nrequires physicians who enter into private contracts to forego Medicare \nreimbursement for a period of 2 years. It has been reported that \ncurrently only 9 percent of physicians do not have any Medicare \npatients. This provision effectively restricts the choice and the \nquality of health care services provided to senior citizens. This would \ntend to prohibit doctors from treating elderly patients and would deny \nseniors the choice of seeking treatment outside of the Medicare system. \nAccording to the amended law, any doctor who is found to be treating \nMedicare patients and privately contracting will be subject to fines \nand even imprisonment. In all practicality, the language makes private \ncontracting impossible.\n  It is imperative that Congress revisit this issue and resolve this \nshortsighted legislation. I am proud to support Senator Kyl's bill, the \nMedicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act, which would allow \nseniors the ability to use their own discretion and money for their \nhealth care needs. This legislation is crucial for the elderly \nindividuals who rely on our Medicare system. By allowing senior \ncitizens the ability to retain the doctors of their choice, they are \nable to receive the care that they want and require. This legislation \nis essential to senior citizens' rights to use their own discretion for \ntheir health care needs.\n  Although it is true that the deficit in January has declined, the \nportion of these revenues claimed by entitlement spending continues to \nrise as entitlement spending rises. I agree with my colleague from \nArizona when he says this is also something that will help us balance \nthe budget. Why wouldn't Medicare accept the idea that a private \nindividual can pay for his own health care services out there? It means \nthey don't have to pay for it. It means less expenditures on \nentitlement spending. It means we can do more to reduce deficit \nspending. Particularly at a time when Medicare is in dire need of \nreform, how can Congress simply deny seniors the right and ability to \nuse their own money for health services?\n  This is not a ``Washington one-size-fits-all'' situation. We are \ntalking about the health care of our Nation's elderly. Medicare \nbeneficiaries should be given the right to pay out of pocket and to \nchoose their own health care provider. It is their freedom we are \ninfringing upon, and it is imperative we act now to rectify this wrong.\n  Congress must create a more efficient and effective health coverage \nprogram for seniors. Senator Kyl's bill is one essential step to \ncomplete that goal. More choice and competition must be implemented in \nthe Medicare Program, thereby facilitating proper health care coverage \nthat fits different individuals' needs and desires. Congress must act \nnow to rectify this problem.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been joined by our associate from \nMinnesota. Let me first say that this Medicare issue, of course, is one \nof the most important issues that we deal with. I think it is one of \nthe most important issues to America. Certainly it is the most \nimportant issue to seniors. The idea is to keep it available over time \nso people who are now paying into part A and will pay into part A will \nhave the benefits of it when they are eligible, to keep choice in it so \nthat seniors will have some choice as they enter into this kind of \nhealth care; to keep it financially strong, which is the difficulty, of \ncourse--their costs have gone up in Medicare; they have finally \nnarrowed down some, largely through the involvement of managed care, \nand there will be a committee or a commission appointed in December to \ntake a look at the future of it--and to make it available in all parts \nof the country. My friend from Colorado just talked about that. We have \nsmall towns, we have towns in which there are only one or two \nphysicians. So this choice thing is so important, that it be there.\n  Let me now yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing my support for Senator Kyl's Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to \nContract Act, of which I am a cosponsor. As I explained on the floor in \na statement last Monday, the thought that we have to debate in the U.S. \nSenate whether or not we are going to allow seniors the very basic \nright to use their money as they see fit is really just testimony to \nhow far this administration is willing to go in trying to impose its \nwill and its vision of socialized medicine on the American people. \nSocialized medicine, what Americans rejected in 1993, the \nadministration is trying to, in incremental steps, reimpose on the \nAmerican public.\n  Over the past few weeks I have received many letters, many phone \ncalls and e-mails on this very subject. I would like to share one of \nthese letters with my colleagues today. This comment came from a \nconstituent of mine in Saint Paul, MN. The constituent wrote:\n\n       By what right do you arrogate to yourself the right to \n     determine the length of my life? Medicare could easily fall \n     short of the necessary medical steps to preserve health and \n     life. Remember, this will apply to you, too.\n\n  My fellow Minnesotan could not be more correct in the assessment of \nthis provision which was tucked into the Balanced Budget act. It was \ntucked in there in the dark of the night, without debate and with \nlittle regard for the consequences and with the demand by the \nadministration that it be included no matter what. It is unconscionable \nthat the United States, the world's model of freedom and liberty, has \nnow decided that senior citizens are somehow second-class citizens, \nthat they are incapable of making their own choices when it comes to \nhealth care.\n  Opponents of the Freedom to Contract Act claim that this bill now \nwill make it easier for doctors to force seniors to give up their \nMedicare rights and be charged ``the sky's the limit.'' They say that \nwithout this protection,\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nseniors will be overpaying for their medical care.\n  I give our Nation's physicians and our Nation's seniors a lot more \ncredit than that. This bill does absolutely nothing to force seniors to \nopt out of the Medicare Program, nor does it implicitly encourage them \nto do so. It simply will give our seniors an additional choice in how \nthey receive their health care services--an additional choice on how \nthey receive their services. In fact, I believe increasing choices for \nseniors in the Medicare Program was probably one of the best things \nthat came out of this year's Balanced Budget Act. The Medicare \nBeneficiary Freedom to Contract Act is just a logical extension of the \nMedicare Plus Choice Program that was created in the Balanced Budget \nAct.\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside the demagoguery and restore the \nrights of our senior citizens. They deserve our respect and they \ndeserve the right to make their own choices. If we don't act on this \nbill before this session of this Congress ends, it will go into effect \nand then it will be very hard to restore this right to our seniors. So \nI am asking my colleagues, urging them, to join with us to make sure \nthat we preserve the rights of our senior citizens to have an \nadditional choice in how they decide on their health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the time. I \nappreciate being joined by my friends in support of this Medicare \nBeneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. Let me just review how we got \nwhere we are.\n  During the consideration of the balanced budget, Senator Kyl put in a \nvery simple amendment which simply said that you could have this choice \nthat did allow for physicians to treat under a private contract in \naddition to Medicare. Unfortunately, the administration became adamant \nabout it. I think they followed, as the Senator from Minnesota said, \nthe idea of turning this back into a one-size-fits-all kind of \nfederally controlled program. The President threatened to veto the \nentire budget package because of this, if this 2-year prohibition was \nnot included. So, today I am still disappointed with the \nadministration, with HCFA, with the President's opposition to this \nproposition.\n  We are going to continue to push for consideration of this issue \nbefore this Congress adjourns so we can eliminate this bottleneck, this \nthing which takes away the choice of senior citizens in their health \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11403-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11405-S11406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEDICARE BENEFICIARY FREEDOM TO CONTRACT ACT\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise this morning in \nsupport of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. \nThis legislation is another step in our continuing effort to give the \nNation's senior citizens something they have lacked for far too long--\nreal choice in health care.\n  I believe we are fortunate that a provision added to this year's \nBalanced Budget Act has served to focus our attention on a very \nimportant and basic freedom. I'm talking about the freedom of \nindividuals, regardless of age, to choose how they are going to spend \ntheir health care dollars. When the Senate first debated this issue, I \nwholeheartedly supported the idea of ``private contracting'' for two \nreasons. First, I heard from numerous Idahoans who feel they are losing \ntheir choice of doctors because of Medicare's overly bureaucratic \nmethod of operation. As more and more health care providers refuse to \naccept Medicare, senior citizens are finding they no longer have access \nto the providers they wish to see. Allowing private contracting will \nprovide seniors the chance to maintain the patient-provider \nrelationships which are so important to them.\n  Second, I support S. 1194 for an even more fundamental reason. I do \nnot believe a nation, for which so many have sacrificed so much in the \nname of freedom, should tell senior citizens that they do not have the \nfreedom to provide for themselves, even if they are perfectly able to \ndo so. Many of our senior citizens are people who worked, and fought, \nduring some of this century's most difficult times, yet current \nMedicare rules tell them we don't think they are capable of \ndetermining, for themselves, how to best meet their own health care \nneeds. Mr. President, this implies that government bureaucrats don't \nfeel those who survived the Great Depression and World War II, and \nhelped make this Nation what it is today, are capable of understanding \nand meeting their own needs. What a ridiculous concept.\n  Would we tell food stamp recipients that they could not use their own \nmoney to buy food, even if they worked hard to gather the financial \nresources needed to feed themselves? Would we tell someone in \nsubsidized housing that they may not use their own resources to move \ninto a home which they could call their own? The answer to both these \nquestion is, of course, no. In fact, I would be willing to guess that \nanyone suggesting such an idea would be laughed right out of this \nChamber. Yet, there are those who don't believe senior citizens should \nbe allowed to provide, voluntarily, for their own health care needs.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are discussing this morning simply says \nthat if you have the ability to take care of your own health care \nneeds, and you wish to do so, you should be legally allowed to do so. \nSupporting it should simply be a matter of common sense.\n  I have heard from numerous Idahoans who tell me they want the freedom \nto decide whether or not to use Medicare to pay for health care \nservices. I have heard from numerous health care providers in my State \nwho sincerely want their patients to have that choice. I trust the \nsenior citizens of Idaho. I believe they are more than capable of \nmaking a decision about how to pay for health care services, and should \nbe given the option to make that choice for themselves.\n  The American people are intelligent. If you give them choices, they \nare certainly able to decide which option is in their best interest. \nDuring my tenure in the Senate, I have consistently worked to give \nAmericans more choice, while reducing government intrusion in their \nlives. The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act accomplishes \nboth of these goals, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in supporting \nthe Kyl-Archer ``Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom To Contract Act.''\n  When I first discovered that the version of this summer's Balanced \nBudget Act that was signed into law included such a drastic deviation \nfrom Congress' intent, which was to allow Medicare beneficiaries the \nchoice to go outside the Medicare system for care, I was outraged. We \nagreed to ensure this freedom, not strangle it by kicking doctors out \nof the Medicare system for seeing Medicare patients on a private \ncontract basis. By excluding physicians from Medicare for 2 years as a \npunishment for entering into a private contract, the law offers seniors \na choice in one breath and takes it away in the next.\n  If beneficiaries choose to pay for care out of their own pocket, that \nis their right. In no way does that constitute a criminal act. It is \nnot an appropriate role for the Federal Government to be telling people \nhow they can spend the money in their wallet--we already do enough of \nthat with their tax dollars.\n  The claims made for instituting such a restrictive law are unfounded. \nThe assertion that seniors of significant means will be siphoned out of \nthe system, creating an increased burden on the Medicare trust fund, \nmakes several false assumptions. First, income and population \nstatistics produced by the Social Security Administration indicate that \nnearly two-thirds of this country's over-65 population live at or near \nthe poverty level, with less than 20 percent seniors earning more than \n$75,000 a year. Given that, it is doubtful that we'll see a wave of \nseniors rushing to contract privately and disrupting the Medicare \nsystem. Those same statistics also deflate the argument that droves of \ndoctors will begin denying care unless patients agree to privately \ncontract at a higher rate. The patients aren't there, leaving \nphysicians strongly dependent--as they are now--on Medicare clients. \nTherefore, there is no threat of a two-tiered system of care, with only \nthe wealthy having access to the best care. It is just not economically \nsound or feasible for a significant number of doctors to establish a \n``new tier'' of medicine.\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\n  The concerns about rampant fraud and abuse resulting from private \ncontracting seem to disregard some very compelling facts. For example, \nover the last 2 years, Congress has implemented strict penalties for \nMedicare fraud and abuse, including thousands of dollars in fines and \njail time. We have seen people go to jail for committing Medicare \nfraud. I have medical professionals contacting me regularly because \nthey are so fearful of inadvertently misbilling Medicare and winding up \nin jail or out of business. More importantly, however, Medicare \nbeneficiaries are copied on all bills that Medicare pays for services \nthey've received. If a doctor double-bills Medicare for services that a \nbeneficiary has already paid for out of their pocket, that senior would \nbe dialing Medicare's 1-800 fraud number faster than you or I could \nblink.\n  Finally, Senator Kyl's bill would allow patients to terminate \ncontracts at virtually anytime, which will force physicians who are \ninterested in private contracting to offer services at reasonable and \ncompetitive rates. Consumers would finally be playing a role in the \nMedicare market.\n  Choice and competition have emerged as the most viable and fair \nsolutions for saving the Medicare Program and ensuring quality, \naffordable healthcare for generations of Medicare beneficiaries to \ncome. This bill embodies those very concepts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11405-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE A-PLUS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, within the next few days this Senate \nwill vote upon a proposal that I have offered with Senator Coverdell, \nS. 1113--A-plus savings accounts. It is a proposal I know that many \nMembers of the Senate are considering for the first time. I take the \nfloor today to ask them to look carefully at its many provisions.\n  Like many Members of my party, I have great reservation about the \nmovement to vouchers in the various States and by the Federal \nGovernment. It has always been my concern that vouchers not only invite \nconstitutional challenge, but inevitably results in a movement of \nresources from the public schools, where they are already too scarce, \nto private schools.\n  The issue in my mind is not to move resources from public to private \nschools, but to increase resources for all schools. That is why, \nalthough I differ with Senator Coverdell and other Members of the \nSenate on vouchers, we have come together as Democrats and Republicans, \nprovoucher and antivoucher Senators, on the issue of the A-plus savings \naccounts.\n  Let us look at the facts about these savings accounts.\n  First, there is not the use of public money. This is money that an \nindividual or their employer or their labor union can put in a savings \naccount for the education of a child in grade school or high school, \ntherefore, there is not a constitutional issue and there is not a \ndiversion issue of public educational resources to private schools.\n  Second, where does this money go? And who does it help? The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates that almost 75 percent of the money \nthat will be placed in these accounts actually would go to public \nschool students because although we are allowing the accounts to be \nused to support tuition at parochial schools or other private schools, \nit also would be available for ancillary activities of public school \nstudents.\n  Since 90 percent of American students go to public schools, these \nfunds--available for computers, tutoring, after-school transportation--\nwould, to a significant, indeed overwhelming extent, actually go to \npublic school students.\n  This is the right program at the right time, bringing the right \nresources to the students most in need.\n  In many of our urban centers today, including in my own State of New \nJersey--from Camden to Newark to Jersey City--if we lose our private \nschools, our parochial schools, we do not have the capacity in the \npublic schools for those students. And many working-class, working-poor \nparents want this option. I do not know why we would deny it to them.\n  Critics have said, ``Well, this is only available to the rich.'' But \nin fact for a single taxpayer, we have put a ceiling of $95,000. It is \nestimated that 70 percent of all of these resources would go to \nfamilies that earn under $70,000 a year.\n  An uncle can put $10 in an account every month for a favorite nephew \nor niece. A grandparent, at a birthday or Christmas, can put $100 or \n$200 in an account. A parent, from the time of birth, can put a few \ndollars away every month to ensure that their child is getting the high \nschool or grade school education they want them to have.\n  What can be wrong with that, getting the entire family involved in \nsaving for a child's education? But if the option is public school--\nwhich it is overwhelmingly in the United States; and understandably \nso--then these funds are available to give a quality public school \neducation.\n  Sixty percent of all students in public schools in America today do \nnot have a computer at home. Eighty-five percent of all minority \nstudents in the public schools do not have a computer at home.\n  An overwhelming majority of public school students cannot afford a \ntutor, even if they are having trouble with math or science. These \naccounts are available for that tutoring and for that equipment. It \ngives a new advantage to parents who want to get engaged in their \nchild's education in the public schools.\n  For all of those reasons, I am asking, particularly members of my own \nparty, to look once again at the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal for A-\nplus savings accounts. This escapes the central conflict over vouchers \nand strengthens both public and private education.\n  No Member of this body today, no matter how they feel about vouchers, \ncan possibly argue--when the United States is now being ranked 15th out \nof 18 nations in the quality of math performance by our students; near \nlast in science education--no one can defend the status quo. No Member \ncan honestly believe that a chance to bring new resources, private \nresources, to middle-income families who want to get engaged in their \nown child's education is a bad idea.\n  We will, Mr. President, have a chance to obviously debate this at \nlength when the bill is brought before the Senate. But here today, in \nanticipation of that debate, I wanted to ask Members of the Senate to \nuse the time between this discussion and that debate to familiarize \nthemselves with this proposal and the hope that we can genuinely have a \ngood and bipartisan level of support in sending this bill, which has \nalready passed the House, on to the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11406-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11406-S11407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE INTELLECTUAL ROOTS OF NATIVISM\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to highlight an article \nfrom the October 2 issue of the Wall Street Journal written by Tucker \nCarlson.\n  It is important to recognize the valuable contributions that \nimmigrants make to this country. Groups that refuse to recognize that \nlegal immigration makes a positive contribution to the productivity and \nvitality of our country ignore the history of our Nation and exploit \nirrational fears. Mr. Carlson has done an exemplary job of exploring \nthe initiatives and history of such anti-immigration organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2, 1997]\n\n                   The Intellectual Roots of Nativism\n\n                          (By Tucker Carlson)\n\n       When the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform issued its \n     final report on Tuesday, Dan Stein, executive director of the \n     Federation for American Immigration Reform, stood ready to \n     comment. Responding to a recommendation that the U.S. \n     citizenship\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\n     oath be modified to strike antiquated words like \n     ``potentate,'' Mr. Stein told the Los Angeles Times, ``If the \n     oath of [allegiance] is too hard for the immigrants to \n     understand . . . we're admitting the wrong immigrants.''\n       In the debate over immigration policy, no single group has \n     received more attention than FAIR, a Washington-based \n     nonprofit that claims a membership of 70,000. For close to 20 \n     years, in books, monographs, op-eds and thousands of \n     newspaper stories, FAIR has made the case for tighter \n     national borders. And while the group's goal seems clear \n     enough--to curtail immigration into the U.S.--its ideology is \n     harder to pin down. FAIR's supporters include both the \n     conservative magazine National Review and former Colorado \n     Gov. Richard Lamm, a Democrat; Pat Buchanan as well as Eugene \n     McCarthy. Where does FAIR stand politically? It's hard to \n     say, says Mr. Stein: ``Immigration's weird. It has weird \n     politics.''\n\n\n                        in favor of infanticide\n\n       Certainly FAIR does. Consider the group's connection to \n     Garrett Hardin, a University of California biologist who \n     became moderately famous in the 1960s for his essay ``The \n     Tragedy of the Commons,'' a polemic against population growth \n     and Americans' ``freedom to breed.'' Mr. Hardin, now in his \n     80s, was for many years one of the more active members of \n     FAIR's board of directors, writing and speaking extensively \n     under the group's auspices. He is now a board member \n     emeritus, and his ideas are still influential at FAIR; just \n     this spring, Mr. Stein quoted ``noted immigration scholar and \n     thinker Garrett Hardin'' in testimony before the Senate.\n       What are Garrett Hardin's ideas? ``Sending food to Ethiopia \n     does more harm than good,'' he explained in a 1992 interview \n     with Omni magazine. Giving starving Africans enough to eat, \n     Mr. Hardin argued, will only ``encourage population growth.'' \n     His views got less savory from there. In the same interview, \n     the ``noted immigration scholar'' went on to criticize \n     China's notoriously coercive population control programs on \n     the grounds they are not strict enough. He also argued \n     against reducing infant mortality in undeveloped nations and \n     came out foursquare in favor of infanticide (``in the \n     historical context,'' as the Omni reporter put it), which he \n     declared ``an effective population control.''\n       ``In all societies practicing infanticide,'' Mr. Hardin \n     explained to the reporter, who happened to be five months \n     pregnant at the time, ``the child is killed within minutes \n     after birth, before bonding can occur.'' Not surprisingly, \n     Mr. Hardin wasn't shy about his enthusiastically pro-choice \n     views: ``A fetus is of so little value, there's no point in \n     worrying about it.''\n       What does eliminating children have to do with immigration? \n     According to Mr. Hardin, just about everything. ``Because \n     widespread disease and famine no longer exist, we have to \n     find another means to stop population increases,'' he \n     explained. ``The quickest, easiest and most effective form of \n     population control in the U.S., that I support \n     wholeheartedly, is to end immigration.''\n       At FAIR, Mr. Hardin's views are considered well within the \n     pale. Founded in 1979 by a Michigan ophthalmologist named \n     John Tanton, FAIR has from its inception been heavily \n     influenced by the now-discredited theories of Thomas Malthus, \n     an 18th-century English clergyman who predicted that the \n     world's food supply would soon fail to keep pace with its \n     rising population. During the 1970s, Dr. Tanton, now FAIR's \n     chairman, did his part to reduce world population by founding \n     a local Planned parenthood chapter and running the group Zero \n     Population Growth. With the birthrate of native-born \n     Americans declining, however, Dr. Tanton says he soon \n     realized that the key to population control was reducing \n     immigration. Unless America's borders are sealed, Dr. Tanton \n     explained to the Detroit Free Press this March, the country \n     will be overrun with people ``defecating and creating garbage \n     and looking for jobs.'' To this day, FAIR's ``guiding \n     principles'' state that ``the United States should make \n     greater efforts to encourage population control.'' Several \n     months ago, the group organized a ``bicentennial event'' to \n     commemorate Malthus's ``Essay on the Principle of \n     Population.''\n       Mr. Stein, the organization's current executive director, \n     doesn't deny that Malthusian fears of overpopulation are \n     ``central'' to FAIR's mission. Nor does he flinch when \n     confronted with Mr. Hardin's views of killing newborns. \n     Instead, Mr. Stein defends Mr. Hardin by pointing out that \n     his colleague has never supported ``involuntary, coercive \n     infanticide.'' (As opposed to the voluntary kind?) As for the \n     Chinese government's well-documented campaign of forced \n     abortions and sterilization, Mr. Stein describes it as an \n     ``international family-planning program.''\n       Perhaps most telling, Mr. Stein appears to embrace Mr. \n     Hardin's long-standing support of eugenics. In his interview \n     with Omni, Mr. Hardin expressed alarm about ``the next \n     generation of breeders'' now reproducing uncontrollably ``in \n     Third world countries.'' The problem, according to Mr. \n     Hardin, is not simply that there are too many people in the \n     world, but that there are too many of the wrong kind of \n     people. As he put it: ``It would be better to encourage the \n     breeding of more intelligent people rather than the less \n     intelligent.'' Asked to comment on Mr. Hardin's statement, \n     Mr. Stein doesn't even pause. ``Yeah, so what?'' he replies. \n     ``What is your problem with that? Should we be subsidizing \n     people with low IQs to have as many children as possible, and \n     not subsidizing those with high ones?''\n       Several years ago FAIR was forced to defend itself against \n     charges of racism when it was revealed that the organization \n     had received more than $600,000 from the Pioneer Fund, a \n     foundation established in 1937 to support ``research in \n     heredity and eugenics.'' Mr. Stein did his best at the time \n     to downplay Pioneer's nasty reputation. ``My job is to get \n     every dime of Pioneer's money,'' he told a reporter in 1993. \n     But an unpleasant odor remained.\n       FAIR also has repeatedly been accused of hostility toward \n     Hispanics and the Catholic Church. Mr. Stein claims the \n     charges are nothing more than ``orchestrated attacks from \n     some of these fervent, out-of-control zealots on the so-\n     called religious right.'' (And, he warned me, I had better \n     not imply otherwise: ``I will call you at home and I'll give \n     your wife my opinion of the article if I don't like it,'' he \n     said heatedly.) But Mr. Stein does little to disprove his \n     critics. In one widely quoted outburst, he suggested--that \n     certain immigrant groups are engaged in ``competitive \n     breeding.'' He told me: ``Certainly we would encourage people \n     in other countries to have small families. Otherwise they'll \n     all be coming here, because there's no room at the Vatican.''\n       There are reasonable critics of immigration, but Dan Stein \n     is not one of them. Which makes it all the more puzzling that \n     a number of otherwise sober-minded conservatives seem to be \n     making common cause with Mr. Stein and FAIR. According to \n     National Review editor John O'Sullivan, FAIR, ``until very \n     recently, never saw the political right as sympathetic to the \n     cause. That was an obvious error.'' An error Mr. O'Sullivan \n     has done his best to correct: Over the past several years, \n     National Review has touted FAIR's positions in its editorials \n     and published several articles by FAIR employees.\n\n\n                       `these central americans'\n\n       FAIR itself has made a conscious play for the support of \n     social conservatives, running ads that blame immigration for \n     ``multiculturalism,'' ``multilingualism,'' ``increasing \n     ethnic tension'' and ``middle-class flight.'' Mr. Stein \n     claims that many immigrants are left-wing ideologues, making \n     conservatives FAIR's logical allies. ``Immigrants don't come \n     all church-loving, freedom-loving, God-fearing,'' he says. \n     ``Some of them firmly believe in socialist or \n     redistributionist ideas. Many of them hate America, hate \n     everything the United States stands for. Talk to some of \n     these Central Americans.''\n       Two years ago Insight, a magazine published by the \n     conservative Washington Times, referred to ``the conservative \n     Federation for American Immigration Reform.'' And last year \n     Republican strategist Paul Weyrich allowed FAIR to co-produce \n     more than 50 hour-long programs dealing with immigration for \n     National Empowerment Television, his conservative network. \n     Clearly, FAIR's overtures to the right are paying off. But do \n     conservatives who embrace FAIR know all they should about the \n     object of their affections?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11406-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11407-S11410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF CHARLES J.

Siragusa to be a judge of the U.S. \ndistrict court for the Western District of New York.\n  The judge has the highest rating possible from the ABA. He was \nunanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee. He was a prosecutor. I \ncommend him and the others.\n  This morning the majority leader has decided to call up the \nnomination of Charles Siragusa to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of New York. I expect this rollcall vote to be much \nlike the last seven in which a unanimous Senate approves a well-\nqualified judicial nomination.\n  As I stated, Judge Siragusa received the highest rating possible from \nthe ABA. He was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee along \nwith others who remain on the Senate calendar awaiting action. He is \nsupported by Senators Moynihan and D'Amato.\n  Judge Siragusa served as an assistant district attorney for the \nMonroe County district attorney's office in Rochester, NY, for 15 years \nfrom 1977 to 1992 and is currently a judge on the New York State \nSupreme Court. He has been the recipient of numerous legal awards, \nincluding the 1996 Recognition\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\nAward from the Monroe County Magistrates Association. He has served as \na volunteer member of the Families and Friends of Murdered Children and \nVictims of Violence advisory board since 1995.\n  I congratulate Judge Siragusa, his wife and family on this day and \nlook forward to his service on the U.S. district court.\n  But I would also note, we had time set aside for debate on this. And \nwe continue to have judges who are held up silently, and then we cannot \nvote on them.\n  Margaret Morrow of California is an example of this. We have spent \nfar more time on quorum calls this year than we have on any debate of \nMargaret Morrow, except that we find Senators who have press \nconferences saying that she should not be confirmed or could not be \nconfirmed or will not be confirmed--but nobody wants to bring her \nnomination to a vote.\n  She, like the judge we will soon confirm, is an extraordinarily well-\nqualified nominee. She does have one difference. She is a woman. And I \ndo not know why this woman, who has been the president of the \nCalifornia Bar Association, one of the most prestigious positions any \nlawyer has ever received, as well as the L.A. bar, why this woman is \ncontinuously blocked.\n  Frankly, I could find no other reason than her gender. And I think it \nis shocking. I think it is a shame.\n  While I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the \nconfirmation of a judicial nominee, there remains no excuse for the \nSenate's delay with respect the more than 50 other judicial nominations \nsent by the President. The Senate should me moving more promptly to \nfill the vacancies plaguing the federal courts. Twenty-three \nconfirmations in a year in which we have witnessed 115 vacancies is not \nfulfilling the Senate's constitutional responsibility.\n  At the end of Senator Hatch's first year chairing the Committee, \n1995, the Senate adjourned having confirmed 58 judicial nominations and \nleaving only 49 vacancies. This year the Senate has confirmed less than \nhalf of the number confirmed in 1995 but will adjourn leaving almost \ntwice as many judgeships vacant.\n  At the snail's pace that the Senate is proceeding with judicial \nnominations this year, we are not even keeping up with attrition. When \nCongress adjourned last year, there were 64 vacancies on the Federal \nbench. In the last 10 months, another 50 vacancies have occurred. Thus, \nafter the confirmation of 23 judges in 10 months, there has been a net \nincrease of 28 vacancies, an increase of almost 50 percent in the \nnumber of current Federal judicial vacancies.\n  Judicial vacancies have been increasing, not decreasing, over the \ncourse of this year and therein lies the vacancy crisis. The Chief \nJustice of the United States Supreme Court has called the rising number \nof vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the Federal \njudiciary.''\n  I have commended Senator Hatch for scheduling 2 days of confirmation \nhearings for judicial nominees this week. Unfortunately, that brought \nto only eight the total number of confirmation hearings for judicial \nnominees held all year, not even one a month.\n  The Judiciary Committee still has pending before it over 30 nominees \nin need of a hearing from among the 73 nominations sent to the Senate \nby the President during this Congress. From the first day of this \nsession of Congress, this committee has never had pending before it \nfewer than 20 judicial nominees for hearings. The committee's backlog \nhad doubled to more than 40.\n  There is no excuse for the Judiciary Committee's delay in considering \nthe nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. \nFletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. \nMargaret McKeown, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the \noutstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much \nas a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been \nfavorably reported last year. Judge Paez had a hearing last year but \nhas been passed over so far this year. Professor Fletcher, Judge Paez \nand Ms. McKeown are all nominees for judicial emergency vacancies on \nthe Ninth Circuit, as well.\n  The committee still has pending before it 10 nominees who were first \nnominated during the last Congress, including five who have been \npending since 1995. Thus, while I am delighted that we are moving more \npromptly with respect to certain nominees, I remain concerned about all \nvacancies and all nominees.\n  Since no regular executive business Meeting of the Judiciary \nCommittee was held this week and none has yet been noticed for next \nweek, which may be our last before adjournment, the committee may not \nhave an opportunity to report any of the 13 fine judicial nominees who \nparticipated in hearings this week or the nominations of Clarence \nSundram or Judge Sonia Sotomayor or, for that matter, the nomination of \nBill Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \nDivision.\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of these \nfine women and men to reconsider and to work with us to have the \ncommittee and the Senate fulfill its constitutional responsibility. \nThose who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of \njustice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve \ncivil disputes without judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and \ncriminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are \ngrowing more critical by the day.\n  A good example of the continuing stall is the long-pending nomination \nof Margaret Morrow. The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are \npuzzling--not only to those of us in the Senate who know her record but \nto those who know her best in California, including many Republicans. \nThey cannot fathom why a few Senators have decided to target someone as \nwell-qualified and as moderate as she is.\n  Anthony Lewis asked the question in a column in The New York Times \nearlier this week: ``Why [are some] trying to frighten conservatives \nwith talk of nonexistent liberal activist Clinton judges?'' Those who \nstart a witch hunt, want to find a witch--even if they have to contort \nthe facts and destroy a good person in the process. That seems to be \nwhat is going on with this nomination as opponents of this \nadministration are seeking to construct a straw woman in the place of \nthe real Margaret Morrow. She does not subscribe to an activist \njudicial philosophy and I am confident that as a district court judge \nwould apply the law consistent with precedents established by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, the court of appeals and judicial precedent.\n  With respect to the issue of judicial activism, we have the nominee's \nviews. She told the committee: ``The specific role of a trial judge is \nto apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt and courts of appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.''' \nShe also noted:\n\n       Given the restrictions of the case and controversy \n     requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies \n     available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad \n     problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do \n     so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches \n     in our constitutional structure.\n\n  Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar \nAssociation and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is \ncurrently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. \nShe is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and \nby Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nadministration. Representative James Rogan attended her second \nconfirmation hearing to endorse her.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive \nand responsible. Her good works should not be punished. Her public \nservice ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this \ntreatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away from \nGovernment service.\n  The president of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the \npresident of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association, the president of the National \nConference of Women's\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nBar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles \narea have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow. They write that: ``Margaret Morrow is widely respected \nby attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties.'' She ``is \nexactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position \nand held up as an example to young women across the country.'' I could \nnot agree more.\n  This nomination has been pending since May 9, 1996. No one can blame \nPresident Clinton for the delay in filling this important judgeship. \nWithin 4 months of Judge Gadbois' disability, the President had sent \nMargaret Morrow's name to the Senate. She had a confirmation hearing \nand was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee \nin June 1996. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the \nelection year shutdown and was not called up for Senate consideration \nduring the rest of that year.\n  She was renominated on January 7, 1997, the first day of this session \nof Congress. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was \nthen held off the judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of \nwritten questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was \nagain favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has \nbeen left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more than 4 \nmonths and been passed over, again and again.\n  Senator Hatch noted in a Senate floor statement on September 29 that \nhe continues to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he \nwill vote for her. He said:\n\n       I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. \n     Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she \n     deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured \n     by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the \n     floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf.\n\n  Yesterday Senators Ashcroft and Sessions held a press conference in \nwhich they noted their opposition to this nomination. I am glad that \nthe secret holds that had prevented the consideration of this \nnomination are now over and urge the majority leader to proceed to call \nup this nomination for a debate and vote without further delay. This is \nthe U.S. Senate, once the greatest deliberative body in the world and \nthe conscience of the Nation. We should proceed to debate this \nnomination and vote.\n  Every Senator is free to vote for or against a nominee. What I have \nnot appreciated is the mysterious hold over nominations for months at a \ntime. Now that the sources of the hold have come forward, the Senate \nshould proceed to debate and vote.\n  I do not oppose a recorded vote on Margaret Morrow any more than I \nopposed a recorded vote on Frank J. Siragusa, or Algenon Marbley, or \nKatherine Sweeney Hayden, or Janet C. Hall, or Christopher Droney, or \nJoseph F. Bataillon, or Frank M. Hull, or Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr., or \nMerrick B. Garland. In fact, on the last seven roll call votes on \njudicial nominees preceded that this morning, there has been a \ncumulative total of one negative vote by a single Senator on one of \nthose seven nominees. Six judges were confirmed by unanimous roll call \nvotes and one was confirmed 98 to one.\n  Meanwhile, while the Senate fiddles, the people served by the \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California continue to \nsuffer the effects of this persistent vacancy, one of the dozens of \njudicial emergency vacancies being perpetuated around the country. This \nnomination has been held up so long that the vacancy has now extended \nto more than 18 months and is designated a judicial emergency vacancy \nby the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\n  This is a district court with over 300 cases that have been pending \nfor longer than three years and in which the time for disposing of \ncriminal felony cases and the number of cases filed increased over the \nlast year. Judges in this district handle approximately 400 cases a \nyear, including somewhere between 40 and 50 criminal felony cases. \nStill this judicial vacancy is being perpetuated by the refusal to vote \non this well-qualified nominee.\n  I fear that the nomination of Margaret Morrow has become a fund \nraising ploy for the extreme right wing. This past weekend we learned \nthat a $1.4 million fund raising and lobbying effort is underway to try \nto perpetuate the judicial vacancy crisis and continue the partisan and \nideological stall on Senate consideration of much-needed judges.\n  I understand that big donors are solicited with promises of intimate \ndinners with leading conservative elected and public figures closely \ninvolved with the judicial confirmation process and that Senators \nappear on a videotape being used as an integral part of this opposition \neffort.\n  Those pressing this effort complain about what they see as the \nfailure of the U.S. Senate to block the appointment of judges to the \nFederal bench. The American people, litigants, prosecutors, and judges \nhave just the opposite complaint--that the perpetuation of judicial \nvacancies is affecting the administration of justice and rendering our \nlaws empty promises.\n  It is sad that this effort is premised on the slanted portrayal of \ndecisions, many of which were decided by judges appointed by Republican \nPresidents. I have spoken before about the dangers of characterizing \nisolated decisions to stir up anger against the judiciary. Short-term \nmonetary or political gain is not worth the price.\n  This fund raising campaign seems to extend back over the course of \nthe year but has only become public with reports in the Los Angeles \nTimes and New York Times over last weekend. Those who delight in taking \ncredit for having killed, judicial nominees last year continue their \nmisguided efforts to the detriment of effective law enforcement and \ncivil justice. This extreme right-wing fund raising campaign to kill \nqualified judicial nominations is wrong.\n  Targeting such a well-qualified nominee as Margaret Morrow is an \nexample of just how wrong this scheme is. I believe all would agree \nthat it is time for the full Senate to debate this nomination and vote \non it. I understand that Senator Ashcroft welcomed such a debate at his \npress conference yesterday. I have looked forward to that debate for \nsome time. I ask again, as I have done repeatedly over the last several \nmonths, why not now, why not today, why not this week?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will vote to \nconfirm a most able candidate for U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of New York. Charles Joseph Siragusa was western New York's \nmost experienced prosecutor who became its most admired supreme court \njudge. We now have the opportunity to bring his considerable talents to \nthe Federal bench.\n  I had the honor of recommending Judge Siragusa to President Clinton \non May 14, 1997. He enjoys the full support of my friend and colleague, \nSenator D'Amato, and the unanimous approval of the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Might I note that my judicial screening panel interviewed more than \n20 applicants to fill the vacancy that resulted when Judge Michael A. \nTelesca took senior status. There were, as one might have expected, \nmany splendid candidates. However, Judge Charles J. Siragusa stood out.\n  Judge Siragusa has served with great distinction in the Seventh \nJudicial District. He was elected to the State supreme court in 1992, \nfollowing 15 years as a prosecutor with the Monroe County district \nattorney's office. In that capacity he tried over 100 felonies and was \ninvolved in a number of significant criminal cases including the \nprosecution of Arthur J. Shawcross, a serial killer responsible for the \ndeaths of 11 women. He received widespread recognition and praise for \nhis work on that case.\n  A native of Rochester, Judge Siragusa was graduated from LeMoyne \nCollege in DeWitt, NY, in 1969. He received his law degree from Albany \nLaw School in 1976 and has been a member of the New York State Bar \nsince 1977.\n  Judge Charles J. Siragusa is a man of great intelligence and \nunwavering principle. I am confident that, upon confirmation, he will \nserve with honor and distinction.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I endorse \nthe nomination of Charles Siragusa who has been nominated by President \nClinton for the position of U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of New York.\n  Judge Siragusa comes before the Senate with an already distinguished\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nrecord having served on the New York supreme court since 1993. In that \nposition, he has presided over both civil cases and criminal cases. He \nis currently assigned full time to the criminal division.\n  Judge Siragusa is not only a seasoned jurist, but he is also an \nexperienced trial lawyer. He has extensive litigation experience having \nfirst been an assistant district attorney and then later serving as a \nfirst assistant district attorney in the Monroe County district \nattorney office from 1977 to 1992. I am sure my colleagues will agree \nthat he is well qualified for a position on the Federal bench for many \nreasons not the least of which because he is someone who has had the \npractical experience of having tried approximately 100 cases as lead \ntrial counsel. I might add that 95 percent of those cases were jury \ntrials and many of them involved homicides.\n  Judge Siragusa also brings the experience of having been a teacher of \nsixth graders and junior high school from 1969 to 1973, in Rochester, \nNY. I am sure that job taught him great patience--a skill that might \ncome in handy someday on the Federal bench.\n  He is also active in his community. Judge Siragusa is a member of \nnumerous organizations including the Jewish Community Center; the New \nYork District Attorney Association; the Monroe County Bar; the \nRochester Inn of Court; Jury Advisory Commission; and the Association \nJustices Supreme Court in New York.\n  Judge Siragusa graduated cum laude from LeMoyne College in 1969 \nhaving earned a bachelor of arts sociology, and his juris doctorate \nfrom Albany Law School in 1976.\n  He has two published writings, in addition to his other than judicial \nopinions--one entitled ``Prosecution of a Serial Killer;'' and the \nother being, ``View from the Bench'' that appeared in Rochesterian \nMagazine.\n  I would also like to add that Judge Siragusa's nomination might have \nbeen before the Senate sooner, but for the fact that when the Judiciary \nCommittee first tried to schedule a hearing on his nomination my staff \nhad a bit of trouble locating him. We later learned that he was in \nAruba on his honeymoon. Congratulations, Judge Siragusa.\n  I am confident that Judge Siragusa will be a worthy addition to the \nbench of the Federal District Court in the Western District of New \nYork. I am very pleased that the Senate has scheduled a vote on his \nnomination, which I am happy to support. He is also supported by \nSenator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato. I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on the matter of the pending nomination, I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Charles J. Siragusa, of New York, to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Western District of New York? On this \nquestion the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous order, the Senate now will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1292, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1292) disapproving the cancellations transmitted \n     by the President on October 6, 1997, regarding Public Law \n     105-45.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Appropriations, with an amendment on page 2, line \n3, to strike ``97-15, 97-16.''\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are 10 hours, as I understand it, \non this bill. I do not have any knowledge yet as to how much time we \nwill take. I will give myself such time as I need in the beginning of \nthis statement.\n  On October 6, the President impounded funds for 38 projects contained \nin the fiscal year 1998 military construction bill, which totaled $287 \nmillion. Let me first take a moment to review the merits of this bill.\n  Mr. President, in June, President Clinton reached a budget agreement \nwith the bipartisan leadership of the Congress. That agreement provided \nfor an increase of $2.6 billion for national defense over the amount \nthe President had requested for the budget in the fiscal year 1998. The \nPresident's action on the military construction bill, in my judgment, \nreneges on the budget agreement that he reached with the Congress. \nCongress was given spending caps. We then allocated that within the \nappropriations process, and the Appropriations Committee presented the \nSenate with 13 appropriations bills consistent with the spirit, terms, \nand limits of the revised budget.\n  Mr. President, I state to the Senate, without any chance of being \ncorrected, that the Senator from West Virginia and I have done our \nutmost to live within the terms of the budget agreement, although we \ndidn't agree with it and we weren't present at the time it was made. \nNow, we have upheld the congressional commitment to the President. \nSimply stated, the President did not when he used the line-item veto on \nthis bill.\n  After consultation with Senator Byrd, the committee held a hearing 3 \nweeks ago to evaluate the President's use of the line-item authority \nand review the status of these projects for military construction. We \nasked military witnesses from three services to testify. They told us \nthere were valid requirements for each of these projects, Mr. \nPresident. They were mission-essential to the U.S. military. They also \ninformed the Appropriations Committee that each of these projects was, \nin fact, executable during the coming fiscal year.\n  Now, these projects clearly did not meet the criteria intended by \nCongress to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary spending. Those were the \ntests under the line-item veto law. Instead, the President chose to \ncancel a project because of three criteria that were announced after \nthe action taken by the President. First, he would veto a bill if it \nwas not in the President's 1998 budget request and no design work had \nbeen initiated and it did not substantially contribute to the well-\nbeing and quality of life of the men and women in the armed services.\n  Senator Byrd is going to speak at length on this. He is an expert in \nthis area, and I don't want to go into the area he will cover. It is \nvery clear that that was not within the terms of the bill passed, the \nlaw that the President signed, which set forth the process for using \nthe line-item veto. At our Appropriations Committee hearing, it was \napparent that, in fact, some design work had been initiated on most of \nthese projects--not all of them, but most of them.\n  The generals that were before us confirmed what many of us already \nknew.\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\n The White House decision conflicted with the military needs of the \nArmed Forces. In every instance these projects were needed and desired \nby the military services. Since that time the administration has \nstated--and even today, the President has a message out today--that \nmistakes were made. The administration has indicated that it will \nsupport many of these projects. But so far it has not told the \ncommittee which ones, Mr. President. We have a criticism of this bill \nfrom the administration, but the administration vetoed 38 projects, and \nit says it made some mistakes. But it has not publicly said which ones.\n  It is my belief that we will be successful in our effort to overturn \nthese line-item vetoes in this instance because the projects the \nPresident has attempted to eliminate are meritorious. They are sought \nby the Department of Defense and by the services involved in each \ninstance, and they are within the budget agreement.\n  I want to go back and emphasize that, Mr. President. We had a budget \npresented to us by the President that was lower than many of us thought \nwas necessary to meet our national needs. The President, in the budget \nagreement, agreed to that, and he agreed to an increase in defense \nspending. Our committee received no specification on what he thought \nthat increase should be spent for. So we did what the Constitution \ngives us the right to do. We determined where the money would be \nallocated. None of these projects have been listed as being either \nwasteful or excessive spending. Again, almost all of them are in the 5-\nyear plan, and those that were not in the 5-year plan were indicated to \nbe necessary and ones that were needed by the military.\n  I believe that our military people, soldiers, sailors, marines, \nairmen, and Coast Guardsmen are the ones that are being shortchanged by \nthe President's veto--not the officials in the Pentagon or the White \nHouse.\n  Let me tell you why I believe the President is reneging. If this \nline-item veto application, the application of that law to these \nprojects, is sustained, we lose part of the increase that was in the \nbudget agreement. This $287 million is no longer available for \nexpenditure to meet military needs. It is a way for the administration \nto renege and not meet the goals that we sought for military spending. \nThe President indicated some protected areas in the budget--areas that \nhe wanted protected because of his priorities. Our committee has met \nevery single one of those. We have not stood here and used a pen and \ntaken them out. We have not used what would be a congressional line-\nitem veto and said, no, we don't agree with you on this or that. We \nhave not done that.\n  But in this instance, the use of the line-item veto reduces the \namount that is available for defense spending for fiscal year 1998 by \nthe amount of the application of the line-item veto.\n  I am differing with my good friend from West Virginia. Although for \nmany years I opposed the line-item veto, I came to the conclusion that \nbecause we needed additional impetus behind our efforts to bring about \na balanced budget, I indicated I would support the line-item veto--and, \nas a matter of fact, due to circumstances that developed, I was the \nchairman of the committee and the chairman of the Senate side of the \nconference on the Line-Item Veto Act. I supported it because I believed \nit should be used for the stated purpose to eliminate wasteful and \nexcessive spending, and only to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary \nspending--not to be used as the display of Presidential executive or \npolitical power.\n  I urge the Senate to support this bill that is before us. We have \nconferred with all of those involved in the projects. I state that all \nof the projects except 2 that were in the President's 38 are in this \nbill. There are two not in there at the request of the Senators \ninvolved. Those two, however, are in the House bill.\n\n\n                     Committee Amendment Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Just one last word about this procedure. This bill is \nnot subject to amendment in the sense of adding anything to it. I state \nnow that we will not offer the Senate's Appropriations Committee \namendment to this bill, and I ask it be withdrawn at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). If there is no objection, the \ncommittee amendment is withdrawn.\n  The committee amendment was withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that means that there are two projects \nthat are not in this bill that are in the House bill. If the Senate \npasses this bill--and I seriously urge that it do so--we will go to \nconference, and the only matters that can be considered in the \nconference are those two projects. If the House passes the bill--and I \npresume it will--which has all of the 38 projects, and we pass this one \nwhich has 36 projects, the only 2 things that can be discussed in that \nconference are the 2 projects. And we will bring the conference report \nback before the Congress very quickly, I believe.\n  But, Mr. President, this bill goes beyond the question of what should \nnormally happen under the Line-Item Veto Act concerning actions of a \nPresident. This bill pertains to projects that were eliminated at a \ntime when there was an agreement entered into by the leadership of the \nconference and the Presidency on the level of spending in several \ndiscrete categories. From the point of view of this Senator, the most \nimportant one was the agreement on the level of spending for the \nDepartment of Defense. If this bill does not become law, $287 million \nof the amount we thought would be available to meet our needs of the \nDepartment of Defense will not be there. That $287 million is part of \nthe most vital part of our spending. It is spending for facilities for \nour people to live in and to work in. I can't think of anything that is \nmore essential right now than to try to maintain our efforts to \nmodernize our bases, modernize our facilities, and to assure that we \nmaintain the quality of life for the military by doing so.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to stand together with the House to \nassure that the President--and really the Presidency--lives up to the \nbargain that was made with the Congress. I do not speak of the \nPresident in a personal vein. I think he relied on the advice that was \ngiven him. I do object to the use of the concept of the criteria that \nwas announced by the White House. I think Senator McCain will speak \nabout that.\n  Senator McCain and I are in agreement in terms of what the White \nHouse should have done when the law was passed. It should have \nannounced then the criteria the President and the administration would \nuse to review individual bills and then match every bill up against \nthat type of criteria. That was not done, Mr. President.\n  I believe this bill should become law.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield to my good friend from West Virginia.\n  I believe the Senator from West Virginia controls 5 hours; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I am looking at the memorandum that is being \ndistributed by the Executive Office of the President, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, dated October 30, 1997.\n  It carries the heading ``Statement of Administration Policy.''\n  I will read it.\n\n       This statement of administration policy provides the \n     administration's views on S. 1292, a bill disapproving the \n     cancellations transmitted by the President on October 6, \n     1997.\n       S. 1292 would disapprove 34 of the 38 projects that the \n     President canceled from the fiscal year 1998 Military \n     Construction Appropriations Act. The administration strongly \n     opposes this disapproval bill. If it originally was presented \n     to the President in its current form, the President would \n     veto the bill.\n       The President carefully reviewed the 145 projects that \n     Congress funded that were not included in the fiscal year \n     1998 budget. The President used his authority responsibly to \n     cancel projects that were not requested in the budget that \n     would not substantially improve the quality of life of the \n     military service members and their families and that would \n     not begin construction in 1998 because the Defense Department \n     reported that no architectural and engineering design work \n     had been done. The President's action saves $287 million in \n     budget authority in 1998.\n       While we strongly oppose S. 1292, we are committed to \n     working with Congress to restore funding for those projects \n     that were canceled as a result of the data provided by the \n     Department of Defense that was out of date.\n\n  I have read the statement of administration policy in its entirety.\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\n  Let me take a further look at this sentence which appears in the \nmemorandum. ``The President used his authority responsibly to cancel \nprojects that were not requested in the budget.''\n  Mr. President, I don't know of any authority anywhere engraved in \nstone or bronze or in granite that gives the President the authority to \ncancel projects that were not requested in his budget. Of course, he \ndid it. There is no question about that. But I don't understand this \nstatement; namely, ``The President used his authority responsibly to \ncancel projects that were not requested in the budget.''\n  Mr. President, we don't live under a king in this country. And I \ndon't propose ever to live under a king. I have been in this Congress \nnow--I suppose I am the dean of the entire Congress, unless Mr. Yates \nin the other body is, who served before I came to the House of \nRepresentatives. But he voluntarily terminated his service over there \nfor a while. He ran for the U.S. Senate. He ran against Senator \nDirksen, I believe, and lost.\n  But, in any event, for the benefit of those who may or may not be \ninterested, I have been in Congress quite a while. So I am the dean of \nboth Houses. I will say it that way.\n  Also, I am 29,200 days old today, October 30. This is not my \nbirthday. It is just that I was born 29,200 days ago.\n  I have taken an oath to uphold--to ``support and defend.'' Those are \nthe words, ``support and defend'' the Constitution. I have taken an \noath many times to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates--many times, beginning with my service in the State Legislature \nof West Virginia 51 years ago. And I have never yet found, and I can't \nfind the authority to which this memorandum from the Executive Office \nof the President, Office of Management and Budget refers, I can't find \nthe authority by which the President can cancel projects solely because \nthey were not requested in the budget. I don't find that in the \nConstitution. I don't find that in the rules of the Senate. I don't \nfind it in even in the Line-Item Veto Act. I don't find that criterion \nin there. And all who may doubt, let them take a look at the Line-Item \nVeto Act, against which I voted. But it is not in there.\n  So much for that. It is just as I expected when I stood on this floor \non several occasions and talked ad nauseam with respect to my \nopposition to the line-item veto.\n  I yet cannot understand whatever got into the heads of the educated, \nintelligent men and women which would cause them to voluntarily cede to \nany President--not just this one. I don't have anything against this \nPresident in that particular. He wanted the line-item veto. But so did \nhis predecessor, and so did his predecessor, and so did his \npredecessor, and so did his, going all the way back to President Taft. \nTaft didn't want it. George Washington didn't think much of it.\n\n  But anyhow, here it is, the line-item veto. And I said, and so did a \nlot of my colleagues, the White House, not necessarily the President \nbut the people who work under him, will expand this authority.\n  I don't know who recommended to the President that he veto these \nitems. One of the items happens to be for West Virginia. But let me \nhasten to say I would not negotiate with this President or any other \nPresident to keep him from vetoing that item for West Virginia. I am \nnot going to negotiate with him to keep something for West Virginia. \nThat is important to me, but more important to me than that is the \nconstitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances, \nand that is what we endangered in passing this illegitimate end run \naround the Constitution of the United States.\n  We handed it to the President just as the Roman Senate handed to \nCaesar and handed to Sulla the control over the purse. The Roman Senate \nceded voluntarily, handed to the dictators, Sulla, Caesar--they made \nCaesar dictator for 10 years and then turned right around and made him \ndictator for life. But they said, ``Here it is, the power of the \npurse.'' The Roman Senate had complete power over the public purse. But \nwhen the Roman Senate ceded to the dictators and later to the emperors \nthe power over the purse, they gave away the Senate's check on the \nexecutive power. They gave away the Senate's check on executive \ntyranny. And that is what we have done.\n  Let me make clear to all Senators that in voting on this resolution \ntoday they are not voting for or against the line-item veto. I am \nagainst the line item veto. We all know that. Everybody knows that. If \nthey don't, they ought to have their head examined. But this vote today \nis not a vote for or against the line-item veto. I hope all Senators \nwill understand that. I hope all Senators' offices will understand \nthat. I hope all Senators' aides will understand that. And I hope that \nthe press will understand that.\n  This is not a vote for or against the line-item veto. This is a vote \nfor or against the disapproval resolution. A Senator can be very much \nfor the line-item veto, yet feel that the President exercised the line-\nitem veto in this case in an arbitrary and unfair manner.\n  That is what we are voting on today, whether or not we feel that the \nline-item veto was exercised in an arbitrary manner or whether it had a \ngenuine basis, whether it ought to be upheld in this instance; whether \nor not these items that are in the resolution should go back to the \nPresident, hopefully for his signature this time.\n  In this case, Senators are only voting whether or not you want to \nsend these particular items that were line-item vetoed back to the \nPresident a second time. That is all. I happen to think that the line-\nitem veto was used in this instance in a very arbitrary manner.\n  I think the administration took this action without ample \nforethought, without a very careful analysis of the items and whether \nor not they, indeed, did fit into the criteria. I think the \nadministration acted in an arbitrary manner, and they have said that \nthey acted on incorrect data from the Defense Department.\n  I hope all Senators will understand that they can vote for this \nresolution today and still be for the line-item veto. It doesn't make \nany difference as to what their position is on the line-item veto. The \nfact that they may vote for the disapproval resolution does not mean \nthey are for the line-item veto. It doesn't mean that at all. It should \nnot be taken as an indication that Senators are for or against the \nline-item veto.\n\n  I hope all Senators will vote for the disapproval resolution. Senator \nStevens, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, conducted a \nhearing. It was well attended by Senators. And it thoroughly exposed \nthe vulnerability of the administration's position. The Department of \nDefense witnesses did not uphold the administration in the information \nthat it sent abroad in the land to the effect that this item or that \nitem or some other item was not on the Defense Department's 5-year \nplan.\n  Now, I hope that the Senate and House will send this resolution to \nthe President. I hope it will be supported overwhelmingly. And, of \ncourse, the President will veto it. He has said he would. But let him \nveto it. That is an old scarecrow. That is a scare word. It doesn't \nscare everybody, but it may scare some people. He will veto it. So \nwhat. Go ahead. Veto it. Maybe the Senate and House will override the \nveto. They may not. But in that instance things will be operating \naccording to the Constitution.\n  Now, here it says in the final paragraph, ``While we''--I do not know \nwho ``we'' is. That is the editorial pronoun ``we'' ``While we strongly \noppose S. 1292, we are committed to working with Congress to restore \nfunding for those projects that were canceled as a result of the data \nprovided by the Department of Defense that was out of date.''\n  What is the matter with the administration? Why don't they make sure \nof what they are doing? They should have acted cautiously. They should \nhave acted carefully because they are vulnerable on this. They have \nbeen exposed to have acted, I won't say with malice aforethought but \ncertainly without careful aforethought. It is not to their credit. I \ndon't happen to believe that the Sun rises in the west, Mr. President. \nIt has never risen in the west a single day of the 29,200 days I have \nbeen on this Earth. It rises in the east.\n  So I am not going to bow down to the west--to the western end of \nConstitution Avenue. I bow down to the Constitution. I took an oath to \nsupport and defend that Constitution. I am not above amending the \nConstitution. The forefathers saw a possible need to\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\namend it and they made provision for that. But I am never going to join \nin dismantling the structure, the constitutional system of separation \nof powers and checks and balances. Count me out.\n  Mr. President, it is with the dispassionate eye of a history student, \nit is with that kind of dispassionate eye that I have tried to view \nthis subject matter. Everything I have said about this subject matter \nhas come true. It comes with sadness, when we find that in the OMB's \nexplanation of the President's veto it resorts to a statement to the \neffect that the President has authority responsibly to cancel projects \nthat were not requested in the budget.\n  But to me that statement demonstrates a superabundance of inflated \narrogance. It demonstrates a superabundance of inflated arrogance for a \nPresident of the United States, any President--I am not just talking \nabout this one--to feel that he has a right, and the power and the \nauthority--apparently he does have the raw power now that Congress \nunwittingly gave him the line- item veto--to take the position that if \nit isn't in his budget, he will veto it.\n  That is a supremely inflated arrogance, to assume that if it isn't in \nthe budget, the President of the United States shall strike it out. \n``Upon what meat [does] this our Caesar feed?'' When an administration \narrogates to itself the sole determination that items that are in the \nPresident's budget are sacrosanct but those that may be added by the \ndirectly elected representatives of the American people are negotiable, \nand they are vetoable--this is plain, bloated arrogance.\n  So, as a history student I have studied the practices and the customs \nand the traditions of the U.S. Senate during its over two centuries of \nexistence, and I believe I can say with some authority that today is a \nlandmark day in the Senate's history. For over 200 years the Senate has \nexercised its constitutional authority to write and pass the laws of \nthe land. But today that tradition will be momentarily set aside as we \nconsider legislation that asks--yes, asks the President to rethink his \ndecision to erase provisions from a bill passed by Congress and signed \ninto law by that same President. Today the Senate completes the \nabdication of legislative power that it began last spring when it \nadopted the conference report on the Line-Item Veto Act. The Senate \nacted upon the conference report on March 27, 1996. The Senate had \noriginally passed the Line-Item Veto Act a year and 4 days previous to \nthat, on March 23rd, 1995. Those are the two dark days in the \nconstitutional history of this country.\n  I would like to take a few moments to impress upon my colleagues the \nsignificance of today's vote and to implore them to reconsider the \nmisguided course that they embarked upon a year-and-a-half ago. But in \nso doing, let me say again, your vote today is not a vote for or \nagainst the line-item veto. But I do think it's good for us to look \nback. Lot's wife looked back and she was turned into a pillar of salt, \nbut Senators will not be turned into a pillar of salt. I think it's \ngood for us to look back and have an opportunity to see where we have \nerred. We all need to look back once in a while and see where we made a \nmistake, where we left the straight path. And maybe we can find a way \nto mend ourselves in the future.\n  So I begin my discussion, as always, with the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America. Any discussion of the line-item veto, indeed \nany discussion of the Federal Government, properly begins with the \nConstitution of the United States of America. And for those who may be \nwatching the Senate, here it is--right out of my shirt pocket. Here it \nis: The Constitution of the United States of America. It cost me 15 \ncents when I first purchased it from the Government Printing Office. I \nthink it's about $1.75 today, but it is worth every penny of it.\n  I begin my discussion with that Constitution, as any consideration of \nthe Federal Government should begin. For the Constitution is not some \nmusty document expressing abstract concepts, a quaint if antiquated \nrelic which only a few high school civics instructors deign to read.\n  The Constitution is the users' manual of the Federal Government. It \nspecifies how the branches of Government function, how they interact, \nhow their powers overlap, and yet those powers are separated. It \nexplains how the framers heeded the warnings set out in the Federalist \nPapers that ``[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, \nand judiciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced the \nvery definition of tyranny.''\n  The solution that the framers hit upon was to divide powers between \nand among three equal and distinct branches of government. It is a \nmarvelous, marvelous document. One, in my opinion, cannot truly \nunderstand the Constitution of the United States without also \nunderstanding the history of the ancient Romans, without understanding \nthe history of England, and without understanding the American colonial \nexperience, and without reading the Federalist Papers, in other words, \nwithout having a thorough grasp of the roots of the Constitution that \nlead back into the misty centuries.\n  The solution that the framers hit upon was to divide powers between \nand among three equal and distinct branches of government. The \nConstitution sets forth a clear separation of powers between and among \nthese three branches. Article I specifies that all--all--let's give \nwhat I say here 100 percent authenticity. I won't risk my memory.\n  Abiyataka was the nickname of Artaxerxes II, of Persia. His memory \nwas so fabulous and outstanding that he was given the nickname \nAbiyataka. So I won't depend on memory. I'll read it from the \nConstitution, so it has to be authentic.\n\n       Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be \n     vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall \n     consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Article II, by contrast--Article II, by contrast--let's be sure that \nit's authentic also, states in Section 1:\n\n       The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the \n     United States of America.\n\n  There it is. And one of the key functions of the President is to, \n``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' It's a matter of \nsome bemusement to me, to think that the Constitution mandates that the \nPresident is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and yet \nCongress passed the Line-Item Veto Act that allows the President to \nsign an appropriation bill into law and to not faithfully execute that \nlaw which he has just signed, but, instead, to turn right around and \nunilaterally repeal it, amend it, cancel or rescind this item or that \nitem. Is that a faithful execution of the laws? The framers could not \nhave made their intentions any plainer. Congress has the job of passing \nlaws. The President has the job of executing them.\n\n  What are the legislative powers ``herein granted'' that the \nConstitution assigns to Congress? Article I lists a number of these \npowers: they run the gamut from the power to ``lay and collect taxes'' \nto the power to ``fix the standard of Weights and Measures.'' Article I \nalso takes great care to spell out in clear and precise language the \nprocess by which Congress is to make laws. The most important language \nis contained in the so-called ``Presentment Clause'' of the \nConstitution--Article I, section 7, clause 2--which I will accordingly \nquote at length. ``Every bill,'' not just some bills, not just a few \nbills:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, [not maybe, not may--\n     shall; not might--shall] before it become a Law, be presented \n     to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall \n     sign it. . .\n\n  It doesn't say he may sign it. He shall sign it if he approve.\n\n       . . . but, if not he shall return it, with his Objections \n     to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall \n     enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed \n     to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of \n     that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, \n     together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it \n     shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds \n     of that House, it shall become a Law.\n\n                               * * * * *\n\n       If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within \n     10 Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented \n     to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had \n     signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent \n     its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\n\n  That is from the Constitution of the United States.\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\n  The Presentment Clause, then, offers the President three mutually \nexclusive alternatives in considering a bill passed by both houses of \nCongress: He may ``sign it,'' he may ``return it with his Objections'' \nto Congress, which may then pass the measure into law by a two-thirds \nvote of both Houses; or he may choose not to return the bill, whereupon \n``the Same shall be Law,'' unless Congress has adjourned before the \nbill's 10-day return limit has expired. So, whatever path the President \nchooses, he is compelled to consider it. And, by ``it,'' the \nConstitution means the entire bill as passed by Congress in its \nentirety; not just parts of it.\n  But, in defiance of the Presentment Clause, the Line-Item Veto Act \ncreates a fourth option for the President. Under the Act, the President \nmay take any bill ``that has been signed into law'' within the past 5 \ndays and he may cancel--I am reading now, quoting from the Line-Item \nVeto Act, ``. . . cancel in whole (1) any dollar amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority; (2) any item of new direct spending; or \n(3) any limited tax benefit. . . .''\n  The 5-day provision is a figleaf designed to conceal the measure's \nbrazen violation of the presentment clause. The drafters of the Line-\nItem Veto Act knew that they could not explicitly authorize the \nPresident to alter a bill passed by Congress before signing it, because \nto do so would violate the presentment clause's mandate that he send or \nreturn each bill in its entirety.\n  Thus, the act inserts a gratuitous pause of up to 5 days between the \nPresident's signing a bill and then canceling certain items in the bill \nthat he just signed. There can be 100 items in that bill, and he can \nstrike out 99 of them. He has 5 days in which to do it. He can strike \nout 100 the first day, the second day strike out another 100, the third \nday strike out another 100, the next day strike out 100, the next day \nstrike out 99. He already signed it into law. It is his little \nplaything then to do whatever he wants.\n  Although the conference report justifies the 5-day allowance as \ngiving the administration sufficient time to provide Congress with \n``all supporting material'' justifying any cancellation, the report \nmakes clear its intention ``that the President's cancellations be made \nas soon as possible.''\n  Nor should it be forgotten that while the President may take up to 5 \ndays to cancel an item, he need not wait that long. He is free, free, \nfree to cancel items the next second after he signs the bill into law, \nand he remains free to cancel items the next second after he signs the \nbill into law, and then he remains free to continue to do so for the \nnext 119 hours and 59 minutes. He has 120 hours.\n  I hope the High Court will say the presentment clause is not so \neasily evaded. The Supreme Court acknowledged the importance of strict \nadherence to the Constitution's procedural mandates when it declared \nthat ``the prescription for legislative action in article I, sections 1 \nand 7, represents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of \nthe Federal government be exercised in accord with a single, finely \nwrought and exhaustively considered, procedure . . . With all the \nobvious flaws of delay, untidiness, and potential for abuse, we have \nnot yet found''--this is the Supreme Court of the United States \nspeaking--``we have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than \nby making the exercise of power subject to carefully crafted restraints \nspelled out''--where?--``in the Constitution.''\n  That is what this line-item veto is all about. It is not about money, \nreally. It is not about reducing the deficits. Fie upon such reasoning. \nIt is just window dressing. It is not about reducing the budgets. It is \nnot about balancing the budget. It is all about power. Where will the \npower over the purse lie? When it lies here, the power of the people is \nprotected, and as long as that power over the purse is vested in the \nCongress, the people's freedoms are secure.\n  Let's see what this Court says, again. This bears repeating. I am \nquoting from the Court's position itself:\n\n       The prescription for legislative action in article I, \n     sections 1 and 7, represents the Framers' decision that the \n     legislative power of the Federal government be exercised in \n     accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively \n     considered, procedure . . . With all of the obvious flaws of \n     delay, untidiness, and potential for abuse, we have not yet \n     found a better way to preserve freedom than by making the \n     exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted restraints \n     spelled out in the Constitution.\n\n  Accordingly, it is not enough that the President may wait up to 5 \ndays after signing a bill before he retroactively violates the \npresentment clause. The violation is just as egregious as if the \nPresident had crossed out the items he disliked before signing the bill \ninto law.\n  Supporters of the line-item veto argue that the veto complies fully \nwith the presentment clause. Since the veto applies to bills that have \nalready been enacted into law in compliance with the presentment \nclause, the supporters of the line-item veto say, and since the \nrequirements of the presentment clause are fulfilled when the President \nsigns the measure into law, the Constitution cannot have been violated.\n  Well, even, Mr. President, if we accept this syllogism, it follows \nthat the act, by empowering the President to rewrite certain laws, to \nrepeal certain laws, to amend certain laws-- grants the President the \nmost basic of Congress' legislative powers; namely, the power to make \nlaws.\n  The act defines the President's cancellation authority as, \nalternately ``with respect to any dollar amount of discretionary budget \nauthority, to rescind''--to rescind--or, with respect to any item of \nnew direct spending or any limited tax benefit, to prevent ``from \nhaving legal force or effect.'' As this definition indicates, \n``cancellation'' is but another word for ``repeal.'' A rose by any \nother name smells just as sweet.\n  So cancellation is but another word for repeal and, functionally, \nwhat the President is doing when he cancels certain parts of the law is \nrepealing--unilaterally repealing--those same acts, those same parts \nfor, if as veto advocates argue, only bills that have been previously, \nalbeit recently, passed into law are subject to the line-item veto, \nthen those same bills, like all other laws, may only be repealed by \nlegislative action pursuant, again, to the presentment clause. After \nall, as the Supreme Court has recognized, ``[a]mendment and repeal of \nstatutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I.''\n  I repeat, as the Supreme Court has recognized:\n\n       [A]mendment and repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, \n     must conform with Article I.\n\n  The line-item veto advocates cannot have it both ways. Either the \nLine-Item Veto Act, as its very title indicates, gives the President \nthe authority to alter a bill passed by Congress by effectively signing \nonly certain parts of the bill into law, or the act allows the \nPresident to unilaterally repeal portions of an existing law. In either \nevent, the act permits the President to encroach upon the legislative \npowers assigned to Congress and to Congress alone, by bypassing the \nprocedures set forth in the presentment clause.\n  Mr. President, I hope that I have impressed upon my colleagues, those \nwho are listening, that the line-item veto offends the most clear and \nincontrovertible requirements of the Constitution. But if that isn't \nenough to sway my colleagues, let me point out that granting the \nPresident line-item veto power is not just unconstitutional, it is also \nbad policy. If anyone doubts what I am saying, and lest I be accused of \nforgetting the pretext for my speech today, let us consider the \ndisapproval resolution before us.\n  The disapproval bill is but a small attempt to repair the damage \nwrought by the President's misguided cancellations of 38 projects in \nthe fiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations bill. A \nnumber of my colleagues have criticized those same cancellations: \n``arbitrary,'' ``capricious,'' ``a raw abuse of political power.'' \nThese are the words of those who voted for the line-item veto. Those \nwho voted for the line-item veto now say that the President's exercise \nof the political tool which they handed to him, now they accuse him of \nbeing ``arbitrary,'' ``capricious,'' ``it was raw abuse of political \npower.''\n  Such criticisms are, of course, absolutely correct. There seems to be \nlittle logic underlying the President's cancellations. What logic can \nbe found is so flawed as to scarcely warrant a response. I repeat, for \nexample, the White House stated that it only vetoed projects that were \nnot ``executable,''\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nmeaning that construction could not begin in fiscal year 1998, but in \ntruth, every one of the 38 vetoed projects was eligible for \nconstruction in fiscal year 1998.\n  With regard to the West Virginia project, the design contract with \nZMM, Inc., of Charleston, West Virginia was signed on August 29, 1997. \nCompletion of the design contract is due in April 1998, and a \nconstruction contract could be let in the May-June timeframe.\n  An amount of $965,214.39 has been obligated and an amount of \n$44,967.61 has been expended against the design contract. So clearly, \nthe design work is underway and the project is executable in the \ncurrent fiscal year.\n  The White House also said that it only considered items that were not \nincluded in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request. How \narrogant! How arrogant! ``Upon what meat [does] this our [little] \nCaesar feed?'' Never mind that the Senate was careful to include \nprojects that were already in the Department of Defense's 5-year plan.\n  Never mind that the Senate moved up projects that were considered \nurgent or particularly meritorious, or that were necessary to remedy \noversights in the Presidential budget that would have deprived our \nArmed Forces of needed quality-of-life improvements or denied funding \nto important Guard and Reserve projects.\n  Never mind the many previous occasions on which Congress has \nsafeguarded the preparedness and well-being of the Armed Forces by \nfunding projects that various Presidents overlooked or shortchanged.\n  Now, the rules have changed, and congressionally backed projects are \ntargets for the Presidential blunderbuss that is the line-item veto. \nThey are targets for his blunderbuss of the line-item veto if they are \nnot in his budget.\n  It is difficult for me to overstate my anger at the rank arrogance of \nthe White House in relegating congressionally backed projects to such \nharsh scrutiny. Need I remind the administration that it was Congress \nthat in 1921 assigned the Executive the task of submitting annual \nbudget proposals? It was Congress that in 1921 assigned the Executive \nthe task of submitting annual budget proposals. Need I also point out \nthat those proposals are, by law, not binding and that Congress remains \nfree to exercise its ``power of the purse'' however it sees fit? And so \n``lay on, Macduff.'' It is the Congress that retains the freedom to \nexercise its power of the purse however it sees fit.\n  My anger is not directed at William Jefferson Clinton. He is merely \nexercising the power that we--we--in our weak moments gave him. The \nultimate blame lies here and across the corridor to the other end of \nthe Capitol. The ultimate blame lies here, here in this Chamber, which \ngave away a portion of its most important power, with no strings \nattached.\n  And I quoted upon the occasion when the Senate passed this ill-\nformed, deformed monstrosity, I quoted upon that occasion the words of \nAaron Burr, who in 1805 said that if the Constitution be destined ever \nto be destroyed, ``its expiring agonies will be witnessed on this \nfloor.'' And I said at the time that Burr's prophecy was being \nfulfilled.\n  So the ultimate blame lies here, which gave away a portion of its \nmost important power, with no strings attached. Here it is, Mr. \nPresident. We witnessed the expiring agonies of the Constitution on the \nfloor, as Burr said we would, when we passed the Line-Item Veto Act.\n  We had an opportunity to retrieve our honor and our commitment to our \nforefathers and our promises to our children at the time the conference \nreport came here. But the Senate again stabbed itself in its back, and \nthe expiring agonies of the Constitution were witnessed on this floor.\n  ``Didn't we tell the President how the line-item veto should be \nused?'' some may protest. Yes, we did. But the restrictions we placed \non the line-item veto were so vague and feeble as to give the President \nvirtually unlimited cancellation authority.\n  The Line-Item Veto Act states tautologically that any veto must \n``reduce the Federal budget deficit''--a requirement that any \ncancellation of a spending measure or tax benefit would presumably \nmeet. The act also insists that any cancellation must ``not impair \nessential Government functions'' or ``harm the national interest.''\n  Well, what are ``essential Government functions''? How should ``the \nnational interest'' be protected? Those answers must rest with the \nPresident, for the act provides little guidance--the act provides \nlittle guidance.\n  Moreover, even if the President determines that all three criteria \nhave been met, he is still free to decide not to effect a cancellation. \nThe act says only that ``the President may'' cancel certain items \nmeeting those criteria.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues protest that the President's \ncancellations are arbitrary and capricious. To this I respond: Of \ncourse they are, because we gave the President the authority to be \narbitrary and capricious.\n  And so let us not now, at this late moment--those of us who voted for \nthe Line-Item Veto Act--let us not heap obloquy and scorn and \ncondemnation and criticisms and castigations and imprecations upon the \nPresident because he is being ``arbitrary'' and ``capricious.''\n  We have given the President the power to strike any item he pleases \nand for any reason he pleases. He can say it was not in his budget. If \nhe does not have any other reason, he can say, ``Well, it wasn't in my \nbudget.'' Not according to the act, but he can do it. He has done it.\n  And who is to blame? We have only ourselves to blame. By passing the \nline-item veto, we have deprived Congress of an effective say in which \nprojects will be funded, we have denied ourselves the ability, which we \nexercised so often and so successfully in past budget cycles, to \ncorrect flaws or oversights in the President's budget proposal.\n  In past years, Congress repeatedly ensured that essential defense \nprojects were funded at the appropriate levels. It was Congress that \ninsisted on adequate funding for the stealth fighter. It was Congress \nthat insisted on the funding for the Osprey helicopter. It was Congress \nthat insisted on adequate funding for the C-130 aircraft, and countless \nother valuable projects that the administration at the time opposed.\n\n  It is no exaggeration to say that this country's defense capabilities \nwould be significantly weakened today if not for Congress' vigilance \nand dedication in the fulfillment of its appropriations duties.\n  Now, however, congressional vigilance is subject to indiscriminate \nline-item vetoes. No longer can Congress ensure proper investments in \nthis country's defense and infrastructure, thus, safeguarding the \npresent and future well-being of all Americans.\n  The line-item veto has created a new order in which Members of \nCongress must resort to ``disapproval measures'' to restore funding \nthat they already approved and that the President already signed into \nlaw, which under the Constitution would indicate that he had already \napproved the items. The Constitution says, if he approves, he shall \nsign it. And he signed it.\n  Today is a black day for this institution whose Members must \nprostrate themselves on bended knee before the President and ask him--\nask him--to do what the Constitution requires: To respect and enforce \nand execute, faithfully execute, the laws passed by Congress.\n  But this is also a black day for the Nation which now finds that its \nsingle most representative institution no longer possesses unqualified \nauthority to make the law. That is the legislative branch.\n  As Members of Congress, we represent the people of this great \ncountry. By abdicating a portion of our responsibility to pass laws--\nthat is exactly what we did--we have denied ourselves the ability to \nrepresent those people effectively.\n  I apologize if my words today have seemed angry or vituperative. I \napologize if my vehemence has offended any of my colleagues. I do not \nmean to provoke partisan dispute or internal dissent. I only wish to \nask my colleagues to consider, as they ponder their vote on the \ndisapproval bill before us--and go ahead vote as they wish on the \ndisapproval bill; that is not an indication of whether they favor of \ndisfavor the line-item veto--but they should ponder whether the Nation \nought to continue down the shadowy trail that it embarked upon when we \npassed the Line-Item Veto Act.\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\n  I pray that before we blunder too far down this misguided path, we \nwill retrace our steps and return to the route laid out by the framers, \nthe path that was lighted by the clear light of the Constitution.\n  The President says, ``We'll say to any Member, we'll be happy to \nnegotiate with you about your item.''\n  ``We might be able to work it out so the President won't veto it.''\n  Senators, do not do it. Do not act to legitimize this legislation. Do \nnot act to legitimize this process by which we have, in part, \nemasculated the Constitution, the constitutional system with its checks \nand balances and separation of powers.\n  Do not negotiate for a moment, because when you do, you are \nnegotiating with respect to the Constitution, you are saying, ``Well, \nI'll negotiate with you. You can go ahead and line item the item out, \nbut maybe we can work out something.'' I say that when one negotiates \nunder those circumstances, he is negotiating something that the \nConstitution is pretty clear about, and that is the checks and balances \nand separation of powers.\n  The Constitution is not to be negotiated. And I, for one, will not \nnegotiate to save any item for West Virginia. I will not negotiate. I \nwill negotiate with other Members until we are able to work out \nlanguage, compromise language, in a bill, dealing with a matter, but \nwhen it comes to negotiating in order to keep the President from \nwielding his dreadful line-item veto pen, that's not for me.\n  When we took it upon ourselves to correct some of the framers' \nmistakes by ignoring the clear language of the Constitution, we did not \njust display a breathtaking contempt for the rule of law and the \nprinciple of separation of powers; we also cast aside our own \nresponsibility as Members of Congress to act as a check upon the \nexecutive branch, and we there and then deprived ourselves and deprived \nthe people that we represent of the ability to ensure that the power of \nthe purse is exercised in the best interests of the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as original cosponsors: Senator Shelby, \nSenator Hagel, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Lautenberg.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nrecognized in this order in consideration of this measure:\n  Senator Burns, Senator Murray, Senator Coverdell, Senator Cleland, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, not to take away from the seriousness of \nthe moment or the debate that we heard about the line-item veto and the \ndebate we are hearing today, I will say about my chairman and ranking \nmember of the full committee, since this circumstance has happened, it \nhas sure picked up the most colorful debate in committees. That had \nbeen absent for quite a while.\n  I want to congratulate my friend from West Virginia on laying out the \nsituation as it really is. But we are here and we have to deal with the \nmoment as it is, and given the President's desire to improve the \nquality of life for the men and women in uniform, and given the \nPresident's dedication to a balanced budget as reflected in the real \nworld, and the real world is appropriations--that is where we actually \nspend the money. We can debate on the budget all we want to but \naccounting time is when we start appropriating dollars for the real \nworld.\n  The ranking member on military construction appropriations, Senator \nMurray, has worked hard with our colleagues in the House and also with \nthe administration before we finally passed a conference report and \nsent it to the White House for the President's signature. We worked \nvery hard to take out those items that would have been objectionable, \nand it reflected the intent of Congress, both through the budget \nstatement and through the appropriations statement and the charge that \nwas given us when appropriating the money. I believe we did a \nresponsible job in working with everyone.\n  Of course, of all the projects that are in this, we had to single out \n38. Now we are offering some back. We have to remember that we are \ncharged with covering the most basic defense requirements. After \nhearing from the military services, the Congress did add back $800 \nmillion to the President's budget, with the agreement from the \nPresident to fund those meritorious requirements that, as articulated \nto us, are essential to the services' operations.\n  I guess since I've been working in this committee, we have tried to \nshift the focus in military construction to quality of life. We have a \nprofessional military now. It is not like it used to be. We have made \nthose shifts primarily into the quality of life--the building of health \ncare centers, the building of child care centers, new barracks for \nenlisted people--because everywhere that I have traveled, looked at our \nmen and women in uniform, and especially with the rollbacks and the \ndownsizing in the force structure, I am concerned, now more than ever, \nabout the morale of our fighting men and women.\n\n  I have visited the installations around the country. I have seen \nsoldiers, marines, airmen and sailors sleeping on floors, airmen \nworking in substandard facilities, and families forced to go on--would \nyou believe it--on food stamps. They actually qualified for food \nstamps.\n  Even though we have a professional military, we still ask them to \ndefend our country on a moment's notice. I, for one, think they deserve \nbetter. That is why I question the veto of this President. I guess I'm \neven more familiar with the facilities in Montana. I had one of those \nlines that was vetoed, a dining facility at Malmstrom Air Force Base in \nGreat Falls, MT. I just wish the President had accepted my invitation \nto have lunch there. It didn't look much like the north side of the \nWhite House last night, I can tell you. He would see a facility that is \nin bad need of repair and renovation. I'm not real sure if the food \npreparation areas or where they serve the food would pass health \ninspection in the civilian sector. There is lack of ventilation and \nfood storage space. It was an old commissary. The facility would sure \nflunk the most basic of all inspections.\n  It is my strong view that the President used the line-item on this \nbill not as the Congress intended, or even his own stated intent. I \nwould not feel so bad, I really wouldn't, had we gone over the budget \nagreement or had we gone over what we spent a year ago or even 2 years \nago. The ranking member knows that we are almost $2 billion out of an \n$11 billion appropriation lower than we were 2 years ago in providing \nnecessary items of need in the military construction for these \nprojects. If we had gone over and had we just thrown money hand over \nfist and wasted it, I wouldn't feel bad about this line-item veto, but \nwe did not do that. We did not approach this bill in that manner. We \nknew the line-item veto was out there. We knew that everything in this \nbill, No. 1, had to be authorized by the authorizers, and we knew the \namount of money that we were expected to save in order to comply with \nthe balanced budget and still get the job done for our military people.\n  Every project on this list was carefully screened. It was authorized \nby the Armed Services Committee. It was included in the final Defense \nauthorization conference for fiscal year 1998. Had we not gone through \nthat process, had we not taken each item individually, had we not been \nsensitive to the need of our lifestyle and the quality of life, had we \nnot done any of that--yet in consultation with the President and with \nthe representatives of each one of the military services--had we not \ndone that, I wouldn't feel so bad today. But we did that. We did it in \nthe most conscientious way that we know, and that is human contact, \nactually talking to people through the whole process, keeping them \ninformed about what was in there and what was not in there.\n  Everybody was not happy with it, but it was a pretty big vote, 97-3. \nI think that is pretty overwhelming. It tells the story of the work \nthat we did on this legislation.\n  So I appreciate my ranking member and both sides of the aisle. I \nappreciate all the folks that worked on this piece of legislation. And, \nyes, I appreciate the people who represented the military services and \nthe people who represented the White House as we were working on it. I \nappreciate them, too. But maybe some things I don't appreciate: Once \nyou agree on something,\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nthen you walk away from it some 6 weeks later. That is not the way we \ndo business in Montana, and I don't think that is the way we do \nbusiness in Washington, Arizona, Georgia, or Kansas.\n  I ask for your support on this. We will probably have more to say \nwith regard to this piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the \nlegislation before the Senate, along with the chairman, Senator Burns, \nwho has done an outstanding job of putting this legislation together. I \nhope the Senate does disapprove the cancellation of projects which the \nPresident made under his line-item veto authority. I do not think it \nwas appropriate to exercise that authority in the case of our bill. The \nsubcommittee worked very hard and successfully to review the many \nrequests that came before us for projects that were not included in the \nPresident's budget. We worked very hard to include only those which met \nvery stringent criteria. In all cases, that included the criteria that \nthe project be executable in fiscal year 1998. That is, that contracts \ncould be awarded for construction.\n  It is puzzling to me why the administration concluded that some 38 \nprojects were not executable. That conclusion is wrong. The Pentagon's \nown paperwork, provided to the subcommittee for each of the proposed \nprojects, plainly states virtually every project we included was \ncapable of execution in fiscal year 1998.\n  The subcommittee added substantial sums for new health facilities, \nquality of life improvements such as the housing area, and for the \nNational Guard and the Reserves. Despite these additions, the final \nproduct was frugal, and represented a 6-percent reduction below last \nyear's milcon spending level.\n  Mr. President, the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senators Stevens and Byrd, have rejected the vetoed items as \nan inappropriate overreaching of authority on the part of the \nadministration. I am gratified that the committee is standing up for \nthe subcommittee's work. It is a substantially better product than the \nbudget submitted by the President, and that is our job. The \nadministration has no exclusive corner on wisdom in making its \nselection of projects.\n  In fact, the administration has admitted making serious errors in the \nhandling of this matter. I would have thought that the administration \nwould have been far more careful and selective in exercising its new \nline-item authority, but the reverse was the case. The exercise of \npower here was sloppy, and rushed--and resulted, as OMB Director Raines \nwrote to the committee on October 23, in inaccuracies. The \nadministration has taken to writing to individual Senators to indicate \nit would help restore those projects wrongly vetoed, and put them back \nin the budget at the earliest opportunity. That tactic makes the \nsituation, if anything, even more confused, since it appears the \nadministration is revising its evaluation of the mix of projects based \non new information or criteria and there has certainly been no meeting \nof the minds on such new acceptable criteria with the committee.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that Senators look at this disapproval \nresolution in the narrow framework in which it is written. Senators \nneed not address this position on the constitutionality or wisdom of \nthe line-item veto legislation itself to vote for this resolution. A \nvote for this resolution is a vote against back-of-the-hand \ncapriciousness, apparently in a hurried manner, after the subcommittee, \nfull committee, and both Houses labored over a period of several months \nto scrub the budget and add only those projects which are deemed \nworthy.\n  I hope this measure will receive the strong support of the full \nSenate, as it did when the conference report was first presented, and \nthat it will be presented to the President before we conclude the first \nsession of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, before my friend from Arizona speaks, we \nhad a unanimous consent on the order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we go back and forth, which would mean \nthat the next Senator allowed time would be Senator McCain from Arizona \nand, after that, Senator Cleland from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield to my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to be brief. This issue has been \nwell discussed and well debated, and will be again because this is the \nfirst step in a process that we will see for the first time in the \nSenate, and that is a motion of disapproval of a veto by the President \nand an attempt to override the President's veto. So we will have plenty \nof time. I mainly asked to speak, one, to congratulate Senator Stevens \nnot only for his stewardship of the entire Appropriations Committee, \nbut his staunch advocacy for a strong national defense and his sincere \nefforts to do what he feels is right.\n  Senator Burns has done an outstanding job as the chairman of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I believe that his recent depiction \nof the situation at Malmstrom Air Force Base is an ample indication of \nhis concern for the living standards of the men and women in the \nmilitary and his deep and abiding concern for their welfare.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I, as a supporter of the line-item \nveto, intend to vote against this resolution. I believe that we have to \nset up criteria that need to be met, because there is not an unlimited \namount of Defense dollars or taxpayer dollars for that matter. Not only \ndid these projects--or at least the overwhelming majority of them--not \nmeet the criteria I have been using now for 10 years, but there were \n129 low-priority items added to the Milcon appropriations bills that \nshould have been--at least under the criteria I have been using for the \nlast 10 years--vetoed.\n  Mr. President, there is a process that we go through. It is \nauthorization, it is hearings, it is budget requests, it is the kind of \norderly process that gives a priority that is sufficiently compelling \nfor the taxpayers' dollars to be used on that project, whether it be in \nmilitary construction or defense appropriations, or any other \nappropriations bill. In order to understand that, in my view, in order \nto make a reasonable and fair and objective decision, you have to set \nup objective criteria. That is where the administration has failed in \nthis exercise.\n  The people in this body--the Senator from Washington, who just spoke \nabout what happened in her State, the Senator from Montana, the Senator \nfrom Georgia, and all the other cosponsors of this bill--deserve the \nright to know under what criteria the President of the United States \nwould act in vetoing these various projects; in this case, they are \nmilitary construction projects. They have a right to know that, as do \nthe people and the military installations in their districts. We have a \nfuture years defense plan that the Pentagon sets up, which lists the \nprojects that are going to be funded, and which they plan to, after a \ncareful screening process, request funding for from the Congress and \nthe American people. There is a system that goes before the authorizing \ncommittees. We have a military construction authorization bill, and \nthen it goes before the Appropriations Committee. That process should \nbe adhered to.\n  Why am I against so many of these projects? Simply, Mr. President, \nbecause there are 12,000 American military families that are on food \nstamps. I understand they don't have a decent facility to eat in at \nMalmstrom, but I also know they are kept away from home because of a \nlack of equipment. And we are having a hemorrhage of Air Force and Navy \npilots because we are not paying them enough and we are keeping them \naway from their families, keeping them at sea, or in places like Iraq \nor Turkey, because we are not funding them adequately.\n  Mr. President, I happen to know that we are not modernizing the force \nsufficiently in order to meet the challenge in the future. We are \nbuying things such as the B-2 bombers, which we find out can't even fly \nin the rain. Then we have the Seawolf submarines, and there is no \ntangible challenge to American security that warrant paying for that. \nFrankly, we are funding projects not on the basis of merit, but for \nother reasons.\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\n  I believe that the men and women in the military, especially those \nenlisted men and women, deserve more than they are getting. They are \nnot getting it because we are funding projects and programs many times \nwhich are unnecessary. Also, in the Defense appropriations bills we are \nfunding projects that have nothing to do with national defense. I am \nnot sure what electric car research has to do with national defense. I \nam not sure what supercomputers to study the aurora borealis have to do \nwith defense. They may be worthwhile projects, and I do not disagree \nthat some of the projects that were vetoed by the President here were \nworthwhile; it is a matter of priority.\n  I hope that the President of the United States and the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, who obviously is making many of \nthese recommendations to the President, will understand that we have to \nset up criteria for when the line-item veto is used or not used. \nOtherwise, you give the appearance of politicization of the process, \nwhich understandably angers and upsets Members of Congress who feel \nthat they or their projects are being singled out, where other projects \nunder the same criteria were not line item-vetoed.\n  So I believe that if we want to avoid going through this exercise on \na fairly frequent basis, the Members of Congress and the American \npeople deserve the President of the United States to say: This is the \ncriteria I will use--whether it is authorized or not, whether it is \nadded in conference or not, whether it was earmarked or not, whether it \nwas requested, or whatever. I am not saying the President should use my \ncriteria, but I am saying he should use an objective criteria that is \ncredible; so that when the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, who has \ndevoted so many hundreds of hours to this effort and takes his duties \nas chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee so seriously, \ndecides whether or not to add or not add a project to his legislation, \nhe will know whether it meets his criteria. He will have a certainty as \nto whether the President will veto it or not.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Montana and his staff for their hard \nwork. I hope we can provide a framework in which he can work so there \nwould be certainty and objectivity, and not a taint or appearance of \npoliticization of this process, which is the case today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Regina \nJackson, a legislative fellow on my staff, be granted floor privileges \nfor the debate on S. 1292.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues today \nin search of any rhyme or reason behind the veto of the $6.8 million \nproject that the President vetoed at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. \nIt is known as the HH-60 OPS/pararescue project. It is a critical \nproject that supports combat search and rescue training and pararescue \ntraining operations. This project should have been included in the \nbudget. It benefits the quality of life for our service members, and \nhas been operating at Moody since April, 1997. There is no apparent \nrationale for this veto action. I believe that the Moody project was \nvetoed because it failed to meet all the criteria for approval set by \nthe administration. Thus, the claim was made that: first, the Moody \nproject was not requested in the President's 1998 budget; second, the \nproject would not improve the quality of life of military service \nmembers and their families; three, the project almost certainly would \nnot begin construction in 1998.\n  Responsible consideration of veto targets would have taken into \naccount and weighed all the facts. The facts are these. My information \nis based on the fact that, in 1996, the Pentagon announced its plans to \nmove two squadrons, the 41st and 71st, from Patrick Air Force Base, FL, \nto Moody Air Force Base, GA. In connection with the move, the Air Force \nbegan quartering a small number of people at Moody as early as October \n1996 and subsequently moved the squadrons there in April 1997. The \nrelocation is now complete and the unit is operating out of a temporary \ntrailer.\n  Having made a formal announcement, the Pentagon certainly had a \ngenuine interest in the success of this project. The Air Force, having \nbegun the transition in October 1996, obviously intended to implement \nthe plan. Unfortunately, the decisions came too late for the Pentagon \nto include this project in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget, \nthough, again, I believe there can be no doubt that our defense \nleadership fully supports the new mission for Moody.\n  My distinguished colleagues, let us not forget that this Congress is \nduly responsible for ensuring that our legislation considers \nappropriate measures where the administration's submission may actually \nbe lacking. It is not unusual, Mr. President, but in fact very common, \nthat in the course of congressional review, we make additions or \ndeletions that are in the best interest of national defense.\n  In my opinion, this is one of the most critical projects that I have \ncome across. I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I think it is my \njob, not only as a Senator from Georgia but as a U.S. Senator to bring \nup other concerns that the administration does not raise. I would like \nto say that the Moody squadron does employ the Blackhawk helicopter to \nimplement its mission, and the project supports essential combat search \nand rescue training and pararescue training operations. What could be \nmore important to the quality of life of military service members and \ntheir families than facilities that can operate to preserve those \nlives?\n  Apparently, the administration erred in assuming that the squadrons \nhad not yet located to Moody. Actually, the move began in 1996 and is \nnow complete. I think if this veto is not overridden, the mission \ncapability of the squadron will be seriously impacted. A combined \nfunction facility is required to provide both an adequate squadron \noperations space and pararescue space. No facility currently exists at \nMoody to support the HH-60 pararescue squadron. Without this facility, \nnew mission functions will be almost impossible to perform and may not \nbe able to operate as designed. Whether the veto was arbitrary or ill-\nadvised, the bottom line is that the Moody veto makes no sense.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent by myself \nand Senator Coverdell be printed in the Record that expresses our point \nof view on this important matter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our profound \n     disappointment with your decision to veto a military \n     construction project vitally important to Air Force rescue \n     squadrons based at Moody Air Force Base. Yesterday you vetoed \n     a $6.8 million project to build a squadron operations support \n     facility to support the 41st HH-60 Pararescue Squadron which \n     has been relocated to Moody AFB from Patrick AFB. We are \n     unable to understand the rationale used in canceling this \n     project. Without this facility, the new mission functions \n     associated with this relocation will be almost impossible to \n     perform and the mission capability of this squadron will be \n     severely impacted. This was an essential project with high \n     military value, and your decision is even more troubling \n     given revelations that Defense Department officials were not \n     consulted.\n       We are particularly disturbed by the discrepancy in the \n     facts you cited in vetoing this project. Your veto message \n     indicated that 1) ``the mission has not yet relocated from \n     Patrick AFB'' and 2) ``it is unlikely that these funds can be \n     used for construction during FY 1998.'' Both of these \n     assertions are false. The relocation of these units began in \n     April 1997 and is now complete. Furthermore, the Air Force \n     informs us that the proposed construction can be executed in \n     FY 1998. We are disappointed that your staff has ill-served \n     you in presenting to you the facts regarding this project.\n       It should be made clear that we both support the line-item \n     veto as a means to reduce spending on wasteful programs when \n     the facts merit a veto. The facts here do not support a veto. \n     We are concerned that the perceived arbitrary nature of this \n     and other such vetoes will undermine support for this useful \n     mechanism.\n       In closing, we regret that your decision was based on \n     erroneous information regarding the urgency of this project \n     and the ability of the Air Force to execute it. We hope to be \n     able to work with you in the future to support the needs of \n     the men and women who\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\n     serve at Moody AFB and in the entire Department of Defense.\n           Most sincerely,\n     Paul Coverdell,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Max Cleland,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Senator Coverdell and I are both supporters of the line-\nitem veto to reduce wasteful spending. But the basis for the veto, as \nthe Senator from Arizona indicated, must be prescribed and must rely on \nthe facts, not on false assumptions. Clearly, in the case of the Moody \nfacility, the facts did not justify the decision, and the project did \nnot warrant a veto.\n  Mr. President, this project has been and remains a top priority for \nMoody Air Force Base and for both Georgia Senators. The mission has \nbeen and remains in place at this time. I look to this bill to make \nright the wrong of the veto. In so doing, I hope to be able to support \nthe needs of the additional 680 military personnel and approximately \n1,500 spouses and dependent children that the mission has brought with \nit to Moody.\n  I yield to my colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia, for his \nremarks. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to apprise my colleagues \nof a terrible mistake made by the President and the administration in \nits issuing a veto on the $6.8 million HH-60 Operations Pararescue Unit \nproject at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, GA.\n  I am aware of the interest of my colleague, Senator Cleland, in this \nmatter, and I understand that he has joined me in questioning the \nrationale behind the abuse of power by the President. We just heard an \nexcellent statement from my colleague, Senator Cleland, of Georgia, on \nthis very matter.\n  In looking at this project at Moody, it is important to understand, \nfirst, that this pararescue unit is critical to our combat search and \nrescue training operations which allow this group to function in a \nproper capacity.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, pararescue units are imperative to \ninstilling in our fighting forces the battlefield and training \nconfidence necessary for just the type of confidence that we have \nearned in this century.\n  The administration claimed that the Moody project was not needed for \nseveral reasons--such as budget requests, quality of life, and \nconstruction capability. We now know that these assertions are not \naccurate. The Air Force has distinct plans to fund the Moody project \nwhich was included in the Air Force's 1999 budget request. Officials at \nMoody inform me that they could have, indeed, begun construction on the \nproject this year.\n  Finally, the Pentagon in 1996 announced its plans to move two \nsquadrons, the 41st and the 71st, from Patrick Air Force Base, FL, to \nMoody Air Force Base in Georgia.\n  A small number of personnel began quartering at Moody as early as \nOctober of 1996, and subsequently moved the squadron there in its \nentirety in April of 1997. Make no mistake. The move is now complete, \nand the personnel are operating out of temporary trailers at Moody as \nwe speak here today.\n  What greater quality of life issue exists for the nearly 2,200 \nmilitary personnel and their families that this mission has brought to \nMoody?\n  We need to move expeditiously on this legislation to correct this \nerror. The administration did not know, Mr. President, that the \nsquadrons were already in Georgia. They believed they were still in \nFlorida when they exercised this veto.\n  On this note, I commend my colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, \nfor bringing this bill before the Senate. I ask for my colleagues' \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, if I might make an inquiry of my colleague from \nGeorgia, did he still prefer to participate if the colloquy here this \nafternoon, or did you want to just enter that into the Record?\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Georgia who spoke eloquently on this matter. It is clear that the \npeople are already there, and the need exists for this operation \nfacility. There was a misunderstanding, a miscommunication, about this \nmatter at the Executive level, and that we were not properly consulted. \nOtherwise, we would have been able to share vital information with them \nat the time, and it might have changed the outcome.\n  But I hope, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Coverdell \nfrom Georgia, that the Senate will override the President on this \nmatter and make sure that this vital operational facility is present at \nMoody Air Force Base in Georgia to accommodate some 2,000 personnel \nthat are already in place, as the Senator has so accurately indicated.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the remarks again of my good colleague \nfrom Georgia, Senator Cleland. His remarks have documented the travesty \nthat has occurred here. And, of course, when something like this \nhappens, you have over 2,000 families in Georgia who are living in \ntemporary facilities, and it is imperative that this error, this \nmistake, be overturned, which, of course, would be among the many, many \nissues that are in Senator Stevens' bill.\n  So my colleague from Georgia and I are both rising in support of that \nto get this error corrected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of \nthe full committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator \nByrd, for their strong leadership on this important issue.\n  Additionally, Senator Burns and Senator Murray, the chairman and \nranking member of the Military Construction Subcommittee, have done an \noutstanding job all year of putting together an appropriations bill \nwhich addresses the vital needs of our military installations.\n  Mr. President, we are here debating the merits of President Clinton's \ndecision to strike funding for over 30 military construction projects. \nLet me state clearly that I strongly object to the President's reckless \nuse of this new authority.\n  While I support the line-item authority, in this instance the \nPresident not only misused it, he endangered soldiers lives.\n  Let's look at the President's argument. Among his statements, the \nPresident claimed that he was canceling only projects ``that would not \nhave been built in fiscal year 1998 in any event; projects where the \nDepartment of Defense has not yet even done design work.''\n  Wrong. The President's statement is absolutely inaccurate.\n  In fact, of the projects contained in this measure, each of them \ncould begin construction in fiscal year 1998, a direct contradiction to \nthe President's claim.\n  As for the two projects in Kentucky which were deemed wasteful by the \nPresident, one had 10 percent of the design work completed, and the \nother had completed 90 percent of the design work. Ninety percent, Mr. \nPresident, that is hardly insignificant.\n  President Clinton also claimed his effort was ``another step on the \nlong journey to bring fiscal discipline to Washington.'' In fact, he \nwent on to claim he was ensuring ``that our tax dollars are well \nspent,'' and was standing ``up for the national interests over narrow \ninterests.''\n  Wrong again.\n  The projects eliminated by the President totaled $287 million. Our \nFederal budget is over $1.6 trillion. Therefore, the President's \nefforts have saved the nation a whopping seventeen thousandths of 1 \npercent of the Federal budget. So the simple truth is no real money \nwill be saved as a result of President Clinton's veto.\n  The fact is every single project contained in this measure is in the \nPresident's own future year plan for military construction. Therefore, \nthese facilities will be built, if not this year some time in the next \n5 years. And, Mr. President, I don't have to explain to you the reality \nthat delaying the inevitable construction will only increase the cost \nof these projects.\n  Mr. President, anyone who believes that the projects will be built \nfor only $287 million, their cost in fiscal year 1998, is sadly \nmistaken. Each of these projects will increase in cost, and the \nAmerican taxpayers will be left holding the bag once again.\n  Finally, Mr. President, allow me to discuss one of the Kentucky \nprojects which was vetoed in order to provide an example of how the \nprocess was mishandled by the Clinton administration. And, let me begin \nby reminding the\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nSenate that the administration did not even use accurate information in \nevaluating this and other projects.\n  Fort Campbell, KY, is home to the 101st Airborne, Air Assault, the \n``Screaming Eagles.'' This unit is one of the most important assets in \nthe U.S. Army, and is often the first to deploy in a crisis situation.\n  As a result, the soldiers at Fort Campbell must maintain the highest \nlevel of readiness in order to deploy at a moment's notice. Yet, \nbecause President Clinton decided this was a pork-barrel project, over \n200 soldiers a day are forced to work in facilities that are more than \n50 years old, but were meant to last no more than 15 years when they \nwere constructed.\n  Let me say that another way. Over 200 of America's finest soldiers \nare working, everyday, in facilities that should have been replaced or \ntorn down over 40 years ago. These structures are literally falling \ndown on top of the men and women working in these facilities.\n  Instead, Mr. President, the soldiers of the 101st are working in \ndilapidated, dysfunctional structures with little or no heat, faulty \nelectrical wiring, no fire control systems and are riddled with \nasbestos.\n  An OSHA inspection of these facilities would do what no army in the \nworld could--shut down one of our premier combat units and prevent it \nfrom meeting its mission requirments.\n  Conditions are so poor that work is often performed outside on gravel \nparking areas and not at all when temperatures reach severe levels.\n  The $9.9 million appropriated for this project would have provided \nmuch needed facilities to the 86th Combat Support Hospital--a rapid \ndeployable unit equipped with the Army's most modern medical systems, \nand whose mission it is to support soldiers on the front lines of \ncombat.\n  To meet its mission requirement, Mr. President, the 86th must \nmaintain more than 1,200 pieces of equipment in top, deployable \ncondition around the clock. And, as you can imagine, much of this \nmedical equipment requires conditions which cannot be met by these \ninadequate facilities.\n  Mr. President, the examples are numerous, but the most telling \nexample is truly shocking. In 1991, one of the structures slated to be \nreplaced burned to the ground in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no \none was hurt in this incident, this time.\n  If this is not a readiness and quality of life issue, I do not know \nwhat is.\n  Clearly, the condition of these facilities is incompatible with \nmaintaining a premier fighting force and with retaining the quality men \nand women who work there.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying the line-item veto was \nintended to be an instrument of precision and not the weapon of blunt \nforce trauma. It was meant to deter wasteful spending--not endanger the \nlives of American service men and women.\n  But, the President's action was not, as he claimed, ``another step on \nthe long journey to bring fiscal discipline to Washington'' rather it \nwas a reckless abuse of authority that must be rejected. It is time we \nstop paying lip service and truly commit ourselves to meeting the needs \nand quality of life issues of these dedicated soldiers. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in voting to restore the funding President \nClinton eliminated.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to defend two projects the \nPresident of the United States chose to veto in the military \nconstruction appropriations bill. The President claimed that three \ncriteria had to be met for an item to be cut. First, the item was not \nrequested in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget; second, it would \nnot substantially improve the quality of life of military service \nmembers and their families; and third, architectural and engineering \ndesign of the project has not started, making it unlikely funds can be \nused for construction in fiscal year 1998. Only the first criterion \nwas, in fact met in the two cases I rise to support.\n  The first project the President struck was a tactical equipment shop \nat Ft. Campbell. The $9.9 million project would provide a vehicle \nmaintenance shop, storage for a forward support battalion, and a combat \nsupport hospital. The project replaces a 55-year-old building that was \nconstructed in 1942 as a temporary structure to last until the end of \nWorld War II. This project was, please note, fully designed, and \ntherefore did not meet the President's third criterion.\n  This facility is Ft. Campbell's No. 1 priority mission support \nproject. The structure is literally falling down around its occupants \nand is ridiculously expensive to maintain. The Army wastes tens of \nthousands of dollars on Band-Aid repair jobs every year just to keep \nthe structure barely functional.\n  The old structures have significant environmental problems: No oil/\nwater separators, no sumps for battery acid, and the buildings contain \nasbestos and lead-based paint. In addition to the environmental issues, \nthe structures have old faulty wiring that caused a fire in October \n1991. Also, there is no eye wash area or vehicle exhaust system.\n  The new structure would support the 101st Airborne, whose operational \ndeployment requirements have increased 300 to 400 percent to support \nOperations Other Than WAr. In 1995 alone, the Clinton Pentagon spent \n$6.6 billion in Operations Other Than War in places like Bosnia, Haiti, \nand Somalia. Combined, the cost of both of the Tennessee projects \nvetoed by the President are about the same as one day's spending at \nthat rate.\n  Ironically, according to the President's formula for cuts, if this \nfacility were an arts and crafts center, it would have been classified \nas a ``quality of life'' project sale from cuts. Of course, the \nbuilding's current state of disrepair is a ``quality of life'' issue to \nthe young Army troop who is spending 8 to 12 hours a day working in the \nfacility.\n  The other Tennessee project canceled by the President was an \natmospheric air dryer facility at Arnold Air Force Base. This $9.9 \nmillion project would construct an air dryer facility to replace the \nantiquated facility currently used. The new facility would support the \nmission of the propulsion wind tunnel facility used to test several new \nweapon systems, including the F-22 and joint strike fighter.\n  Mr. President, both of these projects are vital to military readiness \nand national security. It is my hope that my colleagues will take a \nclose look at the projects in this legislation and cast a vote for this \ncritical legislation. We must not allow our forces to decline further \ninto a hollow state reminiscent of the late 1970's.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks about the \nlegislation before us. I am a strong supporter of the line-item veto. I \nbelieve we must use whatever tools we have at our disposal to restrain \nFederal spending.\n  That said, I agree with my colleagues that we have a right to expect \nthe President to exercise his line-item veto authority in a manner that \nis fair. If he says he is going to use a set of criteria, then he \nshould. Unfortunately, some but not all of the project vetoed met the \nPresident's own criteria.\n  For example, the President used his line-item veto authority to \neliminate funding for an aerial port training facility at the General \nMitchell Air Reserve Station in Milwaukee based on erroneous \ninformation. The administration has admitted as much. There is no \nquestion that this project is 35 percent designed with a site selected \nand is ready to be constructed in fiscal year 1998. In addition, this \nproject was authorized in the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization \nbill conference report and is included in the Pentagon's 5-year plan.\n  I should also add that this project makes a significant contribution \nto the military readiness of a unit which plays an important role in \nour Nation's defense. The merging of the 34th Aerial Port Squadron, 154 \npersons, and the 95th Aerial Port Squadron, 102 personnel, has \noverburdened the current training facility. The 34th Squadron must \ntrain its reserve airlift specialists to load and unload military cargo \naircraft using one bay of the base warehouse and a leased modular \nfacility. Even with the temporary facility, overcrowding is so severe \nthat the unit cannot train together. Some reservists must train on \nweekends that are not normal unit training assembly weekends, depriving \nthem of working with the rest of the unit personnel. Using the \nwarehouse bay has also created a shortage in onbase storage. Members of \nthe 34th Aerial Port Squadron have been deployed to support our mission \nin Bosnia, and they will continue to be\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\ncalled upon to support other active duty and reserve units.\n  Funding for the aerial port training facility is not included in the \nlegislation before us today. It is my hope that the Department of \nDefense will recognize the importance of this project and will move it \nup 1 year to include it in the fiscal year 1999 budget, and I am \nworking to that end.\n  Mr. President, it is our job to make difficult choices. I am not \nwilling to support a bill that restores all of the projects which were \nline-item vetoed. Some of these projects were not 35 percent designed. \nSome of these projects did not meet the President's criteria. Some of \nthese projects did not need to be built this year.\n  If this legislation included just the project which met the \nPresident's criteria that would be a different story, but that is not \nthe bill before us today. Thus, Mr. President, I cannot support this \nlegislation and I urge my colleagues to uphold the President's line-\nitem veto.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago President Clinton \nvetoed 38 projects in the military construction appropriations bill. \nTwo of those projects were in Kentucky, one at Fort Knox and one at \nFort Campbell. These projects were included despite the fact that \nneither one fell within the administration's criteria for a veto.\n  That criteria included projects not requested in the budget, that \nwould not substantially improve the quality of life of military service \nmembers and their families, and that would not begin construction in \n1998 because the Department of Defense reported that no architectural \nand engineering design work had been done.\n  Both the qualification range at Fort Knox and the tactical equipment \nshop at Fort Campbell were requested in the Army's 5-year plan, both \nhave well over the necessary amount of design work completed, and both \ncould begin construction in 1998.\n  Over 50 percent of the design work is completed at Fort Knox and with \nfunding, construction would begin in 1998. This project replaces 10 \n1940 vintage multipurpose small arms training ranges which generate \nhigh costs for maintenance and use--into one modern multipurpose range. \nThis project was the number two construction priority for Fort Knox.\n  The Fort Campbell tactical equipment shop project is in the second \nphase of an effort to replace World War II era buildings. With 90 \npercent of the design work completed, construction can also begin as \nsoon as the money is made available.\n  Mr. President, the projects at Fort Campbell and Fort Knox were \nincluded in the appropriations bill because the Army considered them \npriorities. And while I am for getting rid of government waste as much \nas anyone else, these two projects clearly do not meet that criterion.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1292, the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Line Item Veto Disapproval bill.\n  I have long questioned the line-item veto in general terms. I am not \nconvinced of its merit and I am particularly concerned with the manner \nin which it was applied to the Military Construction Appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1998.\n  Like my colleagues I believe that wasteful spending must be cut. \nHowever, since the line item veto was exercised for the first time on \nthe Military Construction Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998, we \nhave learned that even the White House now recognizes that its own data \nand process for identifying ``wasteful'' items to be subjected to the \nline item veto were seriously flawed. Indeed, OMB Director Franklin \nRaines wrote in the official Statement of Administration Policy, ``. . \n.we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding for those \nprojects that were canceled as a result of the data provided by the \nDepartment of Defense that was out of date.'' Indeed, it is my \nunderstanding that the Administration is seeking ways to right these \nwrongs through other avenues. Moreover, I am perplexed by the theory \nthat only the Administration knows what deserves to be in the budget. \nInstead, I believe there is plenty of wisdom here in Congress as well \nas the White House to establish budget priorities based on rational \ncompromise and debate. Lastly, I would suggest to supporters of the \nline item veto that the real task of balancing the budget requires \nvotes like the one I cast in 1993 for deficit reduction, not line item \nvetoes.\n  There are also some who believe the line item veto is an innocuous \ndevice that could never be used for purely political purposes. However, \nthe people of Rhode Island know full well what giving the President the \nauthority to pick and choose specific budget items means. Rhode Island \nhas already experienced a Presidential effort to eliminate an essential \nprogram. In 1992, President Bush tried to rescind funding for the \nSeawolf submarine program which is vital to our nation's defense and \nthe livelihood of thousands of working Rhode Islanders. Fortunately, \nDemocrats were able to beat back the attempt to rescind funding for the \nSeawolf, but this experience led me to believe that a line item veto \nwould make future battles even more of a lopsided battle than a fair \nfight. In addition, a President, of any political party, could use the \nline item veto to eliminate other programs that are important to Rhode \nIsland without fear because a small state like mine only has four votes \nin Congress.\n  Mr. President, The line item veto is of untested constitutionality. \nWithout a Constitutional amendment, the line item veto act transferred \nsignificant power from the Legislative Branch to the Executive. I would \nhope that the Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the line \nitem veto in the near future so the Congress can act accordingly. In \nthe interim, I believe the two principle tests on the use of the line \nitem veto should be: One, is a particular line item veto politically \nmotivated? Two, is a particular line item veto the outcome of a \nrational and coherent analysis based on sound policy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after a great deal of communication and \ndiscussion working back and forth, I think we have come up with a fair \nagreement on how to handle the campaign finance reform issue that would \nallow us to go forward with other bills this year, and have a time \ncertain in which to proceed next year, and one that would allow for a \nfull discussion and votes.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nnotification of the Democratic leader, shall turn to the consideration \nof a bill regarding campaign finance reform to be offered by Senator \nLott, or his designee, on or before the close of business on Friday, \nMarch 6, 1998.\n  I further ask that Senator McCain be recognized to offer the first \namendment, in the nature of a substitute, that inserts the text of S. \n25, the McCain-Feingold bill, as modified by Senator McCain on \nSeptember 29, 1997. No further amendments would be in order to the \nMcCain amendment prior to a motion to table.\n  I further ask that if the amendment is not tabled the amendment and \nthe underlying bill will be open to further amendments, debates, and \nmotions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his efforts and for the leadership he has shown in keeping \neverybody at the table as long as he has in order for this to be \naccomplished.\n  Let me also thank Senators McCain and Feingold for their diligence in \nworking as long as they have to get us to this point.\n  Finally, let me thank Senator McConnell for his involvement and his \nparticipation in allowing us to reach this agreement.\n  As Democratic leader I can say with great enthusiasm that we are \npleased that we have now reached this point. I also feel the need to \nexpress my public gratitude to Senators in the Democratic caucus for \ntheir willingness to be united in demonstrating the importance of this \nissue.\n  This is not better necessarily for Democrats or Republicans. But in \nour view, this is a very big victory for the\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\ncountry. This will give us an opportunity to have a good debate as we \nhave discussed, and I look forward to that opportunity sometime prior \nto the first week in March.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, as a result of this agreement, I \npersonally will oppose any other effort to bring this issue up prior to \nthe time agreed to, because I believe we have necessary work to be \ndone, and I believe that it is in the interest in keeping with this \nagreement that we now turn to those other matters.\n  I expect a full-fledged debate with plenty of opportunity to offer \namendments. Given this agreement, now I have every assurance and \nconfidence that will happen.\n  So, again, Mr. President, let me reiterate my public gratitude to all \nthose involved for the successful agreement that we have announced this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader \nespecially in all of this. I consider myself a close and dear friend of \nthe majority leader. The majority leader has seen a lot more of me than \nhe wants to ever see me with such frequency ever again. I want to \nassure the majority leader that I am deeply appreciative of the time he \nhas spent with me, and the time he has spent with the entire Republican \nconference.\n  I don't think there has been a more difficult issue that the majority \nleader has had to handle, nor do I believe that he will face one as \ndifficult as this in the future.\n  I thank Senator Daschle, the Democrat leader, who I think has \napproached this issue in a fair fashion.\n  I think it is also only a entirely appropriate that I thank Senator \nMcConnell. The Senator has strongly held honest views on this issue. He \nhas again shown a willingness to debate and discuss this issue. Our \ndifferences have been passionate but they have not been personal, and I \nknow that he and I intend to maintain that relationship. I can assure \nmy colleagues that Senator McConnell will make strong arguments for his \nposition. And I certainly respect and in some ways admire his \nwillingness to stand forth on an issue which is somewhat difficult to \naddress.\n  Mr. President, I also believe the following: That we can and should \nand will sit down together on both sides of the aisle, proponents and \nopponents, with the recognition that this system needs to be fixed. On \nhow it needs to be fixed there are strong differences of opinion, but I \nthink almost every American now understands that we need to fix this \nsystem because we need to restore the confidence of the American people \nin the way that we select our elected officials.\n  I am convinced that the real answer, the real solution, will probably \nnot come in the form of debate or any cloture motions and all of that \non the floor of the Senate. I believe it is going to come when we all \nsit down as dedicated Americans and come up with a bipartisan solution \nto this problem. I still believe that is possible. I will do everything \nin my power working with both Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, Senator \nMcConnell, and my dear friend, Senator Feingold, who has done a \nwonderful job here, as I have said many times, so that we can get this \nagreement.\n  So I believe this is not an end. There isn't a midpoint. This is just \na beginning of a dialog that has to begin in all seriousness, and \ndiscussion and compromise which may be called for on both sides of this \nissue so we can do the will of the American people. I believe the will \nof the American people has been expressed convincingly that we need to \nfix the system.\n  I want to reiterate my openness to any suggestion or idea or proposal \nthat would lead us to that.\n  Again, thanks to the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am, of course, very pleased that this agreement has been reached.\n  I want to join in the gratitude toward the majority leader. Any \nmajority leader has a hard job on almost any issue. But this is about \nas tough as it gets. And I know this has been a very, very difficult \nperiod of negotiation.\n  I thank my leader, Senator Daschle. Without his persistence and \nwillingness to take on a tough job in our conference I don't think this \nwould have been possible either.\n  I want to join with Senator McCain in expressing my admiration for \nthe Senator from Kentucky as well, an extremely worthy adversary. I can \nhonestly say it is enjoyable to debate this issue with him. It will be \nespecially enjoyable to be debating specific amendments as we get into \nthis next year.\n  But overall, what this represents is what Senator McCain of Arizona \nand I have said from the beginning--that this can't possibly be done in \nthe end on a partisan basis. The answers have to be bipartisan. This \nagreement reflects that realization.\n  I want to join with Senator McCain in his statement about the desire \nto negotiate, the desire to put together something that the American \npeople feel would make a real difference in this area.\n  My last comment, Mr. President, it certainly would have been my \npreference to have a bill pass this year. I said, many times it is very \ndifficult to get this done in an election year, and that would be the \nconventional wisdom if we are in the middle of campaigns to try to \nlegislate on that. But I think maybe this next year might be an \nexception. With this system continuing to display itself, perhaps next \nMarch will be the ideal time to take a look at this system as it is \nunfolding in another election and ask ourselves if this is really the \nbest we could do in this country in terms of electing our officials.\n\n  So, again I thank all of the Senators involved in these difficult \nnegotiations. This appears to be a fair outcome, and we will have a \ncontinuation of this important debate next year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my special thanks to Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold, and Senator Daschle for allowing this debate to go \nforward in an orderly fashion.\n  As we all know here in the Senate, any Senator at any moment can kick \noff a debate on any subject. That, of course, gives each Senator a good \ndeal of power in determining what we debate. But what we have \nessentially agreed to here today is an orderly process by which the \nSenate can go on and engage in other business and have another debate \non another day on this very important issue which we have debated \nalmost yearly for the last decade. Let me say that I think this is a \nvery sensible way to do it.\n  Finally, I want to commend the distinguished majority leader. He has \nstood fast on principle over a difficult several-week period. The \nprinciple was that the majority leader should set the agenda for the \nSenate. I want to just say to my friend, the majority leader, that I \nhave never seen a better example of leadership than he has exhibited \nover the last few weeks.\n  Senator McCain said the majority leader saw a lot of Senator McCain. \nHe saw an equal amount of Senator McConnell over this period. And I \nthink he is probably ready to see less of both of us for a few weeks.\n  But in any event, in his position as leader, Senator Lott obviously \nwould like to see things go forward. On the other hand, there are from \ntime to time matters of great principle where it is important to stand \nup and take a position. I say to my friend, Senator Lott, that I can't \nthink of a better example in the 13 years I have been here of standing \nsteadfast for principle when it counted than the performance of the \ndistinguished majority leader over the last 3 weeks.\n  I thank him on behalf of all the members of our conference, the vast \nmajority of whom agree with the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to return to the \ndebate that was underway, so I will yield the floor at this time.\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11421-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11421-S11423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after a great deal of communication and \ndiscussion working back and forth, I think we have come up with a fair \nagreement on how to handle the campaign finance reform issue that would \nallow us to go forward with other bills this year, and have a time \ncertain in which to proceed next year, and one that would allow for a \nfull discussion and votes.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nnotification of the Democratic leader, shall turn to the consideration \nof a bill regarding campaign finance reform to be offered by Senator \nLott, or his designee, on or before the close of business on Friday, \nMarch 6, 1998.\n  I further ask that Senator McCain be recognized to offer the first \namendment, in the nature of a substitute, that inserts the text of S. \n25, the McCain-Feingold bill, as modified by Senator McCain on \nSeptember 29, 1997. No further amendments would be in order to the \nMcCain amendment prior to a motion to table.\n  I further ask that if the amendment is not tabled the amendment and \nthe underlying bill will be open to further amendments, debates, and \nmotions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his efforts and for the leadership he has shown in keeping \neverybody at the table as long as he has in order for this to be \naccomplished.\n  Let me also thank Senators McCain and Feingold for their diligence in \nworking as long as they have to get us to this point.\n  Finally, let me thank Senator McConnell for his involvement and his \nparticipation in allowing us to reach this agreement.\n  As Democratic leader I can say with great enthusiasm that we are \npleased that we have now reached this point. I also feel the need to \nexpress my public gratitude to Senators in the Democratic caucus for \ntheir willingness to be united in demonstrating the importance of this \nissue.\n  This is not better necessarily for Democrats or Republicans. But in \nour view, this is a very big victory for the\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\ncountry. This will give us an opportunity to have a good debate as we \nhave discussed, and I look forward to that opportunity sometime prior \nto the first week in March.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, as a result of this agreement, I \npersonally will oppose any other effort to bring this issue up prior to \nthe time agreed to, because I believe we have necessary work to be \ndone, and I believe that it is in the interest in keeping with this \nagreement that we now turn to those other matters.\n  I expect a full-fledged debate with plenty of opportunity to offer \namendments. Given this agreement, now I have every assurance and \nconfidence that will happen.\n  So, again, Mr. President, let me reiterate my public gratitude to all \nthose involved for the successful agreement that we have announced this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader \nespecially in all of this. I consider myself a close and dear friend of \nthe majority leader. The majority leader has seen a lot more of me than \nhe wants to ever see me with such frequency ever again. I want to \nassure the majority leader that I am deeply appreciative of the time he \nhas spent with me, and the time he has spent with the entire Republican \nconference.\n  I don't think there has been a more difficult issue that the majority \nleader has had to handle, nor do I believe that he will face one as \ndifficult as this in the future.\n  I thank Senator Daschle, the Democrat leader, who I think has \napproached this issue in a fair fashion.\n  I think it is also only a entirely appropriate that I thank Senator \nMcConnell. The Senator has strongly held honest views on this issue. He \nhas again shown a willingness to debate and discuss this issue. Our \ndifferences have been passionate but they have not been personal, and I \nknow that he and I intend to maintain that relationship. I can assure \nmy colleagues that Senator McConnell will make strong arguments for his \nposition.

Mr. President, we still have two more Senators who have \nindicated to us they wished to make statements on this particular \nissue, and we will give them a chance to get here. I warn Senators they \nshould come to the floor and make their statements now because we want \nto get to a vote on this issue. We have other business pending in the \nSenate that we would like to get to. But if those Senators can get to \nthe floor and make those statements, we will wait a few minutes on \nthem. If not, then I would choose, with the permission of the \nleadership, to move to third reading on this bill.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I rise today in support of S. 1292, a bill to \ndisapproved of President's Clinton decision to veto over 30 military \nconstruction projects.\n  I will add, Mr. President, I am a proponent of the line-item veto. I \nbelieve the line-item veto can be an effective tool to eliminate \nwasteful spending but I believe the fact that the White House now \nadmits it used faulty data when it decided to veto a number of military \nconstruction projects demonstrates that this important authority must \nbe used wisely and carefully.\n  I would like to speak for a moment about the two military \nconstruction projects the President vetoed in the State of Idaho. Both \nprojects were intended to support the combat requirements of the 366th \nComposite Wing based at Mountain Home Air Force Base.\n  A recent letter to me from Secretary of Defense Cohen described the \ncritical role played by the 366th Composite Wing: ``As one of the first \nunits to deploy to a problem area, it has the responsibility to \nneutralize enemy forces. It must maintain peak readiness to respond \nrapidly and effectively to diverse situations and conflicts.''\n  In an ironic twist of fate, the 366th was doing its mission on \ndeployment in the Persian Gulf when the President took inaccurate \ninformation, provided by the Air Force, and vetoed two projects \nintended to support the combat effectiveness of this unit.\n  President Clinton used his line-item veto pen to delete $9.2 million \nfor an avionics facility for the B-1 bombers and $3.7 million for a \nsquadron operations facility for an F-15 squadron.\n  In his veto statement, the President claimed the vetoed construction \nprojects could not be started in fiscal year 1998 because there was no \ndesign work on the proposed projects. This assertion has now been \nproven false by a letter from the Deputy Secretary of Defense, John \nHamre, which now acknowledges that the DOD provided inaccurate data \nabout the status of design work.\n  With respect to the two projects at Mountain Home Air Force Base, the \noutdated Air Force data provided to the White House listed both \nprojects at zero percent design when in fact, as now verified by Air \nForce, both projects are in fact over 35 percent designed. Moreover, \nbefore any of these projects could be included in the fiscal year 1998 \nDefense authorization bill, the services were required to certify that \neach of the projects could be initiated in fiscal year 1998 and that is \nwhat they did, without exception.\n  As my colleagues know, the Department of Defense puts together a \nfuture years defense plan which projects the DOD budget 6 years into \nthe future. Regarding the two projects at Mountain Home, I note that \nthe avionics facility is contained in the Air Force's 1999 budget and \nthe F-15 squadron operations facility is contained in the service's \n2000 budget.\n  As the President ponders the use of the line-item veto, I think there \nneeds to be dialog with the legislative branch. If there had been \ndialog, we might have been able to point out the faulty data being used \nby the White House that was provided by the U.S. Air Force.\n  Early this year Congress and the President reached an historic \nagreement to balance the budget and increase defense spending above the \nPresident's request. Congress went through its normal deliberative \nprocess and we used the additional defense dollars to move forward \nfunding for projects on the service's unfunded requirements lists. \nIndeed, the B-1 avionics facility was one of the top 10 unfunded \nmilitary construction projects identified by the Air Force. In \naddition, the funds were within the budget caps agreed to by the \nCongress and the President.\n  Let me read a document, prepared by the 366th Wing, which explains \nwhy we need the B-1 avionics facility. This was written by the civil \nengineer at the base avionics facility:\n\n       Current facility is inefficient, aging, wooden building \n     misconfigured for avionics functions. Numerous false alarms \n     in the fire suppression systems cause excessive avionics \n     support equipment down-time and often cause damage to test \n     equipment. This facility supports over $1 billion of avionics \n     equipment for the wing's fighter aircraft with $115 million \n     in testing equipment. Current avionics facility is \n     approximately one-half the size required for all the wing's \n     aircraft and has severe operational problems supporting \n     fighter aircraft of this wing. About 33,000 sq. ft. of the \n     existing 54,000 sq. ft. facility is condemned for personnel \n     usage. B-1 avionics is currently being maintained at \n     Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota due to inadequate facilities at \n     this base. Engineering estimates by the Army Corps of \n     Engineers found the current facility is uneconomical to \n     renovate. Construction of a new facility collocating avionics \n     for the B-1 and fighter aircraft is the most economical \n     solution and finalizes the B-1 beddown program.\n\n  The Office of Management and Budget and the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense acknowledge the President used outdated and inaccurate data to \nmake his decisions. The Senate should give the President another \nopportunity to do the right thing and pass the pending disapproval \nlegislation.\n  Let me thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd for their quick \nand decisive action to bring this important legislation to the Senate \nfloor. I urge my colleagues to support the pending legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I think the Senator from Idaho has brought up a good point \nmaking the case for his facility because I think we found this \nthroughout this whole message from the administration, that, again, \nthey don't give us the criteria before we finally pass the conference \nreport and send it down there. All at once, then the criteria change. I \nguess that should not surprise me. We ought to get used to dealing with \nfolks who have goalposts on wheels; they sort of change every now and \nagain.\n  I hope we could make it through this thing and the Members realize \nthat every project has been through the screens, two or three of them. \nThe ranking member on this subcommittee, the chairman, and the ranking \nmember of the full committee have set their satchel down, set certain \nstandards, and we tried to meet those standards.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho for his comments.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is just for a question.\n  Would the Senator from Montana agree with me that as we are provided \nthe data, although the idea was that these projects were not necessary, \nwere not needed, yet we find they are in the President's own budget for \nthe very next year or the year following that? And, since we have all \nof this data and we have established, through written information from \nthe Air Force, the inaccuracy of the data that they provided the White \nHouse, the President and the White House should not find themselves in \na situation where they feel they have drawn a line in the sand and \nthere is no way they can back away from this; that it is best for the \nNation and our national defense for the White House to acknowledge \nthat, based on inaccurate data, we all should review this and come to a \ndifferent conclusion, and that is to allow these projects to go \nforward?\n  Mr. BURNS. One advantage of the line-item veto right now is it \ndemands\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nof us a dialog with the people who have to administer the programs. \nThat is good. So I agree with the Senator's statement wholeheartedly, \nand I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, are we on a time limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 hours remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't want to cut some other Senator short, but \nclearly----\n  Mr. BURNS. How much of that 4 hours would you like, Senator?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not going to impinge on anybody with my remarks. I \nhave been in another hearing and for that reason I have been trying to \nget recognition as soon as I can, and I will be as brief as I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution of disapproval of the fiscal year 1998 military construction \nappropriations bill. In his special veto message, the President offered \nthe following three criteria for each of the canceled items: ``The \nproject is being canceled for because:\n  ``First, it was not requested in the President's fiscal year 1998 \nbudget; second, it would not substantially improve the quality of life \nof military service members and their families; and third, \narchitectural engineering and design of this project has not started, \nmaking it unlikely that these funds can be used for construction during \nfiscal year 1998.''\n  Mr. President, the Congress gave the President line-item veto \nauthority to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending. The Congress \nexamined all of these projects very carefully and found them to be \nmerit worthy and mission essential. In fact, the Appropriations \nCommittee used stringent criteria including:\n  First, whether the project was mission essential; second, whether the \nproject will enhance readiness, safety, or working conditions for \nservice personnel; third, whether a site has been identified for the \nproject; fourth, whether any money has been spent on the design or the \nproject; fifth, whether the Department can begin to execute the project \nduring fiscal year 1998; and, sixth, whether the project was included \nin the Department's future year defense plan.\n  Mr. President, these projects substantially meet the criteria \nestablished by the Appropriations Committee. Moreover, the \nAppropriations Committee worked closely with the military services in \ncrafting its bill. In contrast, it is widely known that the President \nneglected to consult the military services in deciding which projects \nshould be vetoed on this bill.\n  First, I want to make clear that if the President thinks that the \nonly good project is one that he recommends, then he will continue to \nmeet strong opposition in the Congress. I remind the President that \narticle I, section 8, of the Constitution gives the Congress the right \nto raise and support armies. That means that if the Congress believes \nthat a particular project will support the needs and requirements of \nthe military that is not only their right, but their responsibility, to \ndo so.\n  I am heartened by the fact that the President has used his line-item \nveto pen more sparingly on the various appropriations bills that have \nbeen sent to him since this military construction bill. However, Mr. \nPresident, let's be clear about his action on this particular bill. I \nbelieve it was an abuse of his authority for three reasons. First, \nvetoing these projects will not eliminate unnecessary or wasteful \nspending. Second, it is clear that none of the spending in this bill \nviolates the budget agreement. Finally, using the President's own \ncriteria, it is clear that the President made several errors.\n  On October 6, 1997, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nconducted a hearing to review the status of the 38 vetoed projects. \nThroughout the hearing, Senators asked the witnesses whether particular \nvetoed projects met the criteria as set out by the President. Most \nquestions centered on the issue of whether each project could be \nexecuted in fiscal year 1998 and if that project were mission \nessential. In every case, Mr. President, the answers were affirmative.\n  Among the items the President vetoed were two New Mexico projects. \nThe first project was $14 million for the construction of a new \nbuilding for the theater air command control and simulation facility \n[TACCSF] at Kirtland Air Force Base [KAFB]. This project is in the \nDepartment's fiscal year 2002 budget. It is mission essential; 35 \npercent of the design has been completed with $1.4 million the Congress \nappropriated last year for this purpose. A site has been chosen for the \nproject, and it is executable this year. Clearly, Mr. President, the \nPresident made a serious error in vetoing this project.\n  The TACCSF is the only facility where fighter crews, command control \npersonnel, and air defense teams operate together in a realistic \nvirtual war fighting environment. TACCSF allows Air Force war fighters \nto train with Army and Marine personnel under one roof, often their \nonly opportunity to rehearse shoot-don't shoot procedures in a complex \nfriend or foe environment.\n  Expanding TACCSF's simulation capabilities will support cost-\neffective development of Air Force systems. TACCSF has flexible \nsimulation architecture that allows new concepts, components, or \nprocedures to be tested in a virtual environment, giving hands-on \nexperience years prior to first prototype--user feedback during early \ndesign results in enormous development cost savings.\n  TACCSF's present building does not allow for any expansion. A new \nfacility is needed to meet growth needs. It is impossible to expand the \ncurrent facility sufficiently to accommodate the simulators, supporting \ninfrastructure and personnel growth needed to maintain TACCSF's \npreeminent capabilities. Failure to provide the requested new facility \nseriously jeopardizes TACCSF's ability to support DOD and the Air \nForce's vision for modeling and simulation in support of the war \nfighter.\n  The second project the President vetoed was $6.9 million for the \nlaunch complex revitalization program at White Sands missile range. \nOnce again, using the President's own criteria, he made a serious \nerror. This project will substantially improve the quality of life of \nmilitary service members, 10 percent of the design has been completed, \nand the project is executable in fiscal year 1998. The project is \nmission essential and there is no question that it will enhance safety.\n  Four launch complexes at WSMR are suffering from deterioration in \ncrumbling structures, failing facility components and below-par \nsanitary and sewage systems. Many of the complex facilities do not meet \ncurrent safety laws and regulations. Adequate fire detection and \nsuppression systems do not exist in the buildings and explosive \nhandling areas. WSMR spokesmen have stated, ``This totally involves a \nsafety issue. There's quite a bit of activity that is conducted at \nthese launch complexes. It is a potential breeding ground for \nhantavirus if infrastructure improvements to these areas is not made.'' \nMoreover, Mr. President, the commanding general of WSMR stated in a \nletter to the delegation members that he was very concerned about the \nsafety of his people who worked in these facilities.\n  Mr. President, the President made serious errors on both these \nprojects. All of them are mission essential and can be executed in \nfiscal year 1998. The Presidents' arbitrary and unfair exercise of his \npower demands the Congress' action. I applaud the chairman and ranking \nmember for acting timely on this matter. I strongly support it, and \nhope my colleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter dated April 18, 1997, from General \nLaws, Brigadier General, U.S. Army, Commanding General at White Sands \nmissile range, to House of Representatives Member from New Mexico, the \nHon. Joe Skeen. I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                                  August 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Joe R. Skeen,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Skeen: This information is provided in response to \n     your question on the health and safety matters at launch \n     facilities at White Sands Missile Range. As you are aware \n     from your recent visit to White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), \n     extensive parts of our infrastructure, particularly the vital \n     launch complexes, are in disrepair or an unserviceable. Many \n     of these conditions entail critical safety and environmental \n     problems that earnestly must be addressed as soon as \n     possible.\n       Recently, we were required to disconnect the water supply \n     that feeds a fire suppression system at a major missile \n     assembly building due to uncontrollable and excessive \n     plumbing leaks. We have many buildings at these launch \n     complexes with inoperable heating and cooling systems. We \n     also have septic systems that have or are failing, and will \n     have to be deactivated due to environmental reasons. The \n     resource reductions of the last several years have \n     exacerbated the already significant backlog of maintenance \n     and repair to the aging infrastructure of WSMR.\n       Aside from the increasing difficulties for our personnel to \n     accomplish the critical test and evaluation mission for major \n     programs of all the services in DOD, I am very concerned for \n     their safety and health from working in such conditions. I \n     deeply appreciate your consideration of these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Terry L. Laws,\n\n                                                Brigadier General,\n                                    U.S. Army, Commanding General.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, now I would like to talk to my fellow \nSenators. In particular I would like to talk to the Republicans on this \nside of the aisle. I say that because I hear some of them asking \nquestions about why were we for line-item veto and how can we justify \nvoting to override the President. If it fits some Senators' concerns on \nthe other side, fine.\n  Let me just say, fellow Republicans, we took the lead, once we got \ncontrol of the House and Senate, to pass this new law called line-item \nveto. I want to make sure everybody understands that we could not have \nintended to say that we would never override a President's line-item \nveto. Obviously, when we passed that, inherent in our passage of that \nmeasure was the fact that Congress still had to have some significant \nsay about the propriety, the validity, the appropriateness of line-item \nvetoes. If it means, if we supported the original line-item veto \nlegislation, whatever the President chooses to do under line-item veto, \nsince we voted for that law we have to concede the President's \nauthority, then I don't think any on this side of the aisle would raise \ntheir hands and say that is what they voted for line-item veto to mean. \nI can assure you I did not.\n  As a matter of fact, I would submit that it is quite right for the \nSenate of the United States to stand on its two feet and say to the \nPresident: You have line-item veto authority but it does not mean you \ncan exercise it any old way you want. The sooner we send that signal to \nthis President--either a Republican President or this one--the sooner \nyou send the signal that there are certain circumstances under which, \nby virtue of our authority, that we would say ``no'' to a President, \nthe better the President will respect the propriety of the notion that \nwe are equal under the Constitution and that the President didn't gain \nsuperiority over appropriations when we passed the line-item veto \nlegislation.\n  So it is almost as if we have a gift of the right situation to send \nthat signal to the President, because in this case there is no doubt of \nthe following set of circumstances.\n  No. 1, it is now acknowledged by the White House that many of the \nline-item vetoes, if not all, were issued and done by the President in \nerror. Nobody will come to this floor and deny that. The problem is, \nthey won't tell us how many are in error. We have concluded that almost \nevery one that is on this list, in this bill of override, is in error, \nif we believed the statements by the White House as to why the line-\nitem veto was used in the first place. We went through each one. We put \nthe financial management officers for the three armed services in front \nof the Appropriations Committee and asked them the questions that \nrelated, not to something we dreamt up, but something the White House \ntold us were the criteria.\n  Mr. President, they were simple criteria: Is project in the 1998 \nbudget request, or did we just dream it up? Question No. 1. Second, has \nthe engineering and design has started? And tied into that one is that \nthe project contracts could be issued in 1998, the year of this \nappropriation. And the third one, that it was something that would \nimprove the quality of life of military men and women and their \nfamilies?\n  Frankly, we asked the questions of the military financial officers. \nIn almost every one of these 38 projects, they said they were in the \nDefense Department 5-year plan, or they did do substantial improvement \nto quality of life, to family life, or third, design had been started \nand the project could commence during the appropriation year of 1998.\n  When the White House then says, well, it may be that we in the White \nHouse made mistakes; that 18 of these vetoed projects don't fit our own \ncriteria; it may be that 16 didn't fit our criteria--in any event, we \nare not going to tell you exactly which ones. I say to the Senators who \nare wondering whether they should vote for this, that is enough to vote \nfor the override. If you ever want to change the power structure, then \nlet a President get by with that. He line-item vetoes and then he says, \n``I made a mistake, but I am sticking with them and I am not going to \ntell you which ones I made a mistake on.'' If you can't discern that, \nthen it seems to me you have to send it back to him with a great big \nvote in the Senate and the House saying, ``Since you won't tell us, we \nare giving them all back to you. And if you send them back, we are \ngoing to adopt them in law and override your veto, because you haven't \nsquared with us.''\n\n  I can think of some other reasons. Each Senator who voted for the \nline-item veto and who is worried about whether he can now vote to \noverride, I ask just a simple question. Did you really mean you would \nnever override? Of course you would say no. If you meant you might \noverride sometimes, what is a more perfect case than this? You have two \nreasons: The projects are bona fide projects that meet any reasonable \ncriteria; and the President will not tell us which ones are incorrectly \nvetoes, although he says there are some, that don't fit the criteria.\n  I know there are some former Governors in the Senate who are going to \nspeak to line-item veto. I don't know which way they are coming down on \nthis. But I take it from many Governors that they never had such a \nlarge argument over line-item veto in many years of being Governors; \nthat all of a sudden you get 38 projects out of one bill, $287 million, \nand they don't know why it was done or why others were left in.\n  So, from our standpoint, this is the appropriate time to send a \nsignal that line-item veto is not a one-way street; that Congress has a \nrole. If it is not used reasonably and rationally as a policy \ninstrument, then it will be overridden, and I hope we do that. I hope \nit is a very big bipartisan vote, because I think it is apt to be the \nsame in the U.S. House of Representatives. We will start this process \noff on the right track.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that a table from the \nCongressional Budget Office comparing the pending bill to the \nPresident's original line-item veto message be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\n\n  EFFECT OF S. 1292, DISAPPROVING CANCELLATIONS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT ON OCTOBER 6, 1997, REGARDING P.L. 105-45\n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                          Outlays\n                                                                 Budget  ---------------------------------------\n                                                               Authority   1998    1999    2000    2001    2002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal CBO estimate of cancellations made by the President to        287       28     102      79      46      16\n P.L. 105-45.................................................\nProjects not disapproved in S. 1292, as reported in the\n Senate\n  Military Construction, Navy\n    Chemical-Biological Warfare Detection Center, Crane Naval         4        8       2       1       1   (\\1\\)\n     Surface Warfare Center, IN (97-15)......................\n  Military Construction, Air Force Reserve\n    Base Civil Engineer Complex, Grissom Air Reserve Base, IN         9        1       4       2       1       1\n     (97-16).................................................\n    Aerial Port Training Facility, Mitchell Air Reserve               4        1       2       1       1   (\\1\\)\n     Station, WI (97-41).....................................\n                                                              --------------------------------------------------\n        Total, Military Construction, Air Force Reserve......        13        2       6       3       2       1\n  Military Construction, Army National Guard\n    Aviation Support Facility, Rapid City, SD (97-31)........         5    (\\1\\)       1       2       1   (\\1\\)\n                                                              --------------------------------------------------\n        Total projects not disapproved in S. 1292, as                22       10       9       6       4       1\n         reported in the Senate..............................\nDifference between S. 1292 and the President's cancellations.       264       18      93      72      42      15\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.

Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am here to speak on two of the specific projects \nthat are covered by this veto and now the proposal to override that \nveto, and then, second, I will make some remarks based on my own \npersonal experience as to how the relationships between the legislative \nand the executive branches should function when the Executive has the \nline-item veto.\n  First, let me turn to two projects with which I have extensive \nfamiliarity.\n  First, a pier improvement project at the Mayport Naval Station near \nJacksonville, FL. Mayport has been designated by the Navy to be the \nsecond Atlantic coast major naval facility, the first being Norfolk. In \norder to carry out this role, it has been determined by the Navy that \nit is necessary to make certain improvements to the piers that serve \nMayport Naval Station. The improvements were included in the 5-year \nNavy plan.\n  The Navy made another decision, and that was to utilize a design-\nbuild process as the means for constructing these pier improvements. In \ncontrast to a traditional procedure in which a project is fully \ndesigned and then contractors bid on those completed designs, design-\nbuild merges the creative and the execution stages which one firm is \nresponsible for submitting a bid to both design a project that will \nmeet the needs of the client, in this case the Navy, and then to \nconstruct that project. It also has the benefits that the project can \nbe segmented, so that if there are portions of the project that can \nproceed ahead on a more rapid pace because they are less complex or \nhave less design requirements, they can be doing so.\n  The result of this design-build process for the Navy has been both a \nsignificant savings in time and cost.\n  A recent study by the Design-Build Institute of America states that \nover the last 4 years, naval facilities utilizing this design-build \nprocess have led to a timesaving of 15 percent over the conventional \nmethod of first design, then bid, then build, and a cost savings of 12 \npercent. That design-build process was determined to be appropriate to \nthis pier improvement at Mayport.\n  The significance of that, Mr. President, is that it runs in conflict \nwith one of the criteria that the President used in determining which \nprojects to veto, because one of those criteria was, was this project \none which had been designed and, therefore, construction could commence \nin this fiscal year? In the case of a design-build project, you don't \nhave a separate sequence of design. The design and the construction \nproject are issued as one.\n  In the case of Mayport, the Navy expectation is that they will issue \ntheir design-build contract in March of 1998. At this point, some of \nthe real benefits of design-build begin to take effect. As an example, \nthe toe wall of these particular piers will use a similar design to the \ntoe wall of piers that are immediately adjacent, and, therefore, the \nexpectation is that they will use the same designs which have already \nbeen done, therefore allowing the construction work on the toe wall to \ncommence in June of 1998.\n  Another important component of this pier improvement is to add a new \nelectrical circuit so that the ships which have higher electrical \ndemand today, because of all of their computerization and other \nelectronics, will be adequately served. This electrical work represents \na fifth circuit to the already existing four circuits. And so, again, \nno significant new design work will be required. It is expected that \nthe electrical construction work will also commence in June of 1998.\n  So the facts of this case are that, if the purpose of that standard, \nwhich was, is the design complete so construction can start? has been \nmet, the only difference is because this is a design-build contract as \nopposed to a traditional contract, you can't answer the question, is \nthere a completed set of designs here ready to be bid upon? It is \nironic that the design-build process was specifically recognized and \napplauded in the reinvention-of-Government study that was done in 1993 \nas the wave of the future as to how the Federal Government should go \nabout much of its construction activity.\n  So, Mr. President, with that background on Mayport, I believe this \nclearly is one of those projects where the facts do not substantiate \nthe reasoning that was given as the basis of the veto. We have an \nimportant project meeting a clear national defense need which the Navy \nhas stated should be completed within the 5-year plan. The Navy has \nselected a design-build process which will result in construction \ncommencing on important elements of this pier improvement in June of \n1998.\n  The second item which is of concern to me relates to Whiting Field, a \nmajor Navy aviation training center in Santa Rosa County, FL. Whiting \nField is the centerpiece of actually a series of fields of runways and \nother training facilities that are located throughout northwest Florida \nand south Alabama.\n  The Air Force and the Navy have decided on an eminently reasonable \nnew joint project, and that is, that rather than having the basic \ntraining of naval aviators being done exclusively by the Navy and Air \nForce aviators being done exclusively by the Air Force, that they will \ndevelop joint training at the primary and advanced levels. Whiting \nField has been designated as the field upon which approximately half of \nthe primary training for both Air Force and Navy pilots will occur.\n  A new aircraft has been selected, called JPATS, which will serve the \nneeds of both the Navy and the Air Force. This new aircraft has some \ndifferent requirements than the aircraft which the Navy has used for \nmany years at Whiting Field. One of those is a slightly longer runway \nfor safety purposes. It is a somewhat higher performance aircraft.\n  In this legislation was $1.2 million to add to the length of one of \nthe outlying fields which serves Whiting, which happens to be located \nin Brewton, AL. Also, as part of this $1.2 million, will be a safety \nzone built around one of these runways in order to enhance the safety \nfor aviators with this new higher performance JPATS aircraft. Again, \nthis is in the Navy's 5-year plan. The JPATS aircraft are going to be \ndelivered in the year 2000.\n  The work to be done is not high-tech, it is the extension of an \nexisting runway, and, therefore, the development of complicated designs \nis not relevant to the project to be performed. Therefore,\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\nagain, the rationale for the veto, which was that unless design had \nbeen conducted, assumedly construction could not start in the fiscal \nyear and, therefore, the project became a candidate and, in fact, a \nvictim of the President's veto.\n  Just as the project at Mayport, this meets all the tests. In this \ncase, the Navy and the Air Force have agreed that this is a needed \nproject to secure an important new joint relationship between our two \nprincipal aviation services which will result in significant savings to \nthe Nation and, hopefully, enhancements in the quality of training and \nthe jointness of training of the Air Force and the Navy.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Whiting Field in August of this year, \nand I can state from personal experience and discussions with the \nleadership of this important naval facility that there is great \ncommitment to seeing that this joint training is a success and a \ncontribution to the Nation's security. All this is going to have a key \ndate of the year 2000 when the new aircraft begin to be delivered.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge that these and the other projects that are \ncontained in the legislation to override the President's veto be \nsupported, because I believe they are the kind of projects which the \nNation will need for its long-term national security. I commend the \nleadership of the Appropriations Committee and the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee for their careful attention to these two \nprojects.\n  If I can take a brief period to comment about the line-item veto \nprocess. I was Governor of the State of Florida for 8 years with the \nline-item veto authority, and I utilized that authority where I thought \nappropriate. I believe that the most significant use of the line-item \nveto is in its deterrence effect. The fact that legislators who might \nbe inclined to submit and seek passage of a project that did not have \nthe positive qualities of Mayport and Whiting Field would be inclined \nto do so but for the fact that they knew the Executive could identify \nthem as being inappropriate and, therefore, subject that sponsoring \nlegislator to the public scrutiny of having advanced such a proposal.\n  But I believe for that deterrence to be effective, there are some \nrequirements on the side of the executive branch which were not met in \nthis first test of the line-item veto at the Federal level.\n  Two of those requirements are, first, no surprises. Neither of these \nprojects are new to the Navy, to the Air Force, to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, to the White House. These projects represent the \ncompletion of important previously determined military priorities: \nMayport as the second naval port on the Atlantic coast; joint training \nof Air Force and naval aviators.\n  Therefore, as these two projects moved through the appropriations \nprocess, there were plenty of opportunities, if it was felt that they \nwere going to be subject to veto, to have sent up such a signal. No \nsuch signal was sent.\n  The assumption was, since they had the support of the Department of \nDefense, and they were within the 5-year plan, that they were projects \nthat had a time urgency, that they were appropriate.\n  In the future, I would urge whoever is the Executive authority to be \nengaged in this process at a much earlier stage to indicate if there \nare some problems and what the nature of those concerns will be. As the \nchairman has indicated, apparently even he did not know what the \ncriteria were to be for these projects until after the Congress had \npassed the final bill and sent it to the White House for its \nconsideration.\n  And the second is that after the bill has gone to the White House, \nand they are looking at these items, if they see an item that they \nbelieve is a candidate for veto, they owe it to themselves, they owe it \nto the sponsoring individuals and agencies, and they owe it to the \nnational objectives which are sought to be achieved to have a frank \ndiscussion with the parties who are most knowledgeable so that they can \nget the facts.\n  I made an effort on both of these projects to educate who I thought \nwere the appropriate people. Obviously, my attempt at education was not \nsuccessful. But I am confident that had there been a full opportunity \nto review the facts that I have briefly submitted here this afternoon, \nthat the White House would have made a different decision relative to \nthese two projects.\n  So I think, second, that the White House needs to have the practice \nto bring into the process before the final decision those who are most \nknowledgeable so that never again will it have to issue statements \nthat: ``I'm sorry I did this. And I did it out of ignorance.'' \nIgnorance declared is a sign of a person who is ready to enter into \nconfession and redemption, but this process is too important to have \nvery many confessions and redemptions. We ought to try to be operating \nbased on facts and knowledge and the importance to the national \nsecurity of these significant defense items.\n  So, Mr. President, with those comments on these two specific \nprojects, and a little unsolicited advice to the White House, I urge a \nstrong Senate vote in favor of this proposal.\n  I hope that our colleagues in the House will follow suit and the \nPresident will see the wisdom of the line-item veto process in its full \nextension of a dynamic relationship between two equal branches of the \nU.S. Government. Thank you.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have one other scheduled speaker after \nSenator Graham, and then Senator Byrd has requested some time. But I \nask unanimous consent that the vote on S. 1292 take place at 4:30 this \nafternoon, and reserving 10 minutes for the ranking member of the full \ncommittee and recognizing Senator Bumpers as the next speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Who controls the \ntime on this side?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe I am in control of time, am I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, we are here today debating this issue which was a \npolitical creation in the beginning. It was a terrible idea and in my \nopinion, plainly unconstitutional. Ronald Reagan was President. He had \npromised the American people he would balance the budget by 1984 after \nhe was sworn in in 1981. And in 1984 we did not have a balanced budget. \nOn the contrary, deficits were soaring wildly out of control.\n  And then we begin to hear and read where the President said, ``Well, \nyou can't blame me because, you know, I can't spend a penny that \nCongress doesn't appropriate.'' And I am not going to belabor that \nargument, but the next thing we heard was, ``If only the President \ncould pick out all those pork projects and veto them, these deficits \nwouldn't be soaring out of control.''\n  First of all, if the President had full line-item veto authority at \nthe time, according to most calculations, the amount of dollar savings \nas a result of those vetoes would have been infinitesimal in comparison \nto that staggering deficit. All that line item veto talk was nothing \nbut a sheer diversionary tactic in the face of a promise that had not \nbeen kept.\n  And I do not mean to denigrate President Reagan. But that rhetoric \nwas the genesis of a very bad idea and in my opinion a patently \nunconstitutional idea.\n  I am almost bitter, Mr. President, at the passage of this line item \nveto. The worst thing that can happen to a politician is to allow \nhimself to become cynical or bitter, so I will say that I am elated. I \nam elated that this day has come.\n  A lot of the people in this body stood and made magnificent speeches \nabout how wonderful the line-item veto would be. They declared that 80 \npercent of the American people favored the line-item veto. I understand \nthat; I took a lot of political heat, along with a lot of people on \nthis side of the aisle who stood up against the line item veto. Senator \nHatfield, who is no longer in the Senate, stood up against\n\n[[Page S11428]]\n\nit, along with a few people on that side of the aisle. We all took \nunbelievable political heat back home because it was wildly popular. \nThe people had been led to believe, and they did in fact believe that \nthe real problem with the spending habits of Congress was that the \nPresident did not have the line-item veto. So I don't know how many \ntimes the line item veto proposal was presented in this body, but I \npromise you I voted no, no, no every time.\n  So I am elated today because a lot of the people who got a lot of \npolitical benefit out of their support for the line item veto are now \ncomplaining. They are not saying that it was a mistake to pass it in \nthe first place. No, they say that the trouble is that the President \nhas abused the authority. Regardless of whether the President has \nproperly vetoed these items before us today, I am not surprised at \ntheir protests. This is precisely what we told them they could expect \nif they passed the line-item veto. It is a bad idea, and plainly \nunconstitutional in the way it transfers the power of the purse to the \nPresident.\n  I heard Senator Graham from Florida about his use of the line-item \nveto when he was Governor of Florida. I had the line-item veto when I \nwas Governor of Arkansas--and I used it. You know how I used it? I \nwould call a legislator down to my office and say, ``You just voted \nagainst that administration bill, and you have a $250,000 appropriation \ncoming for a big project in your district. And I can tell you, that \nsucker's toast unless you get down there and change your vote.'' That \nis what I did.\n  One of the arguments we made here was that the President could cow \nvirtually any Member of the U.S. Senate with a line-item veto. I do not \nthink President Clinton intended to insult Members of this body when he \nvetoed these 34 items, but it was a terrible political mistake.\n  Any time you veto bills that affect more than 25 States, you are in \ntrouble. I do not think the President was really thinking about that. \nIncidentally, he followed me as Governor of Arkansas. And he used the \nline-item veto pretty extensively when he was Governor. But one of the \nmain reasons I object to it is that it gives the President unbelievable \npower over the Members of this body. And I can tell you, the Framers of \nthe Constitution never intended for a President to have that kind of \npower. That is the reason they said: The Congress will pass the laws, \nand present them to the President, not item by item, but bill by bill.\n\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say I hope some of my \ncolleagues will take this to heart and not trivialize the Constitution. \nIt is almost contemptuous the way we treat our Constitution sometimes. \nI have voted for one constitutional amendment since I came to the U.S. \nSenate. That was the Equal Rights Amendment. I am sorry I voted for \nthat, because it is not necessary. I have voted ``no'' 37 times on \nconstitutional amendments, and ``yes'' once, and I regret that one. \nThat is not to say I will never vote for a constitutional amendment, \nobviously. I reserve judgment on that.\n  But the thing that chagrins me more than anything else is that every \ntime somebody comes up with a cute political idea, they want to put it \nin the Constitution. And I have taken heat on prayer in school and the \nbalanced budget amendment and flag burning and term limits, and court-\nstripping proposals. I have taken my share of heat on all those things, \nalmost every one of which undeniably was political.\n  So, as I say, if some of my colleagues--if as many as one colleague \ntoday is thinking, ``I regret having voted for this thing. I regret \nhaving voted for something that in my heart I knew was \nunconstitutional,'' I hope those members will think hard about this \nvote. Let me close, Mr. President, by saying that I am going to vote to \nuphold the President's veto. That may sound a little bit perverse, I \nsuppose, based on what I have been saying. I do not know all the merits \nof these 34 items. That probably does not speak well for me, but I can \ntell you one thing, if one of them affected Arkansas, I would be voting \nto override it. And this entire package of line item vetoes is going to \nbe overwhelmingly overridden by this body. There may not be five votes \nto uphold the President.\n  But I will vote to uphold the veto and I will tell you precisely why. \nI want to make it so painful to support the line item veto that when we \ncome to our senses and the legislation comes up to repeal the line-item \nveto, that it will be passed 100 to nothing. So the more pain we \ninflict, the more likely that is to occur.\n  Ultimately, I think the line item veto will be repealed. I think that \nif Senator Byrd could bring up his line-item veto repeal today, I would \nlike to believe it would pass almost 100 to zip. It was a terrible \nidea. And the time has come when the Senate should think better of it.\n  I look forward to getting a piece of legislation up here even before \nthe Supreme Court strikes it down. I personally believe the Supreme \nCourt has very little alternative but to declare this thing \nunconstitutional when it is presented to them by somebody with \nstanding.\n  So, Mr. President, this is really a happy day for me, now that the \nSenate is addressing this item.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Robb] 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  And I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for \nyielding me time because he knows, as I have already alerted him to the \nfact, that I am going to speak against the position that he has taken \nfor so long and with such eloquence.\n  And as the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas departs, let me \nsay, I agree with almost everything he said, save one small part of the \nspeech that he just made. And I have joined him in voting against most \nof those other amendments.\n  But I rise today to oppose S. 1292 because I believe the credibility \nof the Senate is on the line.\n  Just last year, 69 U.S. Senators voted to give the President line-\nitem veto authority. As a former chief executive who had the line-item \nveto authority, as indeed most Governors have that authority, I \nsupported that decision. I did not use it in the way the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas used it, but I had the authority. And I support it \nbecause I believe that only the President has the singular ability to \nreconcile the competing spending interests of all 535 Members of \nCongress and make decisions that will be based on our national \ninterests.\n  Today, unfortunately, we stand ready to emasculate completely the \nline-item veto authority.\n  I realize that many distinguished Members of this body, some of whom \nhave been heard today, many of whom have been heard from on previous \noccasions, oppose the line-item veto, and have consistently opposed the \nline-item veto, and indeed believe it is unconstitutional.\n  I would concede that it is quite possible that the Supreme Court will \ndeclare it unconstitutional when they consider it on the merits in a \nsuit brought by plaintiffs who have standing to do so. But let's not \npass a bill disapproving the President's veto of nearly every single \nproject he lined out in the military construction appropriations bill.\n  What credibility can supporters of the line-item veto have if, in the \nfirst appropriations bill out of the gate, we vote to disapprove the \nPresident's action simply because one of our projects is on the list?\n  Mr. President, I don't diminish the political difficulty this \nlegislation poses for Members who have projects on this list. I have \nthree projects on the cancellation list that are in my home State of \nVirginia. Since I believe these projects have merit, I will work to \nfund them in future bills. While I do believe strongly that we need to \ndevelop some objective criteria for the President to follow when making \nveto decisions, I never thought that the implementation of the line-\nitem veto would be popular with either the President or Congress.\n  What I find objectionable about this legislation is that we didn't \neven try to determine the merits of the President's cancellations \nexcept for individual Members within their individual States. Instead, \nto maximize political\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\nsupport, we gave, in effect, every Senator line-item veto authority in \nreverse--allowing each Member to decide whether appropriations for his \nor her own projects would be restored. The result is that funding for \n34 of the 38 projects vetoed by the President are included in this \nbill.\n  Is that what line-item veto supporters had in mind last year? It is \ncertainly not what I had in mind, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, quite simply, this legislation is a test of our \nresolve to stick by our decision to impose a measure of fiscal \ndiscipline on the appropriations process. We gave the President the \nauthority. We expected him to use it. Even those who opposed the \nlegislation expected him to use it. And he did. I am simply not \nprepared to say that all of the President's actions were totally \nwithout justification.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this disapproval \nbill. Passage of this bill will increase the deficit and set a \ndangerous precedent that I believe will lead to the emasculation of the \nline-item veto. But most importantly, Mr. President, passage of this \nbill would illustrate once again our own failure to make the tough \nchoices, our own failure to be fiscally responsible.\n  Mr. President, I am under no illusions about what is going to happen \nin this particular case. But I hope before Senators cast their votes, \nthey will think about what it was they thought they were doing when \nthey voted for the line-item veto last year and vote in accordance with \nthe convictions they had last year when they vote on this bill this \nyear.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, with particular thanks \nto the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who knew I was \ngoing to speak against the legislation, which I know he has so \neloquently opposed for so very long.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the position of the Senator from Virginia, \nbut I would like him to consider this: We had $800 million allocated to \nthe military construction budget out of the budget agreement that was \nentered into with the President. That still left us $700 million below \nthe 1997 level. The action of the President in vetoing 38 projects here \nhas removed $287 million from that.\n  If this bill does not pass, that money is gone. But not only is it \ngone, the President has announced the 18 he made a mistake on he will \nfund by reprogramming over other money. So the net result of the \nPresident's veto is an excess of $450 million that is lost from the \ndefense budget this year.\n  Now, it was a mistake. This was not a line-item veto that made sense. \nIt was a sheer mistake. They will not tell us which projects, by the \nway, he made a mistake on. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia knows \nthat?\n  The net result of not passing this bill will be that almost half a \nbillion of the money that we got through the negotiations with the \nPresident to increase the defense budget will be gone forever, \nincluding quality-of-life projects, barracks, mess halls, housing. I \nask the Senator, how can you justify voting for this if you are in \nfavor of the line-item veto?\n  I was the chairman of the Senate conference on the line-item veto. I \nknow the requirements of the line-item veto law. The President did not \nfollow it. He did not establish criteria. He announced the criteria \nafter--after--after the decision was made.\n  In the case of Virginia, as the Senator pointed out, the criteria \ndidn't fit the Virginia projects. That was true on 36 of the 38 \nprojects. Those 36 are in this bill.\n  Now, I say to my friend from Virginia, bad facts make bad law. If \nthis bill doesn't pass, I guarantee the Senator from Virginia, this \ncase will be taken to the courts, and if it is taken to the courts, \nthis will be the vehicle that will lead to the destruction of the line-\nitem veto.\n  We are coming at it from different directions, the Senator from \nVirginia and I. I still believe in the line-item veto, but if the \nPresident's veto is not overridden, I will join the Senator from West \nVirginia in seeking to repeal the line-item veto, because this is \nwrong. This is arrogance, an abuse of power, and it is an overwhelming \nmistake on the part of the executive branch.\n\n  I thank the Senator for listening to me. If the Senator from Virginia \nwishes to have time to respond, I yield from our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to respond very \nbriefly to my friend and colleague and the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Alaska, for whom I have enormous respect.\n  I suggest two things: No. 1, that I share the concern about the \nimperfect process that was followed in this particular instance. I have \nshared my concerns directly with the White House, and I hope we will \nnot have a repeat of the lack of prior consultation, et cetera. So I am \nnot in disagreement with that particular aspect.\n  But the matter of how many dollars are actually involved is not the \nissue, as far as I'm concerned. It is the principle. If we believe that \nthe President ought to have this particular authority because we \nbelieve only a President can reconcile all of the disparate interests \nof 535 Members of Congress who may have an interest in a project that \nmay not have true national interest, then we have given him the \nauthority to veto that particular item, and given us an opportunity to \noverride it.\n  If this particular legislation were designed to collect only those \nabout which there was agreement or only those individual projects which \nwe could consider on their merit, I might well support the \ndistinguished Senator's bill.\n  My objection with this legislation is that we have, in effect, taken \nevery single request by any Senator who asked to have one of the items \nthat was vetoed included in this bill and said, ``We are going to, in \none single bill, notwithstanding whatever merit or lack of merit may be \nevident in these particular items, we are going to tell the President \nhe can't do that.'' I simply disagree.\n  Second, I disagree with the principle that if you are for the line-\nitem veto in principle but can't stand the heat when it applies to a \nproject in your particular district, then, indeed, you ought not to be \nfor the line-item veto.\n  I would not argue with the basic premise of the Senator's remarks \nthat if the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia's \nlegislation to repeal the line-item veto were offered again today, that \nit might well garner overwhelming support, although I am in a position \nto suggest that it might not be unanimous.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no Alaska project that was eliminated by the \nPresident.\n  Second, the difficulty that I really have with what the Senator has \nsaid is the line-item veto was intended to eliminate waste or projects \nthat would lead to a deficit. We asked for the list. Can the Senator \nnow tell me what 18 or 19 projects the President made a mistake on? Can \nhe give us a list? We never got a list. We have 36 to 38 projects in \nthis bill--because we never got a list from the White House as to what \nprojects the President admitted were erroneously line-item vetoed.\n  Mr. ROBB. If the Senator will yield to respond on that particular \nmatter, Mr. President, I remind the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nthat I could not agree with him more. I think it is wrong.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona, with whom I discussed the \nproblem earlier, that we ought to establish clear criteria, and those \ncriteria ought to be made known to those who would be affected by them, \nas well as all the rest of the Members of this body.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. While the distinguished Senator from Virginia is on the \nfloor, I disagree with the Senator in suggesting that we all ought to \nenter into some kind of an agreement with the White House as to what \nthe criteria ought to be in applying the line-item veto. I think if we \ndo that, we are further legitimizing what is an illegitimate end run \naround the Constitution. I'm not for entering into such agreements \nconcerning criteria.\n  While I have the floor, I am not supporting this measure because it \nhas an item in it that was wrongfully vetoed by the President and \nbecause that item is now included in this resolution. I'm supporting it \nbecause I think the administration was arbitrary and capricious in \nexercising the line-item veto\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\nin the way it used it. That is why I have said that Senators can vote \nfor this resolution even though they support the line-item veto. A vote \nfor this resolution doesn't mean they support the line-item veto, nor \ndoes it mean they are against the line-item veto.\n  It says that Senators believe that the administration, in applying \nthe line-item veto, acted capriciously, acted arbitrarily, acted \nwithout justification, acted without a credible basis. That is what \nSenators are voting on. That is why I hope they will all vote for the \nresolution.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, don't count me \nin when it comes to helping the administration to establish criteria by \nwhich it will apply this infernal, nefarious line-item veto.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I simply acknowledge that no one has been \nmore eloquent or consistent in their position that this is not \nappropriate legislation. From the very time that I entered this body I \nhave known that the distinguished Senator, who was then chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, felt that this was not a proper allocation of \npower under the Constitution, that it should be reserved for the \nlegislative body. It was not appropriate to give this to the executive \nbranch.\n  We have a disagreement on that matter in terms of the distribution of \npower, but as to the interpretation of the Constitution, I suspect that \nthe Court will probably ultimately verify or validate the distinguished \nSenator's views and this debate may be moot.\n  My concern today, and I accept the Senator's view that nothing in \nWest Virginia is included, but I am concerned if there were 69 of us, \nif that indeed is the count, who were willing to vote for the line-item \nveto and now come back simply because there is an item in our States \nand say we are against it because it happened to gore the ox in our \npasture, then we are not maintaining the kind of principle that most \nMembers of this legislative branch believe in in all the other dealings \nthey take part in.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am not willing to assume that the \nPresident has a monopoly on wisdom. I have represented the people of \nWest Virginia now for 51 years in one office or another. I think I have \na pretty good idea of what they need, what they want, and so on.\n  But in this particular instance, the item that was vetoed for West \nVirginia was on the Department of Defense's 5-year plan.\n  He vetoed the item that would have been in West Virginia, and I say, \nlet's give it right back to him by his own criteria. He made a mistake \nin vetoing it. I say let's put it right back on the President's desk, \nlet him exercise his constitutional veto, and then let the Congress \nexercise its constitutional option of either overriding that veto or \nsustaining it.\n  I have sat right here and listened to three former Governors talk \nabout the line-item veto. What is beyond my comprehension is how \nSenators can confuse the so-called line-item veto at the State level \nwith the line-item veto at the Federal level. They are two different \nspheres of action. The distinguished Senator from Florida, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, and the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, all three of whom are former Governors, came from States that \nhave the line-item veto. Well, so what? As Governors, they were acting \nunder the constitutions of the State of Virginia, the State of Florida, \nand the State of Arkansas. But now they are operating under the aegis \nof the United States Constitution. They are two different things. I \ndon't find the constitution of the State of Virginia written into the \nU.S. Constitution. I don't find the constitution of the State of \nFlorida written into the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution \nrefers to legislative powers ``vested in a Congress of the United \nStates.''\n  Mr. ROBB. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBB. With all due respect to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, that is the reason that we are proposing, proposed, \nand have effected the line-item veto, and propose it as a \nconstitutional amendment, recognizing that the Constitution of the \nUnited States did not grant this power to the President that it grants \nto 40-some Governors and their respective States.\n  Mr. BYRD. We are talking about two different powers. We are talking \nabout the powers that the 47 Governors have, dealing with the so-called \nline-item veto. Those are powers under their State constitutions. But \nthe Senator from Virginia is no longer a Governor; he is a Senator. The \nSenator from Florida is not a Governor any longer, and he is not to be \ngoverned in his actions here by the constitution of the State of \nFlorida; he is to be governed here by the oath he took to support and \ndefend the U.S. Constitution--not the constitution of the State of West \nVirginia, not the constitution of the State of Virginia, but the United \nStates Constitution. That is the Constitution by which we are governed \nhere.\n  The line of demarcation, the line of separation of powers, the line \nof checks and balances is more strictly delineated at the Federal \nlevel. It is more strictly drawn, more finely drawn at the Federal \nlevel than it is at the State level.\n  Mr. ROBB. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, without the power to amend, this Senator \nwill observe that we would not have had the Bill of Rights, much less \nthe other amendments to the Constitution. So there is a procedure that \nis set forth for subsequent generations to reconsider the wisdom of the \nFounding Fathers, and it appears that the Founding Fathers accepted the \nfact that there might have to be some changes even in their seminal \ndocument, the Constitution.\n  I don't intend to continue the debate, Mr. President, with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I understand his point \nof view. I respect him and I respect him for it. I expect that this \nparticular bill will probably achieve something in excess of 95 votes. \nSo I am not sure that we need to protract the debate on this particular \nissue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't intend to protract the debate. But I \nagree that if this is going to be done, if we are going to have the \nline-item veto, let it be done the way the framers provided that it be \ndone; namely, through an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, not by \nstatute. I don't think we can do it by law. I do hope that the High \nCourt of the United States will uphold the contention that I am making \nand will strike this infernal and nefarious law dead, dead, dead!\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator. How much time does the Senator \nfrom New Mexico need?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the Senator 5 minutes. I believe the Senator from \nNew York wants 5 minutes also, and I will yield him that time when he \ncomes in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me talk separately about two issues. \nOne is this Senate resolution disapproving the cancellations that were \ntransmitted by the President resulting in this S. 1292.\n  Let me first indicate the reasons that I support the resolution, and \nthen I will say a few things about the line-item veto issue, the larger \nissue that the Senator and others have been discussing here. First, I \ndo support the legislation, S. 1292, for the simple reason that I \nbelieve the administration acted to cancel worthy projects on the basis \nof erroneous information and that it is our duty in the Congress to \noverride that decision if we have the votes to do that. The \nadministration has admitted as much to us in a statement that we \nreceived today, and the President continues to insist that he will not \nallow the passage of this resolution to be signed into law.\n  At a minimum, I believe that if this override effort proves \nunsuccessful, the administration owes it to the military personnel in \nthe country and to their families and to those of us in Congress to \nensure that there is funding provided for the projects that were \nincorrectly included in the President's line-item veto package. The \nSenate received a statement from the administration today indicating \nthat some military construction projects that the President vetoed were \ncanceled on the basis of erroneous information. Mr.\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\nPresident, that is exactly what happened on the two projects that I am \nmost familiar with, the two in New Mexico. The project at Kirtland Air \nForce Base and White Sands Range.\n  In both of those cases, we had information from the Department of \nDefense indicating that those projects had been substantially designed, \nand they were ready to be executed in this fiscal year, and as such, \nthey did not meet this criteria that the President has indicated he \nused and the Office of Management and Budget used in deciding which \nitems to line-item veto.\n  In fact, I had a conversation with Franklin Raines, head of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, on the day that the decision was \nannounced by the President, and I discussed with him the information we \nhave received from the Department of Defense and how it conflicted with \nthe information that he had which he was urging the President to use in \nmaking the decision.\n  So I am persuaded that the decision as to those two projects was \nbased on erroneous information. I believe, based on what the President \nhas indicated in his letter to us, that the decisions on many other \nprojects were also based on erroneous information. So I believe it is \nin our best interest and it is our duty, in fact, to go ahead and pass \nthis legislation. I intend to vote for it.\n  Let me say a couple words about the line-item veto itself. I am not \none who supported the line-item veto legislation. I opposed it for many \nof the reasons that the Senator from West Virginia has articulated so \nwell here on the Senate floor. First of all, I don't believe it is good \npolicy. I think the Founding Fathers had it right when they determined \nthat this was not a power that should be granted to the President, and \nso I support the basic structure that was put into our Constitution.\n  Second, if we were going to try to enact some type of line-item veto \nand grant that authority to the President, it cannot be done by \nstatute; we would have to amend the Constitution. We would have to go \nthrough the very elaborate procedure set up in the Constitution to \namend the Constitution. Clearly, that was not done in this legislation.\n  Let me also say that all the debate over the last several years in \nthe Congress about the line-item veto has been an effort to describe it \nas something which was needed in order to impose fiscal responsibility \non the Government. My experience here in the Congress has led me to \nconclude that fiscal irresponsibility is just as much a result of \naction in the executive branch as it is a result of action here in the \nCongress. There are many instances where those of us in Congress are \nfiscally irresponsible. I have witnessed that on many occasions. But I \nhave also witnessed many examples where the executive branch and the \nPresident in the budget sent to the Congress were also fiscally \nirresponsible. So I don't think the case has been made that fiscal \nirresponsibility is just a province of the Congress.\n  I do believe we should pass this resolution. I believe that the \nSupreme Court, when it gets the opportunity, will declare the \nlegislation that enacts the line-item veto to be unconstitutional. I \nbelieve the issue will be back before us at that time to see whether we \nwant to do a constitutional amendment. I will urge my colleagues not to \ndo a constitutional amendment at that time.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I appreciate the time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 12 minutes 37 seconds, plus \n10 minutes to close, which has been allocated separately. The minority \nhas used up all their time, but they still have 10 minutes to close.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield such time to the Senator from Texas, from my 12 \nminutes, as she wishes to use.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified if I go over \n5 minutes, which I don't expect to do.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Stevens' putting this bill \nforward, along with Senator Burns, because I think this is exactly the \nway the process should work. I am, frankly, puzzled by some of my \ncolleagues who are arguing that they aren't going to vote for this bill \nbecause they voted for the line-item veto. I voted for the line-item \nveto. This is exactly the way the process should work. The President \nvetoes, and the Congress does not take away its right to disagree with \nthe President. The Congress has not taken away its right to override. \nIn fact, that is part of the process. That is the way it is supposed to \nwork.\n  I don't accuse the President of partisanship. I think he has vetoed \nprojects that he probably considers were not worthy in States and \ndistricts represented by Republicans and Democrats. But I do think the \nPresident is wrong. I think the President did not have the facts \nstraight, and I think he has vetoed essential projects that the \nmilitary has asked for, and I think we need to override this veto. In \nfact, the President vetoed these measures that are operational. Let me \njust read you a couple of examples: A repair of the launch facilities \nfor missile systems in White Sands, NM; to expand ammunition supply \nfacilities at Fort Bliss; consolidation of B-1B squadron operations \nfacilities.\n  These are projects the military has said are essential. They are in \nthe military 5-year plan. The reason they weren't in the President's \nbudget is because the President always comes in below Congress in the \nmilitary budget. Congress believes the military has certain needs for \nour readiness, and Congress has increased the President's budget every \nyear since I have been here. So it is not unusual that the President \nwould not have in his budget some of the needs that Congress believes \nare essential. In fact, the President left in many military \nconstruction projects at NATO facilities that are exactly the same type \nof facilities that he vetoed on American bases.\n  So I think this is exactly the kind of override that the process \ncalls for. The President did not have his facts. The Department of \nDefense admits that their data was not up to date. The military asked \nfor these projects. They are very important for readiness. And I think \nit is time for us to exercise our rights as Congress to override the \nPresident's veto, not because we think he was sinister in what he was \ntrying to do but because we think he was wrong.\n  It is Congress' prerogative to do this. I think it is important that \nwe stand by the needs for the military that we have studied and that we \nbelieve are necessary, and that we stand by what we did and override \nthe President's veto.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from New York \nwhen he comes. I know he wants to make a statement.\n  But the Senator from Texas has just made the point that I have been \ntrying to make. This is the process of the Line-Item Veto Act. It is \nthe first time we have attempted to use it. This is the override \nmechanism that is provided by that act, and it was provided by Congress \nbecause mistakes could be made. In this instance we now know that \nmistakes were made.\n  The statement came to us today from the Office of Management and \nBudget that admits there was erroneous material given to the President \non which they matched against the criteria that they had used under the \nLine-Item Veto Act to determine whether any projects should be \neliminated. We asked for the list of those projects.\n  My staff tells me we still have not received the ones that mistakes \nwere made on. We have no alternative under the circumstances than to \ninclude them all. There are two here that are not included because of \nthe specific requests of the States involved not to have their projects \ninvolved. But the administration has now clearly said on the record \nthat there were mistakes made.\n  The veto message, as I said, violates the spirit and intent of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  That again is why the override mechanism is in the act. This action \ntaken by the administration does not comply with the act. We have a way \nof saying to the Presidency we intended that money be spent, and we \nwant it spent for these projects.\n  Let's look at this criteria again that the administration used.\n  It set forth three criteria, one of which was that the project had to \nbe in the President's budget by definition. In this instance, that was \nan erroneous\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\ncriteria because the Presidency had agreed to increase the amount of \nmoney that was in the President's budget for defense by $2.6 billion. \nIn the budget agreement that was worked out with leadership. Of that \n$2.6 billion, $800 million of that was allocated to military \nconstruction. Nothing came forward from the administration that \nindicated that it had any desire to decide where that money went.\n  So our committee allocated the money. In allocating it, we gave money \nto these 38 projects. Our criteria was they had to be projects that the \nmilitary supported. We had a hearing after the line-item veto took \nplace. At that hearing the military witnesses stated that every project \non the list was supported by the Department of Defense military people. \nThey were essential to the program. And I believe all but five were in \nthe long-range program. The other five were covered by changes in \ncircumstances since the long-range 5-year program was devised. But they \nwere specifically supported by the military witnesses.\n  The criteria that the Presidency used to determine whether to apply \nthe line-item veto does not stand up to the scrutiny of this Congress.\n  I am corrected about one thing. One of the criteria was that no \ndesign work had been done. The impact of that is that again there were \nprojects where the information was erroneous that was received by the \nWhite House. These projects were in fact underway and could be \ncompleted in the next fiscal year.\n  I thank you for telling me about that.\n  But the problem of the criteria is they were not designed to find \nprojects that were wasteful, or would increase the deficit.\n  In this instance, I failed to point out that since we obtained the \nincrease in money allocated to our committee for defense we looked into \nthe long-range program, and we brought up into the 1998 year years that \nare in the long-range program but were specified to commence at a later \ntime. We did that because some money had already been allocated to \nthose projects by the Department of Defense, and those projects could \nbe more efficiently completed if money was available this year.\n  My point is these are not wasteful projects. No one can claim that \nthere any one of these projects that meets the criteria of the Line-\nItem Veto Act will increase the deficit. By definition they are within \nthis budget. They are within the amount that the administration agreed \ncould be spent this year for defense. And, second, they are not by \ndefinition wasteful.\n  Those are the two criteria of the Line-Item Veto Act. The President \ncan use the Line-Item Veto Act to eliminate wasteful projects, or \nprojects that would increase the deficit. Neither apply to any one of \nthe 38 projects.\n  Under the circumstances, Mr. President, having allocated $800 million \nto military construction, what we find now, as I said just a little \nwhile ago, is a line-item veto eliminates $287 million from the $800 \nmillion which was part of the $2.6 billion overall increase for \ndefense. The line-item veto eliminated 35 percent of the money we put \ninto projects to use the increased amount which was available for \nmilitary construction. That means right now that if the administration \ngoes forward with what is stated in this announcement today from OMB \nthat Senator Byrd has read, they will reprogram money from other \nprojects that have already been approved by the Presidency and move it \nover to the 18 in which the mistakes were made.\n  What does that do to the rest of the budget? It means that we are \npaying twice. We have lost the $287 million, if this bill does not \npass. And, in addition to that, they are going to take somewhere in the \nvicinity of $175 million. We believe it will be $450 million not spent \nfor needed projects, if this bill is not passed.\n  Mr. President, this is the mechanism. That is why I say I will \nsupport and, as a matter of fact, introduce a bill to repeal the act, \nif this mechanism doesn't work. If there is any example where it should \nwork, it is this one. It is admitted that there are 18 projects on \nwhich they made mistakes. They refused to tell us which ones.\n  I don't know how to handle this when people say you can't do this \nbecause this violates the spirit of the Line-Item Veto Act. This is the \nspirit of the Line-Item Veto Act. And I urge Senators who supported the \nline-item veto to consider that. If this mechanism is ever to work, \nthis is the point where it should work. If it won't work in this one \nthere is no reason to support this act anymore, in my opinion, because \nthis is really the worst example I could think of a situation where \ninformation provided to the President leads the President to line-item \nveto items that were eliminated by mistake.\n  Another avenue, of course, is for this to go to court. If it goes to \ncourt, and the court finds in the final analysis that the line-item \nveto is unconstitutional, which is what my good friend from West \nVirginia says, then the money will be restored thereto.\n  But let's see if the mechanism works. There are already some court \nchallenges. I don't see any reason to have another court challenge to \nthe Line-Item Veto Act. The Senate and the House ought to do its duty \non this and the duty is to try to remedy the mistake that was made when \nthe line-item veto was wrongfully exercised in connection with these 38 \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, I don't see anyone else seeking time.\n  I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes for the majority, and \nthere are 10 minutes remaining for the minority prior to the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Maryland, is coming to the floor and he wants 5 minutes. I \nwish to have the Chair alert me when I have remaining 5 minutes. In the \nmeantime, may I address a question to the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska?\n  In the statement of administration policy, we are told, and I quote, \n``The administration strongly opposes this disapproval bill.''\n  Well, if I understand it, the administration is willing to work with \nthe Congress in restoring half of these items; half of the items. I \ncannot understand how it can disapprove the bill when it is willing to \nrestore half of the items that are in the disapproval bill.\n  Also, the statement of administration policy that comes from the \nOffice of Management and Budget says, ``The President's action saves \n$287 million in budget authority in 1998.''\n  In the very next sentence, it says, ``* * * we are committed to \nworking with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were \ncanceled as a result of the data provided by the Department of Defense \nthat was out of date.''\n  How much is the President's action really saving? He claims to save \n$287 million by virtue of the exercise of the line-item veto. But he \nfollows in the next sentence, and says, ``* * * we are committed to \nworking with Congress to restore funding * * *''\n  How much really can the administration claim to have saved?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It would be very hard, Mr. President, to figure out the \nnet amount. The actual savings would be determined by how much of the \nprojects fall into this year by reprogramming and then how much more \nmoney has to be requested next year to pay for the money that is spent \nfor the projects that had been delayed because of the transfer of the \nmoney to these projects. I believe that the net will be that there will \nbe $450 million less this year. But I do believe it will increase the \ncost of defense in later years because of the fact that these projects \nhave been deferred and other projects will be deferred in order to pay \nfor the 18 according to that document.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask that it be charged equally to both sides; charge the first 2 \nminutes to mine, and then bring it down.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have time remaining. I yield to the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\nfrom New York such time as he wishes, and I reserve the remainder of \nthe time to be equally divided between the Senator from West Virginia \nand myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would very much like to thank the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, the Chairman, for the graciousness with \nwhich he has yielded to me. I will not take long.\n  I want to acknowledge that I am a cosponsor of this legislation. And \nin the interest of full disclosure, I will say there are two small \nprojects in New York State that would be affected. But the proposition \nto be addressed once again, as the senior Senator from West Virginia \nhas said, is that the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional, and we \nare already beginning to see the constitutional consequences, the \nextraordinary increase in the power of the Presidency as against the \nlegislature that is implicit in the newly enhanced bargaining position \nof the President.\n  If you want to change this power, which is very carefully set forth \nin article I of the Constitution, then amend the Constitution. But, \nSenators, listen to Senator Byrd. Listen, if I might just presume to \nsay, to Justice John Paul Stevens. In the course of our challenge, \nwhich reached the Supreme Court last June, the Justices simply said, \nwell, they don't have standing. However, in a powerful dissent, Justice \nStevens, who was the only Justice to comment directly on the merits of \nthe case, said they surely do have standing. He wrote of the Act:\n\n       If the procedure were valid, it would deny every Senator \n     and every Representative any opportunity to vote for or \n     against the truncated measure that survives the exercise of \n     the President's cancellation authority. Because the \n     opportunity to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the \n     text of the Constitution, I think it clear that the persons \n     who are deprived of that right by the Act have standing to \n     challenge its constitutionality. Moreover, because the \n     impairment of that constitutional right has an immediate \n     impact on their official powers, in my judgment they need not \n     wait until after the President has exercised his cancellation \n     authority to bring suit. Finally, the same reason that the \n     respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for \n     concluding that the statute is unconstitutional.\n\n  Again, Justice Stevens said, not only do they have standing but the \nmeasure is unconstitutional. Two Federal judges have spoken to this \nissue: Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia--who took just 3 weeks from having heard the case \nto declare it unconstitutional--and then Justice Stevens.\n  I can report that three new constitutional challenges have recently \nbeen filed and now consolidated, I believe is the term, in the District \nCourt, and we will hear from the Supreme Court before this term is out, \nI should think.\n  But in the first instance remember that the large issue here is that \nof the Constitution. We take an oath to uphold and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic. I had never thought, Mr. President, when I first took that \noath that there were any ``domestic'' enemies to the Constitution, but \nnow as I look about us, I recall that celebrated immortal line from \nPogo: ``We have met the enemy and he is us.''\n  Now, there will be time to overcome that. For the moment I simply \nwish to thank the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman, for \nan opportunity to express my view on this subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each manager has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Each side has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could I get 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes. That will leave how much \ntime?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Two minutes to each side.\n  Mr. BYRD. Two minutes to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMaryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \npending measure overriding the line-item vetoes of the military \nconstruction appropriations bill.\n  During last year's debate on the line-item veto legislation, I spoke \nat length--and I do not intend to do that again today--on how giving \nthat authority to the President would strike a major blow against the \nintricate, carefully conceived system of checks and balances that the \nFramers of the Constitution crafted over 200 years ago and that has \nstood the Nation in such good stead ever since.\n  With the line-item veto authority, the President needs only one-third \nplus one of either House of Congress, not even both Houses of Congress \nbut either House, to negate legislation that the Congress has passed \nand the President has signed--I repeat, legislation that the Congress \nhas passed and the President has signed. Then, after that process, the \nPresident can go back in and pull out those items he wants to cancel.\n  In my view, giving such authority to the President cannot be done by \nstatute, and I believe that the measure we passed last year is \nconstitutionally deficient. I trust when it is finally determined by \nthe courts they will agree. In the meantime, of course, we have to deal \nwith the legislation.\n  Furthermore, I simply want to point out that as a matter of policy, \nthe line-item veto gives the Executive extraordinary power to determine \nthe priorities of the Nation and to use that power, if he chooses to do \nso, to pressure Members of Congress on a whole range of other \nlegislative issues. In other words, the Member is told, well, here is \nthis item in this bill that is very important to your State, but on \nother matters on which I need your support--nominations, treaties, you \nname it.\n  A Member of Congress is then under tremendous pressure to support the \nPresident's priorities. That is clearly not the arrangement the \nFounding Fathers envisioned when they established a system based on a \nsharing of policymaking authority between the legislative and the \nexecutive branches of Government.\n  The Congress of the United States is distinguished amongst \nlegislative branches in the world because it has some real measure of \npower and authority. This line-item veto approach is, in my judgment, \nwell on its way to eroding that status.\n  Some asserted during last year's debate that the line-item veto was \nnecessary as a deficit-reduction mechanism. The response from many of \nus was that to reduce the deficit the Congress need only make the right \nbudget decisions, which in fact we have done as demonstrated by the \ndramatic decline in the budget deficit.\n  I am sure that many of my colleagues who voted for the line-item veto \nlast year are having second thoughts after having seen it in action. In \nfact, the President's use of the line-item veto here does not even \ntrack the criteria which the executive branch itself said it was going \nto use in applying it.\n  I welcome this opportunity to join in the effort to undo the \nPresident's use of that authority. However, my colleagues should \nrealize that as long as this legislation remains on the books, we will \nbe back here time and time again waging an uphill battle against the \nChief Executive seeking to impose his set of priorities on the Congress \nand the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I yield back whatever time remains \nto the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators who have spoken \non this important matter. I thank those who take the position contrary \nto the position I have taken. I appreciate the opportunity to close the \ndebate on this matter along with my dear friend, the Senator from \nAlaska [Mr. Stevens].\n  Mr. President, Cato, the Elder, lived between the years 234 B.C. and \n149 B.C. He was a great Roman statesman, and he once went to Carthage \nand viewed the operations of the Carthaginians and saw the progress \nthey were making in building a prosperous regime and one that had \nconsiderable warmaking power. Cato brought back to the Roman Senate \nsome figs that had grown in Carthage just to demonstrate the fact that \nCarthage was ``not very far away, gentlemen. This is a country you had \nbetter keep your eye on. You\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\nhad better watch these people. They are growing stronger every day and \nthey don't live very far away, as evidenced by these fresh figs from \nCarthage.''\n  And, indeed, that great statesman, Cato, the Elder, henceforth closed \nevery speech, every communication, every letter, with the words, \n``Carthage must be destroyed!'' I shall close this speech now and \nperhaps some future ones with the words, ``The line-item veto must be \nrepealed!''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to be in the \nChamber with the Senator from West Virginia. But mine is a more mundane \ntask right now, and that is to try to get the Senate to understand that \nthis is the process provided by the Line-Item Veto Act. If it is not \nfollowed, the defense budget per se and the military construction \nbudget in general will be lowered. If we pass this act and it becomes \nlaw, the President still has control over these projects. He has \nalready reprogrammed money for military projects for Bosnia. Next \nspring we will face another problem of paying for Bosnia. But should we \nlet $450 million go astray here now because of mistakes? I regret that \nthe mistakes were made, but I hope the Senate doesn't make another one. \nThis bill should be overwhelmingly passed to tell the Presidency the \nline-item veto is a very discrete mechanism and it must be used with \ncare. Above all, its use cannot be based on mistakes.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays if they have not been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 287 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Sessions\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Coats\n       \n  The bill (S. 1292) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress disapproves of cancellations 97-4, 97-5, 97-6, 97-7, \n     97-8, 97-9, 97-10, 97-11, 97-12, 97-13, 97-14, 97-15, 97-16, \n     97-17, 97-18, 97-19, 97-20, 97-21, 97-22, 97-23, 97-24, 97-\n     25, 97-26, 97-27, 97-28, 97-29, 97-30, 97-32, 97-33, 97-34, \n     97-35, 97-36, 97-37, 97-38, 97-39, and 97-40, as transmitted \n     by the President in a special message on October 6, 1997, \n     regarding Public Law 105-45.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Again, as I said before, I do not \ntake this time in any way to try to keep these two nominees from being \non the Board. I have met with both of them. They are fine individuals. \nI just happen to think, as I will state a little more in depth later, \nthat their economic philosophy and their positions on what the Fed \nought to be doing are just too much in line with the present thinking \nat the Fed. And I think that is going to cost us dearly in the years \nahead.\n  Having said that, I don't intend in any way to try to block their \nfinal confirmation. But I wanted to take this time of the Senate to \ntalk a little bit more about the monetary policy of the Fed and what it \nis doing to this country.\n  In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee yesterday morning, \nMr. Greenspan said he would welcome a debate on whether or not the \nFederal Reserve should make inflation its sole goal, or whether there \nshould be a balance between lowering unemployment and fighting \ninflation. Well, I welcome that opportunity. I hope my statements from \nMonday and today will help begin the debate on this important issue. It \nis an important issue and it affects every American. It especially \naffects working Americans and their families. Fed policy--basically the \ndecisions they make--tells every American family how much they are \ngoing to have to spend on their car payment or home mortgage payment, \nor whether or not they are going to be able to put away some money for \na college education for their kids. It affects every American family. \nYet, we seem to just sort of let monetary go by the way, without ever \ncalling into question the assumptions and reasons behind the decisions \nof the Fed.\n  There seems to be this sort of attitude that, well, if the Fed says \nit, it must be true. What can we do about it? Aren't they independent? \nDon't they operate independently? That is true. They do. But the \nFederal Reserve is not a creature of the Constitution. It does not have \na constitutional framework in which to operate. The Federal Reserve was \nset up by Congress; it is a creature of Congress. We represent the \npeople of this country. I don't think Congress ought to be in the \nposition of making monetary policy on a day-to-day basis. Far be it \nfrom that. I do believe the Fed ought to have that independence, but I \nalso believe that the Congress ought to exercise judicious oversight \nover the Federal Reserve and carve out, guide, and direct the Federal \nReserve in the area in which we believe it ought to go in setting its \nmonetary policy.\n  I think the question should be asked, ``How independent really is the \nFed?'' Is it not really made up of the major banks of this country and \nthe major lending institutions? How really independent are they? We do \nhave a Board of Governors and, obviously, they are not all bankers. \nThere are economists, people like Mr. Greenspan, and others not in \nbanking. I believe one of the new nominees was an investment banker \nprior to his coming on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. You \nwonder sometimes really how independent they really are. I think the \nCongress has every right and responsibility to the people of this \ncountry to help set the policy and guidance for the Federal Reserve.\n  Now, much of the Federal Reserve's policies are driven by what I have \nnow come to believe to be a very arcane concept called NAIRU, the \nnonaccelerating inflationary rate of unemployment. I doubt that one in \na million Americans even knows what that means. But it is a guiding \nprinciple of the Fed, and it has determined that interest rates will \nremain high for working Americans. Because of NAIRU and because of the \ngrip that this arcane concept has on the Fed, we have unduly high \ninterest rates today, higher than our historical averages, higher than \nwhat is warranted by the rate of inflation out there.\n  Well, NAIRU says is that if unemployment goes below a certain level, \nthen inflation will take off--not just increase, but it will accelerate \nat such a rate that only unusually high interest rates could ever stop \nit. Well, as I said Monday, NAIRU has been proven to be inaccurate. It \nwas once believed that inflation would accelerate if unemployment went \nbelow 6 percent. They said if it goes below 6 percent, look out, \ninflation is going to take off. Well, it went below 6 percent and \ninflation didn't take off. Well, the believers in this concept said, we \nwere just wrong, it is really 5.5 percent unemployment. Well, then it \nwent down below that. Then they said it is 5 percent. Surely, if we get \nto 5 percent unemployment, boy, inflation is going to take off. And \nbecause of that, we saw the Federal Reserve, under Mr. Greenspan, \ndouble the interest rates, the Federal funds rate, from 3 percent to 6 \npercent in 18 months. I believe it was in 1993 and 1994 when they \nincreased those interest rates--or 1994 and 1995. In an 18-month period \nof time, it went from 3 percent to 6 percent because they said \nunemployment was getting so low that we are going to have to raise \ninterest rates to keep inflation in check.\n  Then unemployment went below 5 percent, and still no signs of \naccelerating inflation. And the Fed admits there are no sings of \naccelerating inflation. And, despite no signs of this, the Fed is still \nwilling to raise interest rates through the use of its so-called \n``preemptive strike.'' I don't understand the justification for an \ninterest rate hike based on an assumption that sometime in the future \naccelerating inflation may occur. We don't know when but sometime down \nthat road it may happen. So, therefore, we have to jack up interest \nrates now.\n  In fact, Alan Greenspan admitted that ``economic understanding is \nimperfect and measurement is imprecise. . . .'' If the Fed's \nmeasurements are imperfect and they are not precise, how can we assume \nthat the Fed knows what it is doing when it launches one of its \npreemptive strikes? We don't know, because, first of all, the Federal \nReserve Board meetings are kept secret for 5 years. Why? There is no \nreason to keep their Board meetings secret for 5 years. I would think \nthat at least after 1 year we ought to at least be able to look at \ntheir Board meetings and find out why they decided to do what they did.\n  So we have a Fed that uses an outdated concept to fight inflation \nwhen it might not even know how much inflation is actually in the \neconomy.\n  Again, what we need to understand is that there is a difference \nbetween rapidly accelerating inflation and modest inflation. Mild \ninflation may redistribute income--causing some pain to those who are \nunemployed--but it doesn't destroy employment, and in fact may even be \nbeneficial in terms of more employment and rising incomes.\n  To quote James K. Galbraith, a professor of economics at the \nUniversity of Texas, ``It therefore makes little difference, from the \nstandpoint of inflation dangers that matter most, whether one pursues \nlow unemployment or not. The inflation costs of lower unemployment are \nsmall, tolerable, and easily reversible, if necessary--and that is \nusing pessimistic assumptions. The dangers of an external supply shock, \nthough much greater, are not closely related to the rate of \nunemployment, and cannot be reduced by a slow-growth policy. The lesson \nto be drawn is that there is no benefit in failing to pursue full \nemployment.''\n  To further quote Galbraith, ``Therefore, at a minimum, policy should \ndo nothing to slow economic growth. Let the economy grow. And if growth \nslows, policymakers should react quickly by lowering interest rates in \nan effort to keep progress going. There is certainly no benefit from \nslower growth and rising unemployment while the inflationary costs of a \nstimulative policy in response to evidence of a slowdown are \nspeculative and small.''\n  However, there may be greater risks posed to the economy should the \nFed continue its all-out effort to fulfill the bond market's goal of \nzero inflation.\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\n  And that really is what Mr. Greenspan is after. They want zero \ninflation. But I believe that may pose a very great risk to our \ncountry. Last summer, George Akerlof, William Dickens, and George Perry \nof the Brookings Institution published a study called ``The \nMacroeconomics of Low Inflation.'' Their study argues that controlled \namounts of modest inflation are beneficial to the economy by preventing \nvery high enduring levels of joblessness. In sum, this paper suggests \nthe economic and social costs of getting to zero inflation, otherwise \nknown as ``price stability,'' are far higher than most economists \nbelieve.\n  To quote the study, ``The main implication for policymakers is that \ntargeting zero inflation . . . will lead to a large inefficiency in the \nallocation of resources, as reflected in sustainable rate of \nunemployment that is unnecessarily high.''\n  I raise this point because zero inflation--``price stability,'' as it \nis otherwise known--is the stated goal of Mr. Greenspan and the two \nnominees to the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson.\n  Again, to quote Mr. Greenspan in his 1997 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, \n``The view that the Federal Reserve's best contribution to growth is to \nfoster price stability has informed both our tactical decisions on the \nstance of monetary policy. * * *''\n  Mr. Gramlich stated, ``In the long run, the most fundamental of these \nobjectives is stable prices.''\n  Mr. Ferguson said, ``Price stability should be a central goal of \nmonetary policy.''\n  What concerns me is that in their blind pursuit inflation based upon \nthis arcane notion of NAIRU, that we are coming very dangerously close \nto deinflation. It may even be there right now.\n  Over the past year the core inflation rate, measured by the Consumer \nPrice Index, has increased by approximately 2.2 percent. But Mr. \nGreenspan and others say the CPI is overstated by as much as 1.5 \npercent. That means we might have basically zero inflation in our \ncountry.\n  So what happens when you reach zero inflation? Beyond the question of \nthe Federal Reserve's policies on incomes of average people, which I \nmentioned on Monday and which I will talk about shortly, my concern is \nabout the real possibility that the Fed may send our economy and the \nworld's economy into a serious period of deinflation.\n  In the United States, expectation of accelerating inflation is \nshrinking significantly. We brought down our budget deficit to where it \nis practically nothing. So we have our fiscal house in order. Inflation \nis very low. Unemployment is going down. But the Federal Reserve and \nthe nominees before us see zero inflation at the end process. But, in \nfact, zero inflation is a point on a continuum. You can have inflation. \nYou have zero inflation. Then you have deflation.\n  I believe right now we are on the precipice of risking a \ndestabilizing situation which may push us into a deflationary period.\n  So I think deinflation to me right now is more scary than modest \ninflation. I believe that a serious escalation on that side--\ndeinflation--is more likely over the next 5 years than significantly \nhigher inflation. Yet, the Fed is paying no mind at all to that.\n  The old ``pay any price, bear any burden'' to battle inflation has \nprevented the American economy from reaching its full potential. And \nwhat it has done is it has said to the middle class that you get less \nand less of growth of our economic pie.\n  Before I yield to the Senator from North Dakota, I want to point out \nwhat is happening here with the distribution of the economic pie, as we \nsee it. This chart says it all. If you are in the top 20 percent of the \nincome earners of America, you are getting a larger and larger portion \nof the income in America. But if you are in the bottom 20 percent--\nactually, if you are in the bottom 80 percent--you are getting less and \nless. It is the top 20 percent that is getting more and more of the \ngrowth in the economic pie of our country. Again, that is because we \nhave kept the inflation rates artificially high.\n  That seems to make sense when you think about it. Who likes high \ninterest rates? If you have money you like high interest rates. If you \ndo not have money, you are a low-income American, and you are a working \nfamily wanting to buy a new car, or new home, or put away some money \nfor your kids' college education borrowing money for college education, \nyou are hurt by high interest rates.\n  Again, this chart also spells it out. ``Labor and Capital Shares of \nNational Income, 1993-1996.'' If you look at the percentage share of \nnational income, what we make as a Nation, labor's share since 1993 has \ngone down, and is continuing down. But if you look at capital's share, \nfrom 1993 to 1996, it keeps going up. That is because of the policies \nof the Federal Reserve System. More money is going into capital; less \nand less going to labor.\n\n  Again, this chart also shows it. This shows the corporate profit \nrates and median weekly earnings, 1989-1996. If you look at the \ncorporate profit rate since 1993 it has skyrocketed.\n  Keep in mind that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve jacked up \ninterest rates--doubled the Federal funds rates--in 1994 and 1995. Look \nat that tremendous increase in corporate profits. Yet, look at median \nweekly earnings during the same period of time. Down they have come, \nespecially after 1993.\n  So, again, more and more of our national income is going to corporate \nprofits, and less and less is going to median weekly earnings of the \nfamilies of this country.\n  We have all seen what has been happening on the stock market the last \nfew days. One person from the administration called me the other day \nand alluded to the fact that my holding up these two nominees sent the \nwrong signals to the financial markets. I said, ``What about the \nsignals we are sending to working families?'' What about those people \nout there working hard with maybe two jobs or maybe three jobs with the \nhusband and wife trying to make ends meet, trying to borrow money for a \nhome or a car? What about signals to them? We are not sending any \nsignals. All we are sending to them is higher and higher interest rates \nall the time.\n  The high rates of interest, I believe, are slowing the growth of our \neconomy. And, more than that, it is redistributing the growth that we \nhave in such a way that those at the top--the top 20 percent--are \ngetting more and more of national income. The bottom 80 percent are \ngetting less and less.\n  Again, just before the Federal Reserve began its series of rate hikes \nin 1994, the Federal funds rate was nearly zero. This chart shows what \nhappened on real interest rates.\n  They are higher than people think; higher than historical rates. Here \nthey were in 1994. The real Federal funds rate was about one-half \npercent. Today it is about 3.3 percent. They have come up, and they \nhave stayed up during this entire period of time. So we have higher \nreal rates than we have had before during a period of time when there \nwas absolutely no signs of accelerating inflation in our economy; none \nwhatsoever. Why are these interest rates still high?\n  It is because the Fed has a misguided policy called NAIRU.\n  I would like to discuss this chart entitled ``Alan Greenspan and \nLong-Term Interest Rates.'' It is interesting that every time interest \nrates, long-term interest rates, start to come down, Mr. Greenspan \ngives a speech, and interest rates go back up. Back here--this was last \nyear--Mr. Greenspan gave a speech. He called said the stock market was \ncharacterized by ``irrational exuberance.'' What happened? Well, \ninterest rates started going up.\n  Then interest rates started to come down again. Then Mr. Greenspan \ngave his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and hints that the Fed may change \nits interest rate policy. Interest rates go up again.\n  Then the market forces start to bring interest rates back down again. \nAnd then again just this month Mr. Greenspan testifies before the House \nBudget Committee, again drops subtle hints that in fact the economy is \noverheated, things are going too fast or maybe there is the specter of \ninflation. Interest rates start up again. And yet there is absolutely \nno sign of any inflation. In fact, I think a case can be made that we \nare right now near zero inflation in our country.\n  This is the time when labor's share ought to be a little bit better. \nThis line ought to start going up. This line\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\nought to start going up so our working families get a better share of \nthe income of our country, and yet the policies of the Federal Reserve \nSystem will not let that happen.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my friend from North Dakota, who has been a \nleader on the subject of fighting for working families and getting the \nFed to follow some good, old common sense. I am delighted to yield to \nmy friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will allow a discussion here briefly, I \nappreciate the Senator taking the floor to talk about the Federal \nReserve Board and these nominees. I come not so much to talk about \nthese two nominees but to discuss just a bit about where we are and \nwhere we are headed with the Federal Reserve Board policies.\n  If you go back a century or a century and a half ago in this country, \nyou could go from barber shops to barrooms and hear debates about \ninterest rates. All over this country we debated interest rates. In \nfact, just go 30 or 40 years back, and you will find that Lyndon \nJohnson called the head of the Federal Reserve Board down to a barbecue \nat his ranch in Texas and squeezed him, almost broke his bones, I am \ntold, in his shoulder area because the guy was trying to increase \ninterest rates by one-quarter of 1 percent. That was in the 1960s.\n  Now the Federal Reserve Board has a big concrete edifice downtown \nwith these money-center bankers who sit inside of it and they decide \nwhere the interest rates are going to go, and it doesn't matter what \nthe country thinks.\n  Whose interests do they serve? Well, when they shut the doors down at \nthe Federal Reserve Board and make decisions about interest rates, they \ncall in on a rotating basis the presidents of the regional Fed banks, \nand they vote on what interest rates ought to be.\n  Now, who are the regional Fed bank presidents? And who are they \nresponsible to? Were they ever confirmed by the Senate? No. They were \nhired by a board of directors in their region. Who are the board of \ndirectors? Money center bankers. Whose interest do they represent in \nsetting interest rate policy at the Fed? Bankers. It is bankers getting \ntogether, meeting with other bankers, to establish the interest rates.\n  Is that in the interest of the American people? I think not.\n  I have from time to time come to the floor of the Senate and \nsuggested that my Uncle Joe should be appointed to the Federal Reserve \nBoard. My Uncle Joe is a good guy. He is kind of semiretired now but a \ngood guy, smart guy. He used to fix generators. He knew how to fix \nthings.\n  There is nobody at the Federal Reserve Board who knows how to fix \nanything. They all come from the same area. They all look the same. \nThey all wear the same suits. They all have the same educational \nbackground. If you put them in a barrel and shake it up, the same \nperson winds up on top--gray suit, Ivy League background. Normally he \nwould have worked for the Federal Reserve Board in the past. They are \nan economist, which is psychology pumped up with helium, as I said in \nthe past. And they are like the old Roman augurs who used to read the \nentrails of cattle or the flights of birds in order to portend the \neconomic future. They sit down there now behind this concrete edifice \ntelling us about interest rates and then vote, and they make them \nstick.\n  Here, when we talk about taking money out of people's pockets in the \nform of taxes, we have these extended debates, but when they take money \nout of people's pockets in the form of higher than are justified \ninterest rates, it is done behind closed doors in secret at the Federal \nReserve Board and there is no debate at all and no accountability for \nit.\n  The reason I want to pipe up a bit here on this is the Senator from \nIowa makes the point interest rates are higher than they should be, and \nhe is absolutely right. There is no historic justification given where \ninflation is today for interest rates that exist at the Federal Reserve \nBoard. There is no justification for it at all. It means, in terms of \nwhere they set short-term interest rates, that the prime rate is too \nhigh and every other interest rate paid by every other American \nbusiness and consumer is too high. It is a tax that is unjustified and \nenforced against every family.\n  Now, no one has ever taken me up on the suggestion my Uncle Joe go to \nthe Fed. The reason I suggested Uncle Joe is that my uncle would sit in \nthere, I assume, and say, ``Well what's this mean to the person out \nthere on Main Street? What's this mean to the person who has a little \nbusiness or who's borrowed some money to start a business? What's it \nmean to that person?''\n  That is not discussed. It is just a closed group of people who kind \nof come from the same background, and they just keep talking and they \ndecide what they are going to do in a closed session.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa remembers I have brought to the floor of \nthe Senate, just as a public service, a chart from time to time with \nall the pictures of the Fed Board of Governors, where they came from, \nwhat their education background is, how much money they make, along \nwith the regional Fed bank presidents so the American people can see \nwho's voting on interest rates. They need to see that.\n  Now, I might make one other point. I appreciate so much the \nindulgence of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is a good discussion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is the last living dinosaur. It truly is. There has \nbeen a revolution of sorts in virtually every public institution. We \nhave reformed welfare. We have tackled the budget deficit. We have done \na lot of things in town in public policy. But guess what has not \nchanged at all. The Federal Reserve Board. Nothing. No change.\n  We had the GAO do an investigative analysis of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. What we discovered--and I can put some of this in the Record at \nsome point--was that while they were telling everybody that we need \nmore austerity, telling Congress you need to tighten your belts, they \nwere down there overeating, spending more and more each year.\n  The report, a one-of-a-kind study that took 2 years to assemble, \ncalled into question a whole series of practices with respect to the \nFed's building accounts, contracts they are involved with. But the \ninteresting part of the report was--it was a large report. The little \nnub of it, which is the hood ornament on the excesses at the Federal \nReserve Board, is that the Federal Reserve Board has squirreled away \n$4.3 billion, and I will bet most Members of the Senate don't know it's \nthere. When we actually had the report done, it was about $3.7 billion, \nroughly. But now it has grown to $4.3 billion as of the 15th of this \nmonth--$4.3 billion.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might I ask the Senator, if he will yield, what is that \nmoney used for?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is a contingency fund set aside to absorb possible \nlosses or what a family might call a rainy day fund. Now, the Federal \nReserve Board has been in existence I guess about 80 years. Roughly 80 \nyears.\n  Mr. HARKIN. More than that. 1912, I believe--1916.\n  Mr. DORGAN. For 80 consecutive years the Fed hasn't had a loss and it \nwill and never will have a loss. You can't have a loss if you are the \nFederal Reserve Board. Your job is to create and make money, and you do \nit routinely on a guaranteed basis. So the question is this. Why would \nan institution that will never have a loss in the future, squirrel away \n$4.3 billion of the taxpayers' money in a rainy day fund?\n  The GAO, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of \nCongress, asked that question. In fact, they are the ones who \ndiscovered it. I did not know it existed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I had no idea.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They asked that question, and the Federal Reserve Board \nactually gave them three or four different excuses for it. Essentially, \nwhen you boil it down, they said we need this for a contingency, for a \nrainy day fund.\n  The GAO said simply that money ought to be given back to the American \ntaxpayer; $4.3 billion. I wonder how many Members of the Senate know \nthat sits down there in an account for an agency that will never have a \nloss. They have squirreled away $4.3 billion.\n  The GAO says this ought to go back to the taxpayer. What is the Fed's \nresponse? No response. It doesn't have to respond to anybody. It is not \naccountable. It doesn't respond to you, to me,\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\nto the Congress, to the GAO. It is its own institution.\n  It was not supposed to be that way. It was not supposed to be a \nstrong central bank, unaccountable to anyone. It has become the last \nliving American dinosaur: up on a hill, the big fence, locks on the \ndoors. They make decisions behind closed doors. They call in their \nlocal bankers and make their decision on interest rates. They serve \ntheir constituents, not ours, and that is the public policy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not know a lot about the Fed's internal operations. \nThe Senator has looked at it a lot closer than I have, and he has given \nus some information I did not know. But when the Fed Board meets to \nmake its decisions, do they in fact meet behind closed doors?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Oh, sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Could I go down and sit in on it? I don't know. Can \nanyone sit in on those meetings?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me suggest the Senator try that. In fact, I might be \nwilling to go with him, and we will find, I assume, a reasonably \ncomfortable chair--since I am told they buy great furniture down there. \nThey will provide us a chair outside the room. Do you think the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board and his colleagues on the Open \nMarket Committee, the Board of Governors plus five rotating regional \nFed bank chairmen who convene to make interest rate policy--do you \nthink they are going to invite you in and say, ``Do you want a glass of \nwater or cup of coffee? And, by the way, while you are here, we would \nlike you to sit in this chair because we would really like your \nadvice.''\n  Do you think that is going to happen? The answer is of course it is \nnot going to happen because this is the last American dinosaur. It \noperates in secret, makes decisions without public debate because there \nisn't debate inside the Fed except inside a closed room among bankers.\n  I know there are some of us who very strongly believe we should have \nsome Fed reforms. I won't go on much longer because I know the Senator \nhas other things to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield? I just asked my staff--I was \nunaware of this--I am advised there are no small businessmen or \nbusinesswomen on the Federal Reserve Board. I understand they are all \nbankers or economists. I will further look into this, but that is what \nI was told. I do not think a such an important decision-making body \nshould be comprised of persons representing two select groups of our \nsociety. This is also a nation of small businesses and farms. Small \nbusinesses are the ones that employ people. They are the backbone of \nour economy. If that is true, that there is not even one small \nbusinessman or woman on the Federal Reserve Board, it is shocking.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That's why I want my Uncle Joe there. You are right. I \npointed out the Federal Reserve Board--I know they won't like to hear \nme say this--but the Federal Reserve Board has largely been comprised \nof people you can just cut out with a cookie cutter.\n  Incidentally, you and I come from the same part of the country. We \nhave had the sum total of three, three people from our part of the \ncountry as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors since the \nbeginning of the Federal Reserve Board, over 80 years ago--three.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. They probably don't want to make that mistake again, do \nthey? If people from the Midwest are appointed to the Board, they might \nquestion some of the Fed's policies.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are some people out in the middle of the country, \nbetween the two coasts, who think we are more than just time and space, \nthat we are part of the country and we are producers and we have a \nsignificant interest in what the interest rates are, how much economic \ngrowth this country enjoys and so on. That is why I really feel, when \nwe talk about who should join the Federal Reserve Board, who we should \nconfirm, I hope in the future we can finally get to some people who are \noutside the mold, who can say in those meetings, as they sit in those \nmeetings, ``Gee, what impact does this have? What are we justified in \ndoing here in monetary policy, not just for the interest of banks but \nfor the interest of businesses on Main Street, for the interest of \nmanufacturing plants, and for the interests of mom and pop who are at \nhome, borrowing money trying to send kids to school, maybe trying to \nstart a business?'' Those are the questions that I think are not asked \nbecause you have a single objective at the Fed at this point and that \nis they have decided to pursue, as you correctly pointed out, a zero \ninflation rate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have had twin economic goals in America, generally \nspeaking: Stable prices and full employment. But we don't have twin \ngoals at the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is funny how oftentimes I will talk with people from \nmy State of Iowa about the place of the Federal Reserve Board on \nmonetary policy there seems to be a perception among a lot of people in \nthis country that we have the Federal Reserve Board to not only prevent \ninflation, but to keep us from going into a depression. I find a lot of \ntimes when I tell people that, look, the Federal Reserve Board was in \nexistence for over 20 years prior to the Great Depression of the \n1930's, the Federal Reserve Board was in existence, yet they didn't \nprevent the Great Depression and they did nothing to help us get out of \nit--that is kind of startling to people, to hear that actually \nhappened. The Federal Reserve Board was in existence when we have had a \nlot of slowdowns and recessions in our country, yet nothing happened. \nPeople are amazed at that.\n  I think one of the reasons for the Fed's existence is to make sure we \ndon't have those kinds of recessions and deflations in our country \nabout which I have just spoken and which I think we are very \ndangerously close to right now. So I think a lot of people in this \ncountry have a mistaken idea. I think it is because we don't have a \ngood debate on monetary policy.\n  I just say to the Senator from North Dakota, talking about his \ncookie-cutter images of people on the Fed, I met with both of the \nnominees, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. They are nice, nice \nindividuals. They are very pleasant, obviously very smart, very learned \nindividuals. They are successful in their respective careers. But from \nwhat they told me and from their statements before the committee, they \nare just going to sing out of the same hymn book; the same song, second \nverse, same thing that they hear down at the Fed.\n  I said I would like to hear some people down at the Fed who would \nsay, ``Wait a minute, let's have a different view on this.'' One of the \nthings I like about the Senate, or the House of Representatives where \nwe, the Senator and I, both served before, is not everyone here \nbelieves the same thing. You get good discussions and good debate on \nalmost every issue. Out of that I think you get policies that are \nbetter for our country. But if everyone thinks the same, you are not \ngoing to get good policies that really benefit our country. That is \nwhat I am afraid of. At the Fed you just have one line of thinking and \nwhoever gets nominated by the President and gets put on that Board, \nthey think the same.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is an old saying, when everyone in the room is \nthinking the same thing, no one is thinking very much.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We had a recent example at the Federal Reserve Board. We \nsent someone down there who I think had pretty good promise, kind of a \ndifferent-thinking person. He didn't last too long. At least some of \nthe discussion in the papers about why this fellow left the Federal \nReserve Board--I am told it is because he was not accommodated very \nwell. You know, he didn't think the same, so he was sent over to a \ncorner there and wasn't involved in policy very much. The result was \nthat it was not a place he wanted to stay, because it wasn't a place \nfor dissenters or people with opposing views.\n  I will finish by simply saying--\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield further to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. By simply saying the Senator from Iowa does an important \nservice, it seems to me, in a Senate that is empty, pretty much, on an \nissue of monetary policy and Federal Reserve Board issues, when very \nfew people are willing to discuss or debate or advance these issues. \nThe Senator from Iowa is willing to do that. For that, I am enormously \nappreciative.\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\n  I know neither of us is going to be given an award, Man of the Year \nAward, by the Federal Reserve Board or any of the regional banks, and I \naccept that. But I do think it would serve this country's better \ninterest to have a significant debate about what kind of monetary \npolicy is good for all of our country, good for working families, good \nfor businesses, good for Main Street and Wall Street--good for banks, \nyes, because we want banks to do well as well as the rest of the \nAmerican economy. But we have such a lack of thoughtful debate about \nmonetary policy. The two policies of monetary and fiscal policy are the \npolicies that determine whether we have an economy that is doing well.\n  The Senator made a very important point. We had recessions and \ndepressions before we had the Federal Reserve Board and we have had \nrecessions and depressions since. Has the Federal Reserve Board done \nsome good things? Yes, I think so. I think in times of difficulty they \nhave made some tough decisions. I think in times of fiscal policy \nexcess they have put the brakes on, in monetary policy. I think there \nare a number of things that I can point to about the Fed and say, \n``Good job, we are glad you were there.'' But there are other \ncircumstances in which I think it is important to say to the Fed, ``You \nhave a responsibility in public policy to do more than just represent \nbankers' interests, more than just represent your single-minded goal \nthat ignores the needs of a whole lot of the American people.'' I don't \nstand here saying that I think we ought to do things that advance more \ninflation in our economy.\n  Less inflation is better for our economy, and the global economy is \nwhat has largely produced a lower rate of inflation. But it is also \nvery important, having the aggressive debates we have in fiscal policy, \nin monetary policy for us to foster the opportunity for those same \ndebates about what kind of policies benefit whom and how and why. That \nis what the Senator from Iowa does. I think it is a significant service \nfor him to be here and do that. I am pleased to come out from time to \ntime and be involved in the discussion with him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate what the Senator said, and I appreciate his \nlong-time involvement in this issue. I hope that we will take time in \nthe Senate and the House to really have some more discussions on \nmonetary policy and on the Federal Reserve System.\n  I hope that sometime soon we might even entertain some legislation to \nchange the operation and the functioning of the Federal Reserve System. \nAs the Senator from North Dakota said, it is a dinosaur; it hasn't \nchanged. We try to change the way we operate around here. The Federal \nGovernment is undergoing reorganization. But the Federal Reserve just \nkeeps on the same way it has been doing things year after year, and it \nnever changes.\n  I think perhaps we would be well advised to think of legislation to \nperhaps change some of the operations of the Fed and have a good \nhealthy debate on how the Fed is structured, what its responsibilities \nare, how nominees are selected, how they are approved and whether or \nnot we might want some different voices and different kinds of people \nperiodically on the Fed to take a look at what they are doing.\n  Should their meetings be secret? Should they be secret for 5 years? I \ndon't know. I tend to think they shouldn't be secret for 5 years. I \nhave said that one year might be an appropriate period of time. Some \nsaid why even a year? I had to think, why even a year?\n  I believe we must have some sort of time limit because you don't want \nmarkets to fluctuate drastically due to speculation on the Fed's \ndecisions. But, Mr. President, isn't it true that markets always \noperate the best when there is transparency? I have served on the \nAgriculture Committee for many years. I have looked at the commodities \nmarkets, and we have always said that when you have transparency, that \nis when markets function most efficiently. It is when things are hidden \nand no one knows what is going on and you have a few people making one \ndecision behind closed doors that affects thousands of others, that is \nwhat skews the market.\n  The market works best when there is transparency, and if you have a \nFederal Reserve System operating behind closed doors, with secret \nmeetings and their minutes are kept secret for 5 years, I believe that \nmore than anything skews the financial markets. Secrecy does not \nprovide for a more orderly functioning market system.\n  Mr. President, in all of this debate, we can talk about monetary \npolicy and what it all means. It gets kind of arcane and people's eyes \nget a little bit heavy. Sometimes we have to bring it home, who and \nwhat are we talking about. We are talking about Ken Bishop, a senior \nrecords clerk for AT in Morristown, NJ. This is an older story but \nstill very appropriate. Mr. Bishop has endured two rounds of layoffs, \ncommutes 110 miles a day, works two jobs, yet his family income remains \nstuck at $40,000 a year, right where it was 10 years ago. But 10 years \nago, he owned his own home; now he rents. His wife works two jobs at \ntimes, and he still owes money.\n  So when AT said it would lay off another 40,000 workers, the 48-\nyear-old Bishop said, ``You stop and look at this and say, ``When is it \nall going to end?'\"\n  Or it is about Cynthia Pollard. Two years ago, she was making $40,000 \na year selling computers. She wore suits and heels to work, lived in a \ntony Atlanta neighborhood and ate out often. Then the company closed \nits Government division and Pollard was laid off.\n  Between jobs without health insurance, she totaled her car \nand suffered a pinched nerve. Now she is a waitress earning half her \nformer salary, taking the bus to work, too exhausted from 14-hour days \nto even think about going out.\n\n  These are the people we are talking about. We are talking about \nlabor's share, working people's share of the national income.\n  Since 1993, it has been on a downward track. Capital share of growth \nin this country keeps going up and up. What that means is a further \nwidening of income and wealth in our Nation. The middle class is being \nshoved further and further down, and this chart shows it. This chart \nrepresents a change in the share of income received by each quintile, \neach 20 percent of our income earners in America. The top 20 percent of \nincome earners are getting an increasing share--this is a percentage--\nan increasing share of our national economy at the expense of the other \n80 percent.\n  The lowest 20 percent, that is low income. Obviously, they are \ngetting squeezed the hardest. Up here you have middle-income people and \ntheir share of our national income is going down as well.\n  I believe that spells a great danger for our country, more dangerous \nthan this specter or this fear or this ghost of inflation that the \nFederal Reserve System keeps saying they want to fight at any price. \nWell, this is the price we are paying right here, a tearing apart, I \nbelieve, of our American middle class.\n  Why? Why is it that unemployment can come down and inflation won't go \nup? Why is it that NAIRU is outdated and arcane? It is because we live \nin a new world where prices can decline because of fierce international \ncompetition?\n  For example, over the past few months, we have heard announcements \nfrom most of the major automakers. They are either going to hold their \n1998 model prices at the 1997 level or even lower because they are \nfacing competition both domestically and internationally. Companies are \nmore aggressive as they cut costs. There is a spreading anti-\ninflationary mentality among individual and corporate consumers.\n  For example, Larson Manufacturing, a storm door manufacturer with \noperations in my home State of Iowa, raised workers' wages by 4 percent \nover the past year despite pressures to keep his prices flat. Mr. Jack \nWelch, the CEO of General Electric, said: ``There is absolutely no \ninflation. There's no pricing power at all.''\n\n       All of this means we can have fuller employment, higher \n     incomes, a better share of our national income for labor, for \n     working people without having any inflation.\n\n  Again, I will quote an article by Greg Jaffe in the July 31 Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       Many economists are increasingly concluding that with \n     fundamental changes in the world of work--for now at least--\n     the unemployment rate does not mean exactly what they thought \n     it meant: There are far more\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\n     people than ever before who don't think of themselves as \n     unemployed but will take jobs they find appealing. Far more \n     people are available for employers than the unemployment rate \n     suggests.''\n\n  How many times do we pick up the paper and see that some company has \nopened a new division and they put out the hiring notice, and if the \nwages that they are paying are even modestly over minimum wage, they \ncan advertise for 200 positions and 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 people will \nshow up for jobs that pay just a little bit more than minimum wage? \nThis shows Americans are desperate for higher paying jobs. But to get \nhigher paying jobs, we need a healthy, vigorous, growing economy.\n  We also have to recognize that more people are entering the work \nforce, that combined with increasing productivity will allow our \neconomy to grow at a faster rate. We have a welfare-to-work program. We \nhave a lot of people on welfare that are now going to be coming into \nthe work force. And, quite frankly, we have a lot of women who have not \nentered the work force before who may float in and out of the work \nforce.\n  I will repeat again from the article by Mr. Peter Huber in the Forbes \nmagazine of September 8, 1997. He said:\n\n       Officially speaking, America hasn't yet discovered \n     microwave ovens or women's lib. Bone-weary though she may be, \n     the stay-at-home mother doesn't labor at all in the eyes of \n     employment statisticians. But she could, easily enough. With \n     one new mom working at a day care center, three other moms \n     can enter the official work force when they choose. So long \n     as many women remain ambivalent about where to work, in the \n     home or out, the supply of labor will remain far more elastic \n     than the statistics suggest. Memo to Alan Greenspan: Wire \n     roses to Gloria Steinem.\n\n  The article goes on to say that:\n\n       If the officially audited supply of labor keeps falling and \n     the price doesn't rise--\n\n  Which is what has been happening--\n\n     then we must either give up on economics completely or \n     conclude that there's more to the supply side of labor \n     markets than meets the official eye. Perhaps it's simply that \n     American women, Mexican men and Intel's progeny have all \n     become good substitutes for what the official statisticians \n     call U.S. labor.\n\n  Anyway, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Huber's \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Forbes, Sept. 8, 1997]\n\n    Wage Inflation? Where? (Labor Statistics Lose Predictive Value)\n\n                            (By Peter Huber)\n\n       HERE'S WHY STOCK PRICES are really supposed to fall. \n     Employment rates rise above some critical flash point. So \n     wages rise sharply. So prices of goods rise--just as rising \n     wages are boosting demand. Inflation soars. So interest rates \n     go up. Stock prices crash.\n       This is a perfectly sound theory, but it requires some \n     facts. Where's the critical flash point? Do the employment \n     statistics mean what they used to mean? Do they mean anything \n     at all?\n       Officially speaking, America hasn't yet discovered \n     microwave ovens or women's lib. Bone-weary though she may be, \n     the stay-at-home mother doesn't labor at all in the eyes of \n     employment statisticians. But she could, easily enough. With \n     one new mom working at a day care center, three other moms \n     can enter the official work force when they choose. So long \n     as many women remain ambivalent about where to work, in the \n     home or out, the supply of labor will remain far more elastic \n     than the statistics suggest. Memo to Alan Greenspan: Wire \n     roses to Gloria Steinem.\n       Labor markets have stretched into the home; they have also \n     spilled out of the country. A U.S. multinational doesn't \n     raise wages in Maine if it can shift production to a more \n     elastic labor market in Mexico. Even the all-American \n     producer in Kansas can't raise wages or prices much if it \n     competes against imports from a wage-stable Korea. Labor \n     statistics, in short, don't mean much unless they track where \n     goods are produced and consumed. The more transnational \n     economies become, the worse the tracking gets.\n       Then there's silicon. It takes a mix of capital and labor \n     to manufacture a mousetrap, and economists have always \n     allowed that the mix can change. In the past, however, the \n     substitution effects were slow. You could hire and fire \n     workers a lot faster than you could acquire or retire \n     machines and buildings. So ready supplies of capital didn't \n     discipline the price of labor in the short run.\n       Is that still true? Computers are getting easier to deploy, \n     smarter and--because of rapid innovation and falling costs--\n     shorter-lived. Many a manager can now expand production as \n     easily by investing an extra dollar in chips or software as \n     he can by hiring new workers. Technology can have a powerful \n     wage moderating effect long before silicon becomes a complete \n     substitute for sapiens. All it takes is enough substitution \n     at the margin.\n       The substitution is happening. Productivity, it now \n     appears, has been rising a good bit faster in recent years \n     than government statisticians recognized. Three new working \n     moms with computers produce as much as four old working dads \n     without. Add newly minted Pentiums to the ranks of those in \n     search of useful work, and unemployment statistics look very \n     different.\n       None of this will tell you whether to go long or short on \n     General Motors next week. It's just that the next release of \n     official labor statistics probably won't, either. Like a \n     drunk searching for his keys under the lamppost rather than \n     in the shadows where he lost them, the government \n     statistician counts where the counting is easy. But the three \n     great economic stories of our times--women in the work force, \n     global trade and information technology--offer no easy \n     counting at all. The counters are good with things that sit \n     still. Women, foreigners and chips keep moving.\n       This much we do know for sure. If the officially audited \n     supply of labor keeps falling and the price doesn't rise, \n     then we must either give up on economics completely or \n     conclude that there's more to the supply side of labor \n     markets than meets the official eye. Perhaps it's simply that \n     American women, Mexican men and Intel's progeny have all \n     become good substitutes for what the official statisticians \n     call United States labor. Maybe welfare reform is effectively \n     expanding labor pools, too. In any event, running out of old \n     bread creates neither famine nor inflation when there's a \n     glut of new cake.\n       According to official statistics and economic models, a \n     supply-side crisis in labor markets should have reignited \n     inflation some time ago. Investors may indeed be crazy to \n     ignore this indubitable, though theoretical, truth. But if \n     so, wage earners are crazier still--so crazy they don't raise \n     the price of their labor when they can. Then again, maybe \n     they can't.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I pointed out earlier, average economic growth over \nthe past 25 years has been a full percentage point lower than what its \naverage in the previous 100 years. Slow economic growth is a zero sum \ngame. There are going to be winners and there are going to be losers. \nUnfortunately, more Americans are finding themselves to be on the \nlosing end.\n  Over the past 2 and a half decades the losers have been hard-working \nAmerican families. And the winners--the winners have been the top 20 \npercent income earners in America.\n  The September 1, 1997, Business Week had an excellent article. It \ndescribed the plight of workers that I previously read about. There is \nthe story of Ted Oliver, a 27-year veteran of Con-Agra. I know that \ncompany well out in the Midwest. He works at the shipping dock of Con-\nAgra's Batesville, AR plant.\n\n       Last March, the employees of the plant got a 17 percent \n     raise over the next five years. While that may sound like a \n     lot, it is not.\n\n  I am quoting the article from Business Week.\n\n       Even though the 5 percent hike that took effect this year \n     pushed Mr. Oliver's hourly salary up to $8.96 an hour--\n\n  And mind you, he is a 27-year veteran of this company. He is now up \nto making $8.96 an hour--he and his coworkers earn less in real terms \nthan they did in 1988. In fact, he will still be behind his 1988 \nearnings levels when the entire raise kicks in. Despite his working 9 \nto 10 hour days, 6 days a week, and his wife working two jobs, Mr. \nOliver said, ``We've been strapped, and we're not even back to where we \nwere.''\n  Think about that. Think what that does to you as a family. You worked \nall these years, you think you get a decent raise, and yet you are not \neven where you were in 1988 in terms of your real income.\n  It is little wonder why the amount of personal debt keeps going up \nall the time.\n  Of course we have a movement afoot to change the bankruptcy laws so \npeople can't declare bankruptcy like they used to. I would suggest, Mr. \nPresident, before we go down that road we begin to find out why more \nand more Americans are going into debt and why they are piling up the \ndebts and why they are declaring bankruptcy to get out from underneath \nit--rather than us just rushing to pass legislation to make it harder \nfor people to pay off their debts.\n  I just also point out that Mr. Oliver's grand wages of $8.96 an hour, \nassuming a base 2,000-hour a year job, is less than $20,000 a year for \nhim and his family.\n  So the median family household income has not yet returned to its \npre-1989 level. That was the last year in which we had a recession. In \ntheory, periods of economic growth are supposed to allow wages and \nincomes to\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\nsurpass the levels enjoyed in prior years of economic growth. In a \ncapitalist society, we have periods of growth, and then we have a \nslowdown, and we have a growth again. In theory, each period of \neconomic growth should lead to an increase in incomes for all \nAmericans. But in this economic expansion incomes for most Americans \nhave not even caught up to the level we had for 1989.\n  Well, the bill for Alan Greenspan's slow-growth economic policies and \nhigh interest rates is coming due. As a recent editorial in the \nWashington Post said:\n\n       The United States is six years into an economic expansion, \n     with low inflation, low unemployment and a famously soaring \n     stock market. Yet the benefits of economic growth are not \n     filtering down as much as might be expected. Median household \n     income remains lower than in 1989, before the last recession.\n       The number of poor people in the United States did not \n     diminish in 1996 from the previous year, the poverty rate is \n     still higher than in 1989 and the number of those considered \n     very poor--[that is] earning less than one half of the \n     poverty threshold--actually increased in the last year. Wages \n     for men working full-time declined in 1996 by 0.9 percent \n     from the previous year.\n\n  Imagine that. Huge stock market boom. This top 20 percent getting \nmore and more money; members of Congress increasing their salaries. And \nyet wages for people working full-time declined last year by nine-\ntenths of a percent from the previous year.\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       Beneath these disappointing statistics is a trend of \n     increasing inequality . . . it seems to us that most \n     Americans aren't likely to be comfortable with an economy \n     that leaves one sector further and further behind. It's not a \n     recipe for future steady growth, nor for a healthy society.\n\n  We have heard a lot of talk about how the recent records in the stock \nmarket are benefiting millions of Americans. But that is not true. Over \n80 percent of the American people do not even own stock.\n  As a U.S. News & World Report article pointed out:\n\n       Middle Income Americans have most of their assets in their \n     home and [in] their savings, while the rich keep a higher \n     percentage of their wealth in financial instruments such as \n     stocks and bonds. Housing prices haven't kept pace with the \n     torrid stock market, and the middle class has virtually \n     stopped accumulating savings. While the wealthy have been \n     running up huge gains in the stock market, middle-income \n     Americans have been running up credit card debt to compensate \n     for stagnating wages.\n\n  That is what is happening. The solution to reversing these dangerous \ntrends is strong, sustained economic growth. The Federal Reserve has \nbeen on a course to try to limit economic growth to around 2.2 percent. \nAgain, we have exceeded that. No thanks to the Fed, but we have \nexceeded that. Yet the Fed is determined at all costs to keep that \ngrowth from increasing, and also at all costs to keep interest rates \nhigh.\n  The Federal Reserve doesn't seem willing to let American workers \nenjoy even modest gains in wages.\n  Lower unemployment and rising wages all tie back into this NAIRU \nconcept that I raised earlier in my statement. Again, NAIRU says that \nwhen unemployment drops below a certain level, employers will be forced \nto raise wages. Because of this, we will have inflation accelerate at \nan uncontrollable pace. That is a view supported at the Fed, and I am \nsorry to say, including the two nominees before us, Mr. Gramlich and \nMr. Ferguson.\n  Again, Mr. President, even Mr. Greenspan said in his March 5 \nHumphrey-Hawkins testimony that job insecurity is something to be \nwelcomed, ``If heightened job insecurity is the most significant \nexplanation of the break with the past in recent years, then it is \nimportant to recognize that * * * suppressed wage cost growth as a \nconsequence of job insecurity can only be carried so far. At some point \nthe tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an \nend.''\n  Well, I support the opinion of James Galbraith of the University of \nTexas, who said, ``Mr. Greenspan is concerned about the possibility \nthat the American worker might start to demand and receive a slightly \nbigger share of the economic growth that has occurred over the last \nseveral years. Repressing wages is the essential thing, and the way to \ndo that is to slow economic growth, raise unemployment, and make sure \nthat job insecurity that Mr. Greenspan explicitly credits for \nsuppressing wage growth does not diminish nor disappear.''\n  Again, this is what we are confronting. That is why I tried to take \nthis time to talk about monetary policy. We don't talk about it much in \nthe Senate and don't pay much attention to it, but the monetary policy \nof the Federal Reserve Board is having a devastating impact on American \nsociety. What it means is that real interest rates continue at an \nunnecessarily high level. It means that more and more moderate-income \nAmericans are paying unduly high interest rates for their homes and \ncars and their kids' college education. The high interest rates mean \nthat more and more income will go into corporate profits and less and \nless will go into weekly earnings of hard-working Americans. High \ninterest rates mean working Americans will rack up more and more debt, \nand it means a hidden tax on the American family.\n  A 1 percent increase in rates raises the average home mortgage by \nalmost $1,000 a year. A mortgage on a $115,000 house goes up $80 per \nmonth. A 1 percent increase in rates raises the payments for an average \nfarmer by $1,400 per year. A 1 percent increase in rates raised the \npayments for the average small business by $1,000 per year. These \ninterest payments amount to nothing more than a hidden tax on \nhardworking Americans. And unlike a tax, which you can reasonably argue \nthat at least it goes into the Government that is used to build better \nroads, better bridges, schools, health care and things like that, that \ndoesn't go there. The benefits of higher interest rates go to the top \n20 percent of Americans, who increasingly get more and more of the \nshare of our national income. Again, I believe our free-enterprise \nsystem and our capitalist system and our capitalist economy will be far \nbetter off if, instead of keeping wages low and keeping the bottom 80 \npercent of our income earners falling lower, if we had a more balanced \nmonetary policy in our nation. I believe our free enterprise system and \nour economy will be better off if the incomes and wealth of the top 20 \npercent grow at a proportion equal to the rest of society. If we do \nthat, then I believe we will have a vibrant, growing economy that will \nbe shared by all.\n  It is not going to happen unless we have a different mindset at the \nFederal Reserve System. I will continue to talk about this and will \ncontinue to fight for these policies as long as I am at least here in \nthe U.S. Senate. I hope we will get people on the Federal Reserve Board \nwho will bring a different view and a different opinion and who will \nnot be afraid to go out and state those opinions and engender a more \nhealthy, public debate.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, it would do my heart and my mind good, \nand I think the hearts and minds of the American people a lot of good, \nif we had a member of the Federal Reserve Board go out and start \ndebating and talking about a different method, a different way of \napproaching the monetary policies now in place at the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n\n  I think the last time we had that happen some of the powers that be \nat the Federal Reserve Board came down on that person pretty hard. But \nI think that debate has to happen, and I am hopeful it will happen \nthere, and it should happen here in the U.S. Senate. But we don't seem \nto be having that debate. We should have that debate because it means a \nlot to working Americans.\n  I sum up my comments by saying I didn't really want to unnecessarily \nhold up the appointments of Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. I know they \nwill go through by voice vote. That is fine with this Senator. But I \nthink more often than we have, we have to debate monetary policy here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate and what it means to the American \npeople. Just as war is too important to be left to the generals, so is \nmonetary policy too important just to be left to the bankers. We must \nalso include our small business people, our farmers, our consumers in \nthis debate and in the setting of the policy. That can only be done if \nwe have a good, healthy debate.\n  Again, to sum up, Mr. President, what we need at the Fed is a policy \nof lower interest rates that will help our wages go up for our working \nAmericans who have fallen too far behind so that they should get a fair \nshare of our growth. Those lower interest rates will\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\nalso mean our economy will grow at a faster rate, which I believe it \ncan. I believe the Federal Reserve is saying that the best economic \ngrowth we can hope for is the equivalent to a C average. I believe the \nworking people of this country can do a lot better than that. I think \nour productivity is such and our work force is such that we can do a B+ \nor an A. Why shouldn't we try for a higher rate of growth?\n  I also believe that a change in the monetary policy of the Federal \nReserve Board will mean that a lot of working Americans will have a \nlittle bit better lifestyle. Perhaps they can buy a better home with \nlower interest rates. Perhaps they can have a more decent car. Perhaps \nthey can take their wife or kids out to a local restaurant to eat once \nin a while. Nothing wrong with that. Perhaps they can take a nice \nvacation once a year. Nothing wrong with that, either. Perhaps they can \nborrow a little bit more money at a better interest rate to put their \nkids through college. Nothing wrong with that, either.\n  In sum, the Federal Reserve policies, if they are changed to reduce \nour interest rates, I believe can mean a better life for working \nAmericans all over our country. On the other hand, if the Fed continues \nits blind adherence to this arcane concept of NAIRU, if they continue \ntheir blind adherence to raising interest rates at merely the ghost of \ninflation, then I predict, Mr. President, that we are on the precipice \nof falling into a deflationary period in America. If that deflationary \nperiod happens, working Americans are going to be hit a lot harder than \nthey ever would be by a small or modest increase in inflation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I expect that the Senate will give \nits approval to President Clinton's nomination of Dr. Edward Gramlich. \nThis will bring the career of this distinguished University of Michigan \nprofessor full circle. Thirty-two years ago, Dr. Gramlich had his first \nprofessional experience with a research job at the Federal Reserve. \nShortly, he will be returning to the place where he got his start in \n1965, although this time he will not be a researcher but a Member of \nthe Board.\n  Dr. Gramlich received his BA from Williams College and his MA and \nPh.D. from Yale University. Since then he has held positions in a \nvariety of government and academic areas. His academic positions \ninclude over 20 years at the University of Michigan as Dean of the \nSchool of Public Policy, Chairman of the Economics Department, Director \nof the Institute of Public Policy Studies and always Professor of \nEconomics and Public Policy. He also held temporary positions at \nvarious other universities including Monash, George Washington, Cornell \nand Stockholm Universities.\n  Dr. Gramlich's government and research experience covers a wide range \nof subject areas. In 1970, he was the Director of the Public Research \nDivision at the Office of Economic Opportunity where he studied \neconomically efficient ways of dealing with poverty. In his capacity as \nDeputy and later Acting Director of the Congressional Budget Office, he \nworked to reduce the burgeoning deficits of the mid-1980s. While \nworking on the Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security, he \nproposed a plan to preserve the social protections now built into \nSocial Security while providing for enough total saving so that future \nretirement benefits can be preserved. In addition, Dr. Gramlich has \nwritten dozens of journal articles and reports on issues ranging from \nSocial Security and school finances to Major League Baseball and \ndeficit reduction.\n  In Dr. Gramlich's testimony before the Banking Committee hearing on \nhis nomination, he said, ``I strongly feel that both economic and \nsocial goals are important. . . . A good economist should know how to \nbalance both objectives, which is what I have tried to do throughout my \ncareer.'' This philosophy culled from his substantial experience has \nserved his well in many capacities. The Banking Committee showed its \nfull confidence in him in voting to approve the nomination, and I fully \nexpect him to fulfill the expectations that the President and the \nSenate have placed in him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield back all the time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Gramlich, of Virginia, to be a \nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the \nunexpired term of 14 years from February 1, 1994?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n            VOTE ON THE NOMINATION OF ROGER WALTON FERGUSON\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GEN. ANSEL M. STROUD, JR.--AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nLouisiana's own true American heroes, Major General Ansel M. Stroud, \nJr., Adjutant General for the State of Louisiana.\n  A native of Shreveport, Louisiana, General Stroud began his \ndistinguished career in April of 1944, when he enlisted in the United \nStates Army and was commissioned a second lieutenant following \ncompletion of Officer Candidate School in 1946. After serving active \nduty, he joined the Louisiana National Guard in June of 1947. During \nhis service with the National Guard, he has served as a reconnaissance \nofficer, company commander, regimental supply officer, aide to the \ncommanding general of the 39th Infantry Division, and battalion \ncommander. In 1968, he was assigned as Chief of Staff for the State \nEmergency Operations Center, and became commander of the 356th Support \nCenter (RAO) in 1971. He was appointed to the position of Assistant \nAdjutant General on May 9, 1972, and in August 1978 accepted a dual \nassignment as the commander of the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized). \nIn October 1980, General Stroud accepted his current position of \nAdjutant General for Louisiana.\n  When reminiscing about General Stroud's career, one could easily \npoint to his many military decoration and awards: most notably included \nare the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two Oak \nLeaf Clusters, the Meritorious Service Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, \nthe Army Commendation Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the \nLouisiana Distinguished Service Medal, the Louisiana Cross of Merit and \nthe Louisiana Emergency Service Medal with 19 Fleurs-de-lis just to \nname a few of the honors bestowed upon him. One can also see the direct \nimpact his time in the Armed Services has made with such works as the \n``Stroud Study.'' When General Stroud was selected to conduct a \nDepartment of Army study on full-time training and administration for \nthe Guard and Reserve, his Study was accepted as a guideline for \nrequirements of the National Guard and Army Reserve for full-time \nmanning programs and was the basis for launching the AGR program.\n  In addition to his duties as Adjutant General, there are many other \nareas of service in which he has fulfilled with great distinction: the \nBoy Scouts of America in which he earned the Silver Beaver Award and \nthe Distinguished Eagle Scout Award; past-president of the Adjutants \nGeneral Association of the United States; past-president of the \nNational Guard Association of the United States; and service as a \nmember of the Federal Emergency Management\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\nAgency's Advisory Board representing the National Guard Association of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I would, however, be remiss if I did not mention what \nI feel has been one of the most important aspects of the General's \nservice to Louisiana: serving as the Director of the Louisiana Office \nof Emergency Preparedness (LOEP). Throughout the years, Louisianas have \nbecome all too familiar with life-threatening dangers presented by \nmother nature at her worst. General Stroud has certainly taken the \nmotto ``be prepared'' to heart by ensuring that Louisiana is capable of \nhandling the impact of natural disasters with order and efficiency. \nUnder his supervision, operations at LOEP have undergone state-of-the \nart advances which have allowed personnel to provide immediate \nassistance to citizens affected by nature's fury.\n  Mr. President, many individuals have a calling to serve the public in \na variety of ways. They make sacrifices to contribute their talents to \nthe safety, security and well-being of others. These are the \nindividuals whose commitment to excellence and selfless dedication are \nevident through their leadership and the challenges they choose to \naccept. On November 8, 1997, General Ansel Stroud will relinquish his \npresent position as Adjutant General, a position he has dutifully held \nfor over seventeen years of his fifty-three years of service to our \ncountry. Although he is leaving the realm of public service, the \ncontributions he has made to the greater good of the State of Louisiana \nwill continue to have affect for years to come. It is my most sincere \nwish that General Stroud and Jane, his wife, will reap all the best \nwhich life has to offer, May God bless and God speed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11442-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this has been an extraordinary week in \nWashington with the first State visit by the Chinese leadership since \n1989. While President Jiang Zemin's visit has resulted in important \nagreements on economic, environmental and security issues between our \ntwo nations, it has not resulted in the hoped for progress on human \nrights issues in China.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan scholar and \ndocumentary filmmaker who was a Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College \nin Vermont. In 1995 he had gone to Tibet to document traditional \nTibetan music and dance when he was detained by Chinese authorities and \nthen sentenced to 18 years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of \nthe Dalai Lama. No evidence to support these claims has ever been \nproduced, despite my persistent inquiries. Nor have the Chinese \nauthorities provided any information about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts \nor health status over the past two years. I have raised these concerns \nwith President Jiang directly, emphasizing to him that Mr. Choephel's \nrelease from prison would be a meaningful step in the right direction \non human rights issues. Yesterday and today in meetings with the \nChinese President, I raised this human rights issue, again.\n  The gulf between our two countries can most clearly be seen on the \nissue of human rights. This week demonstrates the distance between our \ntwo countries in another way as the Senate considers President \nClinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in charge of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department \nof Justice. When confirmed, Bill Lee will be the principal law \nenforcement officer of the Federal Government to ensure the civil \nrights and equal treatment of all Americans. He will also be the first \nAsian-American to hold this post and exercise such authority.\n  A meaningful step the Senate should take without delay is to confirm \nBill Lee, a Chinese-American whose life story and life's work are \nquintessentially American. At the same time we are urging the Chinese \nGovernment to improve their human rights' record, we should demonstrate \nthrough action and not just words our own commitment to human rights \nand civil rights by proceeding without further delay on this important \nnomination.\n  Mr. Lee was born in Harlem to Chinese immigrant parents. His parents \nran a laundry in New York. He went on to graduate from Yale College \nmagna cum laude and then Columbia Law School. He testified last week \nthat his childhood experiences, which included hearing racial slurs \ndirected at his parents and his father's inability to rent an apartment \nafter returning from volunteering for military service in World War II, \ngreatly influenced his decision to dedicate his life to civil rights \nwork. Mr. Lee's efforts over the years have ensured Americans of all \nraces and creeds opportunities to advance in their careers, remain in \ntheir homes and raise healthy children.\n  Since July, Senator Kennedy and I repeatedly urged the committee to \nhold a hearing on Mr. Lee's nomination before the Columbus Day recess \nin order to give this important nomination an opportunity to be \nconsidered by the Senate this year. Unfortunately that hearing only \ntook place last week. Chairman Hatch has consistently indicated his \ncommitment to getting this nomination considered before adjournment.\n  At the hearing, Mr. Lee answered hours of questions. The Republican \nmembers of the committee and the majority leader also submitted pages \nof written questions to him, which have also been answered. All members \nof the committee have met or had the opportunity to meet with the \nnominee personally. Unfortunately there was no business meeting of the \nJudiciary Committee this week. I have asked the chairman to report this \nnomination to the Senate without delay and hope that he will do so.\n  Bill Lee is a nominee who has impressed everyone with whom he has \nmet. He is a man of integrity who has practiced mainstream civil rights \nlaw for 23 years. He is a practical problem solver, as attested to in \ntributes from opposing counsel and people from both political parties.\n  Chairman Hatch has clearly indicated that he views Bill Lee as \nimminently qualified for the Assistant Attorney General position at \nDepartment of Justice. At Mr. Lee's nomination\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nhearing last Wednesday, Senator Hatch referred to Bill Lee's ``long and \ndistinguished career'' and noted his ``commitment to improving the \nlives of many Americans who have felt the sting of invidious \ndiscrimination.'' These comments are encouraging.\n  Senator Hatch has been stalwart in moving a number of top Justice \nDepartment nominees through the committee promptly. As examples, I \npoint to the nomination of Eric Holder to be the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, Ray Fisher to be the Associate Attorney General, and Joel \nKlein to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division.\n  In connection with the confirmation of Assistant Attorney General \nKlein, Senator Hatch said:\n  ``I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee hostage \nbecause of such concerns, especially one as competent and decent as \nJoel Klein. In my view, sound public policy is best served by bringing \nthis nominee up for a vote, permitting the Justice Department to \nproceed with a confirmed chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in \nCongress to move forward and work with the Department and other \ninvolved agencies in the formulation and implementation of \ntelecommunications policies.''\n  ``There are times when I disagree with the President, but I have to \nsay when he does a good job and when he does nominate good people . . . \nthen I will support the President.\n  ``I will do what I can to show support for him and to encourage him \nto continue to pick the highest quality people for these positions.''\n  Adhering to that policy should lead us to a prompt and favorable vote \non Mr. Lee.\n  At the recent nomination hearing of Ray Fisher, Senator Hatch assured \nthe administration that ``nominees for the Department of Justice will \ncontinue to receive thorough and prompt consideration by the \ncommittee.'' I am hopeful that Senator Hatch will apply this same \nstandard to Mr. Lee's nomination.\n  I look forward to the vote on Bill Lee, a stellar nominee to head the \nOffice of Civil Rights at Department of Justice. Mr. Lee's recent \ndecision to recuse himself from any involvement in the Proposition 209 \ncase further reflects his integrity and forthrightness on these sorts \nof matters.\n  Bill Lee's story is a true American saga. Raised by immigrants, in \none generation he has risen to the top of his profession and is now \nbeing considered to head the Nation's civil rights division. Let us \nmake sure the story ends the way it should--with the confirmation of \nMr. Lee as Assistant Attorney General before we adjourn this session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11443-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUPPORTING NANCY-ANN MIN DEPARLE'S NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In June, the President nominated Nancy-Ann Min DeParle \nto be Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA]. \nWhen confirmed as the Head of HCFA, Ms. DeParle will be responsible for \nrunning Medicare, Medicaid, and the new children's health program, and \nprovide valuable direction for other important health insurance \ninitiatives. More than 70 million Americans--senior citizens, children, \npersons with disabilities and others--depend on these programs for \nlifesaving health care. Leaving this critically important agency \nwithout a leader during this challenging time is irresponsible and \nindefensible, and I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm her \nnomination.\n  It is especially offensive that a Senator is holding this nomination \nhostage in order to extract a concession from the President on an HCFA-\nrelated issue. We all want things from HCFA, and those issues should be \nresolved as part of the legislative process, not by denying this \nimportant Federal agency the leadership it needs.\n  At this moment, a large number of Medicaid waivers are pending from \nStates that want flexibility to go beyond the current rules. Hundreds, \nperhaps thousands, of decisions must be made regarding implementation \nof the Medicare provisions in the Balanced Budget Act--including the \nestablishment of important new preventive benefits. This historic \nlegislation also included the largest health insurance expansion since \nthe creation of Medicare and Medicaid. It provides health insurance to \nuninsured children in working families who earn too much to qualify for \nMedicaid but not enough to purchase private health insurance. We all \nworked hard for this program. All 50 States will be submitting their \nplans for this coverage in the coming months and HCFA needs to take \naction.\n  Ms. DeParle is extremely well-qualified to lead HCFA. She served from \n1993 to 1997 as the Associate Director for Health and Personnel at the \nOffice of Management and Budget. In this capacity, she guided the \ndevelopment and implementation of budget and policy matters for all \nFederal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition \nto other accomplishments, she has extensive experience running a state-\nlevel cabinet agency. From 1987 to 1989, she administered a 6,000-\nemployee agency as commissioner of human services in Tennessee.\n  No significant objection to her nomination was raised at the Finance \nCommittee hearing in September. She was approved unanimously by the \ncommittee on September 11, and she has been waiting since that day for \nthe full Senate to act. It is long past time for the Senate to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11444-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE CENTER FOR ADVANCED SIMULATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

I would be pleased to accommodate the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator. I first would like to commend my \nfriend and colleague from Alabama for the fine leadership he has shown \nin crafting the fiscal year 1998 Transportation Appropriations bill. He \nhas done a wonderful job in allocating scarce federal resources \nequitably for New York and the entire nation for highway, transit, rail \nand other infrastructure needs.\n  I ask my colleague if he is familiar with an intermodal \ntransportation simulation and technology project on Long Island called \nthe Center for Advanced Simulation and Technology (CAST)?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am familiar with it. This project is being developed at \nthe National Aviation and Transportation Center on Long Island and is \nanticipated to provide an intermodal transportation simulation \ntraining, education and planning asset for the entire nation. A total \nof $19.5 million in federal funding over the next five years has been \ndetermined by officials at the National Aviation and Transportation \nCenter as needed to help carry out this project. According to these \nsame officials, this level of federal funding is expected to trigger at \nleast $5 million in private sector contributions and up to $7.5 million \nin funding from New York State.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. As my friend knows, no specific appropriation was \nprovided in the fiscal year 1998 conference agreement to allow CAST to \ngo forward in this fiscal year. Therefore, I would like to work with \nthe Chairman, the Long Island Congressional delegation and the \nDepartment of Transportation in an effort to find a source of funding \nto continue work on CAST in this fiscal year.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Senator from New York has my assurance \nthat I will work with him to try and identify a source of funding that \nwill allow the CAST effort to commence in fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, as my colleagues no doubt are aware, I \njoined with Senator Hollings, to submit a concurrent resolution (S. \nCon. Res. 52) to reaffirm the Senate's support for the traditional, \nsimple, and honest use of the ``Made in U.S.A.'' label. That use was in \naccordance with the long-standing rule that articles so labelled be \nmade ``all or virtually all'' in the United States.

As we said in that letter, ``Any definition or enforcement \nstandard of `all or virtually all' that would allow more than a de \nminimis level of foreign content is unacceptable to us and, we strongly \nbelieve, would be unacceptable to the Congress.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1997.\n     Hon.

In light of recent press reports of possible \n     Commission consideration of a new proposal to lower the \n     ``Made in USA'' label standard to 89 percent U.S. domestic \n     content, we felt compelled to reiterate what growing numbers \n     of our colleagues in the Congress on both sides of the aisle \n     are saying: neither we nor the American people will tolerate \n     any lowering of the standard for the ``Made in USA'' label.\n       In its proposed guidelines issued last May, the Commission \n     itself described the current standard as follows:\n       ``Cases brought by the Commission beginning over 50 years \n     ago established the principle that it was deceptive for a \n     marketer to promote a product with an unqualified `Made in \n     USA' claim unless that product was wholly of domestic origin. \n     Recently, this standard had been rearticulated to require \n     that a product advertised as `Made in USA' be `all or \n     virtually all' made in the United States, i.e., that all or \n     virtually all of the parts are in the U.S. and all or \n     virtually all of the labor is performed in the U.S. In both \n     cases, however, the import has been the same: unqualified \n     claims of domestic origin were deemed to imply to consumers \n     that the product for which the claims were made was in all \n     but de minimis amounts made in the U.S.A.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Federal Trade Commission Request for Public Comment on \n     Proposed Guides for the Use of U.S. Origin Claims, Federal \n     Register, Vol. 62, No. 88, May 7, 1997, p. 25050.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Clearly, an 89 percent U.S. Content standard would allow \n     much more than a de minimis amount of foreign content and \n     therefore would lower the standard for the use of the ``Made \n     in USA'' label.\n       We the undersigned introduced legislation in both the House \n     and Senate (H. Con. Res. 80 and S. Con. Res. 52, \n     respectively) to specifically condemn any lowering of the \n     standard for the use of the ``Made in USA'' label. H. Con. \n     Res. 80 has now been cosponsored by 219 Representatives, a \n     majority of the U.S. House (see enclosed cosponsor list). We \n     note that these Members do not just represent votes against \n     any weakening of the label. But are Members who felt strongly \n     enough about this issue to join with us as cosponsors of this \n     legislation. S. Con. Res. 52, while introduced only recently \n     is receiving the same favorable reception as its companion in \n     the House.\n       The language of these Resolutions is clear and to the \n     point: ``Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That the Congress (1) maintains that the \n     standard for the ``Made in USA'' label should continue to be \n     that a product was all or virtually all made in the United \n     States; (2) urges the Federal Trade Commission to refrain \n     from lowering this standard at the expense of consumers and \n     jobs in the United States.''\n       Any definition or enforcement standard of ``all or \n     virtually all'' that would allow more than a de minimis level \n     of foreign content is unacceptable to us and, we strongly \n     believe, would be unacceptable to the Congress.\n       We urge you to reject any recommendation to lower the \n     current standard for the use of the ``Made in USA'' label and \n     to enforce vigorously the current standard.\n       Thank you very much.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Dingell,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Ernest Hollings,\n       United States Senate.\n     Bob Franks,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Spencer Abraham,\n       United States Senate.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I have been informed that the FTC will soon make an \nannouncement regarding the ``Made in USA'' label, probably next week. I \nam hopeful that the FTC will maintain the current standard, and urge my \ncolleagues to contact the FTC to add their voices to the chorus calling \nfor that decision.\n  I believe it is crucial for American workers and the American economy \nthat we maintain the integrity of the ``Made in USA'' label. For over \n50 years, consumer goods have worn this label when, and only when, they \nwere made ``all or virtually all'' in the United States.\n  But recently the (FTC) announced plans to soften that rule, allowing \ncompanies to use the label any product on which they spent 75% of their \ntotal manufacturing costs, provided the product was last \n``substantially transformed'' here in the United States. A product also \ncould be labeled ``Made in USA'' if that product, and all its \nsignificant parts and other inputs, were last substantially transformed \nin the United States.\n  In practice, this means that products containing no materials or \nparts of U.S. origin could nonetheless be labeled ``Made in USA.''\n  I believe that would be wrong, These new rules would be a slap in the \nface to American workers. They also would in effect condone false \nadvertising. Many Americans look specifically for the ``Made in USA'' \nlabel because they want to support American workers. These loyal \nAmericans do not believe that they are purchasing products ``mostly'' \nmade in the USA, let alone products for which ``most manufacturing \ncosts'' were incurred in the USA, or which were ``substantially \ntransformed'' in the USA. Quite rightly, consumers who look for the \n``Made in USA'' label believe that when they purchase a product with \nthat label they are getting something made all or virtually all in the \nUnited States.\n  Perhaps worst of all, Mr. President, these new rules will hurt \nAmerican workers. Many companies have invested a great deal in plant \nand equipment, as well as hiring and training, in the United States. \nThese companies have a right to expect that the ``Made in USA'' label, \nwhich they have worked so hard to earn and maintain, will continue to \napply only to products made all, or virtually all, in the United \nStates. If they lose that advantage, these companies may well decide to \nmove some or all of their production--and American jobs--overseas.\n  To dilute the requirement for use of the ``Made in USA'' label would \nbe to lower the value of that label. It would allow companies operating \nsubstantially overseas to deceive American consumers who are attempting \nto support truly American made products and workers. It would \ndiscourage companies from investing in this country by telling them, in \neffect, that they will no longer receive any benefit for keeping jobs \nat home. The result would be a loss of American jobs and morale, as \nwell as a critical blow to consumer confidence in the veracity of \nproduct labels.\n  The American people have a right to expect that the ``Made in USA'' \nlabel will mean what it says. For over 50 years they have depended on \nthat label to assure them that they are purchasing products made ``all \nor virtually all'' in the United States. I again call on the FTC to \nmaintain the traditional standard for labelling products ``Made in \nUSA,'' and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11444-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11445-S11446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  REPORT CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 76\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153 \n(b), (d)), the text of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nFederative Republic of Brazil Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear \nEnergy, with accompanying annex and agreed minute. I am also pleased to \ntransmit my written approval, authorization, and determination \nconcerning the agreement, and the memorandum of the Director of the \nUnited States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear \nProliferation Assessment Statement concerning the agreement. The joint \nmemorandum submitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary \nof Energy, which includes a summary of the provisions of the agreement \nand various other attachments, including agency views, is also \nenclosed.\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\n  The proposed agreement with Brazil has been negotiated in accordance \nwith the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Act of 1978 and as otherwise amended. In my judgment, the \nproposed agreement meets all statutory requirements and will advance \nthe nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United \nStates. The agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation between the United States and Brazil under \nappropriate conditions and controls reflecting a strong common \ncommitment to nuclear nonproliferation goals.\n  The proposed new agreement will replace an existing United States-\nBrazil agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation that entered into \nforce on September 20, 1972, and by its terms would expire on September \n20, 2002. The United States suspended cooperation with Brazil under the \n1972 agreement in the late 1970s because Brazil did not satisfy a \nprovision of section 128 of the Atomic Energy Act (added by the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Act of 1978) that required full-scope International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in nonnuclear weapon states such \nas Brazil as a condition for continued significant U.S. nuclear \nexports.\n  On December 13, 1991, Brazil, together with Argentina, the Brazilian-\nArgentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials \n(ABAAC) and the IAEA signed a quadrilateral agreement calling for the \napplication of full-scope IAEA safeguards in Brazil and Argentina. This \nsafeguards agreement was brought into force on March 4, 1994. \nResumption of cooperation would be possible under the 1972 United \nStates-Brazil agreement for cooperation. However, both the United \nStates and Brazil believe it is preferable to launch a new era of \ncooperation with a new agreement that reflects, among other things:\n  --An updating of terms and conditions to take account of intervening \n    changes in the respective domestic legal and regulatory frameworks \n    of the Parties in the area of peaceful nuclear cooperation;\n  --Reciprocity in the application of the terms and conditions of \n    cooperation between the Parties; and\n  --Additional international nonproliferation commitments entered into \n    by the Parties since 1972.\n  Over the past several years Brazil has made a definitive break with \nearlier ambivalent nuclear policies and has embraced wholeheartedly a \nseries of important steps demonstrating its firm commitment to the \nexclusively peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In addition to its full-\nscope safeguards agreement with the IAEA, Brazil has taken the \nfollowing important nonproliferation steps:\n  --It has formally renounced nuclear weapons development in the Foz do \n    Iguazsu declaration with Argentina in 1990;\n  --It has renounced ``peaceful nuclear explosives'' in the 1991 Treaty \n    of Guadalajara with Argentina;\n  --It has brought the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in \n    Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) into force \n    for itself on May 30, 1994;\n  --It has instituted more stringent domestic controls on nuclear \n    exports and become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group; and\n  --It has announced its intention, on June 20, 1997, to accede to the \n    Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n  The proposed new agreement with Brazil permits the transfer of \ntechnology, material, equipment (including reactors), and components \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It provides for U.S. \nconsent rights to retransfers, enrichment, and reprocessing as required \nby U.S. law. It does not permit transfers of any sensitive nuclear \ntechnology, restricted data, or sensitive nuclear facilities or major \ncritical components thereof. In the event of termination key conditions \nand controls continue with respect to material and equipment subject to \nthe agreement.\n  From the U.S. perspective, the proposed new agreement improves on the \n1972 agreement by the addition of a number of important provisions. \nThese include the provisions for full-scope safeguards; perpetuity of \nsafeguards; a ban on ``peaceful'' nuclear explosives using items \nsubject to the agreement; a right to require the return of items \nsubject to the agreement in all circumstances for which U.S. law \nrequires such a right; a guarantee of adequate physical security; and \nrights to approve enrichment of uranium subject to the agreement and \nalteration in form or consent of sensitive nuclear material subject to \nthe agreement.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. The Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House International Relations Committees as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 b., the 60-day continuous session provided \nfor in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to target \nassistance to support the economic and political independence of the \ncountries of South Caucasus and Central Asia; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n                   The Silk Road Strategy Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am introducing the Silk Road Strategy \nAct of 1977. This is an overarching policy between the countries of the \nSouth Caucasus and Central Asia, which includes the countries of \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Those are not common names to most \nAmericans, but the area of the world that they are around, the Caspian \nSea, I think, is going to become far more common knowledge to many \nAmericans, as there is 4 trillion dollars worth of known oil and gas in \nthe region.\n  The region is reaching out to us. They are seeking to put off the \nRussian imperialism that has been in the region for years and seeking \nto get away from Iranian influence in the area.\n  Thus, we are putting forward this Silk Road strategy as an active and \npositive role in reviving the economies of this region of the world and \nto building them as major forces.\n  I think the United States has a vital political, social and economic \ninterest in the region, and we need to act now rather than later. I \ndon't think our window of opportunity in working with these countries \nas they seek freedom and yearn to be free and build opportunity for \ntheir people is long. Probably within the next 3 years, they are going \nto be making courses and decisions that will decide the long-term fate \nof the people of this region.\n  They seek to be united with the United States. I ask, overall, that \nmy colleagues look at this potential opportunity, at this bill and \nsupport the Silk Road Strategy Act of 1997. It is a key interest area \nfor us and our future.\n  This bill is aimed at focusing the attention of U.S. policy on the \nneed to play an active and positive role in reviving the economies of \nthese parts of the ancient Silk Road which was once the economic \nlifeline of Central Asia and the South Caucasus and the main \ntransportation corridor to Europe and the West.\n  The United States has vital political, social, and economic interests \nthere and they need to be acted on now, before it is too late. These \ncountries are at an historic crossroad: They are independent for the \nfirst time in almost a century, located at the juncture of many of \ntoday's major world forces and they are all rich in natural resources. \nThey are emerging from almost a century of plunder by a Communist \nregime which, while it actively drained their resources, put little \nback. They now find themselves free to govern themselves, and they are \nlooking west.\n  The very fact that they have little experience of independence and \nthat their economies are essentially starting from scratch, leaves them \nin a precarious situation, which is all the more precarious because of \ntheir geographic location: consider this: They are placed between the \nEmpire from which they recently declared independence and an extremist \nIslamic regime to the south--both of which have a strong interest in \nexerting economic and political pressure upon them.\n  These countries are very important to us:\n  They are a major force in containing the spread northward of anti-\nwestern Iranian extremism. Though Iranian activity in the region has \nbeen less blatant than elsewhere in the world, they are working very \nhard to bring the region into their sphere of influence and economic \ncontrol.\n  The Caspian Sea basin contains proven oil and gas reserves which, \npotentially, could rank third in the world after the Middle East and \nRussia and exceed $4 trillion in value. Investment in this region could \nultimately reduce United States dependence on oil imports from the \nvolatile Persian Gulf and could provide regional supplies as an \nalternative to Iranian sources.\n  Strong market economies near Russia and China can only help to \npositively influence these two countries on their rocky path toward \nfreedom.\n  Finally, this region offers us a historic opportunity to spread \nfreedom and democratic ideals. After years of fighting communism in \nthis region, the doors are open to promote institutions of democratic \ngovernment and to create the conditions for the growth of pluralistic \nsocieties, including religious tolerance.\n  The single best way to consolidate our goals in the region is to \npromote regional cooperation and policies which will strengthen the \nsovereignty of each nation. Each of these countries has its own \nindividual needs; however, many of the problems in the region overlap \nand are shared, and a number of common solutions and approaches can \napply. This bill encourages this goal.\n  All of the Silk Road countries are currently seeking U.S. investment \nand encouragement, and they are looking to us to assist them in working \nout regional political, economic and strategic cooperation. This bill \nauthorizes assistance in all these areas.\n  Given the correct infrastructure development, this region is and will \ncontinue to become, a key transit point that will ultimately link \nCentral Asia with the West--as it did in the time when caravans \ntraveled along these same routes in the Middle Ages.\n\n  Opportunities to assist this infrastructure development abound--\ntaking advantage of these opportunities could not only cement political \nties, but commercial and economic ones as well.\n  The United States should do everything possible to promote this \nsovereignty and independence, as well as encourage solid diplomatic and \neconomic cooperation between these nations.\n  In order to do this we need to take a number of positive steps: We \nshould be strong and active in helping to resolve local conflicts; we \nshould be providing economic assistance to provide positive incentives \nfor international private investments and increased trade; we should be \nassisting in the development of infrastructure necessary for \ncommunities, transportation, and energy and trade on an East-West axis; \nwe should be providing security assistance to help fight the scourge of \nnarcotics trafficking, the spread of weapons of mass destruction and \nthe spread or organized crime; and--perhaps the most important of all--\nwe should be supplying all the assistance possible to strengthen \ndemocracy, tolerance and the development of civil society. These are \nthe best ways to insure these countries remain independent and strong \nand that they move toward open and free government.\n  Mr. President, the time to focus and act in this region is now. We \nhave the opportunity to help these countries rebuild from the ground up \nand to encourage them to continue their strong independent stances, \nespecially in relation to Iran and the spread of extremist, anti-\nWestern fundamentalism, which is one of the most clear and present \ndangers facing the United States today. I hope my colleagues will join \nme and support his bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Silk Road Strategy Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\n       (1) The ancient Silk Road, once the economic lifeline of \n     Central Asia and the South Caucasus, traversed much of the \n     territory now within the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, \n     Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \n     Uzbekistan.\n       (2) Economic interdependence spurred mutual cooperation \n     among the peoples along the Silk Road and restoration of the \n     historic relationships and economic ties between those \n     peoples is an important element of ensuring their sovereignty \n     as well as the success of democratic and market reforms.\n       (3) The development of strong political and economic ties \n     between countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia and \n     the West will foster stability in the region.\n       (4) The development of open market economies and open \n     democratic systems in the countries of the South Caucasus and \n     Central Asia will provide positive incentives for \n     international private investment, increased trade, and other \n     forms of commercial interactions with the rest of the world.\n       (5) The Caspian Sea Basin, overlapping the territory of the \n     countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, contains \n     proven oil and gas reserves that may exceed \n     $4,000,000,000,000 in value.\n       (6) The region of the South Caucasus and Central Asia will \n     produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the \n     dependence of the United States on energy from the volatile \n     Persian Gulf region.\n       (7) United States foreign policy and international \n     assistance should be narrowly targeted to support the \n     economic and political independence of the countries of the \n     South Caucasus and Central Asia.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States in the \n     countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia--\n       (1) to promote and strengthen independence, sovereignty, \n     and democratic government;\n       (2) to assist actively in the resolution of regional \n     conflicts;\n       (3) to promote friendly relations and economic cooperation;\n       (4) to help promote market-oriented principles and \n     practices;\n       (5) to assist in the development of the infrastructure \n     necessary for communications, transportation, and energy and \n     trade on an East-West axis in order to build strong \n     international relations and commerce between those countries \n     and the stable, democratic, and market-oriented countries of \n     the Euro-Atlantic Community; and\n       (6) to support United States business interests and \n     investments in the region.\n\n     SEC. 4. UNITED STATES EFFORTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN \n                   GEORGIA, AZERBAIJAN, AND TAJIKISTAN.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should use \n     all diplomatic means practicable, including the engagement of \n     senior United States Government officials, to press for an \n     equitable, fair, and permanent resolution to the conflicts in \n     Georgia and Azerbaijan and the civil war in Tajikistan.\n\n     SEC. 5.

The United States deserves to be extremely proud of the medical \nadvances and efforts that have extended our people's life expectancy \nand our ability to overcome disease and medical setbacks. But we need \nto take some additional, tangible steps to also make progress in the \npractices and care that affect our citizens when they ultimately face \ndeath or the real possibility of death. Our bill provides some of those \nsteps.\n  While this is a difficult area to discuss, it is a very real area for \nAmericans year in and year out. This is legislation designed to respond \nto pressing needs of patients, their family members, and their health \ncare providers, and I hope that Congress will adopt these steps in the \nnext year.\n  In view of the debate this year on physician assisted suicide and \nfrom my own personal experiences, I have spent considerable time \ndelving into the concerns and dilemmas that face patients, their family \nmembers, and their physicians when confronted with death or the \npossibility of dying. In almost all such difficult situations, people \nare not thinking about physician-assisted suicide. The needs and \ndilemmas that confront them have much more to do with the kind of care \nand information that they need, often desperately.\n  The legislation we are introducing today builds on bipartisan \nlegislation enacted in 1990, called the Patient Self-Determination Act. \nThat legislation was championed by my former colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Danforth. I held a subcommittee hearing on Senator Danforth's \nlegislation and it became very clear that the lack of a national policy \non advance directives was not acceptable. As a result of that bill, \nhospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospice \nprograms, and HMO's participating in the Medicaid and Medicare programs \nmust provide every adult receiving medical care with written \ninformation concerning patient involvement in their own treatment \ndecisions. The health care institutions must also document in the \nmedical record whether the patient has an advance directive. In \naddition, States were required to write description of their State laws \nconcerning advance directives.\n  Mr. President, at the time of that bill's enactment, we realized that \nit was only the first step toward increasing public awareness and \naddressing\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\nsome very difficult issues related to end-of-life care. As a result of \nthat legislation, a growing number of Americans do have advance \ndirectives. But recent studies have found that the majority of \nAmericans have not discussed end-of-life issues with their families or \ntheir physicians and have not relayed their treatment preferences \neither verbally or in writing.\n  There is also an increasing awareness that physicians and many other \nhealth care providers are uncomfortable addressing end-of-life issues \nand are even apparently unwilling to respect their patient's \npreferences in some cases. Another complicating factor is the great \nvariation that exists among State laws, and the lack of a legal \nrequirement that an advance directive written in one State be respected \nin another State.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today focuses on \nthe need to improve end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries. It \naddresses the need to develop models of compassionate care and quality \nmeasures for end-of-life care in the Medicare Program, and it will \nencourage individuals to have more open communication with family \nmembers and health care providers concerning their preferences for end-\nof-life care.\n  The first section of the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act \nstrengthens the previously enacted Patient Self Determination Act in \nthe following ways.\n  First, it requires that every Medicare beneficiary have the \nopportunity to discuss health care decisionmaking issues with an \nappropriately trained professional, when he or she makes a request. \nThis measure would help make sure that patients and their families have \nthe ability to discuss and address concerns and issues relating to \ntheir care, including end-of-life care, with a trained professional. \nMany health care institutions already have teams of providers to \naddress difficult health care decisions and some even mediate among \npatients, families, and providers. In smaller institutions, social \nworkers, chaplains, nurses, or other trained professional could be made \navailable for consultation.\n  Second, our bill requires that a person's advance directive be placed \nin a prominent part of the medical record. Often advance directives can \nnot even be found in the medical record, making it more difficult for \nproviders to respect patients' wishes. It is essential that an \nindividual's advance directive be readily available and visible to \nanyone involved in their health care.\n  Third, it will assure that an advance directive valid in one State \nwill be valid in another State. At present, portability of advance \ndirectives from State to State is not assured. Such portability can \nonly be guaranteed through Federal legislation.\n\n  The second part of our bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to advise Congress on an approach to adopting the provisions \nof the Uniform Health Care Decisions Act for Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Uniform Health Care Decisions Act was developed by the Uniform Law \nCommissioners, a group with representation from all States that has \nbeen in existence for over 100 years. The Uniform Health Care Decisions \nAct includes all the important components of model advance directive \nlegislation. A great deal of legal effort went into its development, \nwith input by all the States and approval by the American Bar \nAssociation. Medicare beneficiaries deserve a uniform approach to \nadvance directives, especially since many move from one State to \nanother while in the Medicare Program. The tremendous variation in \nState laws that currently exists only adds to the confusion of health \ncare professionals and their patients.\n  Just this month, a study done by Dr. Jack Wennberg at Dartmouth \nUniversity documented the tremendous variation that exists in the \nmedical care that Medicare beneficiaries receive in the last few months \nof their lives. This sort of analysis highlights that patient \npreferences have little to do with the sort of care patients receive in \ntheir final months of life. Where you live determines the sort of \nmedical care you will receive more so than what you might prefer.\n  The third part of this legislation would encourage the development of \nmodels for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not \nqualify for the Medicare hospice benefit but still have chronic, \ndebilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. The tremendous advances in \nmedicine and medical technology over the past 30 to 50 years have \nresulted in a greatly lengthened life expectancy for Americans, as well \nas vastly improved functioning and quality of life for the elderly and \nthose with chronic disease. Many of these advances have been made \npossible by federally financed health care programs, such as the \nMedicare Program that assures access to high quality health care for \nall elderly Americans. Medicare has also funded much of the development \nof technology and a highly skilled physician workforce through support \nof medical education and academic medical centers. These advances have \nalso created major dilemmas in addressing terminal or potentially \nterminal disease, as well as a sense of loss of control by many with \nterminal illness.\n  I believe it is time for Medicare to help seniors have access to \ncompassionate, supportive, and pain free care during prolonged \nillnesses and at the end of life. As we begin to discuss restructuring \nthe Medicare Program for the long term, this will be one of my primary \ngoals. Our legislation instructs the Department of Health and Human \nServices to develop appropriate quality measures and models of care for \npersons with chronic, debilitating disease, including the very frail \nelderly who will comprise an increasing number of Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Our bill also sets up a consumer hotline that can \nprovide the American public with information on the legal, medical, and \nethical issues related to advance directives and medical \ndecisionmaking.\n  Mr. President, I am learning more and more about the importance of \neducating health care providers and the public that chronic, \ndebilitating, terminal disease need not be associated with pain, major \ndiscomfort, and loss of control. We can control pain and treat \ndepression, as well as the other causes of suffering during the dying \nprocess. We must now apply this knowledge to assure all Americans \nappropriate end-of-life care. And to make sure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries are able to receive the most effective medicine to \ncontrol their pain, Medicare's coverage rules would be expanded under \nour bill to include coverage for self-administered pain medications.\n  Under current law, Medicare generally does not pay for any outpatient \nprescription drugs. The only pain medication paid for by the Medicare \nProgram are those drugs that are administered by a portable pump. The \npump is covered by Medicare as durable medical equipment and the drugs \nused with that pump are also covered. Our bill would expand coverage to \ninclude self-administered pain medications, for example oral drugs or \ntransdermal patches. These alternatives are as effective in pain relief \nand, most obviously, a much more comfortable way for patients to \nreceive their pain medication.\n  Mr. President, much also needs to be done to assure that all health \ncare providers have the appropriate training to use what is already \nknown about supportive care. The public must be educated and empowered \nto discuss these issues with family members as well as their own \nphysicians so that each individual's wishes can be respected. More \nresearch is needed to develop appropriate measures of quality end-of-\nlife care and incorporate these measures into medical practice in all \nhealth care settings. And finally, appropriate financial incentives \nmust be present within Medicare, especially, to allow the elderly and \ndisabled their choice of appropriate care at the end of life. \nMedicare's coverage policy should not be the sole determinate of the \nroute that pain medication is administered.\n  To conclude, I am proud to offer this legislation with Senator \nCollins. We hope consideration of this bill will be an opportunity to \ntake notice of the many constructive steps that can be taken to address \nthe needs of patients and family members grappling with great pain and \nmedical difficulties. During this time when physician assisted suicide \nobtains so many headlines, we are eager to call on Congress to turn to \nthe alternative ways of providing help and relief to seniors and other \nAmericans who only are interested in such alternatives.\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary and a copy of the bill be \nprinted in its entirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MEDICARE COVERAGE OF SELF-ADMINISTERED MEDICATION FOR \n                   CERTAIN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(2)) (as amended by section 4557 of \n     the Balanced Budget Act (Public Law 105-33; 111 Stat. 463)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (S);\n       (2) in subparagraph (T), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (T) the following:\n       ``(U) self-administered drugs which may be dispensed only \n     upon prescription and which are prescribed for the relief of \n     chronic pain in patients with a life-threatening disease or \n     condition;''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to items and services furnished on or after June \n     1, 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 1997--Summary\n\n       More than 70 percent of the 2 million Americans expected to \n     die this year will be over the age of 65. The Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs pay for the majority of care at the end of \n     life. Dr. Jack Wennberg, health researcher at Dartmouth \n     University, recently documented the tremendous geographic \n     variation that exists in end of life care provided to \n     Medicare beneficiaries. The type of medical care a patient \n     received in their last month of life was driven more by where \n     a person lived than by personal preferences.\n\n\n                 (1) Better Information and Counseling\n\n       Current law: This bill builds on federal legislation \n     (Patient Self-Determination Act) enacted in 1990 that \n     requires health care facilities to distribute information on \n     advance directives to their patients. Since passage of that \n     legislation, there has been an increase in the number of \n     individuals who have an advance directive but a recent Robert \n     Wood Johnson study found that while 20 percent of \n     hospitalized patients had an advance directive less than half \n     had ever talked with any of their doctors about having a \n     directive and only about one-third had their wishes \n     documented in their medical record. Many people do not \n     understand the importance of discussing their advance \n     directives with family members and their health care \n     provider. In addition, a 1994 survey found that only 5 out of \n     126 medical schools offered a separate, required course in \n     end of life care. Other surveys of doctors and medical \n     residents found little or no experience in discussing care \n     for dying patients.\n       Proposal: Improves the type and amount of information \n     available to consumers by making sure that when a person \n     enters a hospital, nursing home, or other health care \n     facility, there is a knowledgeable person available to \n     discuss end of life care planning if requested, so that good \n     decisions--decisions based on the patient's own needs and \n     values--can be made. Requires that if a person has an advance \n     directive it must be placed in a prominent part of the \n     medical record where all the doctors and nurses can clearly \n     see it. Establishes a 24-hour hotline and information \n     clearinghouse to provide consumers with information on end of \n     life decision making.\n\n\n                 (2) Portability of Advance Directives\n\n       Current law: The specifics of advance directive legislation \n     vary greatly from state to state. Portability from state to \n     state can only be assured through federal legislation.\n       Proposal: Ensures that an advance directive valid in one \n     state will be honored in another state, as long as the \n     contents of the advance directive do not conflict with the \n     laws of the state. In addition, requires the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to gather information and consult \n     with experts on the possibility of an uniform advance \n     directive for all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of where \n     they live. An uniform advance directive would enable people \n     to document the kind of care they wish to get at the end of \n     their lives in a way that is easily recognizable and \n     understood by everyone.\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\n        (3) Measures to Improve the Quality of End of Life Care\n\n       Current Law: There are few quality measures or standards \n     available to assess the quality of care provided to Medicare \n     beneficiaries at the end of their life. The tremendous \n     geographic variation in medical care that currently exists on \n     end of life care reinforces the notion that most people do \n     not receive care driven by quality concerns but rather by the \n     availability of medical resources in the community and other \n     factors not related to quality care.\n       Proposal: Requires the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, in conjunction with the Health Care Financing \n     Administration, National Institutes of Health, and the Agency \n     for Health Care Policy and Research, to develop outcome \n     standards and other measures to evaluate the quality care \n     provided to dying patients.\n\n\n     (4) Pilot Project Funding to Improve End of Life Care Services\n\n       Current Law: The only Medicare benefit aimed at improving \n     end of life care for Medicare beneficiaries is hospice care \n     which only serves a small minority of beneficiaries. In 1994, \n     the Medicare hospice benefit was provided to 340,000 dying \n     patients for the last few weeks of their lives. The hospice \n     benefit is limited to beneficiaries who have a terminal \n     illness with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Cancer \n     and AIDS are virtually the only diseases that follow a \n     predictable course of decline near death. Cancer patients are \n     usually referred to hospice care when the individual's \n     functioning declines, usually 3-6 weeks before death. \n     Medicare beneficiaries with other diseases generally do not \n     have access to hospice care because the 6 month life \n     expectancy requirement is often difficult to determine.\n       A review of studies done by an Institute of Medicine study \n     panel found that 40 to 80 percent of patients with a terminal \n     illness were inadequately treated for pain ``despite the \n     availability of effective pharmacological and other options \n     for relieving pain.''\n       Proposal: Provides funding for demonstration projects to \n     develop new and innovative approaches to improving end of \n     life care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, in particular \n     those individuals who do not qualify for, or select, hospice \n     care. Also, includes funding to evaluate existing pilot \n     programs that are providing innovative approaches to end of \n     life care.\n\n\n               (5) Improved Coverage of Pain Medications\n\n       Current Law: With a few exceptions, Medicare does not \n     generally pay the cost of self-administered drugs prescribed \n     for outpatient use. The only outpatient pain medications \n     currently covered by Medicare are those that are administered \n     by a portable pump. The pump is covered by Medicare as \n     durable medical equipment, and the drugs associated with that \n     pump are also covered. It is widely recognized among \n     physicians treating patients with cancer and other life-\n     threatening diseases that self-administered pain medications, \n     including oral drug and transdermal patches, offer \n     alternatives that are equally effective at controlling pain, \n     more comfortable for the patient, and much less costly than \n     the pump.\n       Proposal: Requires Medicare coverage for self-administered \n     pain medications prescribed for outpatient use for patients \n     with life-threatening disease and chronic pain.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Advance \nPlanning and Compassionate Care Act which is intended to improve the \nway we care for people at the end of their lives.\n  Noted health economist Uwe Reinhardt once observed that ``Americans \nare the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' \nAdvancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled \nmore and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when \nmedical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, \npatients and their families should not have to fear that the process of \ndying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care \nthat is inconsistent with their values or wishes.\n  The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to \nreexamine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at \nthe end of their lives. Clearly there is more that we can do to relieve \nsuffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide \nopportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's \nconclusion.\n  Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not \ncurrently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life \ncare. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on \ncare at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-\ntechnology interventions and rescue care. While four out of five \nAmericans say they would prefer to die at home, studies show that \nalmost 80 percent die in institutions where they may be in pain, and \nwhere they are subjected to high-technology treatments that merely \nprolong suffering.\n  Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study released earlier this month, \nwhere a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient dies. The \nstudy found that the amount of medical treatment Americans receive in \ntheir final months varies tremendously in the different parts of the \ncountry, and it concluded that the determination of whether or not an \nolder patient dies in the hospital probably has more to do with the \nsupply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or preference.\n  The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help \nus improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of \ntheir lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes \nto the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate \ndiscussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions \nabout end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that \nevery Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing \nfacility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the \npreparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained \nprofessional within the institution. The legislation also requires that \nif a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a \nprominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and \nnurses can clearly see it.\n  The legislation will expand access to effective and appropriate pain \nmedications for Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives. \nSevere pain, including breakthrough pain that defies usual methods of \npain control, is one of the most debilitating aspects of terminal \nillness. However, the only pain medication currently covered by \nMedicare in an outpatient setting is that which is administered by a \nportable pump.\n  It is widely recognized among physicians treating patients with \ncancer and other life-threatening diseases that self-administered pain \nmedications, including oral drugs and transdermal patches, offer \nalternatives that are equally effective in controlling pain, more \ncomfortable for the patient, and much less costly than the pump. \nTherefore, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act would expand \nMedicare to cover self-administered pain medications prescribed for the \nrelief of chronic pain in life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to study end-of-life issues for Medicare and Medicaid \npatients and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models \nfor end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for \nthe hospice benefit, but who still have chronic debilitating and \nultimately fatal illnesses. Currently, in order for a Medicare \nbeneficiary to qualify for the hospice benefit, a physician must \ndocument that the person has a life expectancy of 6 months or less. \nWith some conditions--like congestive heart failure--it is difficult to \nproject life expectancy with any certainty. However, these patients \nstill need hospice-like services, including advance planning, support \nservices, symptom management, and other services that are not currently \navailable.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide \nconsumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-\nlife issues and medical decisionmaking and directs the Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research to develop a research agenda for the \ndevelopment of quality measures for end-of-life care.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in \nlight of the current debate on physician-assisted suicide. As the \nBangor Daily News pointed out in an editorial published earlier this \nyear, the desire for assisted suicide is generally driven by concerns \nabout the quality of care for the terminally ill; by the fear of \nprolonged pain, loss of dignity, and emotional strain on family \nmembers. Such worries would recede and support for assisted suicide \nwould evaporate if better palliative care and more effective pain \nmanagement were widely available, and I ask unanimous consent that this \neditorial be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, patients and their families should be able to trust \nthat the care they receive at the end of their lives is not only of \nhigh quality,\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\nbut also that it respects their desires for peace, autonomy, and \ndignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act that Senator \nRockefeller and I are introducing today will give us some of the tools \nthat we need to improve care of the dying in this country, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Life and Death With Dignity\n\n       When Maine legislators consider a bill this session on \n     physician-assisted suicide, they will face a question that \n     the nation's medical community has been unable to settle \n     after long debate. Legislators should respect the enormity of \n     what they are being asked to consider, recognizing that there \n     are many steps between the current state of caring for the \n     terminally ill and hastening their deaths.\n       Even as the Supreme Court last week was considering \n     constitutional questions surrounding doctor-assisted suicide, \n     a coalition of 40 health care, religious and retiree groups \n     gathered in Washington to find a middle ground to this \n     debate. The coalition--including the American Medical \n     Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, \n     B'nai B'rith and the American Cancer Society--argues that the \n     desire for assisted suicide often is driven by concerns about \n     the quality of care for the terminally ill. Thoughts of \n     doctor-assisted suicide, these groups maintain, are brought \n     about by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of dignity and the \n     emotional strain on family members, among other reasons.\n       The coalition suggests that the nation's medical system has \n     failed to meet the physical and emotional needs of dying \n     patients. One study from Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York \n     estimated that 1.6 million terminally ill people a year would \n     be good candidates for hospice care but only about 350,000 \n     receive it. Why not try to solve these problems before \n     codifying doctor-assisted suicide?\n       The Maine legislation, called the Death With Dignity Act, \n     is narrowly drawn, based on legislative work on a similar \n     bill from last session. It would allow physicians to assist \n     in the suicide of a terminally ill person who makes three \n     oral and one written request to die and has satisfied a \n     counselor that he or she is capable of making the decision. \n     The act goes to some lengths to prevent coercion and to allow \n     the person to back out of the suicide. It is well-crafted and \n     sensitive legislation. But absent advances in the quality of \n     care for the terminally ill, it also may be premature.\n       And despite the safeguards, doubts about who will be \n     allowed to pursue this process remain. In a friend-of-the-\n     court brief addressed to the cases being considered by the \n     Supreme Court, the America Geriatric Society explains the \n     source of some of these doubts: ``The image of an \n     independent, capable person thoughtfully evaluating his or \n     her options, unaffected by biased third parties or other \n     circumstances . . . is so far from the experience of dying as \n     to be fanciful. Dying persons are often very weak, prone to \n     strong emotions and vulnerable to the suggestions, \n     expectations and guidance of others.''\n       The medical community has developed wondrous means for \n     keeping bodies functioning long beyond what could have been \n     expected even a few years ago, perhaps even longer than is \n     desirable. The debate over assisted suicide in state after \n     state demands that physicians go beyond that now in \n     respecting the humanity and mortality that resides within \n     those bodies by providing the terminally ill with the \n     opportunity for less painful, more dignified deaths.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1346. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to increase \nthe penalties for certain offenses in which the victim is a child; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         JOAN'S LAW ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today, \nalong with my colleague from New Jersey Senator Lautenberg, on behalf \nof Rosemarie D'Alessandro, the mother of a young girl murdered some 24 \nyears ago in New Jersey.\n  Mrs. D'Alessandro's 7-year-old daughter Joan was delivering Girl \nScout cookies down the street from her Hillsdale home one day when \nJoseph McGowan, a high school chemistry teacher, destroyed her life and \nchanged the lives of her family members forever. McGowan raped Joan, \nkilled her, and dumped her broken, battered body in a ravine some 15 \nmiles away--she was not found for 3 full days.\n  For Joan's mom, Rosemarie, that shattering event was only the \nbeginning of what would become a literal lifetime of trauma, pain and \ndistress. Although the man who murdered Joan was put away for life, he \nhas already had two parole hearings and is scheduled for another in \n2003.\n  And Rosemarie D'Alessandro cannot rest while these hearings go on. To \nmake sure this murderer remains behind bars, Rosemarie must fight each \nand every day against the system that might free him, and must sit \nthrough appeal after appeal when he is denied release.\n  But rather than becoming consumed with the tragedy that stole her \ndaughter from her, Rosemarie D'Alessandro has used her grief and her \nanger to accomplish an astonishing goal--Joan's Law is now in the books \nin New Jersey, and now any child molester who murders a child under 14 \nin my State must receive life in prison without the possibility of \nparole. Rosemarie D'Alessandro stood up and told the world ``enough is \nenough.'' No other family should have to bear the double tragedy of \nsuffering the loss of a child and then being forced to relive it over \nand over again through parole hearings and appeals. And no other family \nin New Jersey will ever have to again.\n  Well, we do not have parole in the Federal system, but we can make \nsure that anyone who molests or commits a serious, violent crime \nagainst a child 14 or under will serve the rest of his life behind bars \nif that child dies. My bill states that any person who is convicted of \na Federal offense defined as a serious violent felony should be \nsentenced either to death or imprisonment for life when the victim of \nthe crime is under 14 years of age and dies as a result of the offense.\n  Mr. President, with this bill, we intend to send the strongest \npossible message to anyone who would dare molest or attack a vulnerable \nchild--do so at your own risk, because we will find you and we will put \nyou behind bars for the rest of your life if that child dies. I hope my \ncolleagues will quickly join me and Senator Lautenberg in passing this \nlegislation, so that the inevitable tragedies that happen to children \nthroughout America every day will no longer be compounded upon the \nfamilies of those victims.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``Joan's Law Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEATH OR LIFE IN PRISON FOR CERTAIN OFFENSES WHOSE \n                   VICTIMS ARE CHILDREN.\n\n       Section 3559 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Death or Life Imprisonment for Crimes Against \n     Children.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a \n     person who is convicted of a Federal offense that is a \n     serious violent felony (as defined in subsection (c)) or a \n     violation of section 2251 shall, unless a sentence of death \n     is imposed, be sentenced to imprisonment for life, if the \n     victim of the offense--\n       ``(1) is less than 14 years of age at the time of the \n     offense; and\n       ``(2) dies as a result of the offense.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when a child is murdered, families are \ndevastated and communities are rocked to their very core. When a \nmurderer is prosecuted, grieving parents and siblings are forced to \nrelive the often brutal details of the most profound tragedy \nimaginable. And, if a conviction is obtained, in too many instances, \nthe families of a young victim must repeatedly relieve the crime every \ntime the murderer goes before a parole board.\n  The families of murder victims, especially murdered children, need \nclosure. They need to know that they can put the horror and a tragedy \nbehind them. They need to know that they can begin rebuilding their \nlives. But most importantly, they need to know that the person \nresponsible for the crime will never bring harm and grief to another \nfamily.\n  This is why, Mr. President, I am today joining my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Torricelli, in introducing legislation that will \nsignificantly increase the penalties on criminals convicted of a \nFederal crime where a child under the age of 14 is killed during the \ncommission of that crime. I also want to commend and acknowledge \nCongressman Bob Franks, also from New Jersey, who introduced similar \nlegislation in the House.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a Federal companion for an \nimportant New Jersey law called Joan's Law.\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\nJoan's Law was named after a 7-year-old New Jersey girl, Joan \nD'Alessandro, who was raped and murdered in 1973. Joan's murderer, a \nman who lived across State lines and actually had the gall to \nparticipate in the family's desperate search for their missing \ndaughter, was located, convicted of the crime, and sentenced to 20 \nyears in State prison. He is now eligible for parole, and has twice \nsought release since his incarceration.\n  To their horror, frustration, and understandable anger, Joan's family \nhas repeatedly had to fight parole for this cruel killer. They have \nbeen forced to relive this tragedy again and again and to beg that \nothers be protected from the brutal individual who ripped apart their \nfamily.\n  The bill we are introducing today will impose a similar, equally \nsevere and necessary penalty--life imprisonment--on anyone convicted of \ncommitting a Federal crime where a child, 14 years of age or younger, \ndies as a result of that crime.\n  The bill sends a strong message that our society will not tolerate \nnor forgive the brutal acts of a criminal who takes a young life. This \nbill sends the message in no uncertain terms that society will take the \nsteps necessary to protect itself from cold-blooded killers who \nvictimize children. This bill will help to protect all of our families \nand children from the repeat offenders who, all too often, insinuate \nthemselves into our communities and prey on defenseless children.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join with Senator \nTorricelli and I in support of this bill and to work for its fast \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             By Mr. GLENN:\n\n  S. 1347. A bill to permit the city of Cleveland, OH, to convey \ncertain lands that the United States conveyed to the city; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              the cleveland airport expansion act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nassist in improving air transportation for the people and businesses of \nnortheast Ohio and the Nation.\n  The city of Cleveland has a major capacity improvement program \nunderway at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. For some time, \nCleveland and the city of Brook Park had been involved in a dispute \nregarding property crucial to the development project. To their credit, \nboth communities were able to resolve their differences through a \ncomprehensive settlement agreement that will allow the airport's \nimprovement program to move forward. This important settlement \nagreement includes changing municipal boundaries and the \nnoncontroversial, jurisdictional transfer of property.\n  Mr. President, Congress has addressed similar restrictions many times \nby enacting specific provisions allowing the Secretary of \nTransportation to act in similar cases. As part of the comprehensive \nsettlement agreement this is clearly in the public interest and will \nallow Cleveland to meet northeast Ohio's increasing requirements for \nbetter air transportation.\n  Mr. President, since the closing of the settlement agreement is to \noccur before December 31, 1997, this legislation is needed prior to \nadjournment. I appreciate the support of the leadership of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. \n                                Kerrey):\n\n  S. 1348. A bill to provide for innovative strategies for achieving \nsuperior environmental performance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          the innovative environmental strategies act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today The \nInnovative Environmental Strategies Act of l997. I'm honored that \nSenators Daschle, Moynihan, and Kerrey have joined me as cosponsors, \nand that the legislation is being introduced in the House by \nCongressman Dooley and Congresswoman Tauscher. I'm also very pleased \nthat the legislation has been endorsed by the Clinton administration \nand has received positive responses from representatives of industry \nand environmental groups. I look forward to a process of building \nfurther consensus on this bill from all affected interests.\n  The legislation allows companies to propose alternatives to \nenvironmental requirements if those alternative proposals will achieve \nbetter environmental performance. The legislation provides EPA with the \nauthority to waive or modify regulatory requirements for this purpose. \nIt is designed to encourage more pollution prevention and to promote \nbetter, more cost-effective solutions for environmental protection.\n  This legislation seeks to build on both the work of President \nClinton's Project XL--standing for excellence and leadership--and the \nAspen Institute which undertook a 3-year effort to reach consensus \namong a wide group of divergent interests on an alternative path to \nachieving a cleaner, cheaper way to protect and enhance the \nenvironment. The Aspen Institute's work resulted in an excellent \nreport, ``The Alternative Path, A Cleaner, Cheaper Way to Protect and \nEnhance the Environment.''\n  This bill modifies legislation introduced at the end of last \nCongress. At that time, I indicated that I welcomed all proposals and \nsuggestions on how to alter and improve the bill. I have received a \nsignificant number of comments from industry, governmental and \nenvironmental group representatives. The new bill attempts to reflect \nmany of those comments, in addition to a new GAO report examining EPA's \nreinvention efforts, ``Challenges Facing EPA's Efforts to Reinvent \nEnvironmental Regulation,'' and a recently released report by the \nNational Academy of Public Administration, ``Resolving the Paradox of \nEnvironmental Protection.'' The National Academy report recommends \nstatutory authorization for EPA's XL program.\n  There is clearly a wide consensus in this country that our \nenvironmental laws have performed remarkably well. As the writer Gregg \nEasterbrook has pointed out, environmental protection is probably the \nsingle greatest success story of American government in the period \nsince World War II.\n  In many cases, however, we need to do more to provide the level of \nprotection most Americans expect from government. For example, over one \nthird of our rivers and lakes still do not fully meet water quality \nstandards. Health advisories for eating fish have increased. The number \nof people suffering from asthma has reached epidemic proportions in \nsome communities, particularly among children.\n  Pollution prevention--preventing pollution before it occurs--is one \napproach that can help us do both better both in terms of protecting \nthe environment and actually saving companies money. The greater \nefficiency resulting from less waste disposal and reduced use of toxic \nchemicals can significantly bolster the competitiveness of companies.\n  Recently, I listened to a presentation indicating that perhaps the \nNation is not doing as well in pollution prevention as we should be. A \nl995 report by the research group INFORM, ``Toxics Watch l995,'' \nreviewed thousands of documents submitted by industry to EPA to show \nwhether progress was made to further pollution prevention. While 25 \npercent of the forms indicated some effort in pollution prevention had \nbeen made, the remaining 75 percent gave no such indication. And, \naccording to INFORM, while some leading companies have taken major \npollution prevention steps, the broader picture is troublesome: total \nwaste generation is increasing.\n  While these facts show there is clearly a need to improve protection \nof our environment and pollution prevention, there is just as clearly a \nneed to review our methods of environmental protection in order to find \nbetter, more efficient, more innovative ways to achieve greater \nprogress toward meeting our environmental goals. In some cases, the \ntraditional approaches to regulation have hindered companies from doing \na better job at pollution prevention.\n  There is a growing consensus that innovative environmental strategies \ncan form the basis for a new approach to environmental protection that \nwill\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\nachieve superior environmental results, including greater pollution \nprevention, at less cost for regulated industry. This consensus can be \nseen, for example, in the work of the President's Council on \nSustainable Development which brought together leaders from government, \nenvironmental, civil rights, labor and native American organizations in \nan effort to achieve consensus on national environmental, economic and \nsocial goals, as well as in the work of the Aspen Institute.\n  This bill establishes an innovative environmental strategies program \nat EPA. The Administrator of EPA is authorized to enter into \napproximately 50 agreements with regulated entities seeking \nmodifications or waivers from environmental requirements if certain \ncriteria are met. The basic premise of the bill is that better \nenvironmental performance can be achieved by allowing environmental \nmanagers at companies, in partnership with an active group of community \nstakeholders, to develop their own means of reaching environmental \ngoals. This approach recognizes that the regulated industry is now in \nan excellent position to experiment and decide what approaches will \nyield better environmental results than the company is achieving under \nexisting regulations. Allowing flexibility can substantially reduce \ncompliance costs and make industries more competitive, provide for much \ngreater community involvement in the decisions of their neighboring \nindustrial plants, foster more cooperative partnerships, and encourage \ngreater innovation and pollution prevention.\n  Another key element of this program is incorporating the lessons \nlearned from the innovative environmental strategies into the overall \nregulatory structure of the Agency, where appropriate.\n  While the bill authorizes approximately 50 innovative strategy \nagreements, these individual strategies should have widespread benefits \nfor other companies as the Agency incorporates the lessons learned into \nits overall approach to environmental protection.\n  Let me discuss a few specific provisions of the bill.\n  First, the bill establishes benchmarks from which to determine \nwhether better environmental results will be achieved under the \ninnovative environmental strategy. For existing facilities, the \nbenchmark generally will be either the level of releases of a pollutant \ninto the air, land or water actually being achieved by the facility or \nthe level of releases allowed under the applicable regulatory \nrequirements and reasonably foreseeable future requirements, whichever \nis lower. The Administrator is given some flexibility in determining \nthe appropriate measurement for the benchmark. For example, measuring \nreleases per unit of production encourages pollution prevention but may \nresult in releases of concern to the community; the Administrator \nshould take both these factors into account in determining whether a \nper unit measurement is appropriate. The Administrator shall determine \nwhether an innovative environmental strategy achieves better \nenvironmental results based on the magnitude of reduction in the level \nof releases or improvement in pollution prevention relative to each \nbenchmark. In addition, the Administrator shall evaluate other benefits \nthat would result from the strategy. These include whether the strategy \nresults in environmental performance more protective than the best \nperformance practice of comparable facilities or improvement in \nenvironmental conditions that are priorities to stakeholders, even if \nthose conditions are not regulated under EPA statutes.\n  Different types of innovative environmental strategies are possible \nunder this legislation. For example, in some cases, a facility may \ndemonstrate better environmental results by showing a reduction in \nreleases of pollutants and, in exchange, seek a modification of \nreporting or other paperwork requirements. In other cases, a facility \nmay demonstrate better environmental results by showing a reduction in \nreleases of pollutants, but seek modification of a rule to allow for \nflexibility with respect to emission levels at different sources within \nthe facility. There may be some cases where the innovative \nenvironmental strategy would result in large decreases in some \npollutants while resulting in a small increase in another pollutant. \nBut there are a number of specific requirements that must be met under \nthose circumstances. Among other requirements, the Administrator must \ndetermine, based on a well-established analytic methodology acceptable \nboth to the Administrator and the stakeholders, that the strategy will \nachieve better overall environmental results with an adequate margin of \nsafety and will not result in an increase in the risk of adverse \neffects or shift the risk of adverse effects to the health of an \nindividual, population, or natural resource affected by the strategy. I \nrecognize that it is difficult to make such determinations because we \nhave inadequate information about many chemicals and we often do not \nknow how properly to evaluate cumulative or synergistic effects. The \nAdministrator should pay close attention to these factors in evaluating \nprojects. These examples are only illustrative of a range of potential \nprojects.\n\n  The bill also provides that in appropriate cases, the Administrator \nmay establish a benchmark for measuring better environmental \nperformance based on pollution prevention.\n  The bill requires that the innovative environmental strategy provide \na means and level of accountability, monitoring, enforceability and \npublic access to information for all enforceable provisions at least \nequivalent to that provided by the rule that is being modified or \nwaived. A related requirement is that adequate information must be made \naccessible so that any member of the public can verify environmental \nperformance. Other requirements that must be met by the petitioner are \nset forth in section 7.\n  Effective stakeholder participation is the second key element of the \nlegislation. Any company submitting a proposal must undertake a \nstakeholder participation process. One of the criteria for approval of \na project by EPA is that the stakeholders have obtained adequate \nindependent technical support for an effective stakeholder process. \nUnder the bill, the stakeholder process is open to anyone, except a \nbusiness competitor, subject to manageability factors. The stakeholder \ngroup should genuinely represent the full range of interests affected \nby projects and the policies to be shaped by projects. Involving \ncitizens, including workers and members of the local community, in the \ndevelopment of an innovative environmental strategy is absolutely \ncritical. Companies that have formulated successful innovative \nenvironmental strategies have told me that without the support of the \nlocal community these strategies simply will not work. Empowerment of \nthe local community through stakeholder processes will help build trust \nand make implementation of the agreement easier. In other words, the \ninnovative environmental strategy should be a partnership between the \nproponent and the stakeholders.\n  The bill requires the Administrator to give great weight to the views \nof the stakeholders. Obtaining broad community support for the \nstrategy, as shown through stakeholder support, is very important. \nAdditionally, the stakeholders and the proponent of the strategy may \ndecide as part of the guidelines setting up the stakeholder process, \nthat the stakeholders as a group or individual stakeholder participants \nshould have a veto right with respect to whether the strategy goes \nforward. If the proponent still presents a proposal for the strategy \neven with such objections, the Administrator is required to reject the \nstrategy if the objection has a clear and reasonable foundation and \nrelates to the criteria for approval. The principle here is simple: \nstakeholders and the facility owner need to come to agreement on the \nguidelines that will govern the project. This agreement on the \nguidelines should be reached at the start of the process. It must be \nfollowed; if not, the Administrator will not be able to make the \nfinding that the requirements of section 6 of the statute have been \nmet.\n  The bill also attempts to address the recommendations made in the GAO \nreport of July 1997, ``Challenges Facing EPA's Efforts to Reinvent \nEnvironmental Regulation'', which examined EPA's XL program. First, the \nGAO concludes that EPA will be limited in its ability to truly reinvent \nenvironmental regulation without legislative changes. Second, the GAO \nrecommends\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nthat the Agency's reinvention initiatives include an evaluation \ncomponent measuring the extent to which the initiative has achieved its \nintended effect. Therefore, the bill requires that, within 18 months \nafter entering into an agreement, the Administrator provide a report \nevaluating whether the lessons learned from a particular strategy can \nbe incorporated into the overall regulatory or statutory structure of \nthe Agency. The legislation also requires a broader report to Congress \nwithin 3 years.\n  Finally, the GAO proposes that EPA develop a systematic process that \nwould help address problems that come up during reinvention projects in \na timely fashion. This process should be set up to identify the kinds \nof problems that can be resolved at lower levels within the Agency and \nwhich should be elevated for management's attention. While the bill \ndoes not specifically address this recommendation, I hope that EPA will \nseriously examine how it can implement this constructive \nrecommendation.\n  As the GAO report notes, the EPA has undertaken a broad range of \nreinvention efforts. This legislation in no way affects the ability of \nEPA to proceed under its appropriate authorities with those efforts, \nincluding agreements under XL.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1348\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (4) the feasibility of the strategy and the ability of the \n     proponent to carry out the strategy.\n       (c) Better Environmental Results.--\n       (1) Evaluation.--The Administrator shall determine whether \n     a strategy is expected to achieve better environmental \n     results based on the magnitude of reduction in the level of \n     releases or improvement in pollution prevention relative to \n     each benchmark established under paragraphs (4) through (7);\n       (2) Other considerations.--In addition to making the \n     determination under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall \n     evaluate the extent to which the strategy--\n       (A) results in environmental performance more protective \n     than the best performance practice of comparable facilities;\n       (B) relies on pollution prevention;\n       (C) incorporates continuous improvement toward ambitious \n     quantitative environmental goals;\n       (D) produces clear reduction of risk, based on a well-\n     accepted analytical method acceptable to the Administrator \n     and the stakeholders;\n       (E) improves environmental conditions that are priorities \n     to stakeholders, including conditions not regulated under \n     statutes administered by the agency;\n       (F) reflects historic demonstration of leadership in \n     environmental performance of the facility;\n       (G) substantially addresses community and public health \n     priorities of concern to stakeholders, including concerns not \n     addressed under statutes administered by the agency;\n       (H) addresses other factors that the Administrator \n     determines clearly improve environmental performance in the \n     context of a specific strategy; and\n       (I) includes reductions in releases or improvement in \n     pollution prevention in addition to those considered by the \n     Administrator for purposes of paragraph (1).\n       (3) Findings.--The Administrator shall provide findings \n     setting forth the basis for the determination that the \n     innovative environmental strategy is expected to achieve \n     better environmental results. If the Administrator determines \n     that the magnitude of reduction in the level of releases or \n     improvement in pollution prevention would be a reduction or \n     improvement, but not a significant reduction or improvement, \n     the Administrator may approve a proposal only if the \n     Administrator determines that the strategy is expected to \n     result in a clear and substantial improvement in \n     environmental protection, considering the other factors in \n     this subsection.\n       (4) Benchmark.--The benchmark for releases of each \n     pollutant into the air, water, or land shall be as follows:\n       (A) Existing facilities.--For existing facilities, the \n     benchmark shall be the lesser of--\n       (i) the level of releases of each pollutant into the air, \n     water, or and being achieved before the date of submission of \n     the proposal; or\n       (ii) the level of releases of each pollutant into the air, \n     water, or land allowed under applicable regulatory \n     requirements and any reasonably anticipated future regulatory \n     requirements;\n\n     except that the Administrator may, based on extraordinary \n     site-specific circumstances, modify the level under \n     subparagraph (A)(i) on a case by case basis for a facility \n     that has reduced releases significantly below applicable \n     regulatory requirements before the date of submission of the \n     proposal.\n       (B) New or modified facilities.--For new or significantly \n     expanded facilities, the benchmark shall be based on the \n     lesser of--\n       (i) the level of releases of each pollutant into the air, \n     water, or land allowed under applicable regulatory \n     requirements and any reasonably anticipated future regulatory \n     requirements; or\n       (ii) the level of releases of each pollutant into the air, \n     water, or land based on best industry practices.\n       (5) Pollution prevention.--\n       (A) No release of a pollutant.--In appropriate \n     circumstances not involving release of a pollutant, the \n     Administrator may establish a pollution prevention benchmark \n     to evaluate changes in inputs to production of materials or \n     substances of potential environmental or public health \n     concern.\n       (B) Release of a pollutant.--In circumstances involving a \n     release of a pollutant, the Administrator may establish a \n     pollution prevention benchmark in addition to the benchmark \n     under paragraph (4).\n       (6) Basis of measurement.--A benchmark may be established \n     on the basis of total emissions, on a per-unit of production \n     basis, or on a comparable basis of measurement, as determined \n     by the Administrator.\n       (7) Other considerations.--The Administrator may determine \n     that the requirements of this section are met if a benchmark \n     is not met, if--\n       (A) with respect to other benchmarks, the strategy achieves \n     a significant increment of reduced level of releases below \n     that permitted by the benchmark;\n       (B) the strategy, based on a well-established analytic \n     methodology acceptable to the Administrator and the \n     stakeholders--\n       (i) is expected to achieve overall better environmental \n     results with an adequate margin of safety;\n       (ii) is not expected to result in an increase in the risk \n     of adverse effects, or shift the risk of adverse effects, to \n     the health of an individual, population, or natural resource \n     affected by the strategy; and\n       (iii) is expected to achieve clear risk reduction; and\n       (C) the strategy is not expected to result in an exceedance \n     of an ecological, health, or risk-based environmental \n     standard.\n       (d) Views of Stakeholders.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall give great weight \n     to the views of individual stakeholders and to the \n     stakeholders as a group in determining whether to approve or \n     disapprove a strategy.\n       (2) Stakeholders with decisionmaking role.--The \n     Administrator shall deny a proposal if--\n       (A) the stakeholder group and the proponent have determined \n     under section 6 that the group, any subgroup, or 1 or more \n     individual stakeholders in the group will have the ability to \n     veto a decision by the proponent to go forward with the \n     strategy;\n       (B) the group or 1 or more stakeholders objects to the \n     strategy; and\n       (C) the Administrator determines that the objection relates \n     to the criteria stated in section 7 and that the objection \n     has a clear and reasonable foundation.\n\n     SEC. 8. FINAL DETERMINATION ON AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Proposal.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date on \n     which negotiations are initiated under section 6(g) or such \n     later date as may be agreed to by the proponent and the \n     stakeholders, the Administrator shall--\n       (A) provide public notice and opportunity to comment on a \n     proposed innovative environmental strategy agreement; or\n       (B) notify the proponent and the stakeholder group that the \n     Administrator does not intend to enter into an agreement.\n       (2) Form of notice.--Public notice under paragraph (1) \n     shall be provided by--\n       (A) publishing a notice in the Federal Register; and\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\n       (B) providing public notice to persons potentially \n     interested in the strategy in the manner described in section \n     6(d).\n       (3) Comment period.--The public comment period shall be not \n     less than 30 days, and shall be extended by an additional 30 \n     days if an extension is requested by any person not later \n     than 15 days after the beginning of the public comment \n     period.\n       (b) Final Decision.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the end of \n     the public comment period, the Administrator shall determine \n     whether to enter into an agreement, and shall give notice of \n     the determination in the same manner as notice was given of \n     the proposed agreement.\n       (2) Response.--The Administrator--\n       (A) shall respond to comments received; and\n       (B) may modify the agreement in response to the comments.\n       (c) Signatories.--\n       (1) In general.--The parties to an innovative environmental \n     strategy agreement--\n       (A) shall include the Administrator, the proponent, and any \n     Federal, State, or local agency or Indian tribe with \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter of the agreement under \n     this Act; and\n       (B) may include a stakeholder.\n       (2) Joint rules requirements and policies.--If an agreement \n     waives or modifies a rule, requirement, or policy issued by \n     the agency jointly with another Federal agency, the other \n     Federal agency shall be a signatory to the agreement.\n       (3) Consultation.--The Administrator shall consult with and \n     consider the views of any Federal agency with management \n     responsibility or regulatory or enforcement authority over \n     land or natural resources that may be affected by the \n     strategy.\n\n     SEC. 9. STATE ROLE.\n\n       (a) In General.--If a proposed strategy involves waiving or \n     modifying requirements imposed under State, tribal, or local \n     law, the Administrator shall not approve an agreement unless \n     procedures required under those laws for such waiver or \n     modification are followed in addition to the execution of the \n     innovative environmental strategy agreement.\n       (b) Part of Federal Program.--If a proposed strategy \n     involves waiving or modifying requirements of State, tribal, \n     or local law that are part of an authorized or delegated \n     Federal program, execution of an innovative environmental \n     strategy agreement by the Administrator and by the State, \n     Indian tribe, or local government shall be deemed to provide \n     authorization or approval of the program as modified by the \n     agreement.\n\n     SEC. 10. ENFORCEABILITY.\n\n       (a) Specification of Enforceable Provisions.--\n       (1) Definition of voluntary commitment.--In this section, \n     the term ``voluntary commitment'' means a commitment that the \n     parties to the agreement consider to be a necessary part of \n     the strategy but is not enforceable under this section.\n       (2) Inclusion in agreement.--An innovative environmental \n     strategy agreement shall include enforceable requirements and \n     may include voluntary commitments.\n       (3) Enforceable requirements.--\n       (A) Identification.--Enforceable requirements shall be \n     clearly identified and distinguished in the agreement from \n     voluntary commitments.\n       (B) Inclusion of all necessary actions.--In all cases, \n     enforceable requirements shall include, at a minimum, all \n     actions necessary to achieve better environmental results \n     relied upon by the Administrator for purposes of section \n     7(c)(1), and all accountability, monitoring, reporting, and \n     public and agency access requirements mandated by paragraphs \n     (3) and (4) of section 7(a).\n       (4) Voluntary commitments.--Failure to implement a \n     voluntary commitment may constitute a ground for termination \n     of the agreement.\n       (b) Treatment of Agreement as Permit, Condition, or \n     Requirement.--\n       (1) Definition of otherwise applicable requirement.--In \n     this subsection, the term ``otherwise-applicable \n     requirement'' means a rule, permit, condition, policy, \n     practice, or other requirement that an innovative \n     environmental strategy agreement modifies, waives, or \n     replaces.\n       (2) Identification of enforceable requirements.--An \n     innovative environmental strategy agreement shall state in a \n     separate section designated ``Enforceable Requirements'' all \n     of the enforceable requirements of the agreement.\n       (3) Identification of modified, otherwise waived or \n     relocated requirements.--An innovative environmental strategy \n     agreement shall identify (including citation to the specific \n     provision of a statute or rule), with respect to each \n     enforceable requirement, each otherwise-applicable \n     requirement that the agreement waives, modifies, or replaces.\n       (4) Treatment.--Each enforceable requirement shall be \n     deemed, for purposes of enforcement, to be a permit issued \n     under, a condition imposed by, or a requirement of the \n     statute or rule under which the otherwise-applicable \n     requirement that the agreement modifies, waives, or replaces \n     was imposed.\n       (5) Enforceability.--Each enforceable requirement shall be \n     enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent (by the \n     United States, by a State or Indian tribe, or by any other \n     person) as the otherwise-applicable requirement would have \n     been enforceable but for the agreement.\n       (6) New enforceable requirement derived from or imposed \n     under current law.--An enforceable requirement that does not \n     modify, waive, or replace a requirement shall be enforceable \n     in the same manner and to the same extent as a permit, \n     condition, or requirement under the statute or rule from or \n     under which the enforceable requirement derives or is \n     imposed.\n       (7) Enforceable requirement that does not modify, waive, or \n     replace another requirement.--If an enforceable requirement \n     does not derive from or is not imposed under any statutory or \n     regulatory provision, the agreement shall specify the statute \n     under which the enforceable requirement shall be deemed to be \n     imposed for purposes of enforcement and shall be enforceable \n     (by the United States, a State, Indian tribe, and by other \n     persons) in the same manner and to the same extent as a \n     permit, condition, or requirement under that statute or \n     regulation.\n       (8) Emergency or imminent hazard authority.--Nothing in \n     this Act limits or affects the Administrator's emergency or \n     imminent hazard authorities.\n       (c) Specification of Affected Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--When the Administrator approves an \n     innovative environmental strategy agreement under subsection \n     (a), the Administrator shall specify in the agreement each \n     rule, requirement, policy, or practice that is modified or \n     waived by the innovative agreement.\n       (2) No modification or waiver.--Each rule, requirement, \n     policy, or practice not specified pursuant to the preceding \n     sentence is not modified and waived.\n       (d) Termination or Modification of Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator may terminate or modify \n     an innovative environmental strategy agreement if the \n     Administrator determines that--\n       (A) the strategy fails or will fail to achieve the better \n     environmental results identified pursuant to section 7;\n       (B) better environmental results are no longer being \n     achieved by the strategy by reason of the enactment of a new \n     provision of law or promulgation of a new regulation;\n       (C) there has been noncompliance with the terms of the \n     agreement (including a voluntary commitment);\n       (D) there has been a change or transfer in ownership or \n     operational control of the facility to which the agreement \n     relates, or a material change, alteration, or addition to the \n     facility; or\n       (E) any other event specified in the agreement as a ground \n     for termination or modification has occurred.\n       (2) Effect.--On termination of an innovative environmental \n     strategy agreement, the owner or operator of the facility to \n     which the agreement related shall immediately become subject \n     to each otherwise-applicable requirement (as defined in \n     subsection (b)).\n       (e) Term of Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--The term of an innovative environmental \n     strategy agreement shall not exceed 5 years, unless the \n     Administrator determines, after considering the views of the \n     stakeholders, that--\n       (A) a longer period of time is required--\n       (i) to achieve the better environmental results identified \n     under section 7; or\n       (ii) in a case in which a proponent is making a substantial \n     investment in reliance on the agreement, to ensure a \n     reasonable degree of confidence that the investment will be \n     recovered; and\n       (B) the requirements of section 7 continue to be met.\n       (2) Extension or renewal.--In consultation with the \n     stakeholders and with the concurrence of the signatories to \n     the agreement and after public notice and opportunity for \n     comment consistent with section 8, the Administrator may \n     extend or renew an agreement for an additional term or terms, \n     but the Administrator may not extend or renew an agreement if \n     the extension or renewal would not further the purposes of \n     this Act or the strategy would no longer meet the \n     requirements of section 7.\n\n     SEC. 11. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Failure To Perform Nondiscretionary Act or Duty.--\n       (1) In general.--Any person may commence a civil action in \n     the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \n     against the Administrator for failure to perform an act or \n     duty under this Act that is not discretionary with the \n     Administrator.\n       (2) Timing.--No action may be commenced under subsection \n     (a) before the date that is 60 days after the date on which \n     the plaintiff gives notice to the Administrator of the act or \n     duty that the Administrator has failed to perform and of the \n     intent of the plaintiff to commence the action.\n       (b) Decision To Enter Into Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--A person other than a signatory to an \n     innovative environmental strategy agreement may seek judicial \n     review of a decision by the Administrator to enter into such \n     an agreement in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Appeal.--A petition on appeal of a judgment in a civil \n     action under this subsection shall be filed in the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     not later than 90 days after the date on which public notice \n     of the decision to enter into the agreement is published \n     under section 8(b).\n       (c) No Judicial Review of or Record Justification for \n     Decision Not To Enter Into\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\n     Agreement.--A decision not to enter into, modify, renew, or \n     enter into negotiations toward an innovative environmental \n     strategy agreement and decisions under section 6 regarding \n     the stakeholder process shall not be subject to judicial \n     review and shall not require record justification by the \n     Administrator.\n\n     SEC. 12. LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall not enter into \n     more than 50 innovative environmental strategy agreements \n     unless, in the Administrator's sole discretion, and taking \n     into account the full range of the agency's obligations, the \n     Administrator determines that adequate resources exist to \n     enter into a greater number of agreements.\n       (b) Limit.--The Administrator, in the Administrator's sole \n     discretion, may limit the number of agreements to less than \n     50.\n       (c) Priority Consideration Diversity.--The Administrator \n     shall--\n       (1) give priority consideration to proposals from small \n     businesses; and\n       (2) seek to ensure that the agreements entered into reflect \n     proposals from a diversity of industrial sectors, \n     particularly from sectors where there is significant \n     potential for environmental improvement.\n\n     SEC. 13. SMALL BUSINESS PROPOSALS.\n\n       The Administrator shall establish a program to facilitate \n     development of proposals for innovative environmental \n     strategies from small businesses and groups of small \n     businesses and to provide for expedited and tailored review \n     of such proposals.\n\n     SEC. 14. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       (a) Effect of Decisions by the Administrator.--A decision \n     by the Administrator to enter into an agreement under this \n     Act shall not affect the validity or applicability of any \n     rule, requirement, policy, or practice, that is modified or \n     waived in the agreement with respect to any facility other \n     than the facility that is subject to the agreement.\n       (b) Other Agreements.--Nothing in this Act affects the \n     authority of the Administrator in existence on the date of \n     enactment of this Act to enter into or carry out agreements \n     providing for innovative environmental strategies or affects \n     any other existing authority under which the Administrator \n     may undertake innovative initiatives.\n       (c) Other Federal Agencies.--Nothing in this Act affects \n     the regulatory or enforcement authority of any other Federal \n     agency under the laws implemented by the Federal agency \n     except to the extent provided in an agreement to which the \n     other Federal agency is a party.\n       (d) Limits on Purposes and Uses of Agreements.--An \n     agreement under this Act--\n       (1) may not be adopted for the purpose of curing or \n     addressing past or ongoing violations or noncompliance at a \n     participating facility;\n       (2) may not be used as a legal or equitable defense by any \n     party or facility not party to the agreement, or by a party \n     to the agreement as a defense in an action unrelated to any \n     requirement imposed under the agreement;\n       (3) shall not limit or affect the Administrator's authority \n     to issue new generally applicable regulations or to apply \n     regulations to the facility that is the subject of the \n     agreement;\n       (4) shall not give rise to any claim for damages or \n     compensation in the event of a change in statutes or \n     regulations applicable to such facility; and\n       (5) shall not be admissible for any purpose in any judicial \n     proceeding other than a proceeding to challenge, defend, or \n     enforce the agreement.\n       (e) Applicable Law.--\n       (1) Contract law.--An innovative environmental strategy \n     agreement--\n       (A) shall not be interpreted or applied according to \n     contract law principles; and\n       (B) shall not be subject to contract or other common law \n     defenses.\n       (2) OSHA.--For purposes of section 4(b)(1) of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. \n     653(b)(1)), the exercise by the Administrator of any \n     authority under this Act shall not be deemed to constitute or \n     exercise of authority to prescribe or enforce a standard or \n     regulation affecting occupational safety or health.\n\n     SEC. 15. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\n       (a) Evaluation.--The Administrator shall establish an \n     ongoing process with public participation to--\n       (1) evaluate lessons learned from innovative environmental \n     strategies; and\n       (2) determine whether the approaches embodied in an \n     innovative environmental strategy should be proposed for \n     incorporation in an agency rule.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) Individual strategies.--Not later than 18 months after \n     entering into an innovative environmental strategy agreement, \n     the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report \n     evaluating whether the approaches embodied in an innovative \n     environmental strategy should be proposed for incorporation \n     in a statute or a regulation.\n       (2) Aggregate effect.--Not later than 3 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the aggregate effect of the \n     innovative environmental strategy agreements entered into \n     under this Act, including--\n       (A) the number and characteristics of the agreements;\n       (B) estimates of the environmental and public health \n     benefits, including any reductions in quantities or types of \n     emissions and wastes generated;\n       (C) estimates of the effect on compliance costs;\n       (D) the degree and nature of public participation and \n     accountability;\n       (E) estimates of nonenvironmental benefits obtained;\n       (F) conclusions on the functioning of the stakeholder \n     participation process; and\n       (G) a comparison of effectiveness of the program relative \n     to comparable State programs, using comparable performance \n     measures.\n\n     SEC. 16.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Prince Nova, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n               THE CROSS SOUND FERRY SERVICE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator \nLieberman legislation to waive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly \nknown as the Jones Act, to allow Cross Sound Ferry Services, Inc., to \npurchase, rebuild, and operate the 1964 Canadian-built vessel Prince \nNova. Faced with an increased demand for its services and a shortage of \nsuitable U.S.-built ferries, Cross Sound cannot purchase a domestically \nbuilt vessel.\n  Cross Sound Ferry Services, a family owned, nonsubsidized operation, \nprovides auto, truck, and high speed passenger service between Orient \nPoint, NY, and New London, CT. According to the proposed waiver, Cross \nSound will purchase the Prince Nova, and spend more than three times \nthe purchase price, no less than $4.2 million, on the conversion, \nrestoration, repair, rebuilding, or retrofitting of the ferry in a \nshipyard located in New London.\n  Cross Sound Ferry Service, a vital link between New England and \neastern Long Island, provides an alternative mode of transportation \nthat saves trucks and autos up to 200 miles in each direction, and \nreduces traffic, congestion, and wear on major roadways. From an \nenvironmental standpoint, ferry service reduces fuel consumption and \npollution. Currently, the I-95 corridor throughout the Northeast is \nunder a tremendous traffic burden. If the waiver is granted, it is \nexpected that the new and expanded service the Prince Nova will provide \nwill save 6 million miles and 360,000 travel hours.\n  Cross Sound's commitment to service the Prince Nova in a United \nStates shipyard will create high-skilled, high-wage jobs. Additionally, \nthis waiver will undoubtably better facilitate commerce and encourage \neconomic development in the region by allowing consumers easier access \nto goods and services. Furthermore, it will provide businesses with an \nadditional mode to transport their products.\n  An identical waiver was passed last week in the House of \nRepresentatives as part of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1997. \nIt is our hope that it will receive the same favorable consideration in \nthe Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 332 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to preserve State and local authority to regulate the placement, \nconstruction, and modification of certain telecommunications \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n             THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my \nbill to preserve State and local authority to regulate the placement, \nconstruction, and modification of telecommunication facilities be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress make the following findings:\n       (1) The placement of commercial telecommunications, radio, \n     or television towers near homes can greatly reduce the value \n     of such homes, destroy the views from such homes, and reduce \n     substantially the desire to live in such homes.\n       (2) States and localities should be able to exercise \n     control over the construction and location of such towers \n     through the use of zoning, planned growth, and other controls \n     relating to the protection of the environment and public \n     safety.\n       (3) There are alternatives to the construction of \n     additional telecommunications towers to meet \n     telecommunications needs, including the co-location of \n     antennae on existing towers and the use of alternative \n     technologies.\n       (4) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications \n     Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, \n     which would preempt the application of State and local zoning \n     and land use ordinances regarding the placement of \n     telecommunications towers. It is in the interest of the \n     Nation that the Commission not adopt this rule.\n       (5) It is in the interest of the Nation that the second \n     memorandum opinion and order and notice of proposed rule \n     making of the Commission with respect to application of such \n     ordinances to the placement of such towers, WT Docket No. 97-\n     192, ET Docket No. 93-62, and RM-8577, be modified in order \n     to permit State and local governments to exercise their \n     zoning and land use authorities, and their power to protect \n     public health and safety, to regulate the placement of \n     telecommunications towers and to place the burden of proof in \n     civil actions relating to the placement of such towers on the \n     person or entity that seeks to place, construct, or modify \n     such towers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To repeal the limitations on the exercise of State and \n     local authorities regarding the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless service facilities that \n     arise under section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).\n       (2) To permit State and local governments to regulate the \n     placement, construction, and modification of such facilities \n     on the basis of the environmental effects of the operation of \n     such facilities.\n       (3) To prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from \n     adopting rules which would preempt State and local regulation \n     of the placement of such facilities.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN \n                   TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Limitations.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that \n     follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not \n     unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally \n     equivalent services.'';\n       (2) by striking clause (iv);\n       (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n       (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated, by striking the \n     third sentence and inserting the following: ``In any such \n     action in which a person seeking to place, construct, or \n     modify a tower facility is a party, such person shall bear \n     the burden of proof.''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Federal Communications Commission \n     may not adopt as a final rule the proposed rule set forth in \n     ``Preemption of State and Local Zoning and Land Use \n     Restrictions on Siting, Placement and Construction of \n     Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'', MM Docket No. \n     97-182, released August 19, 1997.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to continue a discussion \nthat my colleague, Senator Leahy, began earlier, with regard to the \nFederal Communications Commission proposed rulemaking on regulations \nfor wireless and digital broadcast facilities.\n  University of Vermont instructor and landscape designer Jean \nVeissering recently stated ``We have a real spiritual connection with \nhilltops. They tend to be almost sacred ground. Building something \njarringly out of character upon them seems almost like a sacrilege.'' \nMr. President, I share Jean's sentiments completely. In addition, it is \nthe beautiful views of the majestic mountain ranges that in many ways \ndefines what Vermont is all about.\n  Vermonters take great pride in their heritage as a State committed to \nthe ideals of freedom and unity. That heritage goes hand and hand with \na unique quality of life and the desire to grow and develop while \nmaintaining Vermont's beauty and character. Ethan Allan and his Green \nMountain Boys and countless other independent minded Vermonters helped \nshape the Nation's 14th State while making outstanding contributions to \nthe independence of this country. Today, that independence still \npersists in the hills and valleys of Vermont. Vermonters have worked \nhard over the years to maintain local control over issues that impact \nthem directly.\n  Throughout my years in Congress, I fought hard to protect the ability \nof Vermonters to step out of their kitchen doors and see an \nunobstructed view. Thousands of Americans travel to Vermont each year \nto take in the splendid nature of the State.\n  However, Vermont could have looked quite different if it were not for \nsome foresight on behalf of several Vermonters. In the 1960's, the \nState of Vermont was entering into a period of unchecked development. \nIn response, Governor Dean C. Davis created the Commission on \nEnvironmental Control in May of 1969. The commission drafted a set of \nrecommendations to help manage the precious resources of the State.\n  As the attorney general for the State at that time, I was one of the \nprimary drafters of an environmental land use law which would later \nbecome known as Act 250. Act 250 was specifically written to control \ndevelopment, not to stop development, and in turn, this act has led \nVermont to economic prosperity through balanced environmental \nprotection.\n  After reviewing the Commission on Environmental Control's \nrecommendation and the proposed legislation, Governor Davis made one \nvery basic, but important change in the legislation. The proposed \nlegislation had called for a State agency to administer the act. The \nGovernor was adamant in his belief that the control should be as close \nto the people as possible. It is that control which the FCC's proposed \nrulemaking is looking to preempt.\n  Governor Davis' recommendation led to placing the permitting process \nin the hands of local environmental review boards with appeal rights to \nthe Vermont Environmental Board. Thus, the act is administered by men \nand women who are directly involved in their communities and thoroughly \nfamiliar with local concerns.\n  When reviewing an application for new development, the local \nenvironmental review boards take into account the economic needs of the \nState along with regional concerns. The review board's underlying goal \nis to direct the impact of development toward the positive. The \npositive approach has led to a high priority on preserving the \nenvironment, protecting the natural resources, and maintaining the \nquality of life of all Vermonters.\n  On October 9, 1997, the State of Vermont Environmental Board filed \ncomments with the Federal Communications Commission that stated: ``Far \nfrom being an impediment to personal wireless service deployment, \nVermont's Act 250 demonstrates that the\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\npath to economic prosperity is through balanced environmental \nprotection, not preemption of such protection.'' I share the board's \nsentiments and feel that the FCC should take no further steps to \npreempt Vermont's Act 250 with respect to personal wireless service \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, the Green Mountain State has unique topography, \ndominated by rolling valleys and tall mountains. In turn, the citizens \nof the State have taken many steps to help preserve the beautiful views \nand pristine environment. The determination of the location of visible \ntransmission towers should remain within the jurisdiction of local \ncontrol. I feel that the Telecommunication Act of 1996 recognizes and \nprotects the interest of local and State government in the area of land \nuse regulation.\n  As the attorney general of the State of Vermont at the time of the \nenactment of Act 250, I am proud of the role I and many other \nVermonters played in the subsequent management of the precious natural \nresources of the State. I support Act 250 and feel that the placement \nof communications towers should be left in the hands of the residents \nof Vermont not by a Federal agency.\n  I have written to the Chairman of the FCC with regard to my concerns \nabout this proposed rulemaking. In addition, yesterday the Senate \nconfirmed William Kennard to be the next Chairman of the FCC. Upon his \nconfirmation, I wrote a letter to Chairman Kennard personally inviting \nhim to the State of Vermont to see first hand how this proposed \nrulemaking would impact the State. I hope that he will join me on a \ntour of the State which will demonstrate to him the importance of local \ncontrol with respect to the placement of broadcast facilities. Further, \nI look forward to explaining how Act 250 has allowed for the \ndevelopment of wireless communication in the State while protecting the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to commend Mr. Leahy for \nintroducing this very important legislation for the State of Vermont. I \nam pleased to be a cosponsor and I look forward to working with him to \nprotect Vermont's interests unique landscape.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1351. A bill to amend the Sikes Act to establish a mechanism by \nwhich outdoor recreation programs on military installations will be \naccessible to disabled veterans, military dependents with disabilities, \nand other persons with disabilities; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n                  the disabled sportsmen's access act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Disabled \nSportsmen's Access Act. This legislation will provide new opportunities \nfor sportsmen with disabilities to hunt and fish on the numerous \nDepartment of Defense facilities across this Nation. This legislation \nwill also allow the Department of Defense to work with private sector \ngroups to build facilities and operate programs for the benefit of \nsportsmen with disabilities.\n  The beginnings of this legislation originate from a program developed \nat the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, VA. The program, run by Lt. Col. \nLewis Deal, is a prime example of the work that can be done to provide \nnew opportunities for people with disabilities. Lieutenant Colonel Deal \nhas combined private sector volunteers work with donations from other \npeople to build permanent disabled accessible blinds for deer hunting, \nwhich are used during both gun and bow seasons. These blinds provide \npeople living with disabilities many of the same opportunities for \noutdoor recreation that we all enjoy.\n  There are plans underway at this time to construct a fishing pier on \nthe Potomac River for access by people with disabilities. This pier is \nto be built with lower railings, and stops to provide access and \nsecurity for disabled persons.\n  This legislation, uses the current program at Quantico, to allow the \nDepartment of the Defense to provide access to it's 30 million acres of \nwildlands by disabled individuals, as long as it does not interfere \nwith the primary mission of the military, that of our Nation's defense. \nThe military installations around the Nation offer a number of \nrecreational and outdoor activities for both military and civilian \npersonnel.\n  This legislation, will encourage the Department of Defense to give \naccess to individuals with disabilities and allow the Department to \naccept donations or money and materials as well as use volunteers for \nthe construction of facilities accessible to sportsmen with \ndisabilities. The bill would allow this voluntary work to be done \nwithout cost to the Federal Government or the taxpayer.\n  Madam President, this legislation has the support of numerous \norganizations, including the bipartisan Congressional Sportsmen's \nCaucus, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans. \nAmong sportsmen's groups the bill has the endorsement of the Wheeling \nSportsmen of America, Safari Club International, Wildlife Management \nInstitute, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies \nand the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation. I join today with my \nfriend Congressman Duke Cunningham to bring this important legislation \nto the attention of my colleagues.\n  I hope that all my colleagues in Congress would join Congressman \nCunningham and myself in supporting this legislation for disabled \nsportsmen in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Smith of Oregon) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 58\n\n       Whereas the Russian legislature approved a bill ``On \n     Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association'', and \n     Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed it into law on \n     September 26;\n       Whereas under the new law, the Russian government exercises \n     almost unrestricted control over the activities of both \n     Russian and international religious groups;\n       Whereas the new law will grant privileged status to some \n     religions while discriminating against others through \n     restrictive reporting and registration requirements;\n       Whereas the new law jeopardizes religious rights by \n     permitting government officials, in consultation with \n     privileged religious groups, to deny or revoke the \n     registration of minority religions and order their possible \n     disbandment or prohibition, on the basis of such activities \n     as home schooling, nonmedical forms of healing, ``hypnotic'' \n     sermons, and other vaguely defined offenses;\n       Whereas the law also restricts foreign missionary work in \n     Russia;\n       Whereas under the new law, religious organizations or \n     churches that wish to continue their activities in Russia \n     will have to provide confirmation that they have existed at \n     least 15 years, and only those who legally operated 50 years \n     ago may be recognized as national ``Russian'' religious \n     organizations;\n       Whereas although Article 14 of the Russian Constitution \n     stipulates that ``religious associations are separate from \n     the state and are equal before the law'', Article 19 states \n     that restriction of citizens' rights on grounds of religious \n     affiliation are prohibited, and Article 28 stipulates that \n     ``each person is guaranteed freedom of conscience and freedom \n     * * * to choose, hold, and disseminate religious and other \n     convictions and to act in accordance with them'', the new law \n     clearly violates these provisions of the Russian \n     Constitution;\n       Whereas the Russian religion law violates accepted \n     international agreements on human rights and religious \n     freedoms to which the Russian Federation is a signatory, \n     including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \n     Helsinki Final Act and Madrid and Vienna Concluding \n     Documents, and the European Convention on Human Rights;\n       Whereas governments have a primary responsibility to \n     promote, encourage, and protect respect for the fundamental \n     and internationally recognized right to freedom of religion; \n     and\n       Whereas the United States Government is committed to the \n     right to freedom of religion and its policies, and should \n     encourage\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\n     foreign governments to commit to this principle: Now, \n     therefore, be it--\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress hereby--\n       (1) condemns the newly passed Russian antireligion law \n     restricting freedom of religion, and violating international \n     norms, international treaties to which the Russian Federation \n     is a signatory, and the Constitution of Russia;\n       (2) recommends that President Clinton make the United \n     States position clear to President Yeltsin and the Russian \n     legislature that this antireligion law may seriously harm \n     United States-Russian relations;\n       (3) calls upon President Yeltsin and the Russian \n     legislature to uphold their international commitments on \n     human rights, abide by the Russian Constitution's guarantee \n     of freedom of religion, and reconsider their position by \n     amending the new antireligion law and lifting all \n     restrictions on freedom of religion; and\n       (4) calls upon all governments and legislatures of the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union to respect \n     religious human rights in accordance with their international \n     commitments and resist efforts to adopt the Russian \n     discriminatory law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11465-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11466-S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        THE EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        KOHL AMENDMENT NO. 1528\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KOHL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (H.R. 2646) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-free expenditures from education individual retirement accounts for \nelementary and secondary school expenses, to increase the maximum \nannual amount of contributions to such accounts, and for other \npurposes;

Seven million children attend schools \n     with life safety code violations. Twelve million children \n     attend schools with leaky roofs.\n       ``(3) The General Accounting Office found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced.\n       ``(4) The condition of school facilities has a direct \n     affect on the safety of students and teachers, and on the \n     ability of students to learn.\n       ``(5) Academic research has proven a direct correlation \n     between the condition of school facilities and student \n     achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers found \n     students assigned to schools in poor condition can be \n     expected to fall 10.9 percentage points below those in \n     buildings in excellent condition.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The structure of the Internal Revenue Service should be \n     strengthened to ensure focus and better target its budgeting, \n     staffing, and technology to serve the American taxpayer and \n     collect the Federal revenue.\n       (2) The American public expects timely, accurate, and \n     respectful service from the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (3) The job of the Internal Revenue Service is to operate \n     as an efficient financial management organization.\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\n       (4) The bulk of the Federal revenue is generated through \n     voluntary compliance. Taxpayer service and education, as well \n     as targeted compliance and enforcement initiatives, increase \n     voluntary compliance.\n       (5) While the Internal Revenue Service must maintain a \n     strong enforcement presence, its core and the core of the \n     Federal revenue stream lie in a revamped, modern, \n     technologically advanced organization that can track \n     finances, send out clear notices, and assist taxpayers \n     promptly and efficiently.\n       (6) The Internal Revenue Service governance, management, \n     and oversight structures must: develop and maintain a shared \n     vision with continuity; set and maintain priorities and \n     strategic direction; impose accountability on senior \n     management; provide oversight through a credible board, \n     including members who bring private sector expertise to the \n     Internal Revenue Service; develop appropriate measures of \n     success; align budget and technology with priorities and \n     strategic direction; and coordinate oversight and identify \n     problems at an early stage.\n       (7) The Internal Revenue Service must use information \n     technology as an enabler of its strategic objectives.\n       (8) Electronic filing can increase cost savings and \n     compliance.\n       (9) In order to ensure that fewer taxpayers are subject to \n     improper treatment by the Internal Revenue Service, Congress \n     and the agency need to focus on preventing problems before \n     they occur.\n       (10) There currently is no mechanism in place to ensure \n     that Members of Congress have a complete understanding of how \n     tax legislation will affect taxpayers and the Internal \n     Revenue Service and to create incentives to simplify the tax \n     law, and to ensure that Congress hears directly from the \n     Internal Revenue Service during the legislative process.\n       (b) The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To restructure the Internal Revenue Service, \n     transforming it into a world class service organization.\n       (2) To establish taxpayer satisfaction as the goal of the \n     Internal Revenue Service, such that the Internal Revenue \n     Service should only initiate contact with a taxpayer if the \n     agency is prepared to devote the resources necessary for a \n     proper and timely resolution of the matter.\n       (3) To provide for direct accountability to the President \n     for tax administration, an Internal Revenue Service Oversight \n     Board, a strengthened Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and \n     coordinated congressional oversight to ensure that there are \n     clear lines of accountability and that the leadership of the \n     Internal Revenue Service has the continuity and expertise to \n     guide the agency.\n       (4) To enable the Internal Revenue Service to recruit and \n     train a first-class workforce that will be rewarded for \n     performance and held accountable for working with taxpayers \n     to solve problems.\n       (5) To establish paperless filing as the preferred and most \n     convenient means of filing tax returns for the vast majority \n     of taxpayers within 10 years of enactment of this Act.\n       (6) To provide additional taxpayer protections and rights \n     and to ensure that taxpayers receive fair, impartial, timely, \n     and courteous treatment from the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (7) To establish the resolution of the century date change \n     problem as the highest technology priority of the Internal \n     Revenue Service.\n       (8) To establish procedures to minimize complexity in the \n     tax law and simplify tax administration, and provide Congress \n     with an independent view of tax administration from the \n     Internal Revenue Service.\n\n   TITLE I--EXECUTIVE BRANCH GOVERNANCE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE \n                        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n     Subtitle A--Executive Branch Governance and Senior Management\n\n     SEC. 101.

She began teaching \nat the Bowen School in 1919, and later became the school's principal \nbefore retiring in 1964. Miss Hedke cherished her experiences at the \nBowen School so much that she now lives in the building that was once \nhome to the original Bowen School.\n  As an educator, Miss Hedke inspired her students to dream, encouraged \nexcellence and showed them the many avenues of opportunity made \navailable through learning. She gave her students the foundation for \ntheir dreams. Her influence on the many students she touched has \nenriched their lives, and ours, in ways too numerous to calculate. She \ngave young people the confidence in themselves and hope for the future.\n  The Village of Riverdale, the State of Illinois, and our nation are \nall better as a result of Florence Hedke's talent, love and commitment \nto education. She is truly one of Illinois' special treasures, and I am \nhonored to join in the celebration of her 100th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11487-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11487-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHRISTIANITY IN PUBLIC LIFE TODAY\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to submit for the record \nan address delivered by my colleague, Senator Abraham from Michigan, to \nLegatus, a group of Catholic business leaders concerned to bring their \nfaith into their economic and public lives.\n  We live in an era, Mr. President, in which religious Americans are \nfaced with a number of obstacles as they seek to live their faith in \nour public square. I believe that Senator Abraham well states the \ndilemma faced by people of faith and I hope our citizens, and Members \nof this body in particular, will heed his call for greater \nunderstanding and accommodation for religious principles and beliefs.\n  As we face a continuing breakdown of our families and communities, I \nbelieve it is essential that we return to the fundamental institutions, \nbeliefs and practices on which our society was founded. And to do that \nwe must recognize the central role religion has and must continue to \nplay in shaping our character and our community.\n  The address follows:\n\n\n                     CHRISTIANITY IN AMERICA TODAY\n\n       An address delivered to the Legatus Regional Conference on \n     October 11, 1997 by Senator Spencer Abraham\n       First I would like to thank Tom Monahan and all the members \n     of Legatus for having me here. Your work, bringing your faith \n     to bear on your daily lives as business people and citizens, \n     is crucial, in my view, to the health of our republic and the \n     souls of our people.\n       Because I am speaking today about Christianity in America, \n     I first must point out the standpoint from which I speak: I \n     am both a Christian and a United States Senator. Now, some \n     people might say that ``Christian Senator'' is an oxymoron, \n     right up there with ``political ethics'' or ``military \n     intelligence.'' And it certainly can be difficult to stand up \n     for what is right, for what Christ demands, if you listen too \n     closely to the Washington wisdom. But I think those of you \n     here today know full well how difficult it can be to bring \n     your private beliefs into your public life. Indeed, I think \n     our country as a whole suffers from the fact that we tend to \n     seek a Christian private life while the government too often \n     discourages Christian conduct.\n       Christianity in America and Christianity in Washington and \n     our state capitals seem to be different things. The good \n     news, of course, is that Christianity in America is in many \n     ways thriving.\n       For example, by now most Americans have heard of the \n     Promise Keepers. This organization was founded in 1990 by \n     former University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney. \n     Since its inception over two and a half million men have been \n     to Promise Keepers conferences.\n       Here they promise to:\n       (1) Honor Jesus Christ through worship, prayer and \n     obedience to God's word.\n       (2) Pursue friendships with men who will help them keep \n     their promises.\n       (3) Practice spiritual, moral, ethical and sexual purity.\n       (4) Strengthen their commitment to their wives and children \n     through love, protection and devotion to the Bible.\n       (5) Become more involved in their churches.\n       (6) Seek racial harmony, and\n       (7) Follow the Golden Rule by loving God and loving their \n     neighbors as themselves.\n       That's an unfashionable set of promises to ask men to keep. \n     Yet hundreds of thousands of them came to Washington on \n     October 4, pledging to keep these promises in their daily \n     lives.\n       And there are a number of other important groups working to \n     bring Christianity back into people's lives. Just a couple of \n     weeks ago in Washington there was an ``Emerging Urban Leaders \n     Conference.'' Dozens of young people--so-called ``Generation \n     Xers'' --from all over the country came together. At this \n     conference they discussed ways to cooperate and learn from \n     one another as they worked in faith-based groups struggling \n     for community renewal.\n       The conference was held in a spirit of optimism because of \n     the new organizations and networks that are forming around \n     the idea that faith-based programs can save our inner cities, \n     and those who live in them.\n       And the statistics from a Gallup poll conducted just this \n     year show that Christianity is very much alive among the \n     American people.\n       Despite what you may hear in the press, less than 1% of the \n     American people are atheists. Meanwhile, 9 out of 10 \n     Americans give a religious identification. 7 out of 10 say \n     they are a member of a church or synagogue. 6 out of 10 say \n     religion is an important part of their daily life. 77% \n     believe the Bible is the inspired word of God. 40% attend \n     church on a weekly basis--a rate that has held steady for \n     almost 40 years. 66% report that prayer is an important part \n     of their daily life. And 61% believe religion can answer all \n     or most of today's problems.\n       Unfortunately, despite this common religious attitude among \n     the people, in Washington and many state capitals \n     Christianity is having to struggle.\n       Let me give some examples.\n       First, one of the fundamental bases of our moral order, \n     recognized by Judaism, Christianity and Islam alike, is the \n     Ten Commandments. The moral principles laid out in these \n     commandments, including love of God as well as rules against \n     murder and perjury, literally gave birth to our society. We \n     ignore them at our peril. Unfortunately, at least one judge \n     has sought to bar expression of these principles from our \n     public square.\n       Recently, an Alabama judge ordered his colleague, Judge Roy \n     S. Moore, to stop displaying the Ten Commandments in his \n     courtroom. This ruling, now on hold, rests on the mistaken \n     belief that the Constitution's religion clause forbids such \n     displays. It also rests on hostility toward public \n     affirmations of our religious heritage. It can only undermine \n     our adherence to the principles underlying our moral order.\n       A resolution introduced by my colleague, Jeff Sessions, \n     would state that Judge Moore should be allowed to continue \n     displaying the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. I believe \n     that this is the appropriate response.\n       Unfortunately, activist judges have not been the only ones \n     opposing any role for religion in our public life. Our \n     elected officials too often undermine worthy projects out of \n     hostility or fear toward religion.\n       For example, my colleague, Georgia Senator Paul Coverdell, \n     has proposed education legislation establishing ``A-Plus \n     Accounts.'' These accounts would allow parents to use the \n     tax-free education savings accounts provided in the recent \n     Taxpayer Relief Act for their children's elementary and \n     secondary schooling, rather than just for college.\n       This would give parents greater control over their \n     children's education. With help from these accounts, parents \n     could buy a home computer to enable their child to explore \n     the internet; pay for tutoring for a child having trouble \n     with math; get occupational therapy for a child with special \n     needs, or save for tuition payments and home schooling.\n       The interest on these savings accounts would not be taxed \n     so long as it was used for educational expenses. And the cost \n     to the federal government and taxpayer? Zero. A+ Accounts \n     would simply allow parents to spend more of their own money \n     on their children's education.\n       Unfortunately, the President has vowed to veto any bill \n     containing these provisions. This administration does not \n     want parents\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\n     to control their own children's educations. Simply giving \n     parents the choice of saving their money for nonpublic and \n     parochial schools for this administration is unacceptable. \n     That is wrong, and it should be put right.\n       Another wrong we need to put right is abortion. I will do \n     everything I can as a United States Senator to protect unborn \n     life. Here I must point in admiration to my wife Jane. \n     Through the Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect pro-\n     life women to Congress, and through her many personal \n     efforts, she has done a great deal to improve our ability to \n     correct the great tragedy of abortion.\n       Unfortunately, the pro-life cause is subjected to a great \n     deal of unfair derision. The press focuses almost exclusively \n     on the few bad apples who resort to violence, and tar us all \n     as extremists. Meanwhile the terrible facts about partial \n     birth abortion have been denied repeatedly, despite massive \n     evidence. Even limited efforts to protect the unborn, like \n     parental notification, have consistently failed to make it \n     into law. In Washington, whether on the Senate floor or in \n     the papers, it is considered ``bad form'' to even bring up \n     the rights of the unborn.\n       Indeed, it seems to be bad form to bring up any issue of \n     principle or morality, let alone religion, in Washington. Nor \n     is Congress the only place in Washington where religion and \n     traditional values are being undermined. The Executive branch \n     has played its own, destructive role.\n       Recently President Clinton revoked Ronald Reagan's \n     Executive Order, decreeing that federal bureaucrats consider \n     their actions' effects on the families of this nation. As \n     stated in its preamble, President Reagan's Executive Order \n     was intended ``to ensure that the autonomy and rights of the \n     family are considered in the formulation and implementation \n     of policies by Executive departments and agencies.''\n       More than any government program, America's children are \n     protected, nurtured and given the means they need to lead \n     good lives by their families. No national ``village'' can \n     replace the constant care and attention of parents. But all \n     too often federal regulations interfere with parents as they \n     try to teach, protect and nurture them.\n       For example, the Family Research Council reports that the \n     Food and Drug Administration has classified home drug tests \n     as a ``Class 3 Medical Device,'' placing them in the same \n     category as heart pace makers. In effect, the FDA has barred \n     parents from using these tests in their homes--despite the \n     fact that the drug tests work in the same, simple manner as \n     home pregnancy tests.\n       The irony is that the federal government is using taxpayer \n     dollars to promote the use of other medical devices, namely \n     condoms. Condoms are the subject of a $400,000 federal \n     advertising effort, featuring rock music and sexually \n     suggestive imagery, carried out under federal Department of \n     Health and Human Services regulations.\n       It seems that, according to the federal government, \n     bureaucrats in Washington are the only ones qualified to make \n     certain that our children are not using drugs, and to educate \n     them concerning sexuality and contraception--matters of deep \n     importance to their spiritual lives.\n       In these and other ways, Washington seems to go out of its \n     way to show contempt for traditional values. For example, the \n     federally funded Smithsonian Institution, our premier \n     teaching museum, recently refused to allow the Boy Scouts to \n     hold an Honor Court ceremony at the National Zoo. Why? \n     Because the Boy Scouts ``discriminate'' against atheists.\n       I found it deeply disturbing that the Boy Scouts, one of \n     America's most important private organizations, which has \n     helped literally millions of American boys reach responsible \n     manhood, should be denied access to a federally supported \n     institution because it exercises its Constitutional right to \n     free exercise of religion.\n       I also was disturbed that the Smithsonian Institution, the \n     repository of so many objects central to our heritage as a \n     people, should enforce a policy diametrically opposed to the \n     principles on which our nation was founded.\n       Luckily, after I brought this travesty to the attention of \n     my colleagues in the Senate, enough pressure was applied to \n     the Smithsonian's secretary that he rescinded the order and \n     apologized for this obvious instance of intolerance for \n     religion.\n       I think it is important that we remember victories like \n     this. And there have been others.\n       For example, the last welfare reform bill finally \n     eliminated a destructive, ill-considered provision. That \n     provision prohibited faith-based organizations from \n     contracting with local governments to provide social \n     services. Under this provision, faith-based organizations had \n     to give up their religious character in order to provide \n     social services with public assistance. The results have been \n     tragic.\n       In the late 1980's, when the homeless population was \n     rising, state and local officials in Michigan discovered \n     large inner-city churches with plenty of space. But the \n     federal government would not give any money to cities seeking \n     to use the churches for homeless shelters. The problem? All \n     religious references in the churches, from crucifixes to \n     Bible scriptures carved into the walls, had to be removed or \n     covered if government funds were to be spent.\n       The same situation confronted the people of Flint, where \n     Catholic Social Services runs the North End Soup Kitchen in a \n     building owned by Sacred Heart church. In order to receive \n     government help, from what I am told, they were required to \n     cover up their crucifixes and religious icons and literally \n     hide the bibles. They even were required to create a separate \n     legal entity to accept the aid.\n       This is wrong. It keeps many good organizations from \n     getting more involved in their communities. It saps our \n     religious spirit and denies people assistance they need.\n       Fortunately for our communities, this has changed. The \n     charitable choice provision will see to it that states \n     consider religious organizations on an equal, \n     nondiscriminatory basis with private institutions. Faith \n     based organizations are no longer required to remove \n     ``religious art, icons or other symbols'' to receive federal \n     funds. They also are no longer required to change hiring \n     practices or create separate corporations in order to receive \n     government contracts. The only requirement these \n     organizations must meet is that they cannot use government \n     money for sectarian worship, instruction or proselytizing \n     activities.\n       These reforms already have produced miraculous results. \n     Ottawa County recently was the subject of front page stories \n     in both the Washington Post and USA Today. Why? Because that \n     county's conservative, church-going communities have done \n     what no one else had seemed able to do: get every one of its \n     able-bodied welfare recipients into a paying job. Every one.\n       Governor Engler's innovative ``Project Zero'' deserves a \n     great deal of credit for these results. But even more \n     important, in my view, has been the participation of local \n     churches and parishioners.\n       Faith-based organizations and individuals have served as \n     mentors, helping people in trouble get their lives back on \n     track. Whether by volunteering to babysit, by helping out \n     with a loan, or by offering friendship and spiritual \n     guidance, these people gave of themselves in ways that have \n     changed lives for the better--in ways that until recently \n     were considered illegal.\n       I think the Ottawa County experience shows that welfare \n     reform is a solid step forward. We need to build on it, and \n     try to move public policy in a way that recognizes the \n     fundamental role of religion in our lives, and the \n     fundamental principles religion gives us to guide our lives.\n       Most important, of course, is our duty to protect our \n     children, born and unborn. And, on that front, I am hopeful \n     that we will finally make some progress in the battle against \n     abortion.\n       The House of Representatives has finally joined the Senate \n     by voting to ban partial birth abortion. I know I, and \n     thousands upon thousands of other people, was deeply \n     disturbed by the tactics of some proponents of abortion in \n     defending this practice. But I think the word is finally out: \n     Partial birth abortion is dangerous, unnecessary, and simply \n     unacceptable. And I am confident that, despite the \n     President's veto, we will finally bring this inexcusable \n     practice to a halt, once and for all.\n       But this struggle, over the most fundamental principle of \n     all--the sanctity of human life--shows why we can't let \n     liberals have their way.\n       I want to encourage all of you to get involved and stay \n     involved in public life. Of course, you already are involved \n     by being here in Legatus. But I think America needs you to do \n     even more.\n       Frankly, there are plenty of groups organized on the other \n     side who have a far different and far more radical agenda \n     than those of us who want to restore traditional religious \n     values. They want abortion on demand, fully-funded by \n     taxpayer dollars up to and including the ninth month. They \n     want government-paid physician assisted suicide, paid for by \n     the Medicare and Medicaid plans to which you are forced to \n     contribute. They want to push religion all the way out of our \n     public life, from our schools, from our courthouses, and from \n     our communities.\n       But there is no reason to despair. In fact, I think it \n     would show an inappropriate lack of faith to despair for our \n     country. With God's help, you and I can make a difference. We \n     can stand up for the unborn. We can defend our families and \n     the sanctity of marriage against deluded lawmakers and the \n     smut put out by so-called ``entertainers.'' We can fight to \n     bring God back into the classroom and the courtroom. We can \n     make America beautiful again by reminding her that, whatever \n     Washington might say, we are a nation Under God and \n     answerable to Him for our actions.\n       I am not here to tell you that this task will be easy. But \n     I believe I share with you the conviction that God calls us \n     to work for a more humane public square, in which the voice \n     of faith can be heard. I believe I share with you also the \n     conviction that God is calling all of us, in and out of \n     Washington and Lansing, to renew our public life, to restore \n     it to spiritual health by fighting for the same principles \n     for which Christ died.\n       The cross may be heavy, but surely not so heavy as His. And \n     we owe it to ourselves, our children and our God to work, in \n     our homes, in our parishes and local communities, in our \n     private lives and in our public lives, to make our society \n     recognize the value of unborn life, the value of the lives of \n     those who are old, ill or simply inconvenient, the value of a \n     life not lived for the pleasure of the moment, but for the \n     glory of God.\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11487-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11487-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHRISTIANITY IN PUBLIC LIFE TODAY\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to submit for the record \nan address delivered by my colleague, Senator Abraham from Michigan, to \nLegatus, a group of Catholic business leaders concerned to bring their \nfaith into their economic and public lives.\n  We live in an era, Mr. President, in which religious Americans are \nfaced with a number of obstacles as they seek to live their faith in \nour public square. I believe that Senator Abraham well states the \ndilemma faced by people of faith and I hope our citizens, and Members \nof this body in particular, will heed his call for greater \nunderstanding and accommodation for religious principles and beliefs.\n  As we face a continuing breakdown of our families and communities, I \nbelieve it is essential that we return to the fundamental institutions, \nbeliefs and practices on which our society was founded. And to do that \nwe must recognize the central role religion has and must continue to \nplay in shaping our character and our community.\n  The address follows:\n\n\n                     CHRISTIANITY IN AMERICA TODAY\n\n       An address delivered to the Legatus Regional Conference on \n     October 11, 1997 by Senator Spencer Abraham\n       First I would like to thank Tom Monahan and all the members \n     of Legatus for having me here. Your work, bringing your faith \n     to bear on your daily lives as business people and citizens, \n     is crucial, in my view, to the health of our republic and the \n     souls of our people.\n       Because I am speaking today about Christianity in America, \n     I first must point out the standpoint from which I speak: I \n     am both a Christian and a United States Senator. Now, some \n     people might say that ``Christian Senator'' is an oxymoron, \n     right up there with ``political ethics'' or ``military \n     intelligence.'' And it certainly can be difficult to stand up \n     for what is right, for what Christ demands, if you listen too \n     closely to the Washington wisdom. But I think those of you \n     here today know full well how difficult it can be to bring \n     your private beliefs into your public life. Indeed, I think \n     our country as a whole suffers from the fact that we tend to \n     seek a Christian private life while the government too often \n     discourages Christian conduct.\n       Christianity in America and Christianity in Washington and \n     our state capitals seem to be different things. The good \n     news, of course, is that Christianity in America is in many \n     ways thriving.\n       For example, by now most Americans have heard of the \n     Promise Keepers. This organization was founded in 1990 by \n     former University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney. \n     Since its inception over two and a half million men have been \n     to Promise Keepers conferences.\n       Here they promise to:\n       (1) Honor Jesus Christ through worship, prayer and \n     obedience to God's word.\n       (2) Pursue friendships with men who will help them keep \n     their promises.\n       (3) Practice spiritual, moral, ethical and sexual purity.\n       (4) Strengthen their commitment to their wives and children \n     through love, protection and devotion to the Bible.\n       (5) Become more involved in their churches.\n       (6) Seek racial harmony, and\n       (7) Follow the Golden Rule by loving God and loving their \n     neighbors as themselves.\n       That's an unfashionable set of promises to ask men to keep. \n     Yet hundreds of thousands of them came to Washington on \n     October 4, pledging to keep these promises in their daily \n     lives.\n       And there are a number of other important groups working to \n     bring Christianity back into people's lives. Just a couple of \n     weeks ago in Washington there was an ``Emerging Urban Leaders \n     Conference.'' Dozens of young people--so-called ``Generation \n     Xers'' --from all over the country came together. At this \n     conference they discussed ways to cooperate and learn from \n     one another as they worked in faith-based groups struggling \n     for community renewal.\n       The conference was held in a spirit of optimism because of \n     the new organizations and networks that are forming around \n     the idea that faith-based programs can save our inner cities, \n     and those who live in them.\n       And the statistics from a Gallup poll conducted just this \n     year show that Christianity is very much alive among the \n     American people.\n       Despite what you may hear in the press, less than 1% of the \n     American people are atheists. Meanwhile, 9 out of 10 \n     Americans give a religious identification. 7 out of 10 say \n     they are a member of a church or synagogue. 6 out of 10 say \n     religion is an important part of their daily life. 77% \n     believe the Bible is the inspired word of God. 40% attend \n     church on a weekly basis--a rate that has held steady for \n     almost 40 years. 66% report that prayer is an important part \n     of their daily life. And 61% believe religion can answer all \n     or most of today's problems.\n       Unfortunately, despite this common religious attitude among \n     the people, in Washington and many state capitals \n     Christianity is having to struggle.\n       Let me give some examples.\n       First, one of the fundamental bases of our moral order, \n     recognized by Judaism, Christianity and Islam alike, is the \n     Ten Commandments. The moral principles laid out in these \n     commandments, including love of God as well as rules against \n     murder and perjury, literally gave birth to our society. We \n     ignore them at our peril. Unfortunately, at least one judge \n     has sought to bar expression of these principles from our \n     public square.\n       Recently, an Alabama judge ordered his colleague, Judge Roy \n     S. Moore, to stop displaying the Ten Commandments in his \n     courtroom. This ruling, now on hold, rests on the mistaken \n     belief that the Constitution's religion clause forbids such \n     displays. It also rests on hostility toward public \n     affirmations of our religious heritage. It can only undermine \n     our adherence to the principles underlying our moral order.\n       A resolution introduced by my colleague, Jeff Sessions, \n     would state that Judge Moore should be allowed to continue \n     displaying the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. I believe \n     that this is the appropriate response.\n       Unfortunately, activist judges have not been the only ones \n     opposing any role for religion in our public life. Our \n     elected officials too often undermine worthy projects out of \n     hostility or fear toward religion.\n       For example, my colleague, Georgia Senator Paul Coverdell, \n     has proposed education legislation establishing ``A-Plus \n     Accounts.'' These accounts would allow parents to use the \n     tax-free education savings accounts provided in the recent \n     Taxpayer Relief Act for their children's elementary and \n     secondary schooling, rather than just for college.\n       This would give parents greater control over their \n     children's education. With help from these accounts, parents \n     could buy a home computer to enable their child to explore \n     the internet; pay for tutoring for a child having trouble \n     with math; get occupational therapy for a child with special \n     needs, or save for tuition payments and home schooling.\n       The interest on these savings accounts would not be taxed \n     so long as it was used for educational expenses. And the cost \n     to the federal government and taxpayer? Zero. A+ Accounts \n     would simply allow parents to spend more of their own money \n     on their children's education.\n       Unfortunately, the President has vowed to veto any bill \n     containing these provisions. This administration does not \n     want parents\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\n     to control their own children's educations. Simply giving \n     parents the choice of saving their money for nonpublic and \n     parochial schools for this administration is unacceptable. \n     That is wrong, and it should be put right.\n       Another wrong we need to put right is abortion. I will do \n     everything I can as a United States Senator to protect unborn \n     life. Here I must point in admiration to my wife Jane. \n     Through the Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect pro-\n     life women to Congress, and through her many personal \n     efforts, she has done a great deal to improve our ability to \n     correct the great tragedy of abortion.\n       Unfortunately, the pro-life cause is subjected to a great \n     deal of unfair derision. The press focuses almost exclusively \n     on the few bad apples who resort to violence, and tar us all \n     as extremists. Meanwhile the terrible facts about partial \n     birth abortion have been denied repeatedly, despite massive \n     evidence. Even limited efforts to protect the unborn, like \n     parental notification, have consistently failed to make it \n     into law. In Washington, whether on the Senate floor or in \n     the papers, it is considered ``bad form'' to even bring up \n     the rights of the unborn.\n       Indeed, it seems to be bad form to bring up any issue of \n     principle or morality, let alone religion, in Washington. Nor \n     is Congress the only place in Washington where religion and \n     traditional values are being undermined. The Executive branch \n     has played its own, destructive role.\n       Recently President Clinton revoked Ronald Reagan's \n     Executive Order, decreeing that federal bureaucrats consider \n     their actions' effects on the families of this nation. As \n     stated in its preamble, President Reagan's Executive Order \n     was intended ``to ensure that the autonomy and rights of the \n     family are considered in the formulation and implementation \n     of policies by Executive departments and agencies.''\n       More than any government program, America's children are \n     protected, nurtured and given the means they need to lead \n     good lives by their families. No national ``village'' can \n     replace the constant care and attention of parents. But all \n     too often federal regulations interfere with parents as they \n     try to teach, protect and nurture them.\n       For example, the Family Research Council reports that the \n     Food and Drug Administration has classified home drug tests \n     as a ``Class 3 Medical Device,'' placing them in the same \n     category as heart pace makers. In effect, the FDA has barred \n     parents from using these tests in their homes--despite the \n     fact that the drug tests work in the same, simple manner as \n     home pregnancy tests.\n       The irony is that the federal government is using taxpayer \n     dollars to promote the use of other medical devices, namely \n     condoms. Condoms are the subject of a $400,000 federal \n     advertising effort, featuring rock music and sexually \n     suggestive imagery, carried out under federal Department of \n     Health and Human Services regulations.\n       It seems that, according to the federal government, \n     bureaucrats in Washington are the only ones qualified to make \n     certain that our children are not using drugs, and to educate \n     them concerning sexuality and contraception--matters of deep \n     importance to their spiritual lives.\n       In these and other ways, Washington seems to go out of its \n     way to show contempt for traditional values. For example, the \n     federally funded Smithsonian Institution, our premier \n     teaching museum, recently refused to allow the Boy Scouts to \n     hold an Honor Court ceremony at the National Zoo. Why? \n     Because the Boy Scouts ``discriminate'' against atheists.\n       I found it deeply disturbing that the Boy Scouts, one of \n     America's most important private organizations, which has \n     helped literally millions of American boys reach responsible \n     manhood, should be denied access to a federally supported \n     institution because it exercises its Constitutional right to \n     free exercise of religion.\n       I also was disturbed that the Smithsonian Institution, the \n     repository of so many objects central to our heritage as a \n     people, should enforce a policy diametrically opposed to the \n     principles on which our nation was founded.\n       Luckily, after I brought this travesty to the attention of \n     my colleagues in the Senate, enough pressure was applied to \n     the Smithsonian's secretary that he rescinded the order and \n     apologized for this obvious instance of intolerance for \n     religion.\n       I think it is important that we remember victories like \n     this. And there have been others.\n       For example, the last welfare reform bill finally \n     eliminated a destructive, ill-considered provision. That \n     provision prohibited faith-based organizations from \n     contracting with local governments to provide social \n     services. Under this provision, faith-based organizations had \n     to give up their religious character in order to provide \n     social services with public assistance. The results have been \n     tragic.\n       In the late 1980's, when the homeless population was \n     rising, state and local officials in Michigan discovered \n     large inner-city churches with plenty of space. But the \n     federal government would not give any money to cities seeking \n     to use the churches for homeless shelters. The problem? All \n     religious references in the churches, from crucifixes to \n     Bible scriptures carved into the walls, had to be removed or \n     covered if government funds were to be spent.\n       The same situation confronted the people of Flint, where \n     Catholic Social Services runs the North End Soup Kitchen in a \n     building owned by Sacred Heart church. In order to receive \n     government help, from what I am told, they were required to \n     cover up their crucifixes and religious icons and literally \n     hide the bibles. They even were required to create a separate \n     legal entity to accept the aid.\n       This is wrong. It keeps many good organizations from \n     getting more involved in their communities. It saps our \n     religious spirit and denies people assistance they need.\n       Fortunately for our communities, this has changed. The \n     charitable choice provision will see to it that states \n     consider religious organizations on an equal, \n     nondiscriminatory basis with private institutions. Faith \n     based organizations are no longer required to remove \n     ``religious art, icons or other symbols'' to receive federal \n     funds. They also are no longer required to change hiring \n     practices or create separate corporations in order to receive \n     government contracts. The only requirement these \n     organizations must meet is that they cannot use government \n     money for sectarian worship, instruction or proselytizing \n     activities.\n       These reforms already have produced miraculous results. \n     Ottawa County recently was the subject of front page stories \n     in both the Washington Post and USA Today.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man \nwho exemplifies the American dream. Dr. Robert McNamara, an assistant \nprofessor of sociology at Furman University, rose from a childhood of \nDickensian poverty and violence to become a successful writer, \nprodigious researcher, and beloved teacher. In addition to devoting \nmuch time to instructing and advising his students, he has published \nnine books; his most recent, ``Beating the Odds: Crime, Poverty, and \nLife in the Inner City,'' has just been released.\n  In ``Beating the Odds,'' Dr. McNamara addresses some of our society's \nfundamental problems while relating them to the trials of his own \nimpoverished childhood. Though it is unusual for an academic to \nintertwine memoir with analysis, Dr. McNamara's style makes his book \nall the more compelling.\n  Bob McNamara was born in New Haven, CT, in 1960, the youngest of four \nboys. He and his family--``dirty, unkempt, and unruly''--lived a \ntenuous existence in a squalid section of the city. His abusive and \nalcoholic father was a compulsive gambler. McNamara's parents divorced \nwhen he was 10 years old. Neither wanted to raise him; after a time, \nthey began paying other people to care for him.\n  As an adolescent, Bob McNamara was sent to live with 19 different \nfamilies. His abuse and exploitation at the hands of these so-called \nfoster parents convinced him that ``being a foster child is one of the \nmost frightening things that could ever happen to a young person.'' It \nwas not until one of his high school football coaches realized his \npotential and decided to become his foster parent that McNamara gained \na stable and nurturing home.\n  With the help of supportive teachers and his new foster family, Bob \nMcNamara turned his life around. He worked two jobs to pay for classes \nat the local community college. After succeeding there, he enrolled in \nthe State university and commuted 60 miles each way to attend classes. \nHe made outstanding grades and won a scholarship to Yale University, \nwhere he obtained his doctorate. While at Yale, he met another graduate \nstudent, Kristie Maher, whom he would later marry and who also teaches \nsociology at Furman University.\n  Dr. Robert McNamara is a living example of the promise of American \nlife. He was born into an abysmally poor and dysfunctional family, with \nno role models or guidance. He spent much of his childhood stealing for \nfood and running with gangs. But he found purpose in the pursuit of \nknowledge and nurturing from his teachers, and went on to excell at one \nof America's elite universities. Today, he is an admired teacher and \nrespected scholar.\n  Mr. President, ``Beating the Odds'' is not just the title of Prof. \nRobert McNamara's latest and most inspiring book; it is the story of \nhis life. In fact, beating the odds is what the American dream is all \nabout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11489-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF WALSH COLLEGE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to \nWalsh College on the occasion of their 75th anniversary. Since 1922, \nWalsh College has been highly instrumental in turning business leaders \nof tomorrow into business leaders of today. Michiganites, and many \nothers across America, have benefited immensely by the quality of \neducation and rich tradition bestowed upon its students.\n  Over 11,000 Walsh College alumni have worked to improve Michigan's \neconomy and bring about a better quality of life for those near to \nthem. With over 3,000 students and 4 campuses--soon to be 5 campuses--\nWalsh College continues to enlarge its positive impact on Michigan's \nsoutheastern communities.\n  It is well known by businesses in Michigan that Walsh students excel \nin their work. For example, 10 have received the Paton Award for \nachieving the highest Michigan score on the CPA exam, and 13 have \nreceived the Sells Award for placing in the top 100 of those taking the \ntest nationwide. Through its six undergraduate degree programs and five \ngraduate programs, Walsh College brings to Michigan an unparalleled \nexcellence in education.\n  Again, congratulations for 75 great years in business education and, \non behalf of the U.S. Senate, I offer my highest appreciation and \npraise to all who have made the past 75 years a great success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11489-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11489-S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support the \nAgricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act, the 1996 \nfarm bill's research title. This bill will bring many benefits to the \nNation's farmers and to producers in North Dakota. This bill is \nimportant not only to our farmers but to North Dakota State University, \nour five Tribal Colleges and all facets of agricultural production that \nare the State's lifeblood.\n  In addition to establishing agricultural research priorities, the \nbill makes positive changes in the operation of the Nation's \nagricultural research system, which I am pleased to support. \nSpecifically, this bill will increase the accountability of USDA funded \nresearch by increasing stakeholder input. Just this year, the North \nDakota State Legislature created one of the first stakeholder groups in \nthe country and gave it unprecedented power to direct the agricultural \nresearch at North Dakota State University. This 13-member group met for \nthe first time in July to set priorities for agricultural research in \nNorth Dakota. We look forward to being able to serve as a model to \nother States planning to increase stakeholder input.\n  I am very pleased the Agriculture Committee and now the U.S. Senate \nhave strongly supported funding for agricultural research. Our Nation's \neconomic base was founded on agriculture and as we drift toward an \nincreasingly urban population, we drift from our agrarian roots but we \nmust not ignore the importance of agricultural productivity. North \nDakota farmers and livestock producers continually look to increase \nfarm efficiency, profitability, and environmental stewardship by using \nnew technologies. It is critical that federally funded research focus \non these goals while producers maintain global competitiveness.\n  The bill's Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems \nprovides new funding of $100 million in fiscal year 1998 and $170 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2002 to competitively \naward research, extension, and education grants on issues related to \nfood genome mapping, food safety and technology, human nutrition, new \nand alternative uses, production of agricultural commodities, \nbiotechnology, and natural resource management.\n  These are the directions that agricultural research must go in order \nfor the United States to maintain its edge in the global market while \nproviding greater harmony between agriculture and the environment.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased this bill incorporates my proposal \nto give policy research centers the authority to study the effect trade \nagreements have on farm and agricultural sectors, the environment, \nrural families, households and economies. Of special concern are the \nimpacts of Canadian grain imports and international policies on the \nNorthern Great Plains. Specifically, I would like them to examine the \nimpact of multinational trade policy issues and North American cross-\nborder policies on Northern Plains agriculture, identify strategies to \nimprove export opportunities for this region of the country, and \nevaluate the impacts of national and international policies on the \nregion's agricultural competitiveness, farm income, farm structure, and \nrural economies. Policy researchers at North Dakota State University \nrequested this amendment to help obtain funding for the proposed \nNorthern Great Plains Policy Research Center which would serve as part \nof the Food and Agricultural Policy Research institute consortium. I \nfully support their proposal.\n  And finally, Mr. President, I am very pleased that the bill includes \nprovisions to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to grant up to \n$5.2 million in each of years 1998 through 2002 to a consortium of \nland-grant universities combating diseases of wheat and barley caused \nby Fusarium graminearum and related fungi, commonly known as scab. Scab \nhas had a profound effect on the farmers and economy of North Dakota \nand this year alone it is expected to cause $1.1 billion in economic \ndamages. I cannot stress enough the importance of research to combat \nthis horrible crop disease and thank my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, for working closely with me on this issue and my \ncolleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, for including these provisions \nin the manager's package.\n  Mr. President, so that everyone may fully understand the consequences \nof this crop disease, I would like to submit an economic analysis of \nscab's impact on my home State of North Dakota. I would also like to \nsubmit for the Record a recent newspaper article from the Grand Forks \nHerald, headlined, ``An agricultural nightmare,'' which describes \nscab's impacts and discusses the need for research to combat the \ndisease. Mr. President, I ask that both submissions be printed in the \nRecord in full.\n  The material follows:\n\n  The Market Adviser: Scab Losses Severe--George Flaskerud, Extension \n                 Crops Economist NDSU Extension Service\n\n       Scab in spring wheat, durum and barley will have a severe \n     impact on the economy of North Dakota this year. Estimates by \n     the department of agricultural economics at North Dakota \n     State University put the direct loss to producers at about \n     $355 million. The total loss is expected to be about $1.1 \n     billion when the indirect impact on the communities is \n     included. This brings total scab losses since 1993 to about \n     $2.9 billion. Demcey Johnson and I, with the help of others \n     in the department, calculated the losses.\n       These losses have severely damaged many farm financial \n     statements. The median debt/asset ratio for North Dakota \n     farmers increased from 48 percent in 1992 to 56 percent in \n     1996 and is expected to further increase this year. In \n     addition, North Dakota had a net loss of about 2,000 farms \n     between 1992 and 1996, in many cases due to scab. The debt/\n     asset ratios were derived from the records of farmers in the \n     North Dakota Farm Business Management Education Program.\n       The total direct loss in 1997 was the greatest of the scab \n     losses since 1993. Yield losses were greater during 1993 and \n     1995 than during 1997, but, when the price effect was \n     considered, the total direct loss during 1997 was record-\n     setting. The price effect during 1997, to date, has been \n     negative, on average, which accentuates the 1997 yield loss. \n     The price effect has been negative because actual net selling \n     prices have been below what they would have been during a \n     normal year, on average. Many times over the past five years, \n     a positive price effect offset some or all of the loss due to \n     lower yield.\n       Spring wheat scab losses have generally increased over time \n     when both the yield and price effects are considered. Total \n     direct spring wheat scab losses since 1993 were worse every \n     year except one, the exception being 1996. Barley losses were \n     substantial in three of the five years: the largest was in \n     1993 followed by 1997 and 1995. For durum, the yield effect \n     exceeded the price effect in two of the five years, 1995 and \n     1996.\n       Yield losses were calculated as the difference between \n     trend yields and actual yields. Trend yields were derived \n     from 1970-92 data, leaving out two drought years. The trends \n     were extended to 1997 to derive losses during 1993-97. The \n     yield losses were calculated for Crop Reporting Districts 2, \n     3, 5, 6, and 9, essentially the eastern portion of North \n     Dakota that has suffered from scab.\n       Price impacts were calculated as the difference between \n     normal prices and actual net selling prices. For spring \n     wheat, normal prices for 1993-97 were derived from the 1989-\n     92 price relationship between actual net selling prices and \n     Minneapolis futures prices. For durum, normal prices for \n     1993-97 were derived by multiplying the 1993-97 spring wheat \n     normal prices by a factor of 1.09, which is the long-term \n     price relationship between durum and spring wheat prices. For \n     barley, normal prices for 1993-97 were derived from the 1989-\n     92 price relationship between actual net selling prices and \n     Duluth feed barley prices. These methods permitted both the \n     yield and quality effects to be reflected in the price \n     impacts.\n       This analysis did not address such factors as insurance \n     indemnity payments and disaster payments. Both were \n     substantial in 1993. Based on my observation of yields in \n     1997, however, I would expect that insurance indemnity \n     payments will be relatively low this year. Many yields appear \n     to be about at the level where insurance indemnity payments \n     would just start to be realized.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Grand Forks Herald, Sept. 12, 1997]\n\n An Agricultural Nightmare--Infestations of Scab Provide Area Farmers \n                 Lots of Pains In and Out of the Fields\n\n                           (By Erin Campbell)\n\n       Termed the Armageddon for wheat and barley and compared \n     with cancer, scab remains an uninvited guest and pillager of \n     small grains fields in the region for the last five years.\n       ``It's not a new disease to the area,'' says Jochum \n     Wiersma, small grains specialist with University of \n     Minnesota, Crookston. In fact, it's popped up a few times in \n     the region since the turn of the century.\n       Scab can infest any wheat-growing area if it has the right \n     moisture conditions to develop, he says.\n       ``We certainly are due for a break,'' says Don Loeslie, a \n     Warren, Minn., farmer.\n       Wetter-than-normal weather conditions provide tailor-made \n     conditions for scab to thrive and impact the rural economy.\n\n[[Page S11491]]\n\n       ``When we got rain in July, it used to add to bushels, now \n     it takes away,'' says Neal Fisher, deputy administrator for \n     the North Dakota Wheat Commission.\n       For some producers, scab has robbed them of profits for \n     five years.\n       ``It was the sure crop to plant. We could always pencil in \n     a profit,'' Loeslie says. When farmers deliver grain to their \n     local grain elevator, its quality is evaluated, and the grain \n     is ``graded.'' Grades vary from elevator to elevator. At the \n     MayPort (Mayville and Portland, N.D.) Farmers Co-op elevator \n     grades include milling, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4 and \n     terminal or feed wheat.\n       The price impact of a difference between grades usually \n     amounts to 5 to 10 cents. Feed wheat usually brings 70 cents \n     less than the top market price.\n       Farmers also receive discounts for low test weight and \n     damage, or they may collect premiums for high protein \n     content.\n       This year, discounts for damaged wheat aren't as severe as \n     previous years because the shriveled, scabby grain kernels \n     didn't make it into producers' combine hoppers, says Dan \n     Pinske, general manager for MayPort Farmers Co-op elevator.\n       Instead of discounts, farmers harvested less grain.\n       ``It (scab) was so severe it (scab-damaged grain)-- didn't \n     make it into the combine, so they lost a lot of bushels,'' he \n     says.\n\n\n                            economic impact\n\n       Those lost bushels affect producer's profits and the entire \n     region's economy.\n       Elevators profiting on volume have been hit in the \n     pocketbook as scab reduces the region's wheat yields.\n       ``If we start knocking off 30 to 40 percent of the \n     potential (crop), it's a huge income loss,'' Pinske said.\n       A study recently done by Demcey Johnson and George \n     Flaskerud, both of North Dakota State University's \n     Agricultural Economics Department, shows scab caused a total \n     economic impact of $2,875 billion from 1993 to 1997. That's a \n     combination of a $934 million direct impact and an indirect \n     impact of $1.941 billion.\n       Producers in Minnesota saw a 33 percent loss due to scab in \n     1993. This year, the loss is expected between 12 percent and \n     18 percent in the northwest valley area of Minnesota, says \n     Roger Jones, Extension plant pathologist at the University of \n     Minnesota.\n       That loss is comparative to the direct impact of losing one \n     year's entire wheat crop, Fisher says.\n       The total economic impact of spring wheat production on the \n     region would be about $3.96 billion, using last year's \n     production of 313.5 million bushels multiplied by an average \n     seasonal price of $4.10, a plus a ``multiplier'' effect. \n     Durum, at 79.4 million bushels times the seasonal average \n     price last year of $4.40, plus the multiplier effect, equals \n     roughly $1.08 billion. All barley, at 143 million bushels, \n     times an average seasonal price (average of feed and malting) \n     of $2.45, plus the multiplier effect, also is equivalent to \n     about $1.08 billion.\n       The scab epidemic has made research efforts a main focus to \n     get the wheat industry back in the black.\n       But, that takes money.\n       Scab has become a more prominent issue since 1993 and was \n     the reason for a visit by the newly appointed U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture undersecretary for research, economics and \n     education, Miley Gonzalez.\n       The North Dakota Wheat Commission and other state grain \n     commissions and councils also are making research a priority \n     when preparing budgets.\n       The North Dakota Wheat Commission has about $2.4 million to \n     spend this year. If estimates are correct, and the wheat \n     harvest is 100 million bushels lower, the commission will \n     have $800,000 less than last year. The commission's budget \n     comes from an 8/10 of a cent per bushel checkoff.\n       But, commissions and councils can't shoulder the entire \n     research effort, either.\n       Attempts at gaining more federal dollars for research are \n     slowly gaining strength in Washington. About $1.2 million in \n     federal funding is planned for 1998.\n\n\n                             Stopping scab\n\n       Instead of battling the problem individually, states also \n     are teaming up to stop scab.\n       Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Canada joined \n     forces in 1993 after the Minnesota Association of Wheat \n     Growers organized a scab symposium.\n       A 12-state scab initiative, which includes the Dakotas and \n     Minnesota, also was initiated a few years ago.\n       ``The fact that it affects other wheat is, in a way, a \n     blessing in disguise because it becomes a national problem,'' \n     Wiersma said.\n       One of the key research tasks is finding varieties that \n     resist scab.\n       ``Variety shifts have cut the disease levels in half.'' \n     Jones said.\n       Most of the varieties used by producers existed before the \n     epidemic hit, and some new varieties have proven to be less \n     susceptible. Barley has not made variety changes to date, but \n     varieties on the horizon look promising.\n       For a variety to be successful, resistance would need to be \n     twice the current resistance level, Jones says.\n       ``I have a lot of confidence in our scientists, but it's \n     not going to be overnight,'' Fisher said.\n       In order to solve the scab problem, the industry needs to \n     focus on more than resistant varieties.\n       Although controversial, different residue practices, such \n     as plowing, may help destroy scab inoculum.\n       The only way to prove it is by plowing the whole valley, \n     which is unlikely, Wiersma says.\n       ``Producers need to look at their residue programs. Simply \n     relying on genetic resistance, we are going to have a \n     difficult time resolving this problem,'' Jones said.\n       Change in rotation practices and alternative crops also are \n     options, but they alone cannot solve the problem, either.\n       ``Rotation has an impact, but it's marginal,'' Wiersma \n     says.\n\n\n                              Other crops\n\n       Alternative crops, such as oilseeds and beans, face market \n     uncertainty because of overproduction. Many producers have \n     decreased wheat acres as much as possible and are trying \n     other crops.\n       ``Producers are looking for every alternative they can, and \n     that's understandable considering the circumstances. \n     (However) those markets are easily saturated,'' Fisher said.\n       Many producers also are considering planting winter wheat, \n     but it also can be attacked by scab if excessive moisture \n     comes at the wrong time, Jones says.\n       And there simply is not a large enough variety of crops to \n     choose from in the northern valley.\n       ``There aren't enough specialty crops to tide us over. We \n     don't have the luxury of the southern areas,'' Loeslie says.\n       Besides, producers who use wheat as a rotation for other \n     crops, such as sugar beets, can't change their rotation plan.\n       Sugar beets are planted on a field once every three years, \n     with four years being optimal, said Mark Weber, executive \n     director of the Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers.\n       Like the flood that hit Grand Forks this spring, this river \n     of scab will never be forgotten, Loeslie says.\n       ``It's not a healthy situation for the region.''\n       But the producers in this area will not go down without a \n     fight. Loeslie is confident the dedication and work of a team \n     effort will prove to be successful in the long-term.\n       ``I hate to give up. Wheat has been too good to us for too \n     long.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11490-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11491-S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I oppose the Coverdell bill \nbecause it uses regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private \nschools. It does not give any real financial help to low-income, \nworking and middle-class families, and it does not help children in the \nnation's classrooms. What it does is provide yet another tax give-away \nfor the wealthy.\n  Public education is one of the great successes of American democracy. \nIt makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. This bill turns its \nback on the nation's long-standing support of public schools and \nearmarks tax dollars for private schools. This is a fundamental step in \nthe wrong direction for education and for the nation's children.\n  Proponents of the bill argue that assistance is available for \nfamilies to send their children to any school, public or private. But \nthat argument is false. The fact is that public schools do not charge \ntuition. Therefore, the 90% of the nation's children who attend public \nschools do not need help in paying tuition. Even worse, the people \nhelped most by this proposal are families in high income brackets--and \nthese families can already afford to send their children to private \nschool.\n  The nation's children deserve good public schools, safe public \nschools, well-trained teachers, and a good education. Private school \nvouchers disguised as IRAs will undermine all of those essential goals \nby undermining the public schools, not helping them.\n  We all want the nation's children to get the best possible education. \nWe should be doing more--much more--to support efforts to improve local \nschools. We should oppose any plan that would undermine those efforts.\n  Scarce tax dollars should be targeted to public schools. They don't \nhave the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose special \nchallenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-\nproficient children, or homeless students. Vouchers will not help \nchildren who need help the most.\n  Proponents of the bill argue that vouchers increase choice for \nparents. But parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply \ndifferent rules than public schools. Public schools must accept all \nchildren. Private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. \nThe real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the \nprivate school, the more parents and students are turned away.\n  In fact, many private schools require children to take rigorous \nachievement tests, at the parents' expense, as a basis for admission to \nthe private schools. Lengthy interviews and complex selection processes \nare often mandatory. Private schools impose many barriers to admission. \nFew parents can even get to the schoolhouse door to find out if it is \nopen to their child. For the vast majority of families with children in \npublic schools, the so-called ``school choice'' offered by the voucher \nscheme is a hollow choice.\n  Public schools must take all children, and build a program to meet \neach of their needs. Private schools only take children who fit the \nguidelines of their existing programs. We should not use public tax \ndollars to support schools that select some children, and reject \nothers.\n  Senator Coverdell's proposal would spend 2.5 billion dollars over the \nnext five years on subsidies to help wealthy people pay the private \nschool expenses they already pay, and do nothing to help children in \npublic schools get a better education.\n  It is important to continue the national investment in children and \ntheir future. We should invest more in improving public schools by \nfixing leaky roofs and crumbling buildings, by recruiting and preparing \nexcellent teachers, and by taking many other steps. We should not \ninvest in bad education policy and bad tax policy.\n  We know that at the current time, 14 million children in one-third of \nthe nation's schools are learning in substandard facilities. Over half \nof all schools report at least one major building in disrepair, with \ncracked foundations, or leaking roofs, or other major problems. If we \nhave 2.5 billion more dollars to spend on elementary and secondary \neducation, we should spend it to deal with these problems.\n  During the next decade, because of rising student enrollments and \nrising teacher retirements, the nation will need over 2 million new \nteachers. Yet today, more than 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the \nclassroom every year. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% \nchance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. We \nshould support teachers and rebuild our schools--not build tax shelters \nfor the wealthy.\n  It is clear that this proposal disproportionately benefits wealthy \nfamilies. The majority of the tax benefits would go to families in high \nincome brackets. These families can already afford to send their \nchildren to private school.\n  Working families and low-income families do not have enough assets \nand savings to participate in this IRA scheme. This regressive bill \ndoes not help working families struggling to pay day to day expenses \nduring their children's school years.\n  The majority of families will get almost no tax break from this \nlegislation. 70 percent of the benefit goes to families in the top 20 \npercent of the income bracket. Families earning less than $50,000 a \nyear will get a tax cut of $2.50 from this legislation--$2.50. You \ncan't even buy a good box of crayons for that amount. Families in the \nlowest income brackets--those making less than $17,000 a year--will get \na tax cut of all of $1--$1. But, a family earning over $100,000 will \nget $97.\n  Even many families who can save enough to be able to participate in \nthis IRA scheme will receive little benefit. IRAs work best when the \ninvestment is long-term. But in this scheme, money will be taken out \neach year of a child's education. Only the wealthiest families will be \nable to take advantage of this tax-free savings account.\n  In addition, ``qualified expenses'' are defined so broadly in this \nbill, that parents could justify almost any expense even remotely \nconnected to the costs of elementary and secondary education, creating \na large loophole for people to spend funds in ways not intended.\n  In order to guard against fraud and abuse, the IRS would have to take \non more tax audits of families that establish these accounts. The IRS \nwill have to ask what school a child attends, what expenses the parents \nactually incurred, and whether the accounts were properly set up and \nused.\n  This bill is bad tax policy and bad education policy. It does not \nimprove public education for the 90 percent of children who go to \npublic schools. It is a waste of scarce tax dollars.\n  Education reform should help education, not undermine it. Students \nneed to master the basics, meet high standards, and be taught by well-\ntrained teachers. We need to hold schools accountable for results, and \ncreate safe buildings and learning environments.\n  This bill is simply private school vouchers under another name. It is \nwrong for Congress to subsidize private schools. We should improve our \npublic schools--not abandon them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11492-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11492-S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A FITTING NEW HAMPSHIRE TRIBUTE FOR FALLEN AMERICAN HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the memory of Sgt. William Roy Pearson, USAF. Earlier today, \nhis remains were returned to his native town of Webster, New Hampshire \nwhere he will finally be properly laid to rest with full military \nhonors this weekend, more than 25 years following his tragic loss in \nVietnam.\n  Sergeant Pearson was the all American boy who grew up in a small, New \nHampshire town, played varsity baseball and soccer all four years at \nMerrimack Valley High School, and then, like his father before him, \nwent off to serve his country in time of war. As an Air Force \nPararescue ``Maroon Beret'', he was awarded a Silver Star, Purple \nHeart, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, and five air medals for his \nactions. To Sergeant Pearson, living up to the USAF Pararescuemen \nmotto--``that others may live''--was a daily routine in the jungles of \nVietnam.\n  Then came the tragic day on April 6, 1972 when once again his unit \nwas called upon to rescue a downed U.S. Air Force pilot whose rescue \nstory was later depicted in the movie, BAT-21. During the rescue \nattempt conducted by Sergeant Pearson and his crewmembers, the Jolly \nGreen was shot down by enemy fire, killing those on\n\n[[Page S11493]]\n\nboard. Sergeant Pearson was only 20 years old.\n  But it was not until two decades later that U.S. personnel were \nfinally permitted by Vietnam to fully investigate and excavate what \nremained of the crash site. Despite the passage of time, the recovery \nteam was able to identify and repatriate the remains of Sergeant \nPearson, and we are grateful to our military for their efforts in this \nregard.\n  Sergeant Pearson was a hero, not only for his commitment to freedom \nand the sacrifices he made by serving in Vietnam, but also for his \ncourage in trying to save a comrade, who, I might add, was eventually \nrescued six days later. His heroic deeds were exemplary of the New \nHampshire spirit of duty, honor, and valor, and his story will be an \ninspiring and moving one in the history of United States Air Force \nPararescue for all generations that follow in his footsteps.\n  As a fellow Vietnam veteran and a long-time advocate for the families \nof our POWs and MIAs who have suffered uncertainty for far too many \nyears, my thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Pearson's parents, \nsiblings, family members, fellow comrades, and friends. I know they are \nall very proud of his service, as they now close this long, sad chapter \nin their lives.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I also want to publicly thank the United \nStates Air Force, including personnel at Hanscom Air Force Base in \nMassachusetts, and Sergeant Pearson's fellow Maroon Berets for the \nspecial care they have taken to honor their own, and to bid Sergeant \nPearson a fitting farewell in a such a dignified manner. I know that \nthe honors bestowed on Sergeant Pearson by the Air Force during this \ndifficult weekend ahead will help to console those who have suffered \nthe most from his loss. It has been a long wait, but we are grateful he \nhas now returned home for this fitting final goodbye in New \nHampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11492-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DELTA TEACHERS' ACADEMY\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, The Agricultural Research, \nExtension, and Education Reform Act of 1997, which the Senate passed \nyesterday, includes a provision which authorizes the Secretary to \nprovide funds to a national organization which promotes educational \nopportunities at the primary and secondary levels in rural areas with a \nhistoric incidence of poverty and low academic achievement.\n  The 1990 Report of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission \nidentified quality of education as one if its 68 issues to be addressed \nthrough State and/or Congressional action. One of several \nrecommendations offered by the Commission was that educational agencies \nin the Delta establish cooperative partnerships with institutions of \nhigher education. In 1992, the Delta Teachers' Academy was launched as \none of the first large-scale, federally funded responses to the Delta \nDevelopment Commission. Since that time, the Delta Teachers' Academy \nhas offered outstanding opportunities for elementary and high school \nteachers to increase their academic proficiency and has become the \nlargest professional development program operated by the National \nFaculty. Acting under the assumption that well-prepared teachers beget \nwell-educated students, Congress has continued to provide funding for \nthe Delta Teachers' Academy. Giving teachers the resources, knowledge, \nand support they need to achieve the goals set for them should reside \nat the heart of educational improvement efforts.\n  The importance of preparing young people for the challenges and \nrealities of the 21st Century is indisputable. The region of the United \nStates known as the Lower Mississippi Delta--Eastern Arkansas, \nSoutheast Missouri, Southern Illinois, Western Kentucky, Western \nTennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana--has lagged behind the rest of \nthe country in economic growth and prosperity. This area suffers from a \ngreater amount of measurable poverty and unemployment than any other \nregion of the country. It is inhibited by people who have used their \nsense of place to develop a cultural and historical heritage that is \nrich and unique. A letter from then-Governor Bill Clinton which \naccompanied the Delta Commission's 1990 report identified the region as \n``an enormous untapped resource for America'' that ``can and should be \nsaved.'' The Delta Teachers' Academy has endeavored to do just that.\n  The Delta Teachers' Academy, the National Faculty's single largest \nprogram, unites teachers from largely poor and isolated districts for \nlong-term study in core disciplines. The three-year program combines \nintensive summer institutes with on-site sessions during the school \nyear. Each teacher team works in collaboration with college and \nuniversity scholars in one or more of five core disciplines--English, \ngeography, history, math, and science. As teachers improve their \nmastery of these subject areas and gain confidence in their \nprofessional development, they are able to pass their knowledge along \nto the students with whom they come in contact. In 1995, the program \nserved 600 teachers in 43 program sites. The Academy has continued to \nexpand its outreach efforts and currently serves over 1000 teachers in \nthe 219 counties and parishes comprising the Lower Mississippi Delta.\n  Positive outcomes have been reported for the Delta Teachers' Academy \nby the General Accounting office in June of 1995 and as recently as \nAugust of this year by Westat, an independent entity commissioned to \nevaluate the effectiveness of the program. Both determined that the \nDelta Teachers' Academy is effective in fulfilling its two primary \ngoals--increasing understanding of academic subjects and providing new \nand useful teaching skills. The GAO report specifically noted the \nAcademy's success in helping teachers' institute changes in their \ncurricula and classroom practice.\n  I feel that the Delta Teachers' Academy represents community \npartnership at its very best. I am pleased that Congress has agreed to \nprovide a special authorization for this incredibly worthwhile program. \nThis makes clear Congress' commitment to improving educational \nopportunity and the overall quality of life for people living in the \nLower Mississippi Delta and the need to continue our support such as \nthe Delta Teachers' Academy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11493-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11493-S11494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEDICARE FRONTIER HEALTH CLINIC AND CENTER ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Alaska, Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK), in introducing the \n``Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and Center Act of 1997.'' This bill \nwill go a long way in assuring rural families have access to emergency \nmedical care on a 24-hour basis.\n  As cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, it has been my \npriority to put rural health care at the forefront of any legislative \npackage. Included in this year's ``Balanced Budget Act of 1997,'' is a \ncomprehensive set of reforms that increases Medicare reimbursement \nrates to midlevel practitioners, improves payment levels to rural \nhealth plans contracting with Medicare and permits small hospitals to \nstay open even if they do not meet all of the requirements stipulated \nunder Medicare's conditions of participation.\n  It is this last provision that is particularly beneficial to \nWyoming's health care community. For the first time, our hospitals will \nbe able reconfigure their services and reduce excess bed capacity. The \nnew entities will be called ``Critical Access Hospitals'' [CAH's]. They \nwill be excused from some of the onerous staffing regulations designed \nwith big cities in mind. In addition, they will be reimbursed on a \nreasonable-cost basis, which provides the extra payment needed to \nremain open.\n  While the newly established CAH Program goes to great lengths to \nexpand medical care in rural America, there is still more to do. That \nis where our bill steps in. The ``Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and \nCenter Act,'' permits state certified health clinics in the most \nfrontier areas to upgrade to CAH status. This will ensure that remote \nareas of the country will finally have access to hospital services.\n  Too often, health care providers are forced to close their doors \nbecause they cannot contend with low utilization rates, costly \nregulations and inadequate Medicare reimbursement payments. But closing \na hospital or a medical clinic is not an acceptable option in Wyoming. \nIn my State, if a town loses its most important point of service--the \nemergency room--it is typical\n\n[[Page S11494]]\n\nfor patients to drive 100 miles or more to the closest tertiary care \ncenter. An alternative must be available.\n  Mr. President, our bill presents communities with a viable option. It \naccommodates different levels of medical care throughout a state while \nproviding stabilization services needed in remote areas. It is one in a \nseries of measures that the Rural Health Caucus is working on designed \nto improve quality medical care in rural America, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleague from Alaska to pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11493-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11494-S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THE NORTHEAST INTERSTATE DAIRY COMPACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations \nbill, H.R. 2160, which the Senate has approved today contains a \nprovision, section 732, requiring the director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget to conduct a comprehensive economic evaluation of \nthe direct and indirect economic impacts of the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact on consumers within the six-state compact region and on \nproducers outside of the region. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] \nand I offered this amendment with Senators Kohl, Levin, Abraham, and \nWellstone during Senate consideration of the bill, because, to date, \nthere has been no comprehensive analysis of the short and long-term \nimpacts of the Compact from this perspective.\n  Wisconsin farmers, and many farmers throughout the nation, are \nextremely concerned that the artificially high milk prices under the \nNortheast Dairy Compact will place nonCompact farmers at an unfair \ncompetitive disadvantage. Compact producers, who on July 1 of this year \nbegan receiving a Class I price of $16.94, have been insulated from the \nmarket prices which farmers throughout the country have faced in 1997.\n  Wisconsin farmers are concerned about surplus production the inflated \nCompact price is likely to generate about the impact of potential milk \nsurpluses on national milk prices. Furthermore, there is concern that \nthis Compact, while ostensibly affecting only Class I milk, will result \nin surplus Class I milk being processed into cheese, butter and other \nproducts which are sold nationally. If the supply of manufactured dairy \nproducts rises due to increased manufacturing in the Northeast, \nnational markets for manufactured products will be negatively affected \nand milk prices to producers may fall nationally. In addition, if milk \nproduction rises in the Compact region due to artificial production \nincentives, excess milk may be shipped out of the Compact region to \nfill cheese vats elsewhere, further depressing cheese and milk prices. \nSo these secondary effects of the Compact must be examined.\n  Section 732 of this bill is very specific. It directs OMB to \ncarefully examine changes and projected changes in levels of milk \nproduction, the number of cows, the number of dairy farms and milk \nutilization in the Compact region due to the Compact. OMB must compare \nchanges in those factors resulting from the Compact to levels of \nproduction, cow numbers, dairy farms, milk utilization and disposition \nof milk that would have occurred in the absence of the Compact. It is \nextremely important that OMB compare Compact effects not with national \naverages, but rather with production, cow numbers, and other effects \nthat would have occurred had Compact producers been subject to the \nmarket conditions facing dairy farmers nationally.\n  Section 732 also directs OMB to look at a number of economic \nindicators, such as changes in disposition of milk produced in the \nCompact region and changes in utilization of Compact milk, that will \naid them in determining the impacts of the Compact on farmers outside \nof the Northeast.\n  There is also substantial concern about the consumer impacts of the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact which taxes 14 million Northeast \nconsumers to benefit just over 4000 dairy farmers in the six states. It \nis not surprising that consumer prices for fluid milk have risen since \nthe Compact price has been in effect. The Compact raises Class I prices \nspecifically because demand for Class I milk is less responsive to \nprice than other dairy products and more revenue can be extracted from \nthe consumer's pocket. OMB must examine the effects of milk price \nincreases on consumers and, in particular, on low-income consumers.\n\n  The study must also examine the impacts of the Compact on USDA's \nvital nutrition programs that provide milk and dairy products to low-\nincome women, children, infants and the elderly. OMB is directed by \nsection 732 to study the impact of the Compact on both actual and \nprojected changes in program participation, on the value of benefits \noffered under these programs and on the financial status of the \ninstitutions offering the programs. Will the purchasing power of food \nstamps fall because of the higher milk prices? Will schools offering \nschool lunch and breakfast suffer from an effective lower per meal \nreimbursement rate? Will participation in the WIC program offered by \nthe six northeastern states fall due to increased milk prices? Is the \nreimbursement scheme established by the Compact Commission adequate to \ncompensate WIC for increased milk costs? These questions should be \nanswered by OMB's analysis.\n  Finally, OMB must evaluate the impact of adding additional states to \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact on all of the factors mentioned above. The \nNortheast Dairy Compact allows Delaware, New Jersey, New York, \nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and any additional states contiguous \nto participating states, to join the Compact and benefit from inflated \nClass I milk prices. If that happens, a much larger volume of milk, \nperhaps over 20 percent of national production, will be priced under \nthe Compact and a much larger number of farmers will have artificial \nincentives to increase milk production. Congress must have information \nabout the potential economic impact of adding more states to the \nCompact on farmers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho, California, New \nMexico and other major milk producing states. Furthermore, consumer \nimpacts will be magnified if additional states are added and we need to \nbe able to quantify that impact.\n  Mr. President, the amendment which Senator Grams and I offered, which \nwas adopted by the Senate and included in the final bill by the \nConference Committee, lays out very clear direction for OMB on the \nissues they should evaluate regarding the Northeast Interstate Diary \nCompact.\n  However, the Senator from Vermont [Senator Leahy] made a statement \nshortly after this provision was adopted as part of the Senate FY 1998 \nAgricultural Appropriations Bill that implied that OMB should study \nissues much broader than stipulated by section 732. The Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy] was not a cosponsor of the amendment adopted in the \nSenate and he is incorrect with respect to the issues the bill directs \nOMB to evaluate. There was no agreement between the authors of section \n732 of this bill and the Senator from Vermont, or any other Senators, \nthat any of the items he mentioned in floor statements subsequent to \nthe passage of the amendment were to be included in the study. OMB \nshould look at the requirements of section 732 and at the statements \nmade by the amendment authors in setting the parameters of this study \nand the intent of Congress.\n  As a principal coauthor of the provision requiring OMB to study the \nimpact of the Northeast Dairy Compact, I want to make clear what the \nAgriculture Appropriations Bill requires and what it does not require \nof OMB's evaluation.\n  The study does not require that OMB conduct a comprehensive \nevaluation of retail, wholesale, and processor milk pricing in New \nEngland and OMB should not include such a broad analysis in their \nstudy. The authors of the study provision did not intend for OMB to \nexamine farm-retail asymmetry issues. OMB's study should not address \nwhether those in the marketing chain should be passing on all or a \nportion of the increase in farm level milk costs to consumers. This \nstudy should provide an objective analysis of the direct impacts of the \nNortheast Compact on the wholesale and retail cost of fluid milk not a \nsubjective review of how Compact associated price increases compare to \nprice increases or decreases resulting from market conditions in the \npast.\n\n  OMB should not evaluate broader issues of what the appropriate profit \nmargin for those in the marketing chain could or should be or what \nlevel\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\nof price increase is justifiable or appropriate. That is a question far \nexceeding the scope of this study. OMB should not look at regional \nvariations in pricing as they have little relevance to the impact of \nprice increases in New England. OMB should not examine all the factors \nthat affect the price of milk. The amendment offered by Senator Grams, \nmyself and others directs OMB to examine only the impact of the Compact \non consumer prices, not the price of feeds, transportation costs or \nother factors. In the absence of the Compact, those factors would not \nhave changed, and have no bearing on this study. The only change in the \nstatus quo is the Compact milk price increase and that is what the \nstudy directs OMB to evaluate. The study requirement in this bill \nmerely requires the OMB to report on what impact the inflated Compact \nClass I price has had on wholesale and retail prices and on consumers \ngenerally.\n  OMB cannot and should not, based on the directive of the study \nprovision in this bill, compare increases in retail milk prices to \nconsumers resulting from the Compact to benefits they might receive by \nusing coupons, shopping at discount stores, or other methods consumers \nuse to reduce overall food bills. Consumers should not have to utilize \ncoupons or other methods to reduce food costs in order to offset milk \nprice increases caused by the Compact as the Senator from Vermont has \nsuggested.\n  OMB should not compare the impact of the Compact on USDA nutrition \nprograms to the impact of the recently passed welfare reform bill on \nthese same programs. Welfare reform is being implemented differently by \neach state. It would divert OMB resources to undertake a comprehensive \nreview of the impact of welfare reform on each of these programs in \neach of the Compact states relative to the overall impact of the \nCompact on consumers. That issue is well beyond the scope of this \nstudy.\n  OMB should focus their evaluation on the impact of increased Compact \nmilk prices on the purchasing power of USDA's nutrition programs, the \nnumber of recipients served, and the institutions offering the programs \nin terms of increased costs or financial burdens.\n  Lastly, OMB should not evaluate the supposed direct and indirect \n``positive benefits'' the Compact may bring to farmers, land use \npatterns and tourism in participating Northeastern states. There is no \nmention of this in the study provision in this bill and OMB should not \nevaluate these issues. Presumably, the Secretary of Agriculture and \npolicy makers in the Northeast have already examined these factors and \nduplicating such efforts will be a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  Section 732 of FY 1998 Agriculture appropriations bill requiring OMB \nto study the impact of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on \nCompact-consumers and on non-Compact dairy farmers and manufacturers is \nvery specific. OMB should stick to the directives of this Section and \nprovide Congress with an objective and unbiased analysis of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact's impact on these stakeholders.\n  Mr. President, there will likely be efforts to politicize this study \nand I will work with OMB and the analysts conducting this analysis to \nbe sure that doesn't happen. I plan to meet with OMB Director Franklin \nRaines on this subject. Consumers and non-Compact farmers and \nmanufacturers have a right to know how the Compact will impact them \nwithout interference by Compact proponents who wish to downplay the \nnegative impacts of this price fixing scheme. This is especially \ncritical given that farmers outside of the Compact region have suffered \nfrom extremely low milk prices throughout this year. If the Compact \nwill further drive down milk prices nationally and increase milk \nsupplies, farmers, consumers and taxpayers have a right to know. I, and \nthe other cosponsors of section 732, will hold OMB accountable for the \naccuracy and objectivity of this study.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11494-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PETER J.

Mr. President, I support the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1998. I congratulate the chairman, \nSenator Thurmond, and the ranking member, Senator Levin, for their \nleadership in the bipartisan effort which attained this substantive and \nfar reaching conference agreement. And they reached this agreement with \nthe unanimous support of the Senate Armed Services Committee, all 18 \ncommittee members signed the conference report. Most importantly, this \nagreement was able to produce significant compromise in policy on key \nissues related to Bosnia, the B-2 bomber, and depot provisions.\n\n\n                            depot provisions\n\n  I would like to take a few moments to elaborate on the great \naccomplishment of this depot compromise. This is a compromise that was \nvery difficult to achieve and I appreciate the very strong views of \nSenators on both sides of this issue. Earlier in this authorization \nconference process, I opposed the depot provisions which were \noriginally recommended by the readiness panel because they explicitly \nprecluded competition for the resolution of workloads at Kelly and \nMcClellan Air Logistics Center. So we went back to work and through the \nsignificant efforts of many members with key interests in this depot \nissue, we were able to develop a substantive set of provisions that \npromote competition, and I support them. This compromise protects the \nintegrity of the BRAC process and will serve the best interests of the \nDepartment of Defense and the U.S. taxpayer.\n  First, this bill provides for an open and fair competition for the \nworkloads at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Base by ensuring that \nconsistent practices are used to value the bids of private and public \nsector entities. Furthermore, we have been able to incorporate a major \ninitiative in public-private\n\n[[Page S11496]]\n\npartnerships. This provision enables the Department of Defense to \nleverage the core competencies of our public sector depots with those \nof private industry in building the most effective and the most \nefficient team for maintaining our military's equipment. And it does so \nin a way that keeps competitive pressures on both the private and the \npublic sector that will ensure that the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer \ncontinue to get the best value for their defense dollar. The Pentagon \nhas indicated that this is a workable approach to resolving the highly \ncharged issue surrounding Kelly and McClellan Air Logistics Centers.\n  Second, the depot package amends the 60-40 public-private workload \nsplit to 50-50. This provision, in addition to codifying the definition \nof depot maintenance in a way that protects procurement of upgrades and \nmajor modifications for private industry while retaining a core public \nsector capability, gives the Department of Defense much more \nflexibility in undertaking maintenance functions. In short, it allows \nthem a significant increase in headroom to prudently shift depot \nworkloads across the private and the public sectors to achieve \nefficiencies.\n\n  Most importantly, this depot provision gives us a window of \nopportunity to get defense infrastructure reform on track. From my \nperspective as chairman of the Airland Subcommittee, I see the impact \nof the Pentagon's procurement shortfall which measures approximately \n$10 to $15 billion per year. This shortfall is due to this \nadministration's spending too much on defense infrastructure and \noperations, and too little on vital modernization. I see it in terms of \ndozens and dozens of broken programs which are not funded at \nsustainable rates. Consequently, contractors are required to start and \nstop development and production of major assemblies, if not final \nproducts such as in digital communications, ballistic missile defense, \ntactical vehicles, and the list goes on and on. I also see it in areas \nwhere key Pentagon requirements simply are not being addressed because \nfunding is unavailable such as in the Comanche armed reconnaissance \nhelicopter or the Marine Corps advanced amphibious armored vehicle.\n  In conclusion, I am encouraged that this depot compromise sets the \nstage for gaining efficiencies in our infrastructure so that we can \nretain the readiness levels required in the near term, while at the \nsame time providing the means to boost our procurement programs to help \nensure the preparedness of our future forces to dominate the uncertain \nthreats of the 21st Century.\n\n\n                                airland\n\n  And now I would like to provide a few comments on the Airland aspects \nof this bill. First, this National Defense Authorization supports the \nArmy's commendable Force XXI effort which significantly enhances the \nsituational awareness and combat effectiveness of our land forces \nthrough information technology. Yet, we need to do much more to get the \nspectrum of digitization efforts which were strongly endorsed by the \nPentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review adequately funded. But at least \nthis is a fair start. We also were able to provide significant \nenhancements in the military's tactical and operational mobility \nthrough increases in tactical trucks, the establishment of multi-year \nprocurement for the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles [FMTV], and \nincreases in V-22 procurement. We also added increases for tactical air \nand missile defense capabilities such as with the Sentinel Radar, the \nAvenger Slew-to-Cue modifications, and enhancements to Stinger missile \nmodifications and the Patriot anticruise missile program.\n  I spoke at length about my concerns with F-22 cost overruns and \ntechnology risks during our deliberations over Defense Appropriations. \nThis National Defense Authorization provides the same F-22 funding \nlevels, but goes the very important further step to put key oversight \nprovisions in place that will help Congress and the administration keep \nthis program on track. First, this bill includes the Senate's total \ncost cap provisions which limits the level of engineering and \nmanufacturing development to approximately $18.7 billion, and \nproduction to $43.4B. Second, it require the General Accounting Office \nto conduct an annual F-22 review that addresses whether the program is \nmeeting established goals in performance, cost, and schedule.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  This National Defense Authorization makes great strides in supporting \nthe defense strategy of Shape, Respond, and Prepare Now. It provides \nsignificant increases in our readiness accounts. It also takes better \ncare of our military servicmembers and their quality of life through a \n2.8 percent payraise and a reformed approach to quarters allowances. \nAnd it accelerates procurement to address shortfalls in key mission \ncapabilities. Finally, this National Defense Authorization provides a \nreasonable compromise to the depot issue through a fair and open \ncompetition which serves the best interests of the military and the \nAmerican taxpayer. In short, this bill provides the policy and fiscal \nprovisions representative of the prudent oversight from our Senate \nauthorization process. It provides the framework for setting a course \nwhich ensures U.S. military dominance into the 21st Century.\n  This National Defense Authorization has my full support, and I \nstrongly encourage all members to vote for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11495-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11496-S11498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CBO ESTIMATE ON S. 967\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.

At the time the report was filed, the estimates by \nCongressional Budget Office were not available. The estimate is now \navailable and concludes that enactment of S. 967 would ``increase \ndirect spending by about $10 million over the 1998-2002 period.'' I ask \nthat a complete copy of the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.\n  The estimate follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 967, a bill to \n     amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska \n     National Interest Lands Conservation Act to benefit Alaska \n     Natives and rural residents, and for other purposes.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Victoria \n     V. Heid (for federal costs) and Marjorie Miller (for the \n     impact on state, local and tribal governments).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 967--A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n         Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \n         Act to benefit Alaska Natives and rural residents, and \n         for other purposes\n       Summary: CBO estimates that enacting S. 967 would increase \n     direct spending by about $10 million over the 1998-2002 \n     period. Because the bill would affect direct spending, pay-\n     as-you-go procedures would apply. Assuming appropriation of \n     the authorized amount, implementing S. 967 also would result \n     in discretionary spending of about $1 million over the next \n     five years.\n       S. 967 contains at least one intergovernmental mandate as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), \n     but CBO estimates that any costs imposed on state, local, and \n     tribal governments would be minimal and would not exceed the \n     threshold established in that act ($50 million in 1996, \n     adjusted annually for inflation). The bill contains no \n     private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Description of the bill's major provisions: S. 967 would \n     affect the terms and conditions of various property \n     transactions involving Alaska native corporations. Several \n     provisions would affect the property rights of specific \n     native corporations.\n       S. 967 would amend existing law by assigning a value of $39 \n     million to properties to be conveyed by the Calista \n     Corporation in exchange for monetary credits to certain \n     federal properties if the Department of the Interior (DOI) \n     and the corporation have not agreed on the value of the \n     exchange by January 1, 1998. The bill would allow the Doyon, \n     Limited, native corporation to obtain the subsurface rights \n     retained by the federal government in up to 12,000 acres of \n     public lands surrounded by or contiguous to corporation-owned \n     properties. Another provision would expand the entitlement of \n     the Cook Inlet Region Incorporated (CIRI) to include \n     subsurface rights to an additional 3,520 acres.\n       S. 967 would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n     to allow the native\n\n[[Page S11497]]\n\n     residents of five native villages in southeast Alaska to \n     organize as native corporations. The bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of $1 million for planning grants to the five \n     villages.\n       The bill would permit individual natives to exclude bonds \n     issued by a native corporation from the assets used for \n     determining financial eligibility for federal need-based \n     assistance or benefits.\n       The bill would extend certain protections to lands \n     exchanged among corporations, clarify the status of \n     applications involving land allotments, and exempt a \n     corporation's revenues from sand, gravel, and certain other \n     resources from the income distribution requirements that \n     apply to regional corporations' development of subsurface \n     property. The bill would specify the method of distributing \n     mining claim revenues related to the Haida Corporation or \n     Haida Traditional Use sites.\n       Finally, the bill includes administrative provisions \n     affecting training of federal land managers, subsistence uses \n     in Glacier Bay National Park, certain access rights to \n     federal land, contracting preferences for visitor services, \n     and a status report by the Secretary of the Interior on \n     implementing current laws on local hiring and contracting \n     with regard to public lands.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates \n     that enacting this bill would increase direct spending by \n     about $10 million over the 1998-2002 period and about $17 \n     million over the 1998-2007 period. This bill also would \n     authorize to be appropriated about $1 million for planning \n     grants to certain native villages. The estimated budgetary \n     impact of enacting S. 967 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 300 \n     (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         By fiscal years in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpending Under Current Law:\n  Estimated Budget Authority.........      5      0     -1     -1     -1\n  Estimated Outlays..................      5      0     -1     -1     -1\nProposed Changes:\n  Estimated Budget Authority.........     21      0     -4     -4     -4\n  Estimated Outlays..................     21      0     -4     -4     -4\nSpending Under S. 967:\n  Estimated Budget Authority.........     26      0     -5     -5     -5\n  Estimated Outlays..................     26      0     -5     -5     -5\n \n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nAuthorization Level..................      0      1      0      0      0\nEstimated Outlays....................      0      1      0      0      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Basis of estimate\n       Direct spending\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 967 would increase direct \n     spending because of provisions that would result in a loss of \n     federal receipts from property sales.\n       Calista Corporation property account. The costs of this \n     bill would result primarily from section 5, which prescribes \n     the value of the Calista Corporation's properties to be \n     exchanged for monetary credits with the Department of the \n     Interior to complete a land exchange between the two parties. \n     Under current law, the Calista Corporation is to receive \n     monetary credits equal to the value of the lands to be \n     conveyed, and the corporation is authorized to use these \n     monetary credits to purchase other federal properties. The \n     value of monetary credits counts as direct spending in the \n     year they are issued and as receipts in the years in which \n     they are redeemed. If the credits are used to acquire \n     property that otherwise would have been sold by the \n     government, the use of the credits results in a corresponding \n     loss of receipts from such sales. So far no monetary credits \n     have been awarded because DOI and Calista disagree on the \n     valuation of the properties.\n       The gap between the valuations is substantial: the \n     department's appraisal assigned a value of about $5 million \n     to the properties, while the corporation asserts that the \n     property is worth significantly more. Given the differences \n     in methodologies and values, this impasse could last for \n     some time. Because the department will not award monetary \n     credits until there is an agreement, it is possible that, \n     under current law, Calista would not receive any monetary \n     credits for several years. For the purpose of this \n     estimate, however, we assume an agreement will be reached \n     in fiscal year 1998, because of Calista's interest in \n     acquiring property with the credits. Although a negotiated \n     valuation could exceed DOI's $5 million appraisal, CBO has \n     no basis for estimating whether and to what extent the \n     Secretary would agree to a higher value. Hence, we assume \n     for this estimate that Calista would receive monetary \n     credits of about $5 million in fiscal year 1998 in the \n     absence of this legislation.\n       S. 967 provides that if the parties do not agree on a value \n     of the Calista properties to be exchanged, the value would be \n     established at $39 million. If the exchange does not occur \n     before January 1, 1998, the bill directs the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to credit the Calista property account with two-\n     thirds of the established value of the Calista property ($26 \n     million) in monetary credits in fiscal year 1998. The \n     corporation would be permitted to use up to one-half of that \n     amount in fiscal year 1998 and the remaining one-half of the \n     amount credited in fiscal year 1999. If the two parties have \n     not completed the exchange by October 1, 2002, the bill \n     directs the Secretary of the Treasury to credit the account \n     with monetary credits equal to the remaining $13 million. \n     These actions would result in a net increase of $34 million \n     in the amount of credits issued.\n       Increasing the amount of the credits would increase the \n     budgetary cost of the exchange if Calista's use of the \n     credits in a loss of cash receipts from the sale of federal \n     property. The bill provides that only that federal property \n     which is not scheduled for disposition by sale prior to \n     fiscal year 2003 may be transferred to the Secretary of the \n     Interior for use in the Calista land exchange. Therefore, \n     Calista's use of monetary credits would not result in a loss \n     of receipts to the federal government before fiscal year \n     2003. Assuming that Calista would use half of its monetary \n     credits to acquire properties that the federal government \n     would have sold anyway, CBO estimates that the bill would \n     increase the net cost of the Calista exchange by about $17 \n     million over the 1998-2007 period. The net increase in \n     outlays over the 1998-2002 period would be $10 million.\n       Subsurface conveyance to the Doyon Corporation. Section 2 \n     would allow Doyon, Limited, a regional corporation, to \n     acquire up to 12,000 acres of federally owned mineral estate \n     surrounded by or contiguous to subsurface lands owned by that \n     corporation. According to DOI, the federally-owned mineral \n     estate that Doyon, Limited, could acquire under the bill \n     currently has no mineral development. Based on information \n     from the agency, we estimate that although the federal land \n     to be conveyed has some potential for future development, any \n     forgone receipts from the conveyance would total less than \n     $500,000 per year.\n       Change in eligibility for certain federal assistance. \n     Section 3 would permit Alaska natives to exclude bonds issued \n     by a native corporation from the assets and resources used to \n     determine financial eligibility for federal need-based \n     assistance or benefits. Under current law, natives may \n     exclude certain assets, including stocks issued or \n     distributed by a native corporation as a dividend, from \n     federal financial eligibility tests. This provision would \n     expand the permitted exclusions to include bonds issued by \n     native corporations. Enacting this provision could have \n     limited effects on the federal budget in certain situations. \n     For example, according to a representative of Cook Inlet \n     Region Incorporated (CIRI), this provision would give CIRI \n     greater flexibility in financing a corporate buy-back of its \n     shares, which it seeks in order to keep shares in native \n     ownership. (Because CIRI is the only native corporation \n     currently authorized (under Public Law 104-10) to purchase \n     stock from its shareholders, natives in other native \n     corporations would not be affected in this case.) Enacting \n     the provision could increase federal spending by allowing \n     CIRI shareholders, who had planned to sell their shares to \n     CIRI in exchange for a bond and would have stopped receiving \n     federal assistance payments once their assets exceeded \n     financial eligibility tests, to continue to receive federal \n     assistance. We estimate that any such increase in federal \n     assistance payments would total less than $500,000 per year.\n       Change in CIRI's subsurface rights. Section 4 would \n     increase the entitlement of CIRI to include subsurface rights \n     to an additional 3,520 acres of federal land. Based on \n     information from CIRI representatives and DOI, it seems \n     likely that the corporation would choose properties in the \n     Talkeetna Mountains area. According to DOI, the federal \n     government currently generates no offsetting receipts from \n     that land and does not expect any significant income from it \n     over the next ten years. Therefore, we estimate that any \n     budgetary effect of enacting this provision would be \n     negligible.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Section 8 would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act to allow native residents of five native villages in \n     Southeast Alaska to organize as native corporations. The bill \n     would direct the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture \n     to recommend to the Congress the land conveyances and other \n     compensation that should be conveyed to those native \n     corporations; however, it would not entitle those \n     corporations to any federal lands without further \n     Congressional action. This section would authorize the \n     appropriation of about $1 million for planning grants to the \n     five villages.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-\n     as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. As shown in the following table, CBO \n     estimates that enacting S. 967 would affect direct spending \n     by increasing the amount of monetary credits issued to the \n     Calista Corporation by $34 million over the 1998-2007 period, \n     and that the net increase in direct spending over the 10-year \n     period would total about $17 million. Other provisions could \n     also affect direct spending by giving various native \n     corporations the rights to income-producing federal lands, \n     but we estimate that any such additional effects would be \n     negligible. For the purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go \n     procedures, only the effects in the budget year and the \n     subsequent four years are counted.\n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\n\n\n                                                   SUMMARY OF EFFECTS ON DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               By fiscal year in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1998       1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays.........................         21          0         -4         -4         -4         14         -2         -2         -2         -2\nChange in receipts........................                                                  Not applicable\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 967 contains at least one intergovernmental mandate as \n     defined in UMRA, but CBO estimates that any costs imposed on \n     state, local, and tribal governments would be minimal and \n     would not exceed the threshold established in that act ($50 \n     million in 1996, adjusted annually for inflation).\n     Mandates\n       Section 1 of this bill would amend the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act to clarify what lands are \n     eligible for automatic land protections, including exemption \n     from property taxes. This provision would impose a mandate on \n     the state of Alaska and its constituent local governments \n     because it could increase the amount of land exempt from \n     state and local property taxes. (UMRA defines the direct \n     costs of mandates to include revenues that state, local, or \n     tribal governments would be prohibited from collecting.) \n     Based on information provided by Alaska state officials, we \n     estimate that the impact would be negligible, because Alaska \n     has no state property tax and most of the land affected \n     would be in areas of the state and no local property \n     taxes.\n       By exempting the bonds of native corporations and the \n     income from those bonds from the determination of eligibility \n     for some means-tested federal assistance programs, Section 3 \n     would increase spending for those programs. Because states \n     share these costs, this provision would impose costs on state \n     governments. CBO cannot determine whether some of these costs \n     would result from an intergovernmental mandate, as defined in \n     UMRA. In any event, CBO estimates that any additional costs \n     of states would be minimal.\n     Other impacts\n       Other sections of the bill would result in both costs and \n     benefits for state, local, and tribal governments. Several \n     sections of the bill would benefit specific Alaska native \n     corporations, but some of these provisions could affect the \n     distribution of land and other resources among the \n     corporations. For example, section 7 would allow regional \n     corporations to dispose of sand, gravel, and similar \n     materials without distributing part of the proceeds among the \n     other regional corporations, as required by current law. This \n     change would allow village corporations to gain greater \n     access to these resources.\n       Other provisions would benefit Alaska native corporations \n     by expanding their rights to property and resources currently \n     held by the federal government. Section 5 would specify the \n     value of the properties to be exchanged by the Calista \n     Corporation for other federal properties. This section would \n     effectively increase the amount of property that the \n     corporation could obtain. Section 2 would allow Doyon, Ltd., \n     a regional native corporation, to obtain additional \n     subsurface rights now retained by the federal government. \n     Section 4 would give CIRI subsurface rights to an additional \n     3,520 acres.\n       Section 8 would authorize the creation of five additional \n     native corporations. This section would authorize the \n     appropriation of $1 million for planning grants for the new \n     corporations, but would not give them any entitlement to \n     federal land. This provision would not affect the \n     entitlements of any other native corporations.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would \n     impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Victoria V. Heid. \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Marjorie \n     Miller.\n       Estimate approved by: Paul N.

Mr. President, in March, the House passed H.R. 672. On \nApril 17, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported our companion bill, \nS. 506.\n  The only substantive difference between the two bills is that S. 506 \nprovides that the reasonable costs of a ratemaking proceeding conducted \nby a copyright arbitration royalty panel will be split 50-50 between \nthe parties who would receive royalties from the royalty rate adopted \nin the proceeding and the parties who would pay the royalty rate so \nadopted. H.R. 672 provides that the costs shall be borne by the parties \nin direct proportion to their share of the distribution. The Copyright \nOffice believes that the House version provides the copyright \narbitration royalty panels with greater flexibility in certain \ncircumstances. It is for this reason that the Senate is taking up the \nHouse version of the bill.\n  Last year, when the House considered and passed a similar bill, H.R. \n1861, it included another section clarifying that the distribution of \nphonorecords prior to 1978 did not constitute action divesting \ncopyright for the musical composition. This section was intended to \nclarify the Copyright Law of 1909 on an issue that has become a matter \nof increasing litigation in a number of Federal Circuits since the \nNinth Circuit decision in the ZZ Top case. I was disappointed last year \nthat the Senate did not proceed to consider and pass that bill.\n  We now have that opportunity. The amendment to H.R. 672 adds back \ninto the bill clarifications, which Chairman Hatch and I have \ncosponsored as part of another measure this year. This improvement will \nclarify an esoteric but increasingly important point of copyright law \nunder the 1909 Act with respect to copyrights of musical compositions \ncreated more than 20 years ago.\n  I therefore urge the adoption of the amendment to H.R. 672 and the \nimmediate passage of the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered read, agreed to, the bill be considered read \nfor a third time, and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed \nLt. Gen. Kenneth R. Wykle to be the Administrator of the Federal \nHighway Administration. I must say that we have been waiting quite some \ntime for this day, as the position has been vacant since Secretary \nSlater was confirmed in early February.\n  General Wykle appeared before the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks on Tuesday, October 28, and I am pleased to report that he is an \nexcellent candidate for the position before him. He has a distinguished \n32-year record of service with U.S. Army, where he led a number of \norganizations and commands in the United States, Europe, and Asia. He \nalso has extensive experience in managing the transportation of \npersonnel and cargo by air, highway, rail, and ship. I am confident \nthat he will continue to build on this excellent record as Federal \nHighway Administrator.\n  In his new position, General Wykle will represent the Department of\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\nTransportation and advise the Secretary on all matters related to the \nefficient movement of passengers and freight on the Nation's \ntransportation system. The Federal Highway Administration is \nresponsible for implementing a wide range of programs, including the \nFederal-aid highway program; highway safety programs; motors carrier \nprograms; the federal lands highway program; research and technology; \nand international programs.\n  An issue that is on everyone's mind is the reauthorization of the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. The Federal \nHighway Administration's role is a critical one in helping to implement \nthis landmark legislation. I look forward to working with General Wykle \nand his staff through the reauthorization process and through the \nimplementation process, once the bill is enacted.\n  It is incumbent upon the Federal Highway Administrator to protect not \nonly the key Federal role in implementing ISTEA II but also the broad \nperspective needed to guide the Nation's transportation system into the \nnext century. The enactment of ISTEA in 1991 transformed what was once \nsimply a highway program into a program not only for building roads and \nbridges but also for enhancing our mobility, our safety, and the \nenvironment. In the second ISTEA, we must move forward and strengthen \nISTEA's laudable goals of intermodalism, flexibility and efficiency.\n  I am confident that General Wykle has the experience and the \nknowledge to lead the Federal Highway Administration through the \nchallenges ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/30/senate-section/article/S11499-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
