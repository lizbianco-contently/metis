Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Pam Moran, \na fellow with the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, be allowed \nthe privileges of the floor during consideration of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think all you need to do is take a \nlook at the conference report as it sits on the desk to understand the \namount of work that has gone into this bill. This is an extremely \nimportant bill, and I am extremely pleased that the Senate is on the \nverge of sending to the President the Higher Education Amendments of \n1998.\n  Today marks the culmination of 18 months of hard work that, for me, \nbegan with the Labor Committee's hearing in Burlington, Vermont last \nFebruary.\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\n  The Higher Education Act is among the most significant statutes under \nthe jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Since \nits inception in 1965, the Act has been focused on enhancing the \nopportunities of students to pursue postsecondary education. The grant, \nloan, and work study assistance made available by this Act has made the \ndifference for countless millions in pursuing their dreams for a better \nlife. The legislation we are considering today builds on the proud \nlegacy of this Act.\n  In the face of rising college costs, Congress will provide students \nwith the lowest cost loans in nearly two decades. With increasing \nconcern about the quality of our nation's teachers, this bill will take \ngiant steps in improving teacher preparation. And with students, \nparents, and--frankly--Senators concerned about the delivery of student \naid, this bill completely overhauls the federal role by placing it in \nthe hands of a professional and accountable agency within the \nDepartment of Education.\n  Getting to this point has been a challenging, but rewarding, journey. \nThe process in both the House and Senate has been characterized by a \nspirit of bipartisanship, with members sharing the basic objective of \nmaking higher education programs work better for students and their \nfamilies. I commend the work of the chairman of the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce, Representative Bill Goodling, and the \ncommittee's ranking member Representative Bill Clay. The House \nsubcommittee leadership, Representative Buck McKeon, and ranking member \nRepresentative Dale Kildee have also done a yeoman's job throughout the \nprocess.\n  I would also like to acknowledge in particular the contributions of \nthe labor committee's ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, and the \nefforts of Senator Coats and of Senator Dodd. From the beginning, these \nthree members have been steadfast in their commitment to work through \ndifferences and to craft a solid piece of legislation.\n  At the start of the reauthorization process, we set out to achieve a \nnumber of important goals designed to strengthen higher education \nprograms. I am pleased to say that this conference report achieves the \nmajor objectives identified at the beginning of our efforts: to assist \nstudents, to improve the quality of teaching, to maintain two viable \nloan programs, and to improve the delivery of student financial aid.\n  First, the final bill preserves the focus on students--who are the \nprimary reason we have a Higher Education Act in the first place. \nStudents now in school will be assured of receiving the lowest interest \nrate in nearly two decades on their loans.\n  Students now in high school who aspire to a college education will \nbenefit from an expanded early intervention program known as GEAR UP, \nas well as continuing to receive services from the time-tested and \nhighly regarded TRIO programs. The new GEAR UP program combines \nfeatures of the existing National Early Intervention Scholarship \nProgram, which I sponsored in 1992, with recommendations proposed by \nthe Administration and included in the House bill. The GEAR UP program \npreserves the best features of the program now operating successfully \nin 9 states, while expanding the pool of participants and approaches \ninvolved in early intervention.\n  Students who have graduated and are faced with exceptionally high \nloan burdens will be able to take advantage of extended repayment \noptions under the guaranteed loan program. In addition, the measure \nprovides a four-month window within which students may obtain Direct \nconsolidation loans at an interest rate set at the 91-day Treasury bill \nrate plus 2.3 percent.\n  Recognizing the toll which ever increasing colleges costs are placing \non students, the bill builds on recommendations of the National \nCommission on the Cost of Higher Education so that students and their \nfamilies can obtain useful cost information.\n  Second, perhaps the most exciting and far-reaching innovation in this \nlegislation is its provisions dealing with teacher preparation. \nNumerous small, categorical--and unfunded--teacher training programs \nare repealed and replaced with a comprehensive model for change and \nimprovement. The teacher quality provisions included in Title II of \nH.R. 6 are an important first step towards really improving teacher \ntraining. Working at both the state level to promote system-wide \nreforms and at the local level to develop partnerships to enhance the \nquality of teacher training, the bill offers a comprehensive and \nsystematic approach to this pressing national need.\n  At its foundation, these provisions embrace the notion that investing \nin the preparation of our nation's teachers is a good one. Well \nprepared teachers play a key role in making it possible for our \nstudents to achieve the standards required to assure both their own \nwell being and the ability of our country to compete internationally. \nIn fact, the continued health and strength of our nation depends on our \ncountry's ability to improve the education of our young people. \nIntegral to that is the strength and ability of our nation's teaching \nforce. Without a strong, competent, well prepared teaching force, other \ninvestments in education will be of little value. I think these \nprovisions will be viewed as one of the lasting achievements of this \nreauthorization.\n  In addition, the legislation provides loan forgiveness for students \nwho go into teaching. It is my hope that this new benefit will expand \nthe number of talented teachers serving school districts with large \nnumbers of low-income children.\n  Third, this bill reflects a strong commitment to the maintenance of \ntwo viable loan programs--the guaranteed or Federal Family Education \nLoan Program (FFELP) and the Direct Loan Program. To the extent \npossible within budgetary constraints, the bill ``levels the playing \nfield'' to assure the continuation of fair and healthy competition \nbetween the two programs. This bill extends the provisions of the \nEmergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997 which permit Direct \nloans to be included in FFELP consolidation packages. Following a four-\nmonth period (October 1, 1998, to January 31, 1999) in which Direct \nconsolidation loans will be set at the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus \n2.3 percent, Direct and FFELP consolidation loans will carry the same \ninterest rate. That rate will be the weighted average of the loans \nconsolidated, rounded up to the nearly one-eighth of a percent and \ncapped at 8.25 percent.\n  Among the most challenging tasks facing the committee was developing \na student loan interest rate which could offer the lowest viable \ninterest to students while assuring sufficient lender participation to \npreserve full access to loans. After extensive consultation with \nstudents, lenders, representatives of the higher education community, \nthe administration and financial services experts, a compromise \ninterest rate package was developed. Lender yield is reduced by 30 \nbasis points, while students receive the significant interest rate \nreduction they have anticipated. This solution is by no means perfect, \nbut it promises to preserve the stability of the FFEL program for the \nnearly 4 million students and their families who depend upon these \nloans each year.\n  Fourth, the legislation includes a number of initiatives designed to \nimprove the delivery of student financial aid services. It includes a \nnew guaranty agency financing model--the goal of which is to achieve \ncost savings and efficiencies in the delivery and administration of \nstudent aid while ensuring that students, lenders, the Federal \ngovernment, and institutions of higher education receive high quality \nservice. Additional efforts to improve the delivery of student aid \nprograms include the development of a Performance Based Organization \n(PBO) to strengthen the management of key systems within the Department \nof Education. A number of provisions in the legislation also pave the \nway toward taking advantage of the efficiencies made possible through \nelectronic processing and other technological advances.\n  Looking toward the future, the bill contains several provisions \ndealing with the Year 2000 computer problem. The Office of Management \nand Budget has raised serious questions about the Department of \nEducation's ability to meet the timetable outlined by the General \nAccounting Office for the testing of software renovation work. Failure \nto renovate all mission critical systems could result in disruptions in \nthe\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\nmanagement and delivery of student financial aid to more than 8 million \nstudents. This is an area which the committee will be following closely \nin the months ahead.\n  Finally, I would point out that this legislation complies with the \nBudget Act. In order to bring the bill into balance, the conferees had \nto make a number of difficult decisions. In making these decisions, we \nattempted to select options which would maintain the lowest possible \ninterest rates for students and which would preserve new student \nbenefits such as extended repayment options under the guaranteed loan \nprogram and teacher loan forgiveness. I recognize that particular \nconcern has been raised about provisions in the bill which eliminate a \nprovision of the bankruptcy law that permits individuals filing for \nbankruptcy to have their student loans canceled if the loans have been \nin repayment for seven years or longer. Individuals who file for \nbankruptcy may still have their student loans canceled if the \nbankruptcy court determines that repaying the loans would cause undue \nhardship. Currently, the undue hardship option accounts for 70 percent \nof all student loan discharges. In addition, a number of options are \navailable to assist borrowers who are having difficulties repaying \ntheir loans, including deferment, forbearance, cancellation and \nextended, graduated, income-contingent and income-sensitive repayment \noptions. In just about every case, these options are preferable to \ndeclaring bankruptcy.\n  Over the years, the federal effort in higher education has been \nsubstantial, and this legislation will assure that it will continue to \nbe so. The Higher Education Act currently provides $48.5 billion in \nstudent financial assistance for 8.5 million students and $216 million \nfor institutional development. In 1995-96, 55 percent of undergraduate \nstudents received financial aid under this Act. Over the next ten \nyears, the Federal government will guarantee over 88 million student \nloans--totaling over $383.5 billion. Over the next five years, the \nFederal government will provide more than 25.4 million Pell Grants.\n  As I said before, Mr. President, this conference report to the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998 is the culmination of almost two years of \ngood bipartisan work. Not only does it represent a huge victory for \nAmerica's students, but it represents a victory for all Americans as it \nshows that Democrats and Republicans can work together when it comes to \nthe needs of our next generation. This legislation gives millions of \nstudents the financial key to unlock the door to higher education. By \nlowering the interest rate for student loans to the lowest levels in \nnearly 20 years and by increasing the level of Pell grants, we are \nallowing higher-learning to mean higher-earnings for more of our \nchildren. Vermont has a proud tradition when it comes to higher \neducation in the United States Senate, from Bob Stafford to Justin \nSmith Morrill. I can only hope that, with the passage of this \nlegislation, I will have helped continue that tradition.\n  By increasing the access and quality of higher education, this bill \nwill help ensure that our nation remains a leader in educational \nexcellence for all of our citizens. It deserves the support of all \nmembers of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it we have 15 minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, 4 \nminutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, and I will yield myself, now, \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want first of all to express my appreciation to my \nfriend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for his leadership \nin this area. It follows a long tradition of Vermont Senators being \ncommitted to education policy. Senator Stafford, a long-time friend, \nwas strongly committed to education. At a time when there are \ndifferences that are all too obvious between the two political parties, \nSenator Jeffords constancy and commitment in the area of higher \neducation, I think, have been very, very impressive. All of us have \nenjoyed the opportunity to work with him.\n  I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd, who has been \nextremely active and involved in the workings of the higher education \nlegislation, both in the committee and the conference, and has been a \nkey player in his involvement and commitment in higher education.\n  I see, as well, my friend Senator Reed, who has a particular interest \nin teacher training programs and has a long tradition, with Senator \nPell of Rhode Island, and also in the House, of commitment to higher \neducation. We have a number of others who I will describe in greater \ndetail as time permits, but I am particularly appreciative of my \ncolleagues' strong support.\n  The Education Act of 1998 is a strong and bipartisan bill that \ndeserves the support of all Members. It renews our commitment to make \nhigher education more affordable and more accessible to qualified \nstudents. The House and Senate passed the original versions of the bill \nalmost unanimously, and the conference report preserves most of the \nbest features of both bills. It enhances benefits for students, \nparticularly for students who want to be teachers. It increases the \nmaximum authorization for the Pell grants for the neediest students and \nexpands the formula for calculating their financial need in order to \nprotect a larger amount of income for working parents and students with \ngreater opportunity for eligibility for those Pell grants.\n  The bill also reduces the cost of Pell grants by almost 1 percentage \npoint. This reduction can make a significant difference for students \nwho may face a mountain of debt when they graduate. This change will \nresult in savings of $700 on the average debt of $13,000, and savings \nof over $1,000 on a debt of $20,000, which is enormously important to \nmake these loans--and college--accessible for the sons and daughters of \nworking families.\n  I am disappointed, however, we could not extend this benefit to all \nrecent graduates. Under the bill, the rates for consolidation loans \nwill be permanently lowered in both programs from their previous \nstatutory rates. The bill does create a short time window for recent \ngraduates to consolidate their existing loans under the Direct Lending \nProgram at the same low rates applicable for new loans. This \nopportunity will be available for another 4 months in addition to the \n3-month window already in effect, so the students will have a total of \n7 months to consolidate their loans. Many of us would have liked to \nhave had a longer period of time, but budgetary restraints constricted \nus. I think it is going to be enormously important that students and \ntheir parents look into the consolidations that can save them a great \ndeal of money.\n  One of the key features of the bill is improving the training of \nteachers. The legislation supports local partnerships that include \nelementary-secondary schools and colleges and provides competitive \ngrants to States. This assistance is urgently needed to strengthen \nteacher training. If we are to find an area of greatest need, probably \nin our whole education system, it is putting a well-qualified teacher \nin every classroom in this country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield 4 \nminutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Let me quickly join with those who will commend our colleagues from \nVermont and Massachusetts, the chair and the ranking member of the full \ncommittee, for their terrific work. I also want to thank our colleague \nfrom Indiana, Senator Coats, and others, whom the chairman of the \ncommittee put together to work on this bill as sort of a working group \non higher education. Certainly without their efforts we would not be at \nthe point we are today in proposing what I think is a good bill.\n  You can ask families all over this country what concerns them the \nmost. And the answer, time and time again, is education--particularly \nhigher education. Families know that there is little as important to \ntheir children's lifelong success as achievement in post-secondary \neducation.\n  And families today are worried about higher education. They worry \nabout its cost--which is growing in many instances at outrageous \nlevels. They worry that too many students give up\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\nthe dream of college long before graduation from high school. And they \nworry that colleges are not keeping up and educating their children for \nthe next century.\n  These are fundamental concerns and they have been the driving force \nbehind this strong legislation. For two years, I have been working with \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats and the other members \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and, in the past few months \nwith the House Education and Workforce Committee, to complete this \nimportant bill. And I think our bipartisan efforts have helped produce \na bill that will help America's students and families.\n  It is a bill that, frankly, I think could have been better--but I \nbelieve that we have done a good job with the realities that we face.\n  This bill does four things that I think are commendable. One, it \naddresses the issues of college costs head-on--really for the first \ntime in my memory here that we address this issue. Many of my \ncolleagues may not be aware that over the past 20 years the cost of \ncollege has gone up 304 percent as compared to every other area of our \neconomy where inflation has risen about 165 percent. So we are looking \nat a tremendous increase in college costs for families all across this \nNation.\n  For the first time, this bill will ensure that families have access \nto comprehensive, comparable information on cost. I am particularly \npleased that these disclosure provisions will be enforced by the \nSecretary with the strong fine that I authored in the Senate bill. We \nalso authorize a follow-up study on why costs are escalating, as \nrecommended by the Cost of College Commission, and we direct the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics to develop a market-basket for higher education so \nthat we finally have a workable yardstick with which to judge college \ncosts.\n  I think that is a critical issue. Every year we see these costs go \nup, parents legitimately ask the question why. And while individual \ninstitutions can give some reasons, I think we need to get a better \nhandle on that. The provisions in this bill are simply a first step and \na warning to colleges: We are serious about this effort and will no \nlonger sit idly by while costs increase far faster than inflation.\n  Second, the bill goes right to the heart of the student aid issue. We \nprovide students with significantly improved loan rates, with a \nreduction in interest of nearly one percent. As a result of lowering \nthe loan rates, students in my State could save as much as $650 a year. \nThat may not seem like a lot to some, but to middle-income families in \nmy State that kind of a savings can make a huge, huge difference.\n  I would also point out this bill, of course, raises the maximum \namount that can be received under a Pell grant to $4,500. That makes a \nhuge difference, again, for families that fall within the category of \nreceiving that kind of assistance. So we really reach right out to \nthose families with this bill and make a difference for them.\n  We also afford students with the largest loans new repayment options \nthat will allow them to extend the time of repayment. And we provide \nnew teachers serving in needy districts with loan forgiveness.\n  Third, we finally really understand the role here of the \nnontraditional student, which is critically important. The \nnontraditional student, candidly, is becoming the traditional student. \nThe traditional student is the one who goes to college for 3 or 4 years \nwithout interruption. Today, more and more students are ones who work, \nwho take a year off from studies while they work to save money to pay \nfor the next year of education. People need education throughout their \nlives, so they go back to school. This bill really reaches into that \ncommunity and provides some wonderful opportunities, including things \nlike distance learning.\n  Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts has for years talked about the \nimportance of providing educational opportunity for people who do not \nhave the time or the resources to go to a traditional setting but can, \nthrough distance learning, acquire the knowledge and skills necessary \nto improve not only the quality of their lives, but the quality of all \nof our lives through enhanced educational opportunity.\n  This bill would also help the non-traditional student through the \nhigh-quality, affordable campus-based child care programs for low-\nincome students which I offered.\n  Last, beyond meeting the fundamental concerns of students, this bill \nwill strengthen our educational institutions themselves. This bill \nfundamentally restructures federal support for teacher training and \nfocuses support on high quality reforms that bring and keep excellent \nteachers in our classrooms. Plus, we restructured and improved federal \nsupport for developing institutions, like community colleges and \ncolleges serving at-risk minority populations.\n  I am disappointed we did not include the Wellstone amendment on TANF \neligibility for those pursuing post-secondary education. It is clear \nthat education is the best long term solution to ending welfare \ndependency, but we were frankly unable to move the House conferees on \nthis issue. I want to continue to work to move this initiative forward \nand pledge to work with Senator Wellstone to identify other legislative \nvehicles for this important reform. I was also disappointed that we \nwere forced to adopt two provisions--eliminating the bankruptcy \ndischarge of student loans after seven years of repayment and \nincreasing the fee on Ginnie Mae loans--outside of our committee's \njurisdiction to ensure that this bill was budget neutral.\n  Again, I admit that this legislation is not perfect. But on the \nwhole, I think that this is a very good bill that will help American \nstudents and families, and it is evidence of what we are capable of \ndoing when we all work together.\n  I ask unanimous consent the list of staff, key staff people who \nworked on this bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Senator Jeffords' staff: Susan Hattan, Scott Giles, and \n     Jenny Smulson.\n       Senator Kennedy's staff: Marianna Pierce and Jane Oates.\n       Senator Coats' staff: Townsend Lange.\n       Senator Dodd's staff: Suzanne Day.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I first want to thank Senator Kennedy for \nyielding me time and I add my commendation along with that of my \ncolleagues to both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for the \nremarkable work they have done. This has been a long process, but it \nhas been one that has been very positive, collaborative, and collegial. \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have been very supportive of \nefforts by all the members of the committee and Members of this Senate \nto incorporate, to improve, and to bring forth today legislation of \nwhich I think we can all be proud.\n  This legislation does so much to improve the quality of educational \nopportunity in the United States. One of the keys to our country, not \njust its economic prowess but its social progress, is the ability of \nall of our citizens to go on to higher education. This bill will \nadvance that goal significantly. I applaud all of those who \nparticipated in this process.\n  As my colleagues have mentioned, there are many important aspects of \nthis legislation that should be noted. First of all, there is an \nincrease in the authorization of the Pell grant, which will allow, \nparticularly many low-income students, further access to higher \neducation. There is a reduction in the interest rates which students \nwill pay on loans, which will help them bear the burden of the ever-\nincreasing cost of college. There is loan forgiveness for teachers, a \nrevamping of our early intervention efforts, and a strengthening of the \nTRIO Program, which is a very important program that targets low-income \nstudents who will be the first in their family to attend college. \nWithout TRIO, these students may not have the guidance, the \ninformation, and the support to make it into and stay in college. Also, \nthere has been some significant effort to begin to address cost issues \nwith respect to college education.\n  All of these are commendable, but there are two very important issues \nwhich I would like to stress. First, this Senate last year restored the \nState Student Incentive Grant Program, a very important program which \ntakes limited Federal resources, matches them with State dollars, and \nprovides\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\ngrants to needy undergraduate and graduate students. The Conference \nReport contains legislation I introduced with Senator Collins to reform \nthis program. It is now the LEAP Program, the Leveraging Educational \nAssistance Partnership Program. This revamped program will be a \ncontinuation and a strengthening of our commitment to ensure that all \nAmericans have access to quality higher education.\n  Also, there is a very, very strong teacher training title in this \nbill. Again, I thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for \ntheir efforts in this regard. We built on legislation I proposed, and \nwe created a situation in which now there will be incentives for \nteacher colleges to have active partnerships with elementary and \nsecondary schools.\n  We are trying to move in a direction of more clinical training for \nteachers. One of the sad commentaries I have heard--and I am sure my \ncolleagues have also--is that for so many teachers, on the first day of \nschool, it is practically their first day in a classroom as a teacher. \nThis should change. This approach of partnerships between higher \neducation institutions and elementary and secondary schools, \nparticularly one partnership model known as professional development \nschools, is a positive way to increase the professional development of \nour teachers, which could be the single most important factor in \nimproving and reforming education in the United States today.\n  This legislation is not perfect, but it is a remarkable achievement \nbased upon cooperation and a collegial approach to this issue.\n  I commend and thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman, Senator \nJeffords, and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, for all of their \nwork. I look forward to the speedy acceptance of this conference \nreport.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n        inclusion of the faculty retirement incentive provision\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues a small, but important, provision included in the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Title IX clarifies \nexisting law by making it permissible for colleges and universities to \noffer voluntary, age-based retirement incentives to tenured faculty in \naddition to their regular retirement benefits.\n  The inclusion of the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act in the \nReauthorization of the Higher Education Act will provide a ``safe \nharbor'' for colleges and universities by clarifying that the early \nretirement incentives are permitted by the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act. The faculty retirement incentive provision will benefit \ncolleges and universities, as well as those faculty who choose to \nparticipate. As officials for the American Association of University \nProfessors have stated, this provision will ``provide greater \nflexibility in faculty retirement planning, offer a substantial \nretirement benefit to those professors who choose to retire under the \nterms of an incentive plan, and leave other professors whole in their \nchoice to continue their careers.''\n  At the beginning of the 105th Congress, Senator Ashcroft and I \nintroduced legislation similar to the age-based retirement incentives \nlanguage the House included in its Higher Education reauthorization \nbill. I was very pleased to learn of the diligent effort of those on \nthe House Education and Work Force Committee to add this provision to \ntheir bill.\n  I thank the members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee \nfor working with Senator Ashcroft and me on this issue. I especially \nthank Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their thoughtful \nconsideration of this measure and for allowing it to remain in the bill \nduring conference. Lastly, I express my appreciation to Senator \nAshcroft for working closely with me on getting the Faculty Retirement \nIncentive bill into law.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, few individual pieces of legislation \nembody the spirit of the American dream as does the Higher Education \nAct. First passed in 1965, this legislation opened the doors of college \nand a more prosperous future to millions of students. Without federal \ncollege grants and loans, most Americans would not be able to get the \npostsecondary education that is essential in today's competitive \ninternational economy.\n  The pending legislation--the Higher Education Amendments of 1998--\nstrengthens our nation's commitment to a higher education and I am \npleased to support this important piece of legislation. I congratulate \nSenators Jeffords, Coats, Kennedy, and Dodd for crafting a genuinely \nbipartisan bill. I appreciate their leadership and commitment to \nensuring access to college for millions of Americans.\n  My colleagues have extolled the many fine features of this \nlegislation--lower interest rates for students, improved teacher \npreparation programs and a modernization of the system for delivering \nstudent aid. I am in full agreement on the positive aspects of this \nlegislation.\n  However, as we all know, legislation involves many compromises and I \nwould feel remiss if I did not also express my disappointment about two \nprovisions in the legislation.\n  We are all acutely aware of the soaring debt accumulated by U.S. \nstudents. The reduction in the interest rate by nearly eight tenths of \na point, will provide critical relief to students. As a result, they \nwill save hundreds of dollars.\n  The bill also allows individuals to refinance outstanding loans at a \nlower interest rate by extending the current interest rate on direct \nloans for four more months. Thereafter, the interest rate on \nconsolidation loans will increase to the weighted average of the \noutstanding loans with a cap of 8.25%. The conferees rejected attempts \nto provide a longer period for consolidation at the lower interest rate \nwith means that many students will be unable to refinance their loans \nto get more favorable rates.\n  Modest cuts in the generous subsidies to lenders and guarantee \nagencies would have enabled us to provide a longer window for \nconsolidation. It is my sincere hope that we will continue to work \ntogether to extent this important benefit to make it easier for \nindividuals to pay off their students loans.\n  Secondly, to pay for a lender subsidy for students, the legislation \nincreased the fee that FHA mortgage borrowers will pay to Ginnie Mae in \nthe future from 6 to 9 basis points. If not overturned at a later \npoint, this provision will cost hundreds of extra dollars to modest \nincome homebuyers in order to acquire a mortgage. Clearly, Ginnie Mae \nwhich makes insures the mortgages does not need the funding. This is a \nstraightforward tax on modest income homebuyers, often making $25,000 \nto $40,000 per year inserted into this measure. The conferees may talk \nabout their hope that the 3 basis points will be absorbed by mortgage \nbankers. But, given that competitive market, most of that cost will be \npassed on. I will work to overturn this inappropriate source of funds.\n  Even though I have reservations about some provisions in this \nlegislation, I believe it is a strong bill and worthy of our support. \nThe bill strengthens Federal student aid programs for the future, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my appreciation \nto my colleagues on the Labor Committee for their hard work on the \nHigher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998. I am especially grateful \nto the Chairman and Ranking Member, Senator Jeffords and Senator \nKennedy, for their inclusion of two provisions I authored which are \ncritical to the people of this Nation and of my state of New Jersey.\n  The first addresses the issue of campus safety. Mr. President, every \nyear, over 10 million students and their parents agonize over where to \nattend college. They spend months researching schools and visiting \ncampuses in an effort to find the perfect fit. Just as information is \nthe key to making an informed choice about professors or scholarships, \nit is the key to choosing a safe learning environment. Currently, \nstudents and their parents do not have access to all the information.\n  Current law requires colleges and universities to report statistics \non crimes that occur on their campuses. Reports of hate crimes, \nhowever, is limited to only those that result in murder, rape, or \naggravated assault. This is the law notwithstanding the fact that these \n3 categories of crimes only represent 16 percent of the total number of \nhate crimes that occur on\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\ncollege campuses every year. Over 80% take the form of other crimes, \nincluding simple assault and robbery.\n  An amendment I offered, which is now part of the Higher Education \nAct, will ensure that students and their parents have all the \ninformation necessary to choose a safe school. This amendment will \nrequire colleges and universities to report all hate crimes that \ninvolve either bodily injury or a serious property crime such as \nburglary or arson. It also expands the definition of a hate crime to \nprotect women and the disabled. Current law only protects against \ncrimes motivated by prejudice based on race, ethnicity, religion, or \nsexual orientation.\n  Our children are our future. Their college years are among the most \nexciting and formative of their lives. Expanding the types of hate \ncrimes colleges and universities must report will empower students and \nparents with all of the information necessary to ensure that those \nyears are as safe as possible.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for their \ninclusion of another amendment I authored which will freeze the status \nof a student reservist's grace period for paying back their education \nloans until they return from active duty service. All students are \npermitted a grace period of up to nine months after graduating or \nwithdrawing from class before they must begin to repay their student \nloans. However, the typical length of active duty service for a \nreservist is currently 270 days, meaning that a student's grace period \nhas often expired by the time they return home from military service.\n  We should not welcome our courageous men and women in uniform home \nfrom active duty by handing them a bill. Students who serve their \ncountry in the armed forces should at least have the peace of mind of \nknowing that their student loans are not increasing while they are \nabroad. This provision will provide them with that peace of mind.\n  For these two provisions and for all their hard work on this very \nimportant piece of legislation, I thank Senator Jeffords, Senator \nKennedy and all of my colleagues on the Labor Committee.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nfloor manager of the bill a question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Certainly, I will be happy to answer my colleague's \nquestion.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Under Title II of the pending legislation, entitled \nImproving Teacher quality, the Secretary of Education is authorized to \nmake teacher training partnership grants. These partnerships may \ninclude non-profit education organizations, businesses and teacher \norganizations.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct. The effort is to bring a broad range \nof opportunities to teacher preparedness and training.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I know that the Senator from Vermont is quite familiar \nwith the work of the State Humanities Councils and he is aware of the \nextensive number of teacher institutes which they have supported over \nthe past few years. In Virginia, for example, the council has sponsored \nteacher institutes on local and regional history. The Alabama \nHumanities Foundation's SUPER (School and University Partners for \nEducational Renewal) reached more than 800 Alabama teachers over a two \nyear period.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, I am well aware of the efforts of the state \ncouncils with respect to teacher institutes. Many of the Councils have \nworked closely with the school systems and local colleges and \nuniversities to present relevant and cost-effective teacher institutes. \nThey have a long history in this effort and considerable experience.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree. Consequently, I simply wanted to make certain \nthat state councils, which are non-profit entities, would qualify for \nparticipation in the teacher training partnerships.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think they would certainly qualify and I would urge \nthem to participate whenever they can.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the chairman of the committee and I appreciate \nhis response.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998. As our economy becomes increasingly \nknowledge-based, this legislation represents an important step in \nhelping individuals achieve the American Dream.\n  A college degree expands learning horizons and increases professional \nopportunities. One of the most satisfying efforts we can make as public \nofficials and legislators is helping Americans acquire the knowledge \nand skills needed to seize these opportunities. This bipartisan \nconference agreement makes important strides both in improving the \neducation students receive within colleges and universities and in \nincreasing access to higher education.\n  Nationwide we have about 10 million students enrolled in four-year \nand two-year public colleges and universities. About 83,000 of those \nstudents are in school in Nebraska. We have about 2.5 million in \nprivate institutions--19,000 in Nebraska. This legislation helps those \nstudents stay in college and also opens the door for more students to \nobtain a college degree.\n  Approximately $50 billion in this bill is devoted to postsecondary \ngrants and loans for students. This is a wise investment for all \nAmericans because this financial assistance to obtain higher education \nhelps individuals increase their earning power once they graduate. When \nwe increase the income of Americans, we reduce spending and in turn \nreduce the tax burden on our citizens.\n  According to the US Census, college graduates make an average of \n$600,000 more over their lifetime than do individuals without a college \ndegree. That differential has doubled in the last 15 years.\n  An individual with a bachelors degree can expect to earn $1.4 million \nover the course of a lifetime. With a professional degree, that person \ncan earn over $3 million in a lifetime.\n  But currently, only 60% of high school graduates go on to college, \nand by the time they are 25 years old, only about 25% have a college \ndegree. We need to focus more attention on those students who do not \nenroll in four-year institutions. For those students we need to create \na more seamless transition from high school to the workplace, and we \nneed to encourage those students to take advantage of the opportunities \nthat community colleges offer.\n  For those students who choose to seek a college degree, this \nlegislation helps to make college more affordable. For instance, it \ncuts the student loan interest rate from 8.25% to 7.46%, which will \nsave approximately $11 billion for students over the life of their \nloans. In addition it increases aid to the neediest of students by \nincreasing the authorization for maximum Pell Grants to $4,500 for \n1999-2000. We still have much work to do as we try to figure out how to \nmake higher education more affordable, but this bill is a step in the \nright direction.\n  The bill also authorizes $300 million to make significant \nimprovements in teacher training. It establishes grants to partnerships \nbetween teacher education institutions and school districts to produce \nhighly skilled teachers who are competent not only in their content \narea but also in the use of technology. It also encourages partnerships \nthat recruit and train teachers to serve in high-need schools. In \naddition, it supports state-level efforts to improve teacher quality \nthrough State Teacher Quality Enhancement grants, which strengthen \nteacher certification standards and create alternative pathways into \nthe teaching profession.\n  I am also pleased to contribute personally to this legislation in a \nnumber of ways. The bill authorizes a Web-Based Education Commission \nwhich will study the issue of quality control in educational software \nand determine the need for a Federal role in helping parents, students, \nand teachers identify high-quality educational software.\n  With Senator Wellstone and others, I helped expand student-aid \neligibility for distance learning programs so that more non-traditional \nstudents will be able to obtain a college degree. We also worked \ntogether to achieve a $10 million authorization for Learn Anytime \nAnywhere Partnerships, which will provide competitive grants to \npartnerships between schools, community organizations, and other public \nand private institutions to develop innovative distance education \nmodels.\n  Mr. President, this is a good piece of legislation, and I am happy to \nbe a part of it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the \nconference agreement on H.R. 6, the Higher Education Act bill.\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\n  The bill has a number of provisions that will be helpful to my state:\n  It authorizes $300 million in new initiatives to strengthen teacher \ntraining for elementary and secondary.\n  It continues student loans and increases the maximum authorized Pell \ngrant from $4,500 to $5,800 by 2003 to help low-income students get a \ncollege education.\n  It continues federal support for colleges and universities, such as \nscience and engineering programs and graduate fellowships.\n  The opportunity to pursue an education, particularly a college \neducation, has long been a hallmark of American society. In California, \nshifts in the economy make higher education more important than ever. \nService-related jobs, such as those in high tech industries, have \ndisplaced many traditional manufacturing jobs. These new jobs require a \nlevel of knowledge and skill that can for the most part only be gained \nby a college education.\n  California has long been a leader in providing a strong higher \neducation system. The University of California (UC) has nine campuses \nthat serve 132,000 students. Total enrollment at UC is projected to \ngrow by about 36,500 students by fall 2006.\n  The California State University System (CSU) consists of 22 regional \ncampuses with 286,000 students. Enrollment is expected to grow by 31.4 \npercent or 105,809 students by year 2006.\n  Another important element of higher education in California is the \nCalifornia community college system, the largest community college \nsystem in the world. Its 106 campuses provided vocational, academic, \nand community service programs to over 1.5 million students of varying \nages, income levels and educational backgrounds in 1997. Roughly three \nof four public postsecondary students were in enrolled in community \ncolleges. The system is expected to increase by 28.9 percent as its \nattendance is projected to be over 1.8 million by fall 2006.\n  California faces huge challenges in higher education in the coming \nyears:\n  First, enrollment in California's public schools, the college \ngeneration of the future, is growing at three times the national rate. \nEnrollment in the three major segments of higher education will \nincrease by 28.9 percent, or by 549,144 students, between 1996 and \n2006, according to the state's Department of Finance.\n  California will have this surge in college applicants because (1) the \nnumber of high school graduates has increased by 22 percent since 1993; \n(2) many adult workers are changing careers by choice because of \norganization restructuring, or to enhance their employment skills; (3) \nmigration to California from other states and countries is continuing; \nand (4) more Californians over 40 are pursuing lifelong learning.\n  Second, California has 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials and \nwill need up to 300,000 new teachers in the next decade.\n  Third, California has many first generation, bilingual and \n``nontraditional'' students. California State University, for example, \nhas a large number of ``nontraditional'' students, students who are \nolder than the usual college age. This is because many community \ncollege graduates transfer to CSU and many CSU students are working \npeople seeking to progress professionally or maintain technical \nproficiency. Similarly, approximately 41 percent of community college \nstudents are in the 20-29 age group.\n  I am pleased that the House-Senate conferees accepted several \nprovisions that I authored to help students and institutions in my \nstate:\n  First, the 5th year Pell grant: That authorizes the Secretary of \nEducation to award on a case-by-case basis Pell grants for \ndisadvantaged students for the fifth year of teacher education required \nin California to get a teaching credential. This could enable 12,000 \ndisadvantaged students to become teachers in California, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, at a time when we are facing a severe \nteacher shortage and have 21,000 teachers in the classroom on emergency \ncredentials.\n  Second, distance learning: The bill also includes two of my \namendments to the distance learning demonstration (teaching away from \nthe traditional campus via a computer, teleconferencing or other \ntechnologies). The first, clarifies that university ``systems'' (e.g., \nUC system, CSU system) would be eligible and the bill increases the \nnumber of demonstration sites from five to fifteen.\n  Third, school districts with high numbers of limited English \nproficient students: The bill authorizes state grants for innovative \nways to reduce teacher shortages in high poverty areas. At my \nsuggestion, the bill includes as eligible or target areas, school \ndistricts with disproportionate numbers of limited English speaking \nchildren. In California, 1.3 million students have limited English \nproficiency, a tripling since 1986 and at least 87 languages are \nspoken.\n  Fourth, study of few borrowers: The bill provides that schools whose \nstudent loan default rate exceeds 25% for three years will be \nineligible to participate in the student loan program. For schools like \nCalifornia's community colleges, that have just a few borrowers, this \nmethod gives the appearance of having a very high default rate. For \nexample, if the school has only four borrowers but two defaulters, they \nwould have a 50 percent default rate. The manager's amendment includes \nmy suggestion of a study of the effectiveness of this measurement \nmethod by September 30, 1999.\n  Student financial aid is essential to enabling millions of students \nto get a higher education. The California Postsecondary Education \nCommission estimates that 50-55 percent of students at California's \npublic and private institutions are receiving some form of state, \nfederal or institutional financial assistance. Expenses for tuition and \nsupplies at California's postsecondary institutions, public and \nprivate, averaged $19,500 during the 1997-98 school year. Most families \nhave a hard time saving that kind of money.\n  By continuing federal student grant and loan programs, this bill will \ncontinue to open doors to education for many Californians.\n  The higher education bill is a bipartisan and constructive bill that \nwill help our nation provide a college education to millions of \nAmericans. I hope my colleagues and the President to join me in \nenacting this important bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupport of the conference report on the Higher Education Act. This \nbipartisan legislation takes important steps to lower interest rates on \nstudent loans, recruit and train new teachers, and strengthen and \npreserve the federal commitment to reducing the cost of obtaining a \ncollege education. I commend Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for \ntheir good work and cooperation on this bill.\n  The importance of Higher Education Act cannot be understated. In our \nincreasingly sophisticated economy, access to higher education can be \nthe key to a brighter future for many young people. Our federal student \naid programs, including Pell grants, student loans, campus-based aid \nand other programs have helped millions of students afford a college \neducation. Through these programs, we provide $38 billion in financial \nassistance to more than 19.4 million students in postsecondary \neducation institutions.\n  The legislation we are sending to the President improves these \nprograms in a number of important ways. The maximum Pell Grant is \nincreased to $4,500 in 1999, stepping up to $5,800 by 2004. Interest \nrates on student loans are cut from 8.25 percent to 7.46 percent, \nreducing the total cost to students by $11 billion. Borrowers will also \nbe able to consolidate and refinance their loan balances at the new \nrate for four months. In addition, the bill creates a new program to \nprovide help to disadvantaged students to make sure they know about \nhigher education opportunities and are in a position to take advantage \nof them.\n  Other key aspects of this bill are provisions to improve teacher \ntraining and recruitment and to expand professional development \nopportunities for teachers. Grants will be available to develop \npartnerships between teaching colleges and school districts to improve \nteaching skills and integrate technology into the classroom. Support \nwill also be available for partnerships that will recruit and train \nteachers willing to serve in high-need schools. We know that putting \nstudents in a classroom with a well-trained, qualified teacher is one \nof the most effective ways to help them achieve to the best of their \nabilities.\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\n  I am particularly pleased that the new law will expand opportunities \nfor distance learning. This will help many people --especially those in \nrural areas, those with disabilities, and nontraditional students--gain \naccess to programs in which they otherwise might not be able to \nparticipate.\n  The conference report retains a proposal, which I cosponsored, to \nencourage colleges to establish campus-based child care for low-income \nstudents. I also support provisions to help reduce binge-drinking on \ncollege campuses and reduce campus crime levels.\n  Finally, I strongly support the provision creating a new grant \nprogram for Tribal Colleges and Universities. These institutions do a \nremarkable job of creating educational opportunities for Native \nAmericans. They need and deserve federal support. I call on the \nAppropriations Committee to fund these programs so that Native American \nstudents can have access to a higher education to advance their own \nskills and help their communities address the many challenges that \nexist today in Indian country.\n  I also would like to commend the conferees for their efforts to \nmaintain a balance between the Family Federal Education Loan program \nand the Direct Loan program. There is strong evidence that a healthy \ncompetition between these two programs has strengthened both programs \nand ultimately been good for students, and I believe it is important \nthat we work to maintain this balance.\n  I am disappointed about several aspects of this bill. It is \nunfortunate that resources were not available to reduce costs further \nfor students and to extend the period for loan consolidation beyond \nfour months.\n  I am also disappointed that Senator Wellstone's amendment, which \nwould have enabled those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies to attend post-secondary programs for 24 months and meet the \nwork requirement, was not included in the final bill. I believe this \nproposal should be revisited because of the positive impact higher \neducation degrees have been shown to exert on earnings, on access to \nhealth insurance, and on children's achievement levels, and because of \nthe increased flexibility it offers for states. In South Dakota, access \nto higher education is particularly important on the reservations, \nwhere very few low-skill jobs are available. College degrees have \nempowered Native Americans to assume leadership and professional \npositions in their own tribes, and have enabled many to escape the path \nof poverty, lack of education and under-employment that traps too many \nliving on the reservations. I appreciate the conference committee's \nwillingness to give Senator Wellstone's proposal careful consideration, \nand I am hopeful that the awareness raised during this debate will \neventually lead to expanded educational opportunities for low-income \nAmericans struggling to become self-sufficient.\n  Despite these reservations, Mr. President, I believe this is a good \nbill that will continue our efforts to lower the cost barriers to \nhigher education. The Higher Education Act is a vital investment in our \nNation's future. By enacting this legislation, we will help millions of \nyoung people gain skills and develop their talents, and help our Nation \nbuild a strong work force, develop our intellectual capital, and \nnurture the leaders of the next generation. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Higher \nEducation Act Amendments of 1998. By reauthorizing the Higher Education \nAct (HEA) the Senate is making a down-payment on our nation's future.\n  I would begin by saying: it is a simple fact that the future is \nprejudicial in favor of those who can read, write, and do math. A good \neducation is a ticket to the secure economic future of the middle \nclass. As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows ever larger \nalmost no one doubts the link between education and an individual's \nprospects.\n  And that is what the Senate is doing today, improving the post-\nsecondary educational system of our country.\n  What does the bill do in a nutshell? It improves financial aid \nopportunities for students, creates a unified program to promote \nexcellence in the teachers our schools produce, and streamlines HEA by \nconsolidating overlapping programs and eliminating unnecessary \nregulatory requirements.\n  Mr. President, before I make some specific comments about provisions \nin the bill, I would like to first talk about how important the bill is \nfor New Mexico.\n  Approximately 100,000 students are enrolled in New Mexico's public \ncolleges and universities, with about 53,000 students enrolled in \ncommunity colleges and about 47,000 enrolled in universities. However, \nthe number of high school graduates is expected to increase during the \nnext decade and members of the current workforce are also expected to \nseek additional education during that period.\n  Consequently, the state must have a high-quality, low-cost college \neducation available to a growing number of students, regardless of \nincome level, ethnic background or place of residence.\n  Students attending New Mexico institutions received more than $200 \nmillion in financial aid, counting grants and loans from all sources, \nduring the 1995-96 academic year. About 78 percent of that assistance \ncame from federal sources, and during 1995-96, New Mexico students \ncontracted for about $110 million in federal loans.\n  Thus, I believe that educational performance is a crucial element in \nNew Mexico's capacity to prosper in the extremely competitive national \nand international economy.\n  New Mexico's colleges and universities directly and indirectly \ncontribute to the economic vitality of the state, as they produce \ngraduates with considerable intellectual depth and breadth, workers \nwhose skills allow them to meet the demands of their employers, and \nfirst-rate research that helps to expand the boundaries of human \nknowledge.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to turn and make a few comments about \nseveral of the provisions in the bill and especially one that will \nbenefit New Mexico.\n  Title V establishes a new part dedicated solely to supporting the \nneeds of Hispanic Serving Institutions that is authorized at $62.5 \nmillion for fiscal year 1999. The funds may be used for construction or \nmaintenance of instructional facilities, support of faculty exchanges \nand faculty development initiatives, the purchase of books and \nperiodicals, technological and management improvements, and improving \nand expanding graduate and professional opportunities for Hispanic \nstudents.\n  New Mexico has 17 designated Hispanic Serving Institutions that serve \nmore than 23,500 Hispanic students. These school include Albuquerque \nTechnical Vocational Institute, College of Santa Fe, College of \nthe Southwest, Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell, Luna Vocational \nTechnical Institute, New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU), New Mexico \nJunior College, New Mexico State University (NMSU) Las Cruces, NMSU-\nCarlsbad, NMSU-Dona Ana, NMSU-Grants, Northern New Mexico Community \nCollege (NNMCC), Santa Fee Community College, University of New Mexico \n(UNM)-Los Alamos, UNM-Taos Education Center, UNM-Valencia County \nBranch, and Western New Mexico University.\n\n  Title II, entitled Teacher Quality, focuses on improving teacher \nquality and the recruitment of highly qualified. First, the bill seeks \nto improve student achievement, through quality improvement of the \ncurrent and future teaching force by improving the preparation of \nprospective teachers and enhancing professional development activities. \nSecond, the bill seeks to increase the number of students who complete \nhigh-quality teacher preparation programs.\n  Title III or the Institutional Aid Title creates a new grant program \nfor Tribal Colleges and Universities to strengthen services to Native \nAmerican students. I am especially pleased with this new program \nbecause of my longstanding involvement with the issues affecting Native \nAmericans. Tribally-controlled colleges in New Mexico like the \nCrownpoint Institute of Technology, the Institute of American Indian \nArts in Santa Fe, the new Navajo Community College in Shiprock, and the \nSouthwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in Albuquerque could \npotentially benefit.\n  Student financial aid is given a huge boost through several changes. \nFirst,\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\nthe bill increases the maximum Pell Grant levels to the following \namounts: $4,500 for academic year 1999-2000; $4,800 for academic year \n2000-2001; $5,100 for academic year 2001-2002; $5,400 for academic year \n2002-2003 and $5,800 for academic year 2003-2004.\n  The Federal TRIO Programs are given a boost through changes to the \nStudent Assistance section in Title IV. I have always been a strong \nsupporter of TRIO and most pleasing is how much the students, schools, \nand communities of New Mexico will benefit.\n  The 1,900 current TRIO programs provide benefits to 700,000 students \nnationwide. Two-thirds of participating students come from families \nwhere neither parent attended college and whose incomes are below \n$24,000.\n  The Dissemination/Partnership provision would encourage partnerships \nbetween TRIO programs and other community based organizations offering \nprograms or activities serving at-risk students.\n  The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) is stabilized in the \nfollowing way. Student loan rates will be equal to the 91-day-T-bill-\nplus-1.7-percent while students are in school, and plus-2.3-percent \nduring repayment after graduation. The interest amount is capped at \n8.25 percent and for PLUS loans, rates will be the 91-day-T-bill-plus-\n3.1 percent, capped at 9 percent for borrowers and lenders.\n  An innovative loan forgiveness program is also included for teachers. \nUp to $5,000 of a teacher's loans will be forgiven after five years of \nteaching for those choosing to teach in urban or rural school districts \nthat serve large populations of low-income children.\n  Mr. President, in closing I believe we are taking an important step \nforward today by making an investment in our Nation's future with the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \nto H.R. 6, the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. Passage of this \nimportant measure will ensure that access to higher education remains \nattainable for all Americans.\n  The increase in the Pell Grant eligibility included in the bill will \nhelp families and students offset the growing cost of higher education. \nThis successful program has helped ensure that low-income and \ndisadvantaged students have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary \neducation.\n  The bill also includes the continuation of the concept of the State \nStudent Incentive Grants (SSIGs). The new modified program, Leveraging \nEducational Assistance Partnership Program, will continue the \nworthwhile effort of encouraging additional financial opportunities for \nstudents seeking a higher education.\n  The decrease in the student loan interest rate is another effort to \nensure that students and their families are able to obtain a quality \nhigher education. The decrease in the student loan interest rate helps \nstudents reduce the financial burden of higher education. Too often \nstudents are forced to chose between their education and the enormous \nfinancial hardship they must overcome to obtain the education they need \nto improve their lives. The agreement included in the bill helps to \nreduce the financial burden for students and their families.\n  Mr. President, the provisions in the bill relating to teacher \ndevelopment and preparation are important to ensure that we have the \nquantity and quality of teachers needed for the next generation of \nstudents. Across the country the shortage of teachers, particularly in \ncritical subjects such as special education, math and science where \nthere is serious demand, is having an adverse impact on our students. \nHowever, the problem is not just recruiting students to become \nteachers, the problem is making sure that students have the support and \nencouragement once they have chosen this honorable profession. Teacher \ndevelopment and preparation programs are essential if we are to stem \nthe tide of teachers leaving the profession before retirement. Too many \nteachers are leaving to seek employment opportunities outside of the \nteaching profession because administrators and communities are failing \nto provide the support they need. The teacher development and \npreparation programs included in the bill will help to address this \nimportant issue.\n  Ensuring that our teachers obtain the educational background needed \nto achieve academic success must start at higher education \ninstitutions. Colleges and universities should not complain about the \ncaliber of students pursuing higher education, while denying their \neducational degree programs the resources and the support that they \nneed. The caliber of teachers leaving these institutions has a direct \nimpact on the quality of students coming through the front door. The \nprovisions in this bill help to address these concerns.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, \nand Senator Kennedy, the Ranking Member, for their support on resolving \nthe eligibility concerns surrounding the students from the Federated \nAssociated States (FAS). The House, unfortunately, attempted to \nterminate the eligibility of college students from FAS for Pell Grants, \nSupplemental Education Opportunity Grants, and College Work Study. The \nHouse provision would have upset the unique relationship the United \nStates has with the FAS and violated the legal and moral obligation we \nhave with the countries under the U.S. Compact of Free Association with \nthe Republic of Palau and the U.S. Compact of Free Association with the \nFederated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands. It would have been an embarrassment if the U.S. failed to live \nup to its moral obligations in ensuring that FAS citizens were given \nthe educational assistance necessary to become self-governing. The \nagreement worked out in conference ensures continued federal financial \naid eligibility for FAS students and does not preclude the inclusion of \nsuch eligibility in the renegotiation of the Compact with the FAS.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to express my support for \nthis important measure and look forward to its passage. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Higher Education Act of 1998 is a \nstrong, bipartisan bill that deserves the support of all Members of the \nSenate. It renews our commitment to make higher education more \naffordable and more accessible for all qualified students.\n  The House and Senate passed their original versions of the bill \nalmost unanimously, and the conference report preserves most of the \nbest features of both bills. It enhances benefits for students, and \nparticularly for students who want to be teachers. It increases the \nmaximum authorization for Pell grants for the neediest students, and \nexpands the formula for calculating their financial need in order to \nprotect a larger amount of income of working parents and students.\n  The bill also reduces the cost of student loans by almost one \npercentage point. This reduction can make a significant difference for \nstudents who may face a mountain of debt when they graduate. This \nchange will result in savings of $700 on the average debt of $13,000, \nand savings of over $1,000 on a debt of $20,000.\n  I am disappointed, however, that we could not extend this benefit to \nall recent graduates. Under the bill, the rates for consolidation loans \nwill be permanently lowered in both programs from their previous \nstatutory rates. The bill does create a short window for recent \ngraduates to consolidate their existing loans under the Direct Lending \nprogram at the same low rates applicable for new loans. This \nopportunity will be available for another 4 months, in addition to the \n3 month-window already in effect, so students will have a total of 7 \nmonths to consolidate their loans.\n  One of the key features of the bill is improving the training of \nteachers. The legislation supports local partnerships that include \nelementary and secondary schools and colleges, and it also provides \ncompetitive grants to states. This assistance is urgently needed to \nstrengthen teacher training. The bill also provides assistance for \nrecruitment of new teachers, a critical need for many school districts. \nIn addition, it provides loan forgiveness on student loans of up to \n$5,000 for those who teach for five years in high-need\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\nschools. I hope that we can build on this incentive in future years, as \nan important way to encourage more students to become teachers.\n  The bill also includes an early intervention initiative to encourage \nmore middle-school students to understand that college is not out of \nreach. It incorporates ideas from the Administration and from Senator \nJeffords in a new program, ``Gear Up.'' We need to reach out to middle-\nschool children to help them understand that a college education is \nattainable and affordable.\n  The bill also continues the program of Graduate Assistance in Areas \nof National Need, as a critical investment in graduate education. I am \nparticularly pleased that the conference report preserves the portable \nJavits Fellowships for talented students in the arts, humanities, and \nsocial sciences.\n  The bill contains a new program based on initiatives sponsored by \nCongresswoman Meek in the House and by myself in the Senate to \nencourage a higher quality of college teaching for students with \ndisabilities. In recent years, it has become possible for many more \nstudents with disabilities to achieve the dream of a college education, \nand we need to do more to ensure that faculty members have the \nexperience to teach them. This bill reaches out to all colleges and \nuniversities, and can include training for graduate teaching \nassistants--the faculty of the future.\n  The bill also expands federal aid for learning through distance \neducation. Distance learning can open the doors of higher education to \nmany students who cannot attend classes on college campuses because \nthey live in remote areas, or because of their job and family \nresponsibilities. The Department of Education will monitor the \ninstitutions participating in the distance program, and report to \nCongress on the results. Our goal is to ensure that distance education \nis of the same high quality as traditional education.\n  The bill also helps improve the delivery of federal financial aid, by \ncreating a Performance Based Organization in the Department of \nEducation. Its goal is to streamline and improve the financial aid \nfunctions of the Department, and give it more flexibility to deal with \nmany aspects of federal aid. A principal goal of the PBO is to improve \nservices for students, and the bill creates a new position called the \nStudent Loan Ombudsman, which student groups have urged.\n  The bill also encourages improvements by guaranty agencies, by \nenabling them to enter into voluntary, flexible agreements with the \nSecretary of Education. Under these agreements, the agencies can do \nmore to prevent defaults, instead of collecting from students after \nthey have defaulted on loans. These voluntary flexible agreements will \nencourage the agencies to be more business-like and responsive to \nstudents.\n  This bill sets the stage for future reforms in student loans. The \ncontroversy about what level to set interest rates on these loans makes \nclear that Congress should stop setting the rates for banks. The best \nsolution is to accept a market-based system for student loans, and let \ncompetition set the rates for lenders.\n  Many Members on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses are \ninterested in this fundamental change, and I am pleased that the bill \ncalls for a study of competitive mechanisms for the loans. This study \nwill help Congress make thoughtful changes in a system that is now far \ntoo costly and inefficient.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report does not contain the \namendment to the welfare reform act proposed by Senator Wellstone and \npassed by the Senate. Senator Wellstone's amendment would help welfare \nrecipients attend college for two years. We have heard from many \nstudents who have been forced to abandon their pursuit of college \neducation because of the harsh provisions of the welfare reform law. \nSenator Wellstone's amendment is well-designed to reduce this serious \nproblem, and it deserves to be enacted.\n  Overall, the numerous positive changes in this legislation will \nstrengthen higher education. I commend the constructive bipartisan \nspirit that has brought us to this point. It is fitting to enact this \nlegislation at the beginning of the academic year, and I look forward \nto its adoption and its successful implementation.\n  Mr. President, on the teacher training provisions of this Act, which \nour friend and colleague, Senator Reed, is so very interested in, one \nof the new features is a loan forgiveness program--$5,000 for a teacher \nwho teaches for 5 years. This is a very modest forgiveness, but it \nreally builds on the old National Health Service Corps which provided \nloan forgiveness for doctors to go into underserved areas. The \nforgiveness program was an important incentive and was really very, \nvery important and has been effective. We hope this program will be as \nwell.\n  Also, I want to mention the new program that builds on some \ninitiatives of Senator Jeffords and the TRIO Program, which targets \nmiddle school classes to move the whole class toward continuing \neducation. This has worked in different parts of the country. Now we \nhave a program to encourage other schools to do that.\n  If any one of us goes to any school in this country, in an elementary \nand secondary class, and asks children, even in the most underserved \npart of our Nation, how many want to go to college, before you even get \nthe words out of your mouth, every hand goes up. They get discouraged \nin later years. If they know they have the opportunity to continue \ntheir education if they apply themselves to their studies, it can have \na dramatic impact in reducing dropouts and also antisocial behavior. \nThis is a modest program, but it is very important.\n  I want to also mention, Mr. President, that this bill sets the stage \nfor future reforms in student loans. The controversy over what level to \nset interest rates on these loans makes clear that Congress should stop \nsetting the rates for banks. The best solution is to accept a market-\nbased system for student loans and let competition set the rate for the \nlenders. We believe in competition. This is a good area in which to try \nit. We have many examples in different public policy areas of where \nauctions work. There is an excellent initiative in the House of \nRepresentatives by Republican Congressman Petri to try an auction-based \nsystem. I am very hopeful we can find a bipartisan effort in this area \nto find the savings and return them to the students. It makes sense. \nThat is a way we should proceed. We have a study of that program in \nthis conference report.\n  Finally, I agree with my other colleagues. I am disappointed the \nconference did not accept what I think is the superb amendment of \nSenator Wellstone, which was adopted in this body, about continuing \neducation and how this dovetails with the welfare reform program. \nSenator Wellstone will be over here to speak to that issue later on. I \nregret he was not successful, and I will certainly support his efforts \nlater on to try to implement that program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on the Labor \nCommittee for their skillful work on this bill. Senator Jeffords worked \nhard to accommodate all the concerns of all the members of the \nCommittee, and kept the interests of students firmly in mind. Senator \nCoats and Senator Dodd likewise contributed to the bipartisan spirit.\n  I also thank the following:\n  On Senator Jefford's staff, Susan Hattan, Jenny Smulson, Scott Giles, \nCory Heyman, and Pam Moran.\n  From Senator Coats' staff, Townsend Lange.\n  From Senator Dodd's staff, Suzanne Day and Megan Murray.\n  From my own office, Marianna Pierce, Jane Oates, and former fellows \nGloria Corral, Jennifer Kron, Maria McGarrity, and Eileen O'Leary.\n  I also thank Debb Kalcevik from CBO; Margot Schenet, Jim Stedman, and \nBarbara Miles from CRS; and Mark Sigurski from the office of \nlegislative counsel.\n  They have all done an excellent job, and deserve a large share of the \ncredit for this achievement.\n  Mr. President, I want to single out, in particular, Marianna Pierce \nwho is my chief of staff in the area of education. The members of the \nstaff performed absolutely superbly and have played an indispensable \nrole in helping all of us reach this point. I am enormously grateful to \nher and the other staff.\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to say again that this bill \npreserves the focus on students, who are the primary reason we have a \nHigher Education Act in the first place. Students now in school will be \nassured of receiving the lowest interest rate on their loans in nearly \ntwo decades.\n  Students now in high school who aspire to a college education will \nbenefit from an expanded early intervention program known as Gear Up, \nas well as continuing to receive services from the time-tested and \nhighly regarded TRIO programs. The new Gear Up Program combines \nfeatures of the existing National Early Intervention Scholarship \nProgram, which I sponsored in 1992, with recommendations proposed by \nthe administration and included in the House bill.\n  The Gear Up Program preserves the best features of the program now \noperating successfully in nine States while expanding the pool of \nparticipants and approaches involved in early intervention.\n  Students who have graduated and are faced with exceptionally high \nloan burdens will be able to take advantage of extended repayment \noptions under the Guaranteed Loan Program. In addition, the measure \nprovides a 4-month window within which borrowers now in repayment may \nrefinance their loans through either the Federal Direct Loan Program or \nthe Federal Family Education Loan Program.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Senator Coats is on his way. Let me, in \nthe interim, mention that education, as we know now, is a top interest \nin poll after poll of Americans. They want to see their educational \nsystem reformed in a way that can lead them into a position where this \nNation has the best educational system in the world. Unfortunately, \nthat is not the case right now. But we are taking a huge step forward \nwith the higher education bill, not just in that matter which affects \nthe students in higher education, but also the second title of the bill \nwhich deals with reforming teacher preparation.\n  Nothing is going to change in the classroom until the teacher \nchanges, and the teacher isn't going to change until the teacher knows \nwhat he or she has to do in order to make our system better.\n  As we move into the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization next year, we want to make sure that the universities \nare aware that they have a role to play in ensuring that every new \nteacher who comes into the system is ready for the changes which are \nnecessary to make our educational system the best in the world.\n  I look forward, as we move forward into next year, to continuing the \neffort that our committee has taken to make this Nation's educational \nsystem the best in the world. I am confident we can do that.\n  But right now we do know we have much left to do. But hopefully \nworking first with those who are teaching the teachers, we can make \nsure that we stop the flow in of young people who want to teach but do \nnot have an adequate education at the universities and colleges that \nthey should have in this day and age.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am happy to rise today to speak in \nsupport of the conference report for the Higher Education Act \nAmendments of 1998. This higher education bill has been two years in \nthe making and I know I join the rest of my colleagues in the Labor \nCommittee, and in the Senate, in full support of this very important \nlegislation.\n  This bill represents a strong bipartisan consensus in the Congress to \nensure that students maintain access to post-secondary education \nthrough vital student opportunity programs, such as TRIO; healthy, \nstable, and streamlined loan programs; and a simplified student aid \nprocess. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to this \nimportant bill.\n  This conference report, like the underlying Senate bill, was \ndeveloped with several fundamental principles. Our first, and most \nimportant theme, was to maintain the primary focus of the Higher \nEducation Act since its inception in 1965--to ensure that students have \naccess and opportunity to purse higher education.\n  One of the most important elements of this bill aimed at ensuring \nstudent access and opportunity is the new, low interest rate for \nstudent loans. This legislation sets a student loan repayment interest \nrate of 7.43 percent which represents a significant reduction in the \ninterest rate for students. The interest rate that was scheduled to \ntake effect on July 1, 1998 would have destabilized the successful \nFederal Family Loan Program by causing thousands of lenders to stop \nmaking student loans, resulting in high numbers of students without \nstudent loans for this school year. The interest rate included in this \nconference report provides a significant reduction to students while \nmaintaining the long-term viability of the student loan programs and \nensuring that students will continue to have access to private loans at \nthe lowest interest rate in 17 years. Depending on the size of their \nloan, this low interest rate will save students hundreds, even \nthousands, of dollars over the course of the loan.\n  The conference report also offers students a low interest rate for \nconsolidation loans.\n  This conference report strengthens the major student opportunity \nprograms in the act by focusing much needed attention and resources on \nthese vital programs, with particular attention to the needs of low-\nincome students. This conference report reauthorizes the Pell Grant \nProgram at its highest level ever, with maximum grant awards at $4,500 \nin the 1999-2000 school year and increasing to $5,800 in the 2003-2004 \nacademic year. This bill also makes needed reforms to the TRIO program, \nwhich helps disadvantaged children prepare for college, and increases \nits authorization to $700 million.\n  The vital work-study programs are also continued and expanded in this \nconference report. The authorization for the College Work-Study Program \nis increased to $1 billion for fiscal year 1999 from the current \nfunding level of $830 million.\n  The need analysis formula is also revised to ensure that the growing \npercentage of independents students will be able to retain a greater \nportion of their income.\n  Another critical principle for these amendments was the improvement \nand modernization of the student aid delivery system. This legislation \ncreates a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) within the Department of \nEducation aimed at providing quality service to students and parents. \nThe utilization of this PBO which will incorporate the best and most \nsuccessful practices in the private financial sector, coupled with \nother reforms aimed at streamlining the student aid regulatory \nrequirements will result in a better managed and higher quality federal \nstudent aid system.\n  In addition to the development of the PBO, this bill includes \nsignificant reforms to the Federal Family Education Loan Program \n(FFELP), and specifically to guaranty agencies. This bill restructures \nthe guaranty agency system to ensure that these important participants \nin the private loan program are given the flexibility they need to help \nstudents avoid defaulting on their loans while operating in a more cost \neffective and efficient manner which will benefit taxpayers as well as \nstudents and their families.\n  A third principle which guided these amendments was the need for \nmuch-needed reform of teacher preparation programs. I am very pleased \nthat this bill includes a new initiative for teacher training and \nprofessional development aimed at addressing the shortage of qualified \nteachers in this country which replaces the existing teacher \npreparation programs with a single authorization for three separate \ngrant programs.\n  This initiative encourages state level reforms intended to produce \nwell trained and highly competent teachers, local level partnerships \nintended to improve under-performing teacher education programs, and \nprovides a separate grant for States and partnerships to compete for \nfunds specifically targeted toward teacher recruitment.\n  States will compete to receive 45 percent of these teacher training \ndollars and can use the grants to strengthen their teacher \ncertification requirements, create or expand alternative\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\ncertification programs to attract highly qualified people from other \noccupations to the teaching profession, to decrease the shortage of \nhighly qualified teachers in high need areas, or to develop programs \nwhich reward excellent teachers and remove unqualified teachers.\n  Partnerships will compete for 45 percent of the funds as well, while \n10 percent of the funds is reserved for recruitment grants.\n  This reauthorization was also guided by a strong desire to promote \ncollege cost-cutting measures, utilizing some of the recommendations of \nthe Commission on the Cost of Higher Education which presented its \nfindings earlier this year. This legislation includes initiatives to \nensure that parents and students are kept apprised of college costs and \nprovide with comparative data to keep colleges accountable and higher \neducation affordable; burdensome federal regulations are reduced; and \nthe national role in encouraging affordable higher education is \nstrengthened.\n  This bill also streamlines and consolidates the many programs and \nactivities which are found in the Higher Education Act. This act has \nbecome increasingly complex over the years and these amendments make \ngreat strides in simplifying the act and better targeting its programs \nand activities.\n  It has been a pleasure to be part of the development of this critical \nlegislation. I have found the bipartisanship displayed throughout this \nprocess encouraging and I would like to thank the staff who have worked \non this important legislation for the last two years: on Senator \nJefford's staff, Susan Hattan, Jenny Smulson, Scott Giles, Cory Heyman, \nand Pam Moran have done excellent work on this bill. In addition, \nMarianna Pierce with Senator Kennedy and Suzanne Day with Senator Dodd \nhave worked diligently to ensure that this bill represents a strong \nbipartisan consensus. Thank you all so much for your long hours and \nexcellent work.\n  Again, I am pleased to have been a part of crafting this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n      study of market mechanisms in federal student loan programs\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to call attention to a study of market \nmechanisms in federal student loan programs, Section 801 of the \nconference report. I was pleased to see this issue addressed in the \ncontext of the Higher Education Act. As you know, Chairman Jeffords, \nour fiscal year 1999 Senate budget resolution raised concerns about the \nfederal government setting interest rates for student loans and \nencouraged your Committee to look for a long term solution to the \ndifficult problem of Congress setting these rates. I believe this study \nis a good first step and hopefully will give a good data on which to \naccess where we go after the newly adopted student and lender rates \nsunset in 2003.\n  One matter I wish to clarify with the Chairman is the participation \nof the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in this study. CBO is a \ncritical non-partisan analytical body on which we in Congress rely. By \nlaw they can not recommend specific policies or endorse the policy \nrecommendations of others. I would assume then that the purpose for \nwhich you seek CBO's participation in the study for their expertise on \nstudent loans, and in general, study design and analysis.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is my understanding that the Budget Committee has \nasked CBO to conduct a broader-based study on student loan interest \nrates, subsidies, and the larger student aid program. I expect that \nstudy to be a valuable as well, and it is my view that the knowledge \ngained through this work could be of great benefit to the Department of \nEducation and the Comptroller General as they undertake their own \nstudy. The role of CBO in the study contained in the conference \nagreement is to assist the other participants ask the right kinds of \nquestions, use valid research and analytical tools, analyze the \nvalidity of the study's design or conclusions, where objective analysis \ncan be brought to bear, and be an overall, non-partisan, resource for \nparticipants in the study.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Chairman's clarification. The study \nlanguage makes reference to additional or dissenting views. Is it the \nintent of the Committee that all members of the study group, including \nCBO, shall have the opportunity to express independent concurring or \ndissenting views within the context of the preliminary as well as final \nreport to Congress.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in closing, I am extremely pleased that \nthe Senate with this vote, will have completed action on the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.\n  The scope of the Higher Education Act is so broad that the \nreauthorization of all the programs it covers is necessarily a \ndemanding and time-consuming task. Bringing this process to a \nconclusion would not have been possible without the concerted efforts \nof members of both parties in both the House and the Senate.\n  I express my particular gratitude to the members of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee and their staffs, who have pulled together \nover the past 18 months to help shape a bill which will help ensure \nthat our nation remains a leader in educational excellence for all of \nour citizens.\n  Each and every member of the committee made a positive contribution \nto the development and refinement of this measure. I very much value \nthe time, effort, and commitment they have brought to this task.\n  I also extend my sincerest thanks to the many staff people who \ncontributed to this product.\n  I particularly recognize the efforts of Marianna Pierce and Jane \nOates with Senator Kennedy, Townsend Lange with Senator Coats, and \nSuzanne Day and Megan Murray with Senator Dodd. These individuals--\nalong with my own staff members, Scott Giles, Susan Hattan, Cory \nHeyman, Pamela Moran, and Jenny Smulson--went ``above and beyond'' in \nterms of their diligent work on each and every aspect of this measure. \nI would also like to acknowledge the work of Heidi Scheuerman, Carolyn \nDupree, and Leah Booth of my staff--who brought a semblance of control \nto the vast quantities of paper produced throughout this process.\n  I also recognize and thank the staff of other members of the \ncommittee--all of whom have shown great dedication to this cause:\n  Jackie Cooney with Senator Gregg;\n  Lori Meyer with Senator Frist;\n  John Connelly with Senator DeWine;\n  Chad Calvert with Senator Enzi;\n  Jenny Saunders and Rhett Butler with Senator Hutchinson;\n  Julian Haynes with Senator Collins;\n  Angie Stewart and Chas Phillips with Senator Warner;\n  Robin Bowen and Holly Hacker with Senator McConnell;\n  Bev Schroeder with Senator Harkin;\n  Deborah Connelly with Senator Mikulski;\n  Alexander Russo and Rena Subotnik with Senator Bingaman;\n  Roger Wolfson and Robin Burkhe with Senator Wellstone;\n  Mike Egan with Senator Murray; and\n  Elyse Wasch with Senator Reed.\n  I want to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance offered by Debb \nKalcevic, Robin Seiler, Josh O'Hara, and Justin Latus with the \nCongressional Budget Office, Mark Sigurski with Senate Legislative \nCounsel, and Margot Schenet, Jim Stedman, and Barbara Miles, with the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  This process has been a collaborative and bipartisan one every step \nof the way. It has produced a measure of which we can all be proud.\n  Mr. President, I have no other requests for time. I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11069-7", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11080-S11084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4103, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4103), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House Proceedings of the \nRecord of September 25, 1998.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time for debate on this conference report is \nlimited to 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas wants 2 \nminutes. Please inform when I have used 3 minutes.\n  It is my privilege to present to the Senate this fiscal year 1999 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act. I am especially pleased to \npresent the bill with the full bipartisan support of the conferees on \nthe bill and in partnership with my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  Unlike the previous 3 years, the bill before the Senate matches the \nbudget request levels sought by the President for 1999. Pursuant to the \nbipartisan budget agreement reached last year, we live within the \nbudget authority and outlay limits on defense spending.\n  It is my judgment, though, that the levels set last year do not \nadequately fund readiness, quality of life, modernization, and the \nneeds of our Armed Forces. I will be speaking more on that today.\n  The conference report before the Senate places a clear premium on \nmeeting the personnel and readiness needs of the military. The bill \nprovides the 3.6-percent pay increase for all uniformed personnel. The \nbill also increases funding for urgent operation and maintenance \nrequirements for the military services.\n  The conferees on the bill also worked to address the top \nmodernization priorities established by the service chiefs. The \nconferees did not solve funding challenges presented by the budget caps \nby taking large general reductions to procurement and research \naccounts.\n  Tough decisions were made on each program. Very few programs, Mr. \nPresident, were funded at the full House or Senate level. Where there \nwas a difference, we sought to find a compromise between the House and \nSenate spending accounts.\n  One very important provision of the bill was offered in the Senate by \nSenator Roberts. That is on the prospect of deploying U.S. troops to \nKosovo. Following consultations with Secretary Cohen and the Joint \nChiefs Chairman General Shelton, the conferees modified the provision \nto focus attention on any additional deployment of U.S. troops to \nYugoslavia--which does include Kosovo--Albania and Macedonia.\n  This reporting requirement, related to the introduction of ground \ntroop units, does not apply forces introduced in accordance with U.N. \nSecurity Council 795 or other circumstances determined by the President \nto be an emergency necessitating the immediate deployment of forces.\n  In addition, the conferees added language making clear nothing in \nthis section shall be deemed to restrict the authority of the President \nunder the Constitution to protect the lives of U.S. citizens.\n  I again commend Senator Roberts for this initiative and believe the \nmodifications included in the bill are consistent with past \nrequirements enacted concerning the deployment of U.S. forces in this \nregion. It will be very important in connection with any potential \ndeployment to Kosovo.\n  As I noted earlier, there is not enough money for defense in this \nbill, Mr. President. We recently received a letter from the President \nidentifying the need for additional funds for 1999. The Armed Services \nCommittee today is hearing testimony on this issue from the service \nchiefs.\n  It is my intention to recommend to the Senate that additional funds \nbe provided in the emergency supplemental bill for readiness, \ncounterterrorism, the war on drugs, and intelligence needs.\n  Our committee will work with the Secretary of Defense and the Joint \nChiefs to ensure we meet the needs they present to Congress.\n  Mr. President, let me close by recognizing the excellent work \nundertaken by our colleagues in the House, Chairman Bill Young and \nRepresentative Jack Murtha.\n  The four of us have been handling these defense bills for several \nyears now, and it is truly a pleasure to work with them each year on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you.\n  I thank the chairman for the outstanding work he has done on this \nbill. I will support the legislation. I think it is a commitment to our \nNation's defense. The Senator from Alaska always does a good job on all \nthe appropriations bills, but particularly this defense appropriations \nbill.\n  I am glad for several projects that I think are critical to our \nNation's defense but are also critical to the State of Arkansas, \nincluding the MLRS system, manufactured in Camden, AR, Fort Chaffee in \nFt. Smith, AR, the Pine Bluff Arsenal, and C-130s in Jacksonville.\n  I will vote for the bill. I do so with a deep reservation. I am \npuzzled, discouraged and disheartened by the exclusion of an amendment \nthat passed unanimously in the Senate by a vote of 99-0 --it passed the \nHouse of Representatives on separate votes of 415-1 and 366-54--which \nwould have condemned China's policy of forced abortions and religious \npersecution and would have denied visas to the perpetrators.\n  I am just puzzled, and I am discouraged that an amendment that had \nsuch bipartisan support, that has no cost and no controversy, would \nhave been dropped in conference.\n  Yesterday, President Jiang Zemin in China, according to the \nWashington Post today, issued a strident defense of the Tiananmen \nmassacre in which hundreds--thousands of students were slain. At the \nvery time that the President of China is defending that horrendous \naction, this body cannot lift even a timid voice in condemnation of \nit--even a mild rebuke of those abuses. I am appalled and I find it \ninexplicable that we remain silent and that the conference would have \ndetermined to drop this amendment that had such support in both bodies.\n  So while I vote for this conference report, I do so with a deep \nreservation and with the caveat that this Senator will use his breath, \nso long as he has the opportunity in the Senate, to continue to raise \nthe issues of human rights abuses in China and to offer these kinds of \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time of the Senator from Alaska has \nbeen used.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of this \nconference agreement. Chairman Stevens has once again done an \nextraordinary job in moving this bill forward while protecting the \ninterests of the Senate, and supporting our Nation's defense.\n  Quite often when we talk about defense we highlight the investment \nitems such as tanks and missiles and ships and fighting aircraft. Mr. \nPresident, while these are all important, and in fact critical to \nensuring a strong defense, whenever you meet commanders in the field, \neach one will tell you that the most important element of our defense \nis the men and women who are willing to serve us.\n  There are 1,396,000 men and women in the Active Forces and another \n877,000 in our National Guard and Reserve. This represents less than 1 \npercent of our population. And they are the ones who are willing to \nsacrifice everything to stand in harm's way to defend all the rest of \nus.\n  Mr. President, we should be very grateful for their willingness to \nserve and, most important, we should demonstrate our gratitude by \nensuring that they receive adequate compensation, good housing and \nquality medical care.\n  In this bill, we have made some progress on each of these fronts.\n  First, the bill provides for a 3.6 percent pay raise, one-half \npercent higher than requested by the administration.\n  Second, the conferees have added $505 million to cover real property \nmaintenance needs for barracks and housing for our military personnel \nand their families.\n  Third, the bill has added $500 million for supporting our bases to \nmake sure that there is enough money to adequately operate the bases.\n  Finally, we have fully funded the Defense Health Program.\n  Mr. President, many of us have a real concern that our military no \nlonger believes that we are doing enough to respond to their needs.\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\n  Last May, our chairman led a delegation to the Persian Gulf. It was \nvery clear from the men and women with whom we spoke that there is \ngrowing dissatisfaction in our military with their working and living \nconditions, and pay.\n  We have tried to address these within the funding constraints that we \nface, but we believe more needs to be done.\n  We know we do not have all the answers on the best approach to fix \nthis problem.\n  Therefore, the conferees have directed the Defense Department to \nreview all aspects of its compensation package, from recruiting \nincentives to retirement, including all quality of life programs.\n  It is the intent of the managers that the Defense Department conduct \nthis review in the next 3 months and provide the Congress with its \nrecommendations in conjunction with its budget submission for fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  Mr. President, this is a good package. The bill provides more money \nin title II for operation and maintenance than was requested by the \nPresident. It does a great deal to help our men and women in uniform, \nnot as much as we would like, but more than DOD requested.\n  Considering the tough financial climate that we are living in, I must \ncommend our chairman for forging this agreement and thank his staff too \nfor their great assistance.\n  Mr. President, this is a good package, I recommend it to all of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I understand there is some concern regarding section \n8115 in this conference report. It was my understanding that the \nprovision regarded the deployment of additional ground troops to \nYugoslavia, Albania, and Macedonia. We hope that those responsible for \ninterpreting this legislation will understand this when they respond to \nthis provision.\n  Mr. President, before I close, may I add my commendation to the \nextraordinary work of our staff, led by Steve Cortese and Charlie Houy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join Senator Inouye in commending our \nstaff and all those who worked on this bill, and particularly Senator \nRoberts, for his very significant amendment to this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I strongly support H.R. 4103, the \nDefense appropriations conference report for fiscal year 1999. The \npending provides $250.5 billion in total budget authority and $168.1 \nbillion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related \nactivities. When outlays from prior years and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, outlays total $245.1 billion.\n  There are some major elements to this bill that are important for the \nSenate to review.\n  The bill is consistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement.\n  It funds a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel, rather than \nthe 3.1 percent requested by the administration.\n  It contains quality-of-life enhancements for our Armed Forces, which \ntotal $455 million more than was requested.\n  I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to \ncomplement the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his very \nskillful handling of this important legislation and for his \nstatesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling issues in this \nyear's defense budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Senate Budget Committee \ntable displaying the budget impact of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                H.R. 4103, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 1999, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   (Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Defense   Nondefense  Crime  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget authority........................................    250,282       27     .....      202      250,511\n    Outlays.................................................    244,876       27     .....      202      245,105\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority........................................    250,324       27     .....      202      250,553\n    Outlays.................................................    244,877       27     .....      202      245,106\n1998 level:\n    Budget authority........................................    247,340       27     .....      197      247,564\n    Outlays.................................................    247,130       31     .....      197      247,358\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority........................................    250,770       27     .....      202      250,999\n    Outlays.................................................    246,493       27     .....      202      246,722\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority........................................    250,499       27     .....      202      250,728\n    Outlays.................................................    245,408       27     .....      202      245,637\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority........................................    250,290       27     .....      202      250,519\n    Outlays.................................................    244,938       27     .....      202      245,167\nConference Report Compared To:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority....................................        -42  ..........  .....  .........        -42\n        Outlays.............................................         -1  ..........  .....  .........         -1\n    1998 level:\n        Budget authority....................................      2,942  ..........  .....        5        2,947\n        Outlays.............................................     -2,254       -4     .....        5       -2,253\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority....................................       -488  ..........  .....  .........       -488\n        Outlays.............................................     -1,617  ..........  .....  .........     -1,617\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority....................................       -217  ..........  .....  .........       -217\n        Outlays.............................................       -532  ..........  .....  .........       -532\n    Senate-passed bill:\n      Budget authority......................................         -8  ..........  .....  .........         -8\n      Outlays...............................................        -62  ..........  .....  .........        -62\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

I want to commend the managers of the \nbill, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, for their thoughtful work. I \nparticularly want to thank the managers for their inclusion of a \nrequirement in the conference report for a Department of Defense report \non the troublesome security situation in the Taiwan Strait. I know that \nboth Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye share my concern about \nstability in the Taiwan Strait.\n  This report, requested on or before February 1, 1999, is very timely. \nThe twentieth anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act is in April 1999. \nDoes the senior Senator from Alaska agree that one of the principal \npurposes of this study should be to compare the security situation as \nit exists now in 1998 with that which existed in 1979, when Congress \noriginally enacted the Taiwan Relations Act, P.L. 96-8?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President. My colleague from Alaska is correct. The \nCommittee believes that it is important for Congress to be fully and \ncurrently informed on the military balance in the tense Taiwan Strait, \nas Congress directed in the Taiwan Relations Act. The Committee expects \nthe report to detail recent additions to the offensive military \ncapabilities of the People's Republic of China, as well as new \nchallenges to the deterrent forces of the Republic of China on Taiwan. \nThis report should carefully examine the balance as it exists today, as \nit may exist in the future, given expected procurement programs, as \nwell as comparing the balance with the situation that existed in 1979, \nwhen Congress adopted the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I would like to thank my friend from \nAlaska. I also wanted to note that it is important that the report \nprovide a comprehensive analysis of the security balance in the Taiwan \nStrait. In addition to the traditional force-on-force analysis, I \nunderstand that it is the conferees intent that the report evaluate the \ncapability of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to conduct command and \ncontrol warfare against Taiwan, including the PLA's capability for \ninformation dominance, air superiority, naval blockage, and amphibious \ninvasion. This is an area that has not received enough attention in \nterms of evaluating Taiwan's defensive capabilities.\n  It is also my understanding that the conferees intend that this \nreport evaluate the degree to which the PLA's modernization programs in \nthe areas of submarine development, ballistic and cruise missile \ndevelopment, special operation forces, electronic warfare and computer \nvirus attack capabilities have altered, or may in the future alter, the \nsecurity and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. I would like to add my expression of \nsupport in this area to that articulated by the junior Senator from \nAlaska. I was pleased to work with my colleagues in the conference \ncommittee to shape this important provision. I look forward to \nreviewing this report from the Department of Defense early next year. \nI, too, believe that it is particularly important to focus on the \nqualitative balance now in 1998 as compared to that which existed in \n1979, when Congress enacted the Taiwan Relations Act, with its Section \n3 provisions regarding continued military sales to the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the Chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  The Conference Report accompanying H.R. 4013, the Fiscal Year 1999 \nDefense Appropriations bill, includes a funding level of $28 million \nspecifically for making upgrades to the radars which will support the \nNavy Theater\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\nWide missile defense system, through a competitive process. The Senate \nhas a long history of supporting this effort by providing funding above \nthe amount requested by the Administration. I concur fully with these \nadditions.\n  The Navy Theater Wide program is an integral part of the overall \narchitecture of missile defense which is being developed and built by \nour country today. However, in order to field a Navy Theater Wide \nsystem that will be available on the schedule that the Navy is \npursuing, we must increase our efforts in the area of radar \ndevelopment. To date, the preponderance of the funds expended for the \nNavy Theater Wide program have gone toward development of the missile \nand the kill vehicle. While these are necessary elements of the Navy \nTheater Wide system, without the upgraded sensors to operate with them, \nthe overall system will be less than fully capable. With the addition \nof the $28 million in this bill we are just beginning to make up for \nlost time. I wish we could have provided even more funds. However, I \nencourage the Navy and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to \ncommence a vigorous effort to develop a radar system that will meet the \nstringent requirements of the Navy Theater Wide program. I believe the \nsame radar system should also be compatible with meeting other fleet \nrequirements, such as improving its ability to defeat cruise missiles.\n  Do you agree with my assessment of the situation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. He makes some very \nimportant and timely points. I, too, have been very supportive of the \nNavy Theater Wide program and will work closely with him to ensure that \nthe entire system, including the radar, is developed on schedule. I \nfully support the conference's decision to provide $28 million for \nRadar Improvements Competition in Fiscal Year 1999 and I encourage the \nNavy to factor the radar development into their overall plan for Navy \nTheater Wide development and fielding.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his remarks. I \napplaud his efforts as Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee on this \nissue and for his dedication to our armed forces. I thank the chair and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nagain thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their efforts and \nleadership in putting the Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense \nAppropriations Conference Report together. I would also like to thank \nmy colleagues for their continued support of photonics research and \ntheir leadership in providing continued funding for one of our most \ncritical technologies. The vital nature of this photonics effort has \nbeen highlighted in recent Critical Technologies Reports to Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify one point in the Conference \nReport before us, and to confirm the legislative intent of the \nCommittee. I would like to ask the senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, and the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, if the $2.5 \nmillion provided for photonics research in the RDT/Army section was \nintended to be provided to the Photonics Research Center which was \nfunded in the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense Appropriations Bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first I would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and say that I am well aware of the critical role \nphotonics is playing in our national security. I concur that the \nfunding in question was intended to go to the Photonics Research Center \nthat was funded in the FY 1996 DOD Appropriations Bill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I, too, would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his remarks. I have also supported funding for \nphotonics research in the past. In the future, most of our weapons \nsystems will depend on photonics for their effectiveness. If we are to \nmaintain our competitive advantage, we must maintain an advantage in \nphotonics research. I would also agree with the Senator from Alaska and \nhis explanation of our Committee's legislative intent in providing \nadditional funding for the Photonics Research Center.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would again like to thank my colleagues for their \nleadership on this vital technology and for clarifying the \ncongressional intent of this funding.\n\n\n            advanced materials intelligent processing center\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a short \ncolloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the conference report included $3 \nmillion in the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Navy account \nof your Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations bill for \ncontinued funding of the Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing \nCenter in Evanston, Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I greatly appreciate the \nsupport that the subcommittee provides for this project. I would like \nto confirm that the intent of the conferees was to provide this \nadditional $3 million to continue the activities of the Center in \naffiliation with the Naval Air Warfare Center in Lexington Park, \nMaryland, as well as other industrial and governmental partners. This \ncontinuation funding will allow the Center first to complete a state-\nof-the-art resin transfer molding system with all required equipment \nfunctionality, monitoring, and intelligent supervisory control, and \nthen to transfer it to the Center's industrial and governmental \npartners for prove out in a production environment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the senior Senator from Illinois for her \ninterest in this matter. I would like to confirm that the intent of our \ncommittee's action was as she stated.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \nclarification on this matter, and for his assistance on this project. I \nalso thank Senator Inouye of the subcommittee for his support of this \nproject. I would also like to say to my colleagues that I am confident \nthe work of the Center can help reduce the cost of our defense systems \nthrough the use of faster, cheaper, and better means of processing \ncomposite materials for military hardware. These improvements will \nprovide substantial dividends to the American people.\n\n\n                 cost reduction proposal for terfenol-d\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am delighted to respond to questions from the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, I commend the chairman for all \nhis hard work on this very complex and extremely important bill.\n  One project that is of continuing interest to me is the cost \nreduction proposal for Terfenol-D, the smart alloy used in Navy \nadvanced sonar systems. These essential cost reductions will enable \nsignificant cost and operational effectiveness enhancements of U.S. \nNavy surface ship, submarine and torpedo undersea warfighting \ncapability. Furthermore, this program is essential if the U.S. Navy is \nto have a competitive advantage and not be at a disadvantage compared \nto the Chinese, Japanese and Russians as they invest in TERFENOL-D \nmanufacturing technology advancements.\n  As the chairman recalls, funding for this important project was \nincluded in the FY 98 Defense Appropriations bill only to be line item \nvetoed by the President. Due to the importance of the project, funds \nwere included again in the FY 99 bill. However, because of the \nconfusion caused by the line-item veto and the subsequent opinion by \nthe Supreme Court, I would like to clarify with you that the full $3.0 \nmillion appropriated by the Congress in FY 98, line-item vetoed by the \nPresident and then nullified by the U.S. Supreme Court, continues to be \navailable for its stated purpose of cost reduction for Terfenol-D. \nMoreover, it is my understanding that the $2.0 million currently \nprovided in FY 99 is in addition to the $3.0 million provided in FY 98 \nfor a total of $5.0 million over two years for this extremely important \ncost reduction initiative.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator's assessment that the 2 years of consecutive \nfunding for this program totals $5.0 million is correct. It was the \nintent of the Conferees to provide this level of funding for the \nsuccessful completion of this important program that will greatly \nenhance the security of the United States and the safety of our men and \nwomen at sea.\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, for this important clarification.\n\n\n                         ship scrapping project\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address my \ncolleague, Chairman Stevens, concerning funding for a ship disposal \ninitiative in the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations Act. At my \nrequest, funds were provided in the Senate bill for this program and \nI'm pleased to note that the conference report has preserved the Senate \nfunding level of $7.5 million. This initiative has been crafted to \naddress the Department of Defense Interagency Ship Scrapping Review \nPanel's recommendations for a pilot program.\n  It was my understanding that the $7.5 million provided under \nOperation & Maintenance for a ship disposal initiative would be used to \nimplement a demonstration project at the Navy's only two fresh water \nreserve basins, where more than 300,000 tons of ships slated for \nscrapping are stored, and that these funds will be distributed evenly \nbetween the two sites--the Delaware River and the James River--for the \nfirst year of this demonstration project.\n  Earlier this year, I spoke with Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell and \nofficials of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation \nregarding their needs as we move ahead on revitalizing the Philadelphia \nNavy Shipyard. A key element of their plan is to demonstrate a ship \nscrapping project that assures responsible environmental health and \nsafety management while reducing government costs for managing \ndecommissioned ships.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct that the Senate \nincluded funding for this program at his request. The Committee and \nconferees were silent on the specific purpose of the program. I will \nadd, though, that I support the intent of the Senator.\n\n\n                    Protecting Our Strategic Airlift\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the defense appropriations \nconference report, but I would like to briefly comment on one issue - \nstrategic airlift.\n  As we have learned in places like Kenya, Tanzania, Iraq, and Bosnia, \nthe end of the Cold War has not brought stability to the world. That \ninstability continually threatens our national security interests and \nhas placed a high demand on our military assets.\n  Primary among those assets is strategic airlift. Using our military \nrequires getting troops and equipment and weapons to strategic \nlocations. I am very concerned that we are taking some short-cuts in \nthis bill that directly impact that vital national security capability. \nIn particular, I am concerned that the Senate did not fully fund the \nPresident's request for C-5 avionics modernization. Instead, this \nConference Report provides only $33.7 million of $47.9 million dollars \nnecessary to increase C-5 safety and reliability. While $33.7 million \nis a lot of money, we need to do more.\n  The $14.2 million cut delays installation of the Traffic Collision \nAvoidance System (TCAS) by a full-year. Other important modifications \nare also delayed, including the following: Enhanced Ground Proximity \nWarning System, Global Air Traffic Management, Flight Instrument and \nEngine Display System, and Automatic Flight Controls. These are the \nsystems that navigate the plane and protect it against various forms of \ncollision. As the skies continue to become more crowded, and as we rely \non C-5s to provide airlift in all types of weather and over all kinds \nof terrain up-to-date avionics are critical.\n  The C-5 has served the nation well in all of our military actions \noverseas from the Yom Kippur War to current operations in Bosnia and \nIraq. In Desert Storm, the C-5 delivered over 38 percent of all \nAmerica's airlift. It is an absolutely essential part of the Air \nForce's airlift capacity. A capacity that is more critical than ever as \nwe move to an Expeditionary Aerospace Force.\n  I want to point out here that it is not just me who believes the C-5 \nis a critical national defense priority. It is one of the Air Force's \ntop priorities. Even now, I know that the Air Force is attempting to \ncobble together the needed $14.2 million from other accounts. The Air \nForce should not be put in this position. We should give them the \nmoney.\n  We have known for some time that the C-5 needs some modernization \nwork. The Air Force is undertaking a study to determine how best to \npreserve and protect our strategic airlift. That larger study will look \nat many things--re-engining the C-5, buying more C-17s, refitting \nexisting commercial airframes, exploring spare parts shortages and \nmaintenance delays--but it will not change the need to modernize the \navionics in the short-term. The Air Force is committed to this \nmodernization and deserves our support.\n  Quite simply, the airlift of the United States military rests in the \nback of the C-5. In a world where threats appear in every corner of the \nglobe, we cannot afford to shortchange the strategic airlift that \nprotects our national security.\n  When we look at addressing readiness shortfalls in the military in a \nsupplemental appropriations bill this year, I hope my colleagues will \nconsider the need to restore $14.2 million to the C-5 Avionics \nModernization accounts. The Air Force should know that we share its \ncommittment to strategic airlift.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator yield back the balance of his time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11080-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 87, the nays are 6. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the Senate \nbegins consideration of S. 442, the Internet tax bill, the Commerce \nCommittee amendment be agreed to; and immediately following that \naction, the Finance Committee substitute be agreed to and considered \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendments. I also ask that \nduring the Senate's consideration of S. 442 or the House companion \nbill, that only relevant amendments be in order.\n  I now ask that the motion to proceed be adopted and the Senate \nproceed to the bill following the period of morning business at 3:15 \np.m. today.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, the Senator from Florida has chosen \nto object. We just had a vote, 89-6, which probably would have been 94-\n6. This is not the way the Senate should function, Mr. President--1, or \n2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6 Senators should block this important \nlegislation. We are going to have a motion or a vote on the motion to \nproceed, and we are going to file cloture and we will begin the 30 \nhours that will bring us to final conclusion on this vote.\n  If the Senator from Florida wants an amendment, we will debate it. If \nthe Senator from Florida wants to change the bill, we will discuss it. \nBut for the Senator from Florida, with one more week to go before we \nleave, to continue to block consideration of this legislation, I think \nis clearly thwarting not only the majority of the Senate, but the \nmajority of the American people. His own President was out in the \nSilicon Valley at a soft money fundraiser bragging about the fact that \nthe Congress will pass the Internet Tax Freedom Act, as he raised \n$25,000 a plate in a soft money fundraiser. And he took credit for H-\n1B, which Senator Abraham was primarily responsible for.\n  We are growing weary of this. It is time we move forward with this \nlegislation. It is time we save this critical technology, which is \nabsolutely vital to the future of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I want to state my intentions again, after \nconsultation with the majority leader. That is, on Thursday morning, \nthere will be a vote on the motion to proceed. It will be another 89-6 \nor 94-6 vote. We intend to file cloture at that time, and then we will \nhave cloture on the bill, which will then allow us 30 hours of debate. \nI might point out that, in this present scenario, 1 hour of debate \npost-cloture on the motion to proceed is allowed per Senator. We will \nfinish this legislation and go to conference in the House and make sure \nthat we don't choke this baby in the cradle--which is called the \nInternet--which is vital to the future of the economy of this Nation \nand the world.\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we voted a few minutes ago to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I \nopposed that motion to proceed, as did the Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, and a few others. I think it is incumbent upon us to \nstate why we opposed it and why we did not oppose it.\n  None of us who opposed the motion to proceed did so because we are \nantagonistic to high technology. None of us did it because we failed to \nappreciate the importance of the Internet system and the enormous \ncontribution that it has made in disseminating information to peoples \naround the world. No one opposed it because we failed to understand the \neconomic importance of this both in terms of the industry itself and \nhow this information industry makes the rest of our economy more \nefficient and productive. And none of us did it because we are mired in \nthe past, because we have some childhood addiction to the way things \nhave always been. We understand that the world is moving at an \nincreasingly rapid pace and that these technologies are an important \nengine of that progress.\n  But why I believe we did oppose this motion to proceed was to slow \ndown the consideration of a body whose whole purpose for being is to be \na deliberative body on issues that are of importance to this Nation and \nits citizens.\n  I believe there has been an effort maybe to minimalize the importance \nof this legislation, the Internet Freedom Tax Act, and to focus on it \nalmost as a cliche: if you are for high technology you are for this \nbill. If you are opposed to high technology, you are opposed to this \nbill. That simplicity hides the real importance of this issue.\n  To me, that importance can be described under two labels. The first \nlabel, Mr. President, is fundamental fairness. If I were to use an \nexample that I suggested to the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, \nearlier today: if Main Street was divided and all the stores on the \nleft side of Main Street were under a requirement to collect sales tax \non each of their sales and all the stores on the right side of Main \nStreet were exempt from that obligation to collect tax on exactly the \nsame sales, we would say that is unfair.\n  Why should the hardware store on the left side be required to collect \nsales tax and therefore increase the ultimate cost to its customers of \nthe hammers and saws and nails that were purchased, but the hardware \nstore on the right side be exempt and therefore have that competitive \nadvantage? Everyone would immediately say, ``That's unfair. How could \nyou tolerate such a situation?''\n  Well, we have essentially that situation today, Mr. President, as it \nrelates to the sales that are made on both sides of Main Street where \nthe sellers are required to collect State and local sales taxes, and \nremote sellers where you can pick up a catalog and order those same \nhammers and saws and nails and have them shipped to you by mail where \nthere is no requirement of the seller to collect that sales tax. That \ncreates a discriminatory situation in the marketplace.\n  This bill has as a principal objective to avoid discrimination \nagainst Internet sales. Now the question is going to be, Discrimination \nrelative to what? To whom? Is it discrimination relative to the Main \nStreet hardware store or is it discrimination relative to the catalog \nsale hardware store?\n  If it is the latter, then the Internet industry would be able to \nargue, ``We shouldn't have to pay any taxes either. We shouldn't have \nto collect taxes because the sales are made over the Internet any more \nthan our catalog brethren are not required to collect taxes for sales \nmade through the post office or through telephones.''\n  If, on the other hand, the question is discrimination against that \nMain Street hardware store, then the answer is the other way, that \n``Yes, just as Main Street has to collect, you should have to \ncollect.''\n  That issue of fairness then gets to the second issue of its effect on \nState and local governments. We in this Congress have had as one of our \nprincipal objectives to decentralize responsibility, to send more \nauthority from Washington to the communities of America and support \nthat principle. I am a Jeffersonian, and I believe the best government \nin general is that government which is closest to the people affected \nby a government's actions. But I understand, as we send more \nresponsibility--whether it is in education or in health care or \nenvironmental protection or economic development--to our communities, \nthat they are going to need a revenue base in which to carry out those \nresponsibilities that we have just sent them.\n  This issue of discrimination of Internet sales has the potential of \ndriving a major hole into the revenue sources upon which many States \nand local governments depend in order to provide those very services. \nThe most at-risk service will clearly be education, since it is the \nlargest responsibility of State and local government in terms of its \nimportance to our future and in terms of its use of State and local \nresources.\n  So in my judgment, the most important education bill that we will \ndebate in 1998 will be the Internet Tax Fairness Act because it has the \ngreatest potential of fundamentally affecting what kind of education \nour children will receive in this and future generations.\n  So our reason for slowing this train down was to be able to elevate \nwhat I believe to be some very fundamental issues and provide us an \nopportunity to try to work through them so that we do not \ninadvertently, in the rush to show our support for high technology, \nhave some very negative unintended consequences.\n  The good news, Mr. President, is those efforts have been underway for \nsome time and I believe are close to bearing positive results. In the \nnext couple of days, I anticipate there will be a meeting of many of us \nwho were interested in this issue, from all points of view, to try to \nclose the increasingly narrow gap that is necessary to have legislation \nthat will achieve the desires of the sponsor, which is to give a pause \nand time and structure for thoughtful consideration of how the Internet \ntransactions should be taxed for purposes of State and local \ngovernment, as well as international transactions, and to allow the \nindustry this brief period of moratorium from State and local taxes \nwhile a comprehensive set of policies is being developed.\n  What those of us who have been concerned about the rush to final \njudgment of this act have been seeking is to assure that that study \nwill look at all of the means by which commerce is being conducted in \nAmerica today so that we will receive from this moratorium and study a \nthoughtful set of policies that will not have the effect of eroding \nconcepts of fairness in the marketplace and capacity of State and local \ngovernments to carry out their important responsibilities, particularly \nthe education of our children.\n  So, Mr. President, those remarks are intended to de-escalate the \nemotion of this issue, elevate the importance of this to our Nation's \nfuture, particularly our future ability to prepare generations of \nAmericans through quality education. And I express my appreciation to \nSenator Wyden, to Senator Enzi, and to others who have been interested \nin this and have invested a considerable amount of their time, \nexperience, understanding, and intellect in reaching a resolution that \nwill be in America's interest. I believe we are close, and I look \nforward to reaching our destination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we just held a vote to proceed to debating \nthe Internet tax bill. I did not vote to proceed to that bill, and I \nwould like to take a minute to explain why I do not currently support \nthe legislation that is before us. It doesn't have anything to do, as \nwas said before, with whether we are high tech or not. I have been \ntrying to get permission to bring a computer on the floor of the \nSenate. I work with the Internet. I understand how web sites work. I \nunderstand the advantages we could have with more utilization of \ncomputers. I understand how the Internet works, and I understand some \nof the spectacular advantages that we are already enjoying in this \ncountry, and some of the ones we could be enjoying to a greater level. \nI am not trying to keep that from happening.\n  There was mention in the motion to proceed that there was very little \nopposition. That is because it is a motion to\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\nproceed. There would be a much stronger opposition if the bill were to \nbe voted on right now, without some of the requests that we have made \nfor amendments--amendments that I think are simple enough that they \ncould have been agreed to as part of a package.\n  I want to say right up front that my vote was not a vote in favor of \ntaxes. I want to reduce taxes. I want to stop new taxes--particularly \nat the Federal level. That is a goal we should all work toward. Federal \nincome taxes, FICA taxes, unemployment taxes, and user taxes are always \nat the top of the list of burdens on working Americans and small \nbusinesses. I want to tell you that this bill doesn't reduce any of \nthose taxes. This bill is an easy way for us to look good. We get to be \nthe tax cutters by placing mandates on the other levels of government. \nWe are tying the hands of local government to be able to finance \nitself, and we make ourselves out to be the good guys.\n  I wish all the Members who voted for cloture today would get as \nserious about reducing Federal taxes as they seem to be about reducing \nlocal taxes. This bill will create an unfair playing field. Congress \ndoes have a constitutional responsibility to regulate interstate \ncommerce, and I understand the desire of the bill's sponsors to protect \nand promote the growth of Internet commerce. But I am concerned that we \nare picking the tax winners and the tax losers. I want to tell you, the \nlocal Main Street retailers will be the losers, unless we have some \ncorrections in this bill.\n  There is also nothing in this bill to protect against fraud. The \nbarriers to entry are so low in the Internet commerce and so hard to \ntrack that it is difficult to draw comparisons with catalog companies. \nCatalogs can be tracked. Those orders can be tracked. The Internet is a \nwhole different problem.\n  The fraud that can exist in it can go so far as to have a retailer in \na town set up an Internet web site in a State that does not have sales \ntaxes. And when you go to purchase in that store, you would purchase \nthrough their other corporation in that tax-free State and free \nyourself from paying any sales tax. That is nice if you do not have to \npay sales tax, except most of the States in this Nation rely on some \nform of sales tax for education money. Some States, including mine, \nrely on sales tax. There is no income tax in Wyoming. There is no \nincome tax in several other States. There are provisions in the bill \nfor States that do not have income tax to be represented on the \ncommission. I think it is imperative that there be a provision in this \nInternet bill that those States which do not have an income tax but do \nhave a sales tax also have representation on that committee.\n  There should also be a requirement for legislative suggestions from \nthe commission. Right now the commission in this bill is required to \ngive a report. A report on what? I think it ought to be much more \nspecific than that and actually get into the instructions for \nlegislation, the actual wording for the legislation that would ensure \nan end to the moratorium and be sure that we have something we can \nactually use. There should be a strong reporting requirement for the \ncommission.\n  I look forward to debating this bill in the coming days. I am not \nopposed to the idea, but I think we have to move closer to the House \nversion of the bill. The House bill does empower the commission to look \nat the remote sales issue. It does require the commission to produce \nlegislative recommendations. These are important components of the bill \nthat are necessary to keep it fair for small retailers and small \ngovernments.\n  I come from government that is closest to the people. I was a mayor \nfor 8 years, and I served in the State legislature for 10. In Congress, \nwe make decisions every day that affect the lives of millions of \npeople, but they do not live at the Federal level. They live at the \nlocal level. In local government, you make decisions every day that \naffect the lives of your friends and neighbors, ones who know you and \nknow what you are working on. There is a big difference.\n  I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that mandates or \nrestricts local government's ability to meet the needs of citizens, and \nthis bill does exactly that. It may not seem like a big restriction, \nand it may not exceed the $50 million limit that Congress set in the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act, but it does establish a national policy \nagainst State and local government interference. It takes an \naffirmative step that ties the hands of local government.\n  What am I asking here? I am asking that we actually talk about some \nof the amendments that we need to have that maintain the status quo for \nState funding--not increases the tax, not decreases the tax, maintains \nthe status quo. There are States that rely on this tax at the present \ntime, and I will do everything I can to make sure that we do not take \naway the possibility, or the right, for those States to continue to \noperate.\n  We have to plug the loophole of the possibility for fraud, the \npossibility for fraud during the 2 years that there is a moratorium. If \nthat gets established and allowed, we will have some of that happening \nfor the rest of the time, and States again relying on the money will \nnot have it.\n  That is a brief explanation. I will have an opportunity, I am sure, \nto expand on those considerably, but we do have concerns. That is why \nwe are trying to make sure that we have an opportunity to have those \naddressed and to make sure they are addressed up front.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11085-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a Senator from a State with an \nexcellent records of accomplishment at the secondary education level, \nbut a discouraging low rate of participation in higher education, I am \nextremely pleased to rise in support of the conference report on the \nhigher education act amendments of 1998. Mr. President, I have had no \nhigher priority than bringing this important legislation to completion \nthis year.\n  I am very proud of the record of Maine's primary and secondary \nschools. We have one of the lowest high school dropout rates in the \ncountry, and we rank in the top third of the Nation for residents over \n25 years old with high school diplomas. More important, the academic \nachievement of our schools is impressive. Education Week's ``Quality \nCounts'' assessment found that the performance of Maine's students in \nmathematics, science, and reading was at the very top of the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, there is one dark cloud in this \notherwise very bright and sunny picture, and that is the low rate of \nparticipation in higher education by Maine's high school graduates. \nThat low rate results not from a lack of interest or lack of ability, \nbut rather from a lack of opportunity. The legislation we are \nconsidering today holds the key for young people of limited means to \nget through a door that, often for financial reasons, would otherwise \nremain closed to them.\n  This reauthorization of the Higher Education Act continues the \nhistoric commitment begun 40 years ago when Congress enacted the \nNational Defense Education Act. In the NDEA, Congress stated, ``The \nsecurity of the Nation requires the fullest development of the mental \nresources and technical skills of its young men and women.''\n  In 1958, Congress was thinking of security in terms of the cold war \nand the recent launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union. However, Mr. \nPresident, this statement remains equally valid today--although the \nchallenge to our\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nnational security is greatly different. Today, we face an internal \nthreat--not the threat of the rapidly advancing technology of a foreign \nenemy, but the quiet threat of failing to provide educational \nopportunity to all our citizens. Those deprived of that opportunity \nlose the chance to participate in our Nation's bright, technology-based \neconomic future.\n  Given the well-established relationship between educational \nattainment and lifetime earnings, the consequences of not affording \neducational opportunity to lower-income Americans are predictable. \nIndeed, the result is a vicious cycle, in which the income gap leads to \nan education gap, which in turn leads to an even more pronounced income \ngap. Unless steps are taken to close the education gap, one that is \nrooted in economics rather than in ability, we lock the children of \nAmerica's lower income families into a self-perpetuating cycle of \ninadequate education and low income.\n  The Higher Education Act seeks to close that education gap. It \nassumes that all qualified high school students graduating are entitled \nto higher education and strives to make this a reality through a \nprogram of grants, guaranteed loans, and Opportunity Programs.\n  The grant programs authorized by the Higher Education Act are the \nmost important part of our attempt to assure access to higher \neducation. Nationwide, Pell grants have assisted millions of students \nin obtaining postsecondary education. In Maine, 15,000 students were \nawarded $24 million in Pell Grants last year. In addition, Maine \ninstitutions received more than $6.5 million in Supplemental Education \nOpportunity Grants, which they distributed to the most needy students.\n\n  My strong belief in the importance of grant aid in expanding access \nto higher education has led me to introduce several bills to increase \nthe level of Pell Grants for which students can qualify. One of these \nbills, the Working Students Income Protection Act, eliminated an unfair \npenalty that is imposed on low-income students who work to pay part of \ntheir educational expenses--just the kind of thing we ought to be \nencouraging. The bill was incorporated, I am pleased to say, into the \nHigher Education Act Amendments and, as a result, students may now earn \n$2,000 a year more before their Pell Grants are reduced.\n  The act also reflects my efforts to ensure that the formula used to \ncalculate the amount of a student's Pell Grant reflects the true costs \nof dependent care. As we increase the maximum level of Pell Grants, we \napproach the point at which this arbitrary cap of $750, which is in the \ncurrent law, would limit Pell Grants to some of the most deserving \nstudents--those balancing caring for their children and going to \ncollege. The changes in the Higher Education Act will prevent such \nstudents from having to choose between supporting their children and \npursuing higher education.\n  In addition to Pell Grants, the Higher Education Act has provided \nfunding for a joint Federal-State effort to award grants to needy \nstudents. This program is known as the State Student Incentive Grants \nProgram. This bill incorporates a proposal authored by Senator Reed of \nRhode Island and myself to not only maintain this important program, \nbut to expand it to fund a series of other State efforts to promote \naccess to higher education for low-income students. This year, for \nevery dollar in Federal SSIG funds, my State of Maine is contributing \nalmost $50, and the result is that 10,000 students will receive a total \nof $5 million to further their education.\n  Mr. President, the combined Federal and State grant aid based on the \nHigher Education Act totals more than $35 million to students in Maine \nwho are enrolled in institutions of higher education. This represents a \ndirect investment in equal opportunity and bright futures for Maine \nfamilies.\n  The other major financial assistance program in the Higher Education \nAct is the guaranteed student loan program. This reauthorization \nassures that students will continue to have access to both private \nloans, as well as those that come directly from the Department of \nEducation, and it establishes the lowest interest rate in 17 years for \nguaranteed student loans. This is good news, indeed.\n  Mr. President, unless individuals from disadvantaged social and \neconomic backgrounds aspire to higher education, no amount of financial \naid will help them. Therefore, in reauthorizing the Higher Education \nAct, we are continuing a very successful effort by the Federal \nGovernment to put higher education on the radar screens of \ndisadvantaged youths through the Opportunity or Trio Programs.\n  In my home State, TRIO programs, such as Talent Search and Upward \nBound, have lifted the aspirations of thousands of young people who \notherwise never would have even considered postsecondary education. I \nam very pleased to have worked for the extension and improvement of \nthese programs along with the creation of an exciting new program known \nas Gear Up, through which colleges will reach out to entire middle \nschool classes.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit outstanding Upward Bound programs \nat both the University of Maine at Orono and the University of Maine at \nPresque Isle. The high school students in these programs were \nenthusiastic, challenged, and so excited about their opportunities. As \none student told me, ``No one in my family has ever been to college. I \nhad no idea that college could be part of my future--Upward Bound has \ngiven me confidence and experience; it's opened my eyes to all sorts of \nnew opportunities.''\n  The Federal Government cannot guarantee equal educational \nachievement, but we can take steps and must take steps to guarantee \nequality of access by removing the barriers that prevent students from \nlower- and middle-income families from pursuing postsecondary \neducation. That is the very purpose of the Higher Education Act. Its \nstudent loan programs have assisted countless students in overcoming \nthe financial obstacles to higher education while its opportunity \nprograms, such as Upward Bound, have an admirable record of breaking \ndown the social and academic areas.\n  Despite our successes, the statistics show that we have not yet done \nthe job. The education gap still exists, and to close it we need to \nreaffirm and extend our commitment to equal access to education. \nEstablishing equality of opportunity is the ultimate goal of the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998.\n  The American people expect their Government to prepare our Nation for \nthe next century. I can think of no better way to carry out that \nresponsibility than to assist today's young people in realizing their \nfull potential to become not just productive members of society but \nalso the leaders upon whom America's future depends.\n  I am pleased to have played a role in bringing this very important \nlegislation before the Senate today. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I yield 5 minutes to Senator \nMurray, serving on the same committee, the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, I thank Senator Collins for all the work she put into this \npiece of legislation. She clearly not only has a higher education \nbackground but she is very committed to education. It is wonderful to \nsee Senators who have her commitment, and I thank her for her work.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Minnesota \nfor yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the conference committee, I wish to \nexpress my deep appreciation for the committee's work and its \nleadership in crafting the higher education reauthorization bill that \nis so vital to our country's future. This bill is a major victory for \nstudents and teachers across America. The committee provided the \nopportunity to hear from countless witnesses from across the Nation who \ntestified on everything from default rates to job hunting, campus crime \nto child care.\n  Mr. President, throughout the committee's effort on this bill, I \nworked to strengthen our Nation's commitment to providing the strongest \ntraining possible for schoolteachers. I am most\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\npleased with the bill's focus on teacher training and, in particular, \nits emphasis on technology training.\n  A year ago, I introduced the Teacher Technology Training Act to add \ntechnology to the areas of professional development and teacher \ntraining that are included in current law. I thank the chairman and the \nranking members of both sides for their cooperation and support in \nadding these critical pieces to the bill.\n  The work of the committee on the teacher education provisions is \nreally very historic and is a drastic overhaul of the previous teacher \ntraining section. Teacher quality grants will institute State level \nreforms to ensure both current and future teachers will possess the \nskills and academic knowledge to teach children effectively in their \nassigned areas. As a member of the Labor Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nwill fight to ensure that this section is finally funded at a level \nthat does make a difference in the classroom.\n  This teacher quality section particularly highlights training in the \neffective use of technology in our classrooms. All of us have witnessed \nthe tremendous impact that technology now plays in our daily world. It \naffects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the \nway our children learn in school. Young people today are in the midst \nof a technology explosion that has opened up limitless opportunities \nand possibilities in the classroom. In order for students to tap into \nthis potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they have to learn \nhow to use new technologies. But all too often teachers are expected to \nincorporate technology into their instruction without being given the \ntraining to do so.\n  We simply cannot allow students to teach our teachers in the rapidly \nexpanding area of technology. I have toured several teaching schools \nand found them well supplied with up-to-date equipment. However, \nteaching students are often not provided adequate instruction in the \nuse of that technology beyond simple communication purposes. It is not \nenough for a teacher to be able to just e-mail. They must use this \neducation technology to advance their curriculum and to provide their \nstudents with resources along the information highway.\n  Last year, amazingly, just 10 percent of new teachers reported that \nthey felt prepared to use technology in their classrooms; and only 13 \npercent of all public schools reported that technology-related training \nfor teachers was mandated by the school, the district or teacher \ncertification agencies; and only 18 States required preservice \ntechnology training.\n  This act will significantly turn those numbers around and provide our \nteachers with the training so critical to harnessing new technologies. \nSo, again, I thank the conferees for their leadership on this effort. I \nalso thank my colleague, Senator Wellstone, for his work on the TANF \namendment. It is so important for literacy instruction and lifelong \nlearning. I know this issue remained unresolved, and I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to Senator Wellstone and will soon see the \ndirect link between educational opportunities and economic self-\nsufficiency.\n  I believe this first generation of the new millennium will benefit \nimmensely from the efforts put forth over this past year. From \nincreases in financial aid, to campus security improvements, to \ntechnology instruction, this legislation will stand as a proud \ntrademark of this Congress.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield my time back to my colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \nalso echo what I said. There are some Senators here who have really dug \ninto the committee. The same could be said for the Chair, who is on the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee. I think this is a bipartisan \neffort. I love Senator Murray's passion for children and education. I \nsay to the Senator from Washington, I think probably more people and \nmore families in Washington, Minnesota, Wyoming, and the country are \nmore focused on education right now than any other issue. The Senator \nhas been a real leader in the area, and I thank her.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to thank colleagues on both \nsides. Senator Jeffords has done a great job in our committee. I feel a \nlittle awkward because there is a lot in this higher education bill \nthat I worked on myself and with other colleagues in the committee. I \nthink this is a good piece of legislation. I was pleased to vote for \nit. I am very pleased with the bill's distance education provisions, \nwhich I worked on a great deal. I think the Chair also is very \ninterested in these issues, and we worked together on this portion of \nthe bill. Distance education is very important for those of us who come \nfrom communities where we really still have strong rural parts to our \nStates.\n\n  I think the bill's focus on applying Pell grants to summer school is \nreally important, especially for our ``nontraditional students,'' \nstudents who are older and going back to school. The bill's coordinated \nresponse dealing with violence on campus between local law enforcement \nand the institutions of higher education is real important; the bill's \ncoordinated response to the problem of binge drinking also is terribly \nimportant.\n  I think there is much in this higher education bill that is important \nfor our country. I thank colleagues. I also thank Roger Wolfson, who \nhas been working with me, on my staff, and has really been responsible \nfor some of the good amendments that we were, working with others, able \nto incorporate into this legislation. I have not covered all in this \nlegislation that I feel very strongly about.\n  But I want to speak to one flaw in this higher education bill. I am \ngoing to speak about this with, I guess, some indignation. When we \npassed this higher education bill on the floor of the Senate, there was \nan amendment that dealt with the welfare bill, though it was an \namendment to the higher education bill--and that is where it should \nhave been. It passed 56 to 42; 11 Republicans joined Senate Democrats \nin supporting the provision. There were over 125 higher education and \ncivil rights organizations that supported this amendment; there were \nstrong editorials in the Boston Globe, the New York Times, Minnesota \nStar and Tribune and other newspapers around the country. As I think \nabout Senators who were out here on the floor speaking about this, the \nSenator who maybe spoke with the most eloquence, certainly the \nstrongest feeling, was the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford.\n  Any number of Senators supported this amendment which I am about to \ndescribe, even though they also supported the welfare bill. I did not \nsupport the welfare bill. They did. I will talk about that in a moment. \nBut this amendment said nothing other than this: That any State that \nwanted to would be allowed to allow a parent, a welfare parent--almost \nall of these parents are women; I think the Chair, from what I know of \nhim, would agree with me that men ought to be taking more \nresponsibility for their children as well--that when it comes to single \nparents, mothers--we would allow States to allow these women to \ncomplete at least 2 years of higher education without having any State \npenalized for doing so.\n  Wyoming would not have to provide these two years, Minnesota would \nnot have to provide these two years, but if Wyoming and Minnesota \ndecide it would be better for these women to be able to complete 2 \nyears of higher education, which could be vocational-technical or \nanother program like a nursing assistant program, then the State should \nbe able to do that and the State would not be penalized. It would not \ncount against the State meeting its work participation requirement.\n  That amendment passed the U.S. Senate, and then it went to conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, this is a single photograph. It is of Troyce Williams, \nbut there are a lot of women like her. This all translates into human \nterms. She is a single mother of four children who is at the \nMinneapolis Community College, a community and technical college, at \nwhich she is trying to get her higher education completed. There are \nmany, many women like her.\n  What I felt good about as a Senator was that after this amendment \npassed, we got all sorts of calls and all sorts of letters from people \nall across the country. This was an amendment that\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\nwould have really made a difference. It would have really made a \ndifference because what a lot of people in our community colleges and \nin our higher education community were saying was that we were going to \nspeak up for our students. This was a mistake we made when we passed \nthe TANF. When we passed the welfare bill we probably should have been \nclear at the Federal level we would have some language that would give \nStates the flexibility, if they wanted to, to allow these parents to \ncomplete at least 2 years of higher education.\n\n  Now I am not going to bore anybody here today about all of the \nstatistics that make the point that every single citizen in this \ncountry understands: If you are able to go on and complete 2 years or 4 \nyears of higher education, you are going to be in a better position to \nfind a good job and give your children the care you know they need and \ndeserve.\n  This amendment passes. Then we go to conference committee. I am just \nfurious about what happened in conference committee. We met, and the \nHouse conferees, the majority House conferees, Republicans, said no to \nthe amendment, and they were not interested in talking about anything \nelse by way of maybe something else we could do that would make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, it is just simply bitterly ironic that the very women \nwho are on the path to economic self-sufficiency, because they are \ntrying to complete at least 2 years of higher education, all too often \nget driven out of school because States feel like they will be \npenalized if they do not get these women into the workforce. Then they \nget into the workforce and they find a job at $6 an hour, and then 1 \nyear later they lose their medical assistance and they and their \nchildren are worse off. Whereas, if they could complete 2 years of \nhigher education they would be better off.\n  We come to conference committee and I am just going to repeat what \nhappened. I do no damage to the truth, because I want to make a point \nabout what is at stake here--not just on this amendment but, sort of, \npolitics in our country. The Chair may not agree with me, but I get to \nspeak my piece on the floor of the Senate.\n  Now, the Republicans in the House come in and they say, ``We want \nthis Wellstone amendment out.'' Forget my name. I am not important. \n``We want this amendment out.'' And I will not use names because there \nis no one here to debate me and that would not be fair. On the House \nside, they are not here to debate me. So the person who is kind of the \npoint person in making this argument says, ``This would be a terrible \namendment.'' And then I hear everybody saying, ``This welfare bill was \nhallmark legislation. It is the best thing we have done in a half a \ncentury. It is so successful that we cannot touch it--this is nothing \nless than an effort to undermine this welfare bill.''\n  Mr. President, first of all, a lot of people who voted for this \namendment did not vote for this amendment to undermine the welfare \nbill. They thought it was a modification that was needed. They thought \nthat the welfare bill would work better if we allowed States to allow \nthese women to complete at least 2 years of higher education. But I am \ngoing to make another point.\n  I then turned--and for all I know the Chair was there at the \nconference committee--I turned to people who made this presentation and \nI said you keep talking about how successful this welfare bill is, and \nyou talk about the number of people who are no longer on welfare, the \nnumber of women and children who are no longer on our welfare rolls. \nThat is true; maybe 4 or 5 million fewer people.\n  My question for you, since you told me how successful it is--even \nthough I would rather debate this in a higher education framework, let \nme raise this question. Let me raise this question on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. We have seen a dramatic reduction in the welfare rolls. \nHave we seen a dramatic reduction in poverty? Can any of you, from any \nState, provide me with any data as to where these mothers and children \nare, what kind of jobs are these mothers receiving? What are the wages? \nIs there child care available for their 3- or 4-year-old? And when \ntheir first and second graders come home alone, sometimes in very \ndangerous neighborhoods, is there anybody there?\n  I have said this on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am going to say \nit again. We all say how much we love children. These children count, \ntoo. There are children--I know, I have been in these neighborhoods--\nthat go home alone, now, because their mothers are working. They are 7 \nyears old. And they are told to go into their apartment and to lock the \ndoor and to take no phone calls, and don't go outside. There are \nchildren, when there is beautiful weather, they don't play outside \nbecause there is nobody there to take care of them. And these single \nmothers who are working are terrified as to what might happen to them.\n  I asked my colleagues on the Republican side in the House of \nRepresentatives, because they eliminate this amendment, since they are \ntalking about how successful the welfare bill is, could they provide me \nwith data? Not one of them could; not one of them.\n  I will debate anybody on the floor of the Senate, and I will debate \nanybody on the floor of the House on this question. The Swedish \nsociologist Gunnar Myrdal once said, ``Ignorance is never random.'' \nSometimes we don't know what we don't want to know. We don't know what \nis going on in these States. We don't know what is going on with these \nmothers and children.\n  I can't believe how punitive people can be. I can't believe how harsh \nthey can be. Not one single argument was made against this amendment. \nNot one bit of data was presented to show that these mothers and these \nchildren are better off now, but they just eliminated it because they \nhad the majority.\n  I am not whining. I am telling people in the country that this one \nsmall example, one small story, tells a larger story about what is at \nstake.\n  I am not out here, by the way, to defend the President's behavior, \nbut I don't think the President is the issue this fall. He is not on \nthe ballot. He will never be on the ballot again running for President. \nThis election, I say to people in Minnesota and people around the \ncountry, is about you.\n  I just ask, what are these kinds of priorities? Just eliminate an \namendment to the higher education bill that allows States to allow \nwomen, mothers of small children, to complete 2 years of higher \neducation so they and their children will be better off? Eliminated.\n  Do you know that this past June, America--I think it was in June--in \nthe same week this Republican majority voted to give a tax break to \npeople with estates worth more than $17 million, they voted to \neliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and voted to \neliminate summer jobs for kids? Unbelievable.\n  People go to their pollsters and say, ``What are the issues people \ncare about?'' The same Republicans who knocked out this amendment found \nout it is education--people care about education. They learned how to \ntalk about education--I said ``talk about education''--but they have \ncut funding for education. They have cut funding for K through 12 \neducation.\n  It is interesting. We are at a crossroads with education. We are \ngoing to see a dramatic increase over the next 10 years by about 10 \npercent of high school students and about 6 percent of middle school \nstudents. The average age of our public school teacher is 50. We are \ngoing to need to hire about 1.3 million teachers in our country. We can \nhave all sorts of men and women coming into education with creative new \nideas, new energy, and all the rest--it is a golden opportunity--but we \ncan't take advantage of a golden opportunity on a tin-plate budget.\n  The same people who are in the majority in the House of \nRepresentatives--so punitive, so harsh, so little compassion--voted to \ndeny a single parent, a mother, the opportunity to finish 2 years of \nhigher education so she can do better for her children. They gave a tax \nbreak to people with estates worth more than $17 million, but in the \nsame week they eliminated the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \nso that in my cold-weather State, elderly people, families with \nchildren, have a choice of eating or heating, but not both. They \neliminate low-income home energy assistance, so people go cold in the \nwinter, and knock out summer jobs for kids. They give speeches about \nbeing for education and children and then cut the budgets.\n  That is what is at stake this election. That is what is at stake. My \nstrategy\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\nwould be for people to turn out this fall. I think the Republican \nstrategy is for people to be turned off this fall, low turnout.\n  I hope that from this example people in the country will realize that \nthere is a lot at stake. If you care about a good education for all of \nour children, if you are committed to the idea of living-wage jobs, if \nyou are committed to the idea of decent health care for every citizen, \nif you are committed to improving the standard of living for all the \npeople in our country, if you believe that economic and educational \nopportunities are important, then I make this appeal to people in the \ncountry: Don't let people turn you off to politics.\n  This election this fall is not about President Clinton. We can talk \nabout his behavior at another time. Nobody needs to approve of it. I \ndon't know of anybody who does. But this election, I say to people in \nthe country, is about you; it is about your families. This election \nthis fall--the President is not on the ballot--is about these kinds of \nissues.\n  I hope people will turn out. I hope you will vote for education. This \namendment was knocked out of the higher education bill in spite of the \ngood support of Senator Jeffords. We supported it on the Senate side. I \ntell you, this Gingrich-House Republican majority agenda is harsh, it \nis mean-spirited, and if you are committed to education for children, \nmake sure you vote this election. If you believe in the importance of \nhealth care and you think good jobs are important, just make sure you \nvote this election. If you think it is wrong in the same week in the \nHouse of Representatives to give a tax break to people with estates \nover $17 million and eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram and eliminate summer jobs for kids--that is exactly what this \nmajority did in the House--you make sure you vote this election.\n  If you are angry at people in Washington, DC, and the U.S. House and \nthe U.S. Senate because you think that neither party is doing enough \nabout your concerns and you think too much of our decisionmaking is \ndominated by special interest or big money or you feel locked out or \nall the rest, make sure you vote. Don't opt out. Don't let people turn \nyou off. There is a lot at stake in elections in our country, and this \nis but one example.\n  I will get to speak more about this after our caucuses. I see my \ncolleague, Senator Graham. I wanted to start out congratulating my \ncolleagues for the good work on the higher education bill.\n  Roger Wolfson, thank you for your help.\n  I want to tell you that what happened in the conference committee is \njust outrageous. There is nothing I can do about it, not now. I will \nbring this amendment back on the first bill I can amend. Of course, for \nthe last couple of weeks there hasn't been an opportunity to amend any \nbills. I want to make sure people understand what is at stake.\n  In my not too humble opinion--and the Chair is a good friend; I \nreally like him, and I hope it is mutual, so I don't mean this in a \npersonal way--but what is at stake in these fall elections is critical.\n  I say to people in the country, this small story tells a larger \nstory. I shudder at the thought of Speaker Gingrich or, for that \nmatter, on the Senate side as well, there being even more of a majority \nor more power, because I think it will be an agenda that will move our \ncountry back 60 years. People have learned how to talk about education, \nI say to my colleague from Florida, but the budgets don't reflect that. \nOn the House side, they cut funding for education. There was no action \nwhatsoever on health care. There is very little concern about what I \ncall some really important family-value issues, and this is but one \nexample.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, is there a set time for the recess?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a set time for the recess, 12:30 p.m.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I may give back some.\n  I rise to speak about the conference report to H.R. 6, the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998. I take this opportunity to commend my \ncolleagues on the conference committee for the truly outstanding work \nthey have done on behalf of our Nation's students and the higher \neducation community. This legislation includes an important expansion \nof the Pell and work study programs, provides the lowest interest rates \nin 17 years for student borrowers, provides for loan forgiveness for \nteachers working in high poverty areas, and makes a continued \ncommitment to improving our teacher preparation programs.\n  I know that the passage of this bill will have a significant impact \non students and colleges in my State. While I am pleased with many \nprovisions in this bill, I am extremely disappointed that the \nconference committee did not include the text of the Wellstone \namendment. This amendment allowed up to 24 months of postsecondary or \nvocational education, removed the 30-percent limitation on education as \na work activity for teen parents, and clarified that participation in a \nFederal work study program is a permissible work activity.\n  Instead, the conference report calls for a GAO study on this issue. I \nam personally aware of at least a half dozen studies--a half dozen \nstudies--which already indicate that this is a problem for many low-\nincome, single mothers. Why do you have to have a study to tell you \nthat the more education you have the better job you can receive and the \nbetter the employer likes you? Instead of doing the right thing for \nthese\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\nsingle mothers, trying to better themselves, our colleagues want to \nstudy the issue to death. What they ought to do is try living in the \nsingle mother's shoes for a day and see what it is to try to raise a \nfamily and attend school full time, while holding down a part-time job.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I supported and voted for welfare \nreform. It has been almost 2 years since Congress rewrote our Federal \nwelfare laws in the hopes of breaking the cycle of dependency that was \ntrapping too many Americans in poverty and despair. Much good has come \nof that law, including substantial drops in the welfare rolls and \nsaving States like Kentucky $14 million. But despite its good \nintentions, the new welfare law is penalizing parents, particularly \nsingle mothers trying to improve their chances at getting good jobs.\n  Under the new law, a parent must work 20 hours to continue receiving \naid. That might not seem particularly onerous, but the law also limits \nthese single parents to just 1 year of education before requiring them \nto find work. As a result, too many promising, capable, nontraditional \nstudents are being forced out of postsecondary education due to the \nFederal restrictions.\n  My State is not a wealthy State. There are many single mothers \ntrapped in the cycle of poverty. Recently, the University of Kentucky \nreleased a study which demonstrated that higher education greatly \nincreases a person's ability to earn a living. The study found that a \nparent living in rural Kentucky needs to earn at least $10.61 an hour \nworking full time, or $19,708 a year, to support two children on a \nbasic budget. The study found that only women with a college degree--\nand let me repeat, only women with a college degree--earn above that \nthreshold in Kentucky. This same study found that single mothers with a \nhigh school degree never, never reach that threshold. In fact, the \naverage income for Kentucky women of any age with a high school degree \nis only 67 percent of that benchmark.\n  My State wants to go forward and help these women help themselves. A \nbipartisan bill in the 1998 Kentucky general assembly to improve access \nto education for welfare recipients was ultimately scrapped. Why was it \nscrapped? Due to the fear of Federal penalties. The State wanted to \nextend the opportunity, particularly to single mothers, and they were \nfearful because of Federal penalties.\n  I know the Wellstone amendment was perceived by some of my colleagues \nas an effort to undermine the welfare law and had little business being \nattached to a Higher Education Act. I am sorry that these colleagues \ndecided to frame this issue in such a way. This was an amendment about \neducation. This was an amendment about education. Education is the key \nto helping parents escape the low-paying jobs that only perpetuate the \nwelfare wheel. If these single mothers have just a little more time to \nget an education, they will be able to compete for higher paying jobs \nwhich will help them keep their families from sinking.\n  Although I will not be here next year, I am heartened by the fact \nthat there will be joint hearings on this issue and that my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Paul Wellstone, will continue to advocate for \nthis change.\n  I urge my colleagues to learn more about this pressing problem, pay \nfull attention to these hearings, and talk to people in your State. I \nbelieve that my colleagues will find that this is a commonsense fix \nthat will improve the welfare law. As someone who voted for this bill, \nI reiterate the Wellstone amendment was not about trying to undo \nwelfare reform, but an attempt to help single mothers caught in a \nCatch-22. The Wellstone amendment is about helping families help \nthemselves. I hope my colleagues will look beyond party lines next year \nand do the right thing.\n  I thank my friend from Minnesota and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know the time in the Senate for my \ncolleague, Senator Ford, is limited. But I want to say to him, when we \nreceived 56 votes for this amendment on the floor of the Senate, in the \naftermath of that a lot of people were just thrilled around the \ncountry, especially a lot of these mothers and a lot of the higher \neducation community and a lot of States like Kentucky, and others that \nwanted to allow mothers to complete 2 years of education. I am not \nnaive about this. I don't think we would have ever gotten the 56 votes \nif not for the voice of Senator Ford.\n  I wish he would not be leaving here. I don't think there is anybody \nmore respected. I know we all come out here on the floor and we say \nthese things about one another. But, you know what, I am sure most of \nthe time it is sincere, but in the case of Senator Ford, when I hear \nhim speak I just wish he wasn't leaving.\n  I think what happened with him and certainly what happened with me is \nI would travel in Minnesota and I would go to community colleges and \nmaybe speak at a gathering. Maybe there would be a couple of hundred \nstudents, the majority of them were women, most of them were older, \nmost of them were going back to school, and a good number of them were \nsingle parents. Their plea was: Please, Senator Wellstone, the only \nthing we are asking is try and let us finish our 2 years here.\n  Mr. FORD. May I say to my good friend, I found the same thing, too. \nWe have several community colleges around the State. I have not talked \nto an employer yet who said he would not prefer to have an employee \nthat was better educated. I have never talked to those from academia \nwho would not tell me that at least, the minimum, 2 years of education \nwould give, particularly a single-parent mother, the opportunity to \nsecure the $10.91 per hour that was necessary to keep that family out \nof poverty. That is just a little over $19,000 a year to take care of \nthree people. That does not sound like much. But you give them an \nopportunity to earn and compete. That is what this bill is all about, I \nthought, under welfare.\n  So, somehow, some way, our colleagues are going to have to understand \nthe employer wants a better educated employee; the single-parent mother \nparticularly wants to be able to get out of poverty and get away from \nthat cycle. Whatever you can do next year--you don't have to have a \nstudy to understand that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No.\n  Mr. FORD. I don't understand. They just tried to throw a wet blanket \non it to say it was undoing welfare reform because, after we have had \nit in place for 2 years we found there was a kink in it? I didn't know \nthat we were perfect.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the other thing that was interesting, \nthis amendment just allows States to do this if they want to. No State \nwas required to. Any State that thought it would be better for many of \nthese women and children and their families, to allow these women to \nfinish 2 years of education so they get a better job and their children \nwould be better off, would be allowed to do so.\n  I will just say to my colleague from Kentucky, I was there in the \nconference committee. I think it was punitive for this amendment to be \neliminated. I never heard anybody make a credible argument against it, \nI really didn't. There was not any credible argument made against it. I \nsaid here this morning, and I will say it one more time, I think this \nsmall story tells the larger story, the same Republican majority in the \nHouse, as we look to the elections in the fall, the same Republican \nmajority in the same week in June--one more time, this bears \nrepeating--voted to give a tax break to people with estates worth more \nthan $17 million and at the same time voted to eliminate the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program and eliminate summer jobs for kids.\n  This is a kind of meanness that I think is just simply not the best \nfor America. I want to say to all of my colleagues, I am going to \nreally miss having Senator Ford with me. The first bill that comes out \nhere, the first vehicle--if it is tomorrow, it is tomorrow; if it is \nnext week, it is next week; if it is after, in January or February--I \nam going to be coming right back with this amendment again, right back \nwith this amendment again. Because all across our country there are a \nlot of these women who have just essentially been driven out of school.\n  I cannot believe that is what we are doing. There is not one person I \nknow,\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\njust on the basis of common wisdom about this, who doesn't know that a \nmother and her children are going to be better off if those mothers are \nallowed to complete 2 years of higher education. So we will be back. We \nwill be back and we will pass this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I, again, will just finish speaking about this \namendment if I refer to Latashie Brown, who is a single mother in her \nthirties from Minnesota. She decided to return to college to enhance \nher nursing skills and improve her earning power.\n  You have a single mother, she wants to go back to school, it is 2 \nyears to get that associate's degree to go into nursing, to be a \nnursing assistant. And too many women like Miss Brown are just \nessentially being told you have to leave school because the States get \npenalized for not meeting the work requirements. We will be back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11091-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11093-S11095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to bring up one other \nmatter on the floor today because we are in another fight. You know, it \nseems like, with about 2 weeks to go, there is a whole lot that is \nactually going on here in the Congress. I think the tragedy of it is \npeople may not be aware of all of it. But I will tell you, one issue \nthat people in Minnesota, especially the farmers and people in greater \nMinnesota, are well aware of--we have a crisis in agriculture. We have \na lot of people who are faced with record-low prices. There is no way \nfarmers can cash-flow on the basis of $1.40 a bushel of corn.\n  Those farmers are being driven off the land. As those farmers get \ndriven off the land, that is the death knell for many of our rural \ncommunities because it is those family farmers who live in those \ncommunities and buy in those communities that support our schools and \nsupport our small businesses and support our churches and support our \nsynagogues--you name it. That is what is happening.\n  We put together a $7 billion package. Senator Baucus from Montana was \npart of that effort. I was hopeful because, whereas before our August \nrecess I heard Senators come to the floor and say ``stay the course.'' \nThe Freedom to Farm bill--which I call the Freedom to Fail bill--it is \nthe market. Stay the course. Stay the course.\n  I was thinking to myself, it is easy for people here to say ``stay \nthe course'' while farmers in Minnesota are just being driven off their \nland.\n  That changed. Now, finally I think, at least I hope that everybody \nrecognizes there is a crisis out there. I also believe that many people \nrealize this Freedom to Fail bill is not working. We just eliminated \nthe leverage for farmers to get a fair price in the marketplace. We \ncapped the loan rate at $1.89 for a bushel of corn.\n  What in the world are we doing supporting a piece of legislation that \nkeeps prices down when prices have plummeted to the point where you \ncould be the best farmer in the world and you cannot make it?\n  So we put together a $7 billion package that has indemnity payments \nfor farmers that have experienced crop failure and have had to deal \nwith scab disease, had to deal with terrible weather like wet weather \nin Northwest Minnesota, and we did a couple of other things, the most \nimportant of which was to take the cap off the loan rate so that we \ncould get the prices up and have some kind of safety net for farmers \nwho otherwise are going to go under.\n\n  Mr. President, we had a farm rally in Worthington, MN, just Saturday \na week ago--not this past Saturday. There were petitions--I won't \ninclude them in the Record because there are too many--there were \npetitions that were passed out that talked about the importance of a \nfair price for family farmers.\n  I thank all of the farmers and small business people and lenders who \ncame to this rally--almost 1,000 people were there--in Worthington. \nThese petitions are going out all across our State. Ted Winter, who is \nhouse majority leader, a farmer himself, has been one of the people who \nhas taken the lead.\n  This is a plea from Main Street businesses in rural America, a plea \nfrom family farmers, a plea from rural citizens. They are saying to \npeople in the U.S. Senate, ``We are not asking for a handout, we are \nasking for a fair shake. We are asking you to take some action that \ncorrects a major deficiency in a piece of legislation you passed''--the \nfreedom to fail bill--``which is great for the grain companies but puts \nus family farmers under.''\n  What we got yesterday by the same Republican majority that I was \ntalking about earlier--you talk about partisanship. I don't know if it \nis partisanship on the floor of the Senate right now or just an honest-\nto-goodness debate. I argue that any majority that gives away a break \nto people who have over $17 million estates and cuts low-income energy \nassistance--those are priorities that are distorted priorities. I don't \nthink that is the goodness of our country.\n  I argue that any majority that eliminates an educational opportunity \nfor a single parent and her children--that is punitive.\n  And I argue that this package that was put together yesterday in the \nag appropriations conference committee shut out--I say to my colleague \nfrom Montana--shut out the Democratic proposal. It is way too little, \nway too late, doesn't get the price up, deficient in all sorts of ways, \nand will not do the job. It is like my Republican colleagues in the \nHouse and the Senate labored mightily and produced a mouse. It is an \ninsult.\n  We will on Thursday--Yom Kippur is tomorrow; it is a religious \nholiday for some of us--Thursday we will have a motion to recommit this \nto the conference committee. We will keep coming back and fighting it.\n  I say to family farmers in Minnesota, ``Look, $4 billion doesn't get \nthe price up, it isn't targeted, it helps landowners, not necessarily \nproducers, doesn't help soybean growers, doesn't deal with the real \nissue.''\n  People are not looking for handouts. They are not looking for more \npayments. They want to get the price up. I say to farmers in Minnesota, \n``Look, I have given this everything I have--everything I have,'' or \n``everything I had,'' if it is in the past tense. I will tell you that \nwhatever is out there is just not going to do the job. I refuse to be a \npart of a phony argument where we pretend like we have come up with \nsome agricultural crisis relief bill that does not provide the \nnecessary relief for people so they can stay on their land and farm \ntheir land. This is not going to do the job.\n  You can say, ``Well, but this goes part of the way.'' I suppose a \nquarter of a loaf of bread is better than none, but I am not going to \nbe party to the argument that this is going to help the farmers or is \nanywhere near commensurate to the task before us.\n  The President has said that he is going to veto this. The \nadministration is hanging in there tough. Let me tell you, Mr. \nPresident, I don't always agree with you on policies. I am a Democrat \nand quite often in disagreement with some of what the administration \ndoes. But I give credit where credit is due.\n  I am glad the President is hanging tough on this. I am glad that the \nPresident and the Vice President and Secretary Glickman--especially \nSecretary Glickman--are there for family farmers. I hope he vetoes \nthis, and then I hope we sit down at the bargaining table and come back \nwith a farm relief package that really provides relief.\n  I am tired of symbolic politics. We get ourselves in big trouble when \nwe pretend like we put something together that is going to do the job. \nThe Democrats' proposal, I say to my colleague from Montana, was barely \na start. It was the best we felt we could do. It did not get the prices \nup there. It did not get the relief there. It was not all that we \nneeded to do, but it was a credible start.\n  What has come out of this agricultural appropriations conference \ncommittee by the Republican majority--let me go on record and say \nthis--is not a great step forward, it is a great leap sideways. It is \nnot a step forward for family farmers, it is a great leap sideways. The \nfamily farmers in Minnesota and the people in greater Minnesota deserve \nbetter. They deserve better, and I am going to keep on fighting and \nraising heck on the floor of the Senate and in every other way I can \nuntil they get better. I believe I will be joined by many of my other \ncolleagues as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a very eloquent piece by\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nSteve Calvin, ``We need to reconnect with the food supply,'' which was \npublished in the Minnesota Star Tribune today, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Minnesota Star Tribune, Sept. 29, 1998]\n\n                 We Need To Reconnect With Food Supply\n\n                           (By Steve Calvin)\n\n       The recent Great Upper Midwest Farm Price Crisis Rally was \n     held at the Nobles County fairground in my hometown of \n     Worthington, Minn. It was attended by sympathetic Democratic \n     politicians and a small but enthusiastic crowd of 750 \n     farmers. The invited Republican office holders had other \n     priorities.\n       At a time when the ``crisis'' label is too widely used, \n     there is agreement that the current farm situation is a \n     disaster to rival the one that occurred in the 1980s. It is \n     particularly ironic that this comes during a year when crop \n     yields are bountiful. Yet this abundant harvest will likely \n     be followed by foreclosures and personal tragedies.\n       There are many reasons for the current desperate situation. \n     As usual, political hay is being made. Democrats blame the \n     1996 farm bill that gradually removed farm subsidies. \n     Republicans say that the rationale for ending government \n     involvement in agriculture is sound and that unforeseen \n     global financial disruption dried up export markets. Truth is \n     always more complicated than sound bites.\n       Though I was born in southwestern Minnesota, I grew up \n     elsewhere and now live in the Twin Cities. I kept in touch \n     with my roots through my grandfathers, who farmed for a \n     combined 100 years. Five years ago I resisted the cabin-up-\n     north urge and bought a farm down south. Though a small \n     operation, it is currently home to a productively grazing \n     flock of sheep and herd of cattle. However, my best \n     credential for a comment on the farm crisis is that I am \n     concerned about the source and security of our food supply.\n       Although fewer than 2 percent of Americans are engaged in \n     agriculture, the family farm is still enshrined in our \n     national psyche. Very few have a physical place where we can \n     reconnect with our rural roots. The popularity of the animal \n     barns at the State Fair is no surprise. Even though most of \n     us could never tolerate the privations and efforts required \n     of farming a generation ago we have a deep longing for what \n     it represents. But farming has changed.\n       Developments in technology have reshaped agriculture. As \n     always, change is doubled edged. A family farm may now \n     encompass more than 1,000 acres. In 1950 this would have \n     required three or four farm families. The consolidation has \n     come at a price. Sometimes the advice to get big or get out \n     trapped farmers in massive and ruinous debt. Thus the call \n     for federal assistance.\n       The proper role of government in agriculture has always \n     been hotly debated. My maternal grandfather and my great \n     uncle were best of friends except when it came to that \n     question. Grandpa saw the New Deal as the root of corruption \n     of independent farming. Uncle Paul thought that government \n     should guarantee the price of production. In their retirement \n     the debate was suspended for reasons of health and family \n     peace.\n       Whatever else they are, government programs are \n     complicated. As the owners of 43 acres that were already \n     enrolled in support programs, my wife and I receive the \n     modest diminishing yearly payments of the 1996 Freedom to \n     Farm Act. We have used the money for conservation projects. \n     We also receive the voluminous regulations of the program. \n     The dozen-plus years of postgraduate education that my wife \n     and I share give us no help in understanding them.\n       Is the future agricultural landscape destined to be one of \n     industrial mega-farms, dotted with a few decorative hobby \n     farms? I hope not. If we are to have an agriculture that is \n     safe, local, environmentally sound and affordable, government \n     must serve as the impartial referee. The difficult debate \n     will be in defining fair rules. The current situation favors \n     the interests of agribusiness. Because of the influence that \n     money has on the political system, change will be difficult.\n       On the other hand, farmers will not be guaranteed an income \n     by federal programs. Those who plan to be farming very far \n     into the next century will have to do so in innovative ways. \n     Agricultural writers such as Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson and \n     Gene Logsdon outline a future that includes a mosaic of \n     profitable family farms across America. These farms will \n     require a return to diverse enterprises and sustainable \n     practices.\n       Nonfarming Americans have a stake in this too. That we pay \n     such a small percentage of our incomes for food has lulled us \n     into a false sense of security. We must reconnect with our \n     food supply. This can be done by frequenting local farmers' \n     markets and by joining the burgeoning community-supported \n     agricultural movement, where product and meat can be obtained \n     directly from farmers. We must know more about our food \n     source than the location of the nearest food warehouse. \n     Ignoring the current farm crisis may bring us closer to a \n     much more dangerous food crisis.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will conclude my statement by quoting \nthe third to the last paragraph from the commentary of Dr. Calvin, who \nis a physician and a farmer:\n\n       Is the future agricultural landscape destined to be one of \n     industrial mega-farms, dotted with a few decorative hobby \n     farms?

Because of the influence that \n     money has on the political system, change will be difficult.\n\n  That is true, change will be difficult, but not for a moment, those \nof us who come from States like Minnesota, do we intend to give up on \nthis fight. The family farm structure of agriculture and food policy is \nour most precious priority. We have just begun to fight on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota controls the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield the 7 minutes I have, and \nperhaps if the Senator needs more, the Senator from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, will yield some of his, but I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are under an order up to 3:15 p.m., with 1 \nhour equally divided between the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator \nfrom Vermont. The Senator from Minnesota has 6 minutes 30 seconds left.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the Senate business at the conclusion of that \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I apologize, I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 minutes left.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, first I will chime in and praise the Senator from \nMinnesota. He is a fighter. As all the residents of Minnesota know and \npeople across the country know, if there is anybody who is fighting for \npeople's interests and to help people in America--it is the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  He is particularly right, in this Senator's view, when it comes to \nthe action taken last night by the agriculture appropriations committee \nand their failure to report out legislation that in some modicum way, \nin a bipartisan way, helps give some encouragement to American farmers. \nAs the Senator knows even better than I, costs facing our farmers and \nranchers have just continually risen over the years. Pickup trucks, \ncombines, farm equipment is out of sight and so expensive.\n  At the same time, the price that farmers get for their products, \ncommodities has just plummeted. In fact, at least in my State of \nMontana--I am sure it is the same for the Senator's State in \nMinnesota--we face wheat prices of $2, $2 a bushel, with freight rates \nsometimes $1 a bushel, which has to come off of the $2, so that means \nthe farmer is only receiving about $1 a bushel for wheat, which is \nnowhere close to breaking even. You need about $5, $6--at least these \ndays--just to break even in farm country.\n  I just want to again thank the Senator. He is a real champion when it \ncomes to helping people. And I just want to let people know, who might \nbe listening, just what a fine Senator he is and how he works so hard \nfor people and people's interests.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I just say to Senator Baucus, thank you very much.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise on another issue. And depending \nupon whether the Senator from Vermont comes back, we will just kind of \nplay this by ear on timing.\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11093-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11093-S11095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to bring up one other \nmatter on the floor today because we are in another fight. You know, it \nseems like, with about 2 weeks to go, there is a whole lot that is \nactually going on here in the Congress. I think the tragedy of it is \npeople may not be aware of all of it. But I will tell you, one issue \nthat people in Minnesota, especially the farmers and people in greater \nMinnesota, are well aware of--we have a crisis in agriculture. We have \na lot of people who are faced with record-low prices. There is no way \nfarmers can cash-flow on the basis of $1.40 a bushel of corn.\n  Those farmers are being driven off the land. As those farmers get \ndriven off the land, that is the death knell for many of our rural \ncommunities because it is those family farmers who live in those \ncommunities and buy in those communities that support our schools and \nsupport our small businesses and support our churches and support our \nsynagogues--you name it. That is what is happening.\n  We put together a $7 billion package. Senator Baucus from Montana was \npart of that effort. I was hopeful because, whereas before our August \nrecess I heard Senators come to the floor and say ``stay the course.'' \nThe Freedom to Farm bill--which I call the Freedom to Fail bill--it is \nthe market. Stay the course. Stay the course.\n  I was thinking to myself, it is easy for people here to say ``stay \nthe course'' while farmers in Minnesota are just being driven off their \nland.\n  That changed. Now, finally I think, at least I hope that everybody \nrecognizes there is a crisis out there. I also believe that many people \nrealize this Freedom to Fail bill is not working. We just eliminated \nthe leverage for farmers to get a fair price in the marketplace. We \ncapped the loan rate at $1.89 for a bushel of corn.\n  What in the world are we doing supporting a piece of legislation that \nkeeps prices down when prices have plummeted to the point where you \ncould be the best farmer in the world and you cannot make it?\n  So we put together a $7 billion package that has indemnity payments \nfor farmers that have experienced crop failure and have had to deal \nwith scab disease, had to deal with terrible weather like wet weather \nin Northwest Minnesota, and we did a couple of other things, the most \nimportant of which was to take the cap off the loan rate so that we \ncould get the prices up and have some kind of safety net for farmers \nwho otherwise are going to go under.\n\n  Mr. President, we had a farm rally in Worthington, MN, just Saturday \na week ago--not this past Saturday. There were petitions--I won't \ninclude them in the Record because there are too many--there were \npetitions that were passed out that talked about the importance of a \nfair price for family farmers.\n  I thank all of the farmers and small business people and lenders who \ncame to this rally--almost 1,000 people were there--in Worthington. \nThese petitions are going out all across our State. Ted Winter, who is \nhouse majority leader, a farmer himself, has been one of the people who \nhas taken the lead.\n  This is a plea from Main Street businesses in rural America, a plea \nfrom family farmers, a plea from rural citizens. They are saying to \npeople in the U.S. Senate, ``We are not asking for a handout, we are \nasking for a fair shake. We are asking you to take some action that \ncorrects a major deficiency in a piece of legislation you passed''--the \nfreedom to fail bill--``which is great for the grain companies but puts \nus family farmers under.''\n  What we got yesterday by the same Republican majority that I was \ntalking about earlier--you talk about partisanship. I don't know if it \nis partisanship on the floor of the Senate right now or just an honest-\nto-goodness debate. I argue that any majority that gives away a break \nto people who have over $17 million estates and cuts low-income energy \nassistance--those are priorities that are distorted priorities. I don't \nthink that is the goodness of our country.\n  I argue that any majority that eliminates an educational opportunity \nfor a single parent and her children--that is punitive.\n  And I argue that this package that was put together yesterday in the \nag appropriations conference committee shut out--I say to my colleague \nfrom Montana--shut out the Democratic proposal. It is way too little, \nway too late, doesn't get the price up, deficient in all sorts of ways, \nand will not do the job. It is like my Republican colleagues in the \nHouse and the Senate labored mightily and produced a mouse. It is an \ninsult.\n  We will on Thursday--Yom Kippur is tomorrow; it is a religious \nholiday for some of us--Thursday we will have a motion to recommit this \nto the conference committee. We will keep coming back and fighting it.\n  I say to family farmers in Minnesota, ``Look, $4 billion doesn't get \nthe price up, it isn't targeted, it helps landowners, not necessarily \nproducers, doesn't help soybean growers, doesn't deal with the real \nissue.''\n  People are not looking for handouts. They are not looking for more \npayments. They want to get the price up. I say to farmers in Minnesota, \n``Look, I have given this everything I have--everything I have,'' or \n``everything I had,'' if it is in the past tense. I will tell you that \nwhatever is out there is just not going to do the job. I refuse to be a \npart of a phony argument where we pretend like we have come up with \nsome agricultural crisis relief bill that does not provide the \nnecessary relief for people so they can stay on their land and farm \ntheir land.

In fact, at least in my State of \nMontana--I am sure it is the same for the Senator's State in \nMinnesota--we face wheat prices of $2, $2 a bushel, with freight rates \nsometimes $1 a bushel, which has to come off of the $2, so that means \nthe farmer is only receiving about $1 a bushel for wheat, which is \nnowhere close to breaking even. You need about $5, $6--at least these \ndays--just to break even in farm country.\n  I just want to again thank the Senator. He is a real champion when it \ncomes to helping people. And I just want to let people know, who might \nbe listening, just what a fine Senator he is and how he works so hard \nfor people and people's interests.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I just say to Senator Baucus, thank you very much.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise on another issue. And depending \nupon whether the Senator from Vermont comes back, we will just kind of \nplay this by ear on timing.\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11093-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11095-S11098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at some point soon the Senate must either \nreturn to the consideration of the Interior appropriations bill or else \nconsider an omnibus bill that includes provisions relating to the \nappropriations for the Interior Department or, dare I say, at a time \nwhen perhaps the Interior appropriations bill would come to the Senate, \nnot directly to the floor, but via a conference report, where the \nconference report is not debatable. But when any of those events occur, \nwe are going to face the issue of antienvironmental riders which are \ncurrently in the Senate Interior appropriations bill. In anticipation \nof that debate, I will take some time this afternoon to explain why I \nand several of my colleagues intend to offer an amendment that would \ndelete many of those riders.\n  Three years ago, there was an attempt to fill appropriations bills \nwith various riders--you know, those attachments that go on to \nappropriations bills that have virtually nothing to do with the bill--\nriders that made very controversial changes to our Nation's \nenvironmental laws: riders that would weaken, for example, the Clean \nWater Act, weaken the Clean Air Act, slow down the cleanup of hazardous \nwaste sites, and prevent the protection of any more endangered species.\n  We all remember what happened. The President vetoed the bills, \ndemanding that the riders be deleted. Congress refused. There was a \nstandoff. The Government was shut down. A fierce public backlash \noccurred, not only against the Government shutdown, but also against \nthe effort to lace appropriations bills with antienvironmental riders.\n  After that, we seemed to have learned our lesson. Chairman Stevens \nurged us to ``get on with our work'' and get the appropriations bills \npassed. We pretty much did, keeping controversial riders out of most of \nthe appropriations bills.\n  A few weeks ago that changed. When we took up the Interior Department \nappropriations bill it became, as Yogi Berra said, ``deja vu all over \nagain.'' The anti-environmental riders are back. The Interior \nappropriations bill that the Senate was considering just a short while \nago is replete with controversial provisions that would weaken the \nprotection of our environment and environmental laws, our water, our \nforests and parks, and our wildlife.\n  The administration objects to about two dozen of the riders in this \nbill. It says it is an attempt to roll back environmental protection. \nThe amendment that I and several other Senators plan to offer is much \nmore focused. It strikes only eight of the most egregious \nantienvironment riders. Let me describe them. I will be brief because I \nand perhaps some other Senators will discuss each of these at a future \ndate in more detail.\n  The first rider locks in new and existing rulings for commercial \nfishing at Glacier Bay National Park, AK. It jeopardizes the protection \nof one of the crown jewels of our national park system.\n  The second rider grants a right-of-way to build a road through the \nIzembek National Wildlife Refuge and Wilderness, also in Alaska. For \nthe first time ever, Congress would allow a road to be built through a \nwilderness area.\n  The third rider prevents the Forest Service from decommissioning any \nof its authorized roads until it has dealt with every mile of \nunauthorized roads, the so-called ghost roads. This, in effect, would \nmake it impossible for the Forest Service to manage the National \nForest/Road System to protect public safety and the environment.\n  The fourth and fifth riders prevent the Forest Service from revising \nany more forest lands until the Forest Service publishes comprehensive \nnew planning rules. What is the effect of this? It would lock in old, \noutdated plans that no longer reflect how our citizens want their \nforests to be managed.\n  The sixth rider requires the Forest Service to sell 90 percent of the \nallowable sale quantity of harvestable timber from one national forest, \nand one only. That is the Tongass, in Alaska. This would create a \nunique entitlement to take public timber from that one forest.\n  The seventh rider prohibits the reintroduction of grizzly bears in \nMontana and Idaho, disrupting a locally oriented public process \ndesigned to answer the very question of whether and how reintroduction \nshould occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to use the time that has been \nallotted to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The eighth rider prohibits changes to the management and operation of \nany dam in the Columbia River Basin without congressional approval. \nThat would override environmental laws, make it impossible to protect \nthe salmon and other endangered species, and establish congressional \nmicromanagement of one of the largest river systems in the world.\n  I have been in the Senate for about 20 years. I like to think that I \nunderstand the appropriations process pretty well. And in some cases it \nis perfectly acceptable to make policy changes in an appropriations \nbill, for example, where there is a broad consensus or an emergency. I \nhave supported provisions like that, and every Senator here has \nprobably done the same. But that is not what we are talking about here.\n  We are talking about a slew of riders that go way too far, making \ndramatic and controversial changes in our environmental laws. In some \ncases, the riders micromanage the agencies. In other cases, they \nsubstitute a one-size-fits-all Washington, DC, decision for a decision \nthat balances national concerns with the concerns of local residents. \nIn still other cases they improperly favor special interests at the \nexpense of the national interests.\n  Some Senators will no doubt disagree with my characterization of \nthese riders. They will argue, well, this or that rider is good public \npolicy, justified on the merits. As with most issues that we debate \naround here, there will be serious arguments on both sides. But that is \npart of the problem. There are serious arguments on both sides.\n  Each of the riders involve important and complex natural resource \nissues. These issues require close attention and careful consideration \nas part of the regular legislative process. But instead, they have been \ntucked away in a 200-page appropriations bill, or what probably will be \na much, much longer omnibus bill, that we are rushing to enact before \nthe end of the fiscal year--only days away. And if rumors of an \nunamendable omnibus appropriations bill conference report are true, the \nSenate may never get to the debate or vote on any of these riders.\n  It is, to my mind, not the way to do business. We all know what is \ngoing on. These riders cannot stand up on their own merits. They cannot \nstand up on their own merits in the full light of day. The public does \nnot support them. And the President does not support them. So the \nadvocates resort to an appropriations rider.\n  This is not what people expect of us. Time and time again, folks back \nhome tell us how upset they are with these kinds of riders. I hear it \nall the time. I am sure other Senators do, too. You know what? People \nare right. They certainly are in this case.\n  There is another problem with these particular riders, and that is \nthat they are a poison pill. They will kill the Interior appropriations \nbill. Let us not forget the Interior appropriations bill is an \nimportant bill for all States, but particularly for Western States like \nMontana. It provides funds for our national parks, our forests, \nwilderness areas, and other public lands.\n  Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd and Senator Gorton have done a great \njob with all the other parts of the bill. I do not want to overlook \nthat, not for a moment. They have worked very, very hard. And I commend \nthem for it. Frankly, I do not understand how they do it, how they find \nthe time or the patience of balancing all the competing interests--\nfunding our natural resource agencies, funding tribal programs that are \nso critical to Native Americans, resolving the controversy over the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  They have done too much good work for us to allow these riders to \nsully and probably sink the bill. But that is what is going to happen.\n\n  Let me talk a little bit about the official version of what the \nadministration says, the bureaucratic version.\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\n The administration's statement on the bill says that because of \ninadequate appropriations levels and because of various riders, ``The \nPresident's senior advisers recommended that he veto the bill as \nrepresented to him in its current form.''\n  Now I will relate the practical version. We all know what this means: \nUnless this bill is cleaned up, it will be vetoed. And we will be back \nwhere we were 3 years ago, facing a veto, gridlock, political shutdown; \nfurthermore, if these riders find their way into an omnibus \nappropriations bill they will only compound the mayhem, which will be \nan affront to open, responsible, representative government.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues from Alaska and the State of \nWashington, the chairman of the committee and the subcommittee. They \nare good friends. They are good Senators. They are very good advocates. \nOn the issues critical to the West, I am honored to work with them very \nclosely.\n  With due respect, however, I believe these riders go too far. They \nweaken environmental laws. They undermine sound stewardship of our \nnatural resources. For that reason, these riders don't belong in the \nInterior appropriations bill. They don't belong in the omnibus bill, \neither. They should be deleted.\n  When the time comes, I will offer an amendment to do just that.\n  Mr. President, one of the riders that my amendment would delete is \nsection 120 of the Interior Appropriations bill, which prevents the \nPark Service from limiting commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National \nPark in Alaska.\n  I have a map of Glacier Bay National Park. Where is Glacier Bay? It \nis northwest of the Tongass Forest, in the southeastern part of Alaska. \nGlacier Bay National Monument was established in 1925 by a Presidential \nproclamation, expanded in 1939, and in 1980 it was redesignated as a \nNational Park and Preserve by the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act.\n  Now, I haven't been there, but I understand it is one of the crown \njewels of our National Park System. The area is basically all that is \nincluded within this pink line. This is all Glacier National Park and \nPreserve--one of the largest national parks, encompassing 3.3 million \nacres, including Glacier Bay here and the surrounding waters.\n  Thousands of visitors come to the park each year for its tidewater \nglaciers, its abundant marine life, its scenery and outstanding \nwilderness qualities. A lot of tour boats come up here to visit the \nJohns Hopkins inlet here. It is hard to see this small photo in the \nupper right corner, so here is a larger copy of it. This is a \nphotograph of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. This is a tour \nboat down here, and this is to give you an example of the spectacular \nscenery that occurs up in Glacier Bay.\n  It also provides tremendous opportunities for scientists to study the \nmarine environment, including the humpback whales. These creatures--\nhere is a photo of one in Glacier Bay--feed in the bay during the \nsummer months.\n  Commercial fishing has been illegal in the park since 1966. For many \nyears that prohibition was not enforced, largely out of concern for the \ncommercial fishermen. As a result, commercial fishing still occurs in \nand around Glacier Bay.\n  Let me add that this issue is not about subsistence fishing in the \nPark. Fishing for personal use, whether by Natives or other local \nresidents, is allowed in the park; the proposed rule by the Park \nService would not change that. The real issue here is commercial \nfishing.\n  Since 1966, there have been growing concerns about the effects \ncommercial fishing was having on the Park, its unique natural \nresources, and on the hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Park \neach year. For example, in the late 1970s, the Park Service noticed a \nsharp decrease in the number of humpback whales that used the Park \nduring the summer months. To help protect them, the Park Service \nprohibited commercial fishing in the bay for shrimp and other species \non which whales feed. We will get the map of Glacier Bay up here again. \nIt prohibited commercial fishing here within Glacier Bay.\n  The Park also provides a unique refuge for hundreds of thousands of \npeople who visit Glacier Bay each year. In the last 10 years, the \nnumber of visitors to the Park has doubled. Many of those visitors come \nto experience solitude and quiet and escape from modern civilization. \nCommercial fishing is inconsistent with that wilderness experience.\n  In 1997, the Park Service tried to balance all the competing \ninterests in the Park and proposed regulations that would allow \ncommercial fishing in some areas, phase it out in other areas, and \nprohibit it altogether in a few other areas.\n  More than a thousand written comments have already been received. I \nwill tell you where it is allowed and where it is prohibited. \nBasically, commercial fishing will be phased out in the bay. It will be \nprohibited in several small inlets, and there are about five of them. \nIt will be allowed just outside of the bay here, still within the line; \nthat is, coastal fishing would still be allowed.\n  At this point, I might say, Mr. President, that 70 percent of all the \ncommercial fish are caught outside the bay, not inside the bay. So what \nI am really saying is, even though in 1966 commercial fishing was \nprohibited--and it has not been enforced since 1966--the new rule \nproposed by the Park Service would phase out commercial fishing over 15 \nyears within the bay only, and it would allow fishing outside the bay, \nin the coastal area right along the land here. And a full 70 percent of \nthe fishing is outside the bay.\n  In the meantime, more than a thousand written comments have been \nreceived since the publication of the proposed rule. The comment period \ndoesn't close until November. Final rules are due out next year.\n  That is where the rider comes in. Section 120 of the appropriations \nbill prevents the National Park Service from finalizing the proposed \nrule. Worse, it even prevents the Service from enforcing existing \nprohibitions against commercial fishing in the Park, such as the \nprohibition adopted in 1985 to protect endangered humpback whales, as \nlong as the fishing complies with State laws and regulations.\n  I understand the concern that the Alaska Senators and others have \nthat the fishermen and their families will be affected by these \nlimitations on commercial fishing. But I believe the rider takes the \nwrong approach, for four reasons:\n  First, Glacier Bay National Park is a very special place, like \nYellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park in Montana. In \nfact, Glacier Bay National Park is our country's largest marine \nprotected area, with over 600,000 acres of marine waters. That is \nnearly the size of Rhode Island. So we have to make an extra effort to \nprotect the Park, its whales, seals, and sea lions, and the wilderness \nexperience many visitors are seeking.\n  Second, there are serious concerns about the effects of commercial \nfishing. For example, commercial shrimp harvesting can reduce the food \nsupply for humpback whales. The Park is also an important laboratory \nfor studying how natural marine ecosystems can function. But it is very \ndifficult to study a natural system if it is being fished \ncommercially--in this case, to the tune of 4 million pounds of fish \neach year. If the Park Service cannot finalize the new rules or even \nenforce the existing prohibition, then this rider will put at risk the \nPark's marine resources.\n  Mr. President, I have a chart here that is a little wordy, and I \napologize for that. It says, ``The Effects of Proposed Moratorium.'' \nFirst, the effect on natural resources. It will prevent the Park from \nachieving its purpose as a marine-protected area; it won't be protected \nanymore. It would also allow trawling and other commercial fisheries \nthat have been prohibited since 1985. It would allow commercial fishing \nin a congressionally designated wilderness area. Second, it will also \nadversely affect scientific research because the park is a laboratory \nfor scientific study. Finally, the rider prevents the Park Service from \ncompleting a fair and open planning and rulemaking process. It just \nsays: This is it, folks. No rule. This is it. The rider will stop the \nPark Service from implementing a proposed rule to balance local, \nregional and national interests.\n  The third reason I am opposed to this rule is that I think we need a \nbalanced\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\napproach. We will have to see what is in the final regulation. We don't \nknow what is going to be in it. But the proposed rule tries to balance \nthe need to protect the Park's resources with the need to treat \ncommercial fishermen fairly. Again, commercial fishing would be allowed \noutside the bay where 70 percent of the fish are caught.\n  The proposed rule is balanced, I think, because it divides the area \ninto three parts. It allows commercial fishing to continue in marine \nwaters outside the bay itself. As I have already mentioned, that is out \nhere. It does, though, phase out commercial fishing inside the bay over \n15 years. And it closes five wilderness areas--including Beardslee \nIslands, Adams Inlet, Rendu Inlet, Hugh Miller Inlet Complex, and part \nof Dundas Bay--to commercial fishing in order to comply with the \nWilderness Act because these areas, I believe, are within the \nwilderness system.\n  On the other hand, I must point out the rider will allow commercial \nfishing anywhere in the Park, as long as it complies with State law. In \neffect, the rider would turn over management of the Park's fish \nresources to the State.\n  Finally, the best way to get to a balanced solution, I think, is with \nlots of public input and review. The proposed rules have been developed \nthrough a fair, lengthy and open process, and with ample opportunity \nfor public input. I will put up a chart that shows that.\n  Since April 1997, this chart shows all of the procedures that have \nbeen followed to allow people to comment on the proposed rule. The \npublic comment period has been extended several times, I might add. \nOver 1,200 written comments have been received to date, and there are \nstill 2 months to go. Furthermore, there have been numerous workshops, \nopen houses and hearings on the proposal.\n  Again, were it not for the rider, the final rule would probably be in \neffect sometime in 1999. There have been many, many opportunities for \npeople to comment.\n  Putting all of this together, I believe the best approach is to \ndelete the rider. That way the process of developing a balanced \nsolution can continue and we can protect Glacier Bay National Park for \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to turn to another section of the \nInterior Appropriations bill. This is section 126, which authorizes a \nright-of-way for construction of a road through the Izembek National \nWildlife Refuge and Wilderness. Let me explain why I believe this rider \nshould be deleted.\n  The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is on the Alaska peninsula, \napproximately 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It is a major stopover \non the Pacific flyway. The Refuge was established in 1960 and is an \ninternationally recognized refuge that provides vital habitat to \nhundreds of thousands of waterfowl, shore birds, and other migratory \nbirds. It also serves as a key denning area for the Alaska brown bear, \nand a primary migration route for the southern Alaska Peninsula Caribou \nherd. In 1980, Congress designated most of the refuge as wilderness.\n  This is a map of Alaska that gives you a sense of where the Izembek \nRefuge is located. We are talking about the Alaskan peninsula, and it \nwould be basically right in here. This is a blown-up area of this part \nof the Alaskan peninsula. There are two communities in the vicinity of \nIzembek: Cold Bay up here and King Cove in the lower right of this map.\n  King Cove has a population of about 800 people, and Cold Bay, a \npopulation of about 100. They are separated by approximately 20 miles \nof marine water. They are linked by commuter air service and by boats. \nHowever, in bad weather, emergency transportation by air from King Cove \nto Cold Bay is limited.\n  The State of Alaska is currently evaluating various alternatives to \nimprove transportation between these two communities, especially \ntransportation for emergency medical treatment. That is going on right \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time under morning business that has \npreviously been allotted has now expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to my good friend from Missouri \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wanted to ask, I need about 5 minutes to \nintroduce a bill. I wanted to find out if my good friend from Montana \nis going to wrap up; I didn't want to interfere. But if it would be \nagreeable with him, and with the manager of the energy and water bill, \nto briefly introduce a measure, I would ask my colleagues, if that \nwould accommodate them, if I could do that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say to my good friend I am about ready to wrap up \nthis section. It will take maybe about 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  I would point out that regular order is S. 442, and the motion to \nproceed that has been agreed to. Anybody seeking recognition will have \nto receive consent.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will yield, without losing my right to \nthe floor, to my good friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I don't need the Senator to yield to me. I wonder, \nwhen you are finished----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you want to ask for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator might want to ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for 5 minutes following the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When that is finished, I ask that I be recognized for 1 \nminute on a matter as if in morning business, and then to make a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, the State of Alaska is currently \nevaluating various alternatives to improve transportation between these \ntwo communities. One of the alternatives being studied is construction \nof a 30-mile road that would cut through 8 miles of the Izembek \nWilderness and 3 miles of nonwilderness refuge lands.\n  You can tell from the map here, this is where the road would be. And \nthis is the area of wilderness that would be affected. From King Cove, \naround the bay, up to Cold Bay. That is one alternative to be \nconsidered. Again, it would cut through 8 miles of wilderness and 3 \nmiles of nonwilderness refuge lands.\n  Section 126 of the bill establishes a 60-foot-wide swath through the \nrefuge for this road. In exchange, the bill adds 664 acres of adjacent \nlands to the refuge.\n  The avowed primary purpose of this rider is to improve public access \nto emergency medical services for the residents of King Cove. It is a \nserious problem, one that affects people's lives and health. I do not \ndeny that. But this is also about increasing convenience for local \nresidents and enhancing regional economic development.\n  My State also has vast distances and remote communities, although not \nas large a scale as in Alaska. So I am very sensitive to the concerns \nof the people of Alaska and certainly of the views of the Senators from \nAlaska.\n  However, I believe that the Izembek rider is the wrong solution to \nthe problem that occurs between King Cove and Cold Bay. First of all, \nthe rider establishes a very troubling precedent. Congress has never \nauthorized the construction of a road through a wilderness area, \ncertainly not as a rider to an appropriations bill. If we do so in this \ncase, it will be more difficult to hold the line in the future.\n  Second, this road would have serious environmental consequences. The \nimportance of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is internationally \nrecognized. It provides vital habitat to hundreds of thousands of \nwaterfowl, to\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\nbrown bears, and to caribou. Its location on the Alaska peninsula makes \nthe Refuge a critical resting and feeding ground for migratory \nwaterfowl that pass through Izembek each spring and fall.\n  This is a map which shows the migratory patterns of various waterfowl \nand other birds, such as the Black Brant--the purple line here. They \nstop here at Izembek. 100,000 Emperor Geese stop here in the spring and \nfall; 150,000 Black Brant, 85,000 Canadian Geese, 150,000 Steller's \nEider, and about 31 species of shore birds. These are the Arctic \nbreeding grounds in the summer, and parts of the year they go south to \nwinter. It is a very important refuge.\n  This rider, I might say, would cut this Refuge in half. It would \nfragment the coastal wetlands and tundra that are considered essential \nto many of these species. It would destroy the character of the \nwilderness area.\n  This, Mr. President, is the picture of a typical road in Alaska that \nwould be contemplated by this amendment. You can see what condition it \nis in. This is a very good road. In comparison, this is a road that now \nexists in part of the wilderness area. This is what is there now. This \nis what would be contemplated. As you can tell, it is a pretty good \nsize road. It is no small little cow path.\n  Third, and perhaps most significantly, there are many ways to address \nthe legitimate transportation problems at King Cove without violating \nthe Izembek Refuge: Coast Guard air evacuation is one; better port \nfacilities and special marine ambulances are another; as well as \ntelemedicine and other medical advances. After all, in bad weather, \nwith high winds and blowing snow, a road can be very risky and often \nimpassable.\n  In fact, I might read a letter from the Anchorage Daily News. It is a \ncitizen, Tara P. Fuller, who is from Cold Bay. I will put it in the \nRecord, but her basic point is that this is ridiculous, this amendment, \nthis rider, which would allow this road. Because, she says, often this \nroad would be totally impassable with snowdrifts. When storms come, the \nroad would have to be plowed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      Road No Help In Bad Weather\n\n       Regarding the King Cove-to-Cold Bay ``Rescue Road in \n     Alaska'':\n       As a lifelong resident of this area, I have some great \n     concerns with the proposed legislation to grant a right of \n     way for a 27-mile road from King Cove to Cold Bay, 10 miles \n     of which would be in Izembeck National Wildlife Refuge and \n     seven miles of which would be in the wilderness area.\n       To say this road is the only alternative to the health and \n     safety issue is ridiculous. How could this possibly be true? \n     When we are having inclement weather, are we to believe a \n     vehicle could drive some 27 miles in whiteout conditions, \n     drifting snow and winds? I lived 3.2 miles out of the town of \n     Cold Bay for four years, with so-called ``road access'' to \n     Cold Bay, and during winter spent many days stranded either \n     at home or in town, depending on where I was when the storm \n     came. Drifting snow would be so bad, it would take days to \n     get the 3.2 miles of road plowed enough to be passable.\n       I would also like to say that during the 14 years I have \n     spent living in Cold Bay, I have yet to see the bay freeze \n     over, making a marine link with a breakwater/harbor the only \n     viable and obvious alternative to the road.\n       As Murkowski, Stevens and Young are trying to ramrod this \n     through Congress, I would like to see them show up in Cold \n     Bay and ask some of us Cold Bay residents how we feel instead \n     of assuming we also are in favor of this ``King Cove to Cold \n     Bay Road.''\n                                                   Tara P.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. How long, Mr. President?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The State of Alaska is already evaluating various \nalternatives and there is provision in the current transportation \nappropriations bill, that the Senate passed in July, that adds $700,000 \nfor the Corps of Engineers to study rural access issues in Alaska. That \nis already in there. Alaska is now studying various alternatives that \naffect rural access issues.\n  With these two studies out there, one by the State of Alaska and the \nother by the Army Corps of Engineers, now is not the time to jump to \nconclusions and pass a rider which authorizes the construction of a \nroad through a wilderness area.\n  I say, let's let the studies examine the evidence, let the studies \nweigh the alternatives. Let's see if the road is, in fact, the best way \nto meet the stated needs. It may be and may not be. But the fact of the \nmatter is, when you look a lot deeper into this, the real impetus \nbehind the road may not be emergency medical evacuation. That is not \nthe real driving force here. Really, it is that the folks there have an \neconomic interest in having a road.\n  I might say, too, that is true of many communities--not only in \nAlaska, but other parts of the country. I understand those needs. \nPeople move to and live in King Cove because they want to live there. \nThat is their home. That is their choice. There are ways to deal with \nthe medical needs that may arise, but I do not think it makes sense to \nput in an appropriations bill a requirement that a road be built when \nthere are two outstanding studies looking at this issue to see what the \nbest way is to solve the access issue, particularly with respect to \nemergency medical services.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor. I see my good friend from \nMissouri on the floor. I cannot, for the life of me, have any idea what \nhe is going to talk about, given the State he is from and given the \nmagnificent feat of one of his local citizens in the last few days, \nwith the number 70 behind it.\n  I very respectfully yield the floor so my good friend from Missouri \ncan address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana. I also thank \nthe distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11095-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11098-S11099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MARK McGWIRE INTERSTATE ROUTE 70\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Sunday evening in St. Charles, MO, I was \nattending a picnic. Late in the afternoon a bright-eyed, starry-eyed \n10-year-old boy came in. He had just witnessed something that is truly \nhistoric. I told the young man I hoped he had a really good memory, \nbecause I imagine that he would be telling not only his schoolmates, \nbut his children and his grandchildren, and we might even hope his \ngreat grandchildren about it.\n  As a matter of fact, as we travel around Missouri and other parts of \nthe country, people have been talking about it all over. That is, of \ncourse, that on Sunday, Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals hit his \n69th and 70th home run this season; a grand total of 70 home runs. To \ndo that, he hit 5 home runs in his last 11 at bats.\n  There were people who thought it would be very difficult to break the \nwonderful record that Roger Maris had established of 61 home runs. This \nyear we saw something truly extraordinary. Another outstanding athlete, \nSammy Sosa, hit 66. And the contest between these two superb athletes \nand wonderful human beings electrified this country. As somebody who \nhas been a baseball fan for a long time, I was so delighted to see the \nexcitement and enthusiasm as baseball came back to the status it has \nhad as our Nation's pastime. People who never cared about sports in my \nState were clustering around the radios or the television whenever Mark \nMcGwire came up.\n  Mark McGwire is a man of immense physical stature, conditioning and \nstrength. When I met him I was overwhelmed with his size and muscle. \nBut he is a man of great mental dedication, of great concentration, \ndetermination, and--reading the column in today's Washington Post by \nTom Boswell--probably possessing other extraordinary capabilities of \nwhich we mere mortals cannot be aware.\n  He did something that, for baseball fans, was truly remarkable. It \nhas done more for our State, the city of St. Louis--but for the country \nas well--when we look at the sportsmanship and the example of how hard \nwork and determination and doggedness pay off. I would like to believe \nin other countries\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\nwhere baseball is played they felt the same excitement and the same \nenthusiasm that we did.\n  To both Mark McGwire and to Sammy Sosa, we say congratulations and \nthank you for a wonderful season. Mr. Sosa has some more games to play \nwith the Chicago Cubs. But I did not want this moment to pass without \nasking this body to consider acting on something that I think is a good \nidea. Actually, I read about it on the sports page. Bernie Miklasz' \ncolumn in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch suggested it. I talked to my \nfriends at the St. Louis Cardinals and they have been thinking about \nit. You see, there is an interstate highway that runs through St. \nLouis, interstate 70--a very fortuitous number, given the feat that Mr. \nMcGwire has achieved.\n  There are some of us--we don't want to raise a question, be \nnitpicking--who think he actually hit 71, if you count one in \nMilwaukee. But we are willing to pass on that one and say that there \nwere 70 home runs that were hit. I am going to propose a measure today \nto designate a portion of interstate 70 in Missouri as the Mark McGwire \nInterstate Route 70; through St. Louis County and St. Louis City, to \nrecognize the man who has not only brought baseball back to the top of \neverybody's mind and heart, but has done a tremendous amount for the \ncommunity as well.\n  This, I think, is a small measure for us to undertake. We are \ncontacting our colleagues in the House to ask for their support. The \nmayor of St. Louis has indicated his support, and we are asking others \nto join with us. We hope to have clearance later on today, if we can \nobtain clearance to pass it in wrap-up.\n  We also invite additional cosponsors. I have three who wish to \ncosponsor it to recognize this tremendous feat and to designate this in \nhonor of the man who has really brought the thrill back to baseball and \nhas shown that human beings have tremendous talent.\n  I send to the desk a bill to designate the Mark McGwire Interstate \nRoute 70.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, before being referred, that \nthe bill be held at the desk to seek clearance from the minority side \nof the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has Senator Bond finished?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to ask consent on \nsomething, but I thank Senator Bond and congratulate him for what he \ndid today. I don't know if we can do anything that is enough in \nresponse to the marvelous baseball year that Mark McGwire and others \nhave given to the American people.\n  I suggest that in an America that has grown so cynical about \nanything, wasn't it a marvelous thing to see how the people responded \nto the genuineness, the frankness, the decency of both Mark McGwire and \nSammy Sosa? Just remember, on a number of those very important home \nruns, those people who caught that ball, without one moment's \nhesitation--until right at the end, of course--they said the ball \nbelongs to him; they weren't trying to get rich. It was just absolutely \nmarvelous for the United States to see that kind of thing happen.\n  Then to see the friendship between two people who are really at war \nin a very civil and different kind of way to break this title, which \nboth of them did, which has been there for 37 years, and see how they \nrelated to each other. I think they have become genuine friends while \nthey have proceeded, each in their individual way, to try to break one \nof the most important and difficult athletic standards in all of \norganized athletics worldwide.\n  I believe if the Senate understands what has happened, they are going \nto approve that very soon. I commend the Senator for it, and I hope \nMark McGwire and his family understand the reason for you doing this \nand why we are probably going to unanimously accept it. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness and then proceed to a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11098-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RESTORING CONFIDENCE TO WORLD FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Federal Reserve today decided to cut \ninterest rates, and this is a very important step toward restoring \nconfidence and stability in the world's financial markets. It shows \nthat the world's policymakers are taking an active role in ensuring \nthat financial contagion does not spread further. It is also an \ninsurance policy against further damage to the U.S. economy from \ninternational events which currently are out of our control.\n  However, the U.S. Federal Reserve cannot resolve the current \nfinancial crisis alone. Investors are shunning the emerging markets \nbecause of a heightened sense of the risk that is there. In order to \nget money flowing to these regions again, nations must improve their \nbanking regulations and must make information about their financial \nsystems more available. This will assure investors and will help \nresolve much of the current crisis.\n  As policymakers, we should aid the Fed's effort to restore \ninternational confidence by approving the International Monetary Fund's \nrequest with appropriate amendments. We should also remain confident \nthat the Fed will continue to act in a way that ensures maximum U.S. \nlong-term growth, as they have done in the past and, as I gather, they \ndecided to do today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11099-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11099-S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4060\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note there is a minority Member on the \nfloor. I would not make this request if there was not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4060; that \nthere be 40 minutes for debate, with 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Graham from Florida; and that the remaining 10 minutes be \nequally divided between Senator Reid of Nevada and myself, as ranking \nmember and chairman, respectively, managers of the bill. I further ask \nunanimous consent that upon the conclusion or yielding back of time, \nthe conference report be adopted and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of another Democratic Senator, I \nmust respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I had hoped the Senator would have \nstated the name of the Senator, because he has already talked to us, so \nwe all know who it is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to my friend, he can mention the \nname because he knows more than I do. I don't know the name.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Distinguished Senator Harkin is the Senator who told me \nhe is going to object. He is not here, so the Senator from Montana is \nobjecting.\n  I say to the Senate--in a way to the absent Senator Harkin--frankly, \nthis is a completed conference report on one of the required annual \nappropriations bills. From what I understand, there is no objection to \nthis bill. From what I understand, it passed the House 389 to 25.\n  We are all engaged in trying to get the appropriations bills passed \nbecause that is our duty. We are supposed to have them finished before \nthe fiscal year ends, and there are constant complaints that we don't \nget it done.\n  Essentially, tomorrow is the end of the year. We worked very hard, \nDemocrats and Republicans, House and Senate, to get this bill done, to \nmeet it, have it within our allocation so it does not break the budget, \nto do it in the way that most probably will get a Presidential \nsignature.\n  The Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the entire \nDepartment of Energy, both defense and nondefense, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission--they cannot help Senator Harkin. They are all in \nthis bill. They should get their funding. They can't help Senator \nHarkin solve the problem of the labor, health, and human services bill, \nwhich the Senator from Iowa thinks needs a further allocation of \nresources in order to accomplish what he, as ranking member, thinks \nshould be done.\n\n[[Page S11100]]\n\n  In addition, I suggest, at the request of the President, this bill \nincludes a provision to resolve a dispute between the District of \nColumbia courts and the Public Defenders Office. We included that \nprovision in the bill because this has to be enacted before the end of \nthe current year. If that does not happen, then the public defenders--\nthe entire office, which defends those in the District who cannot \nafford their own lawyers, will not be able to meet its payroll.\n  The leadership of the House and Senate Appropriations Committee \nwanted Senator Reid and me to address that problem, and we were able to \ndo that with the help of Chairman McDade and his ranking member, \nRepresentative Fazio from the State of California.\n  I hope Senator Harkin will reconsider this objection and will let us \nadopt this conference report. All I can say is, in all honesty, Senator \nHarkin and those who feel like he does, holding this bill up is not \ngoing to help one bit resolve the problem that centers around how much \nmoney should Labor, Health, and Human Services have to spend this year \non its annual appropriations. It is just not going to help.\n  There is nobody suggesting the money ought to come out of this bill. \nThere is nobody suggesting that the solution to the problem, which is \nraised by the Senator from Iowa, can be solved by this bill or by this \nSenator.\n  It has to be resolved, if a problem exists, through the leadership \nhere and the chairmen of both of the Appropriations Committees, and I \nassume maybe even the White House. Since all of that would be required \nto resolve the problem, I once again ask, What good does it do to hold \nthis bill up? And I hope that will not be a long-lasting event.\n  I thank the Senate for considering this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to mention another anti-\nenvironment rider in the Interior appropriations bill. I have already \ndiscussed two of them. One is Glacier Bay and the other is Izembek. \nThis will be the third.\n  Mr. President, this amendment deletes the rider that limits the \nForest Service's ability to close roads on National Forests that \nthreaten public safety or the environment.\n  Let me explain. The Forest Service has constructed over 370,000 miles \nof roads on National Forests across America--370,000 miles of roads. \nThese roads, the ones that Forest Service has constructed, are called \nauthorized roads; another name given to them is systems roads. Most of \nthese are single-lane roads. They are relatively low quality, often \nbuilt to harvest timber. They are just basic roads built to meet basic \nneeds.\n  Many of these roads, though, have outlived their intended purpose. \nThey are no longer needed. That is, they are built essentially to \nharvest timber, a lot of them, or built for a specific purpose and that \npurpose is no longer in use. So the roads therefore are no longer \nneeded.\n  About 40 percent of the 370,000 miles of authorized roads are \nmaintained to public safety and environmental standards. The remaining \n60 percent are in poor condition and in many cases are a threat--a real \nthreat--to the public safety or a threat to water quality or often a \nthreat to wildlife habitat.\n  In addition to these authorized roads, the Forest Service estimates \nthat there are at least 60,000 miles of additional roads. These \nunauthorized roads are sometimes referred to as ghost roads.\n  This is a photograph, Mr. President, of typical ghost roads. These \nare created when somebody decides that he or she wants to drive a \npickup, a car, or a four-wheeler to a stream, or whatnot. After a \nwhile, a few people drive back and forth and we end up with an \nunauthorized road or a ghost road.\n  Another example is here. Here is a young fellow on a bicycle. It is \nclose, perhaps, to a stream. It is hard to tell from this photograph, \nbut basically after a bit more use it becomes kind of a road--a ghost \nroad. There are about 60,000 miles of these kinds of ghost roads that \nthe Forest Service thinks exist out in the National Forests--roads \ncaused by people, not roads that the Forest Service has planned or \nbuilt.\n  Again, Mr. President, just to recapitulate, there are about 370,000 \nmiles of roads the Forest Service has planned on building. Most of \nthese are deteriorating. Many of these roads were intended to be used \nas logging roads to harvest timber, and the timber harvest is gone; \nthat is, the timber has been harvested so they are no longer in use.\n  Then there are 60,000 miles of ghost roads not planned by the Forest \nService and which are created by people who drive around in pickups or \nother off-road vehicles.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service cannot safely manage all of the \nauthorized and the unauthorized, so-called ghost roads that cover our \nNational Forests. It just cannot do it. There are too many roads. Too \nmany miles of roads. As a result, many of these roads are safety \nhazards, and some cause significant environmental problems.\n  Mr. President, let me show you these two photographs. These are \nphotographs of authorized roads, of system roads, of roads the Forest \nService planned--not the ghost roads. In this top photograph of this \nroad, you can tell the road is washed out. It is just washed out.\n  Here is another photograph of another authorized road, the kind the \nForest Service plans on. What happened here? The bridge went out. Some \npoor unlucky fellow did not realize the bridge had gone out until he \ncaused it to go out. The bridge just collapsed. This guy's pickup went \ndown on the collapsed bridge on the authorized road. Obviously, the \nbridge has rotted out.\n  In other cases, the authorized roads create environmental hazards. I \nmight tell you what the top road is. This is a road on the Mount Baker/\nSnoqualmie National Forest that has washed out. These types of washouts \noften clog streams, as you might guess. They kill fish. That is pretty \nobvious. And in the middle of the night, they can be one heck of a \npothole.\n  When roads such as these are unsafe, or cause environmental problems, \nwe have two options. One is to fix the road; and the other is to \ndecommission the road. Just a fancy way of saying closing it.\n  In deciding which roads to upgrade or close, the Forest Service sets \npriorities, obviously, based on public safety, based on environmental \nconcerns, on a forest-by-forest basis.\n  Let's face it, road closures can be a big issue in some parts of the \ncountry. I know that is very much the case in my State of Montana; \npeople have strongly held views as to which roads should be closed and \nwhich roads not.\n  These are not easy decisions for the Forest Service to make. But the \nForest Service personnel by-and-large do the very best they can. And \nthey do so after talking with the public. And they make their decisions \nbased on what they think the public wants and based upon safety and \nbased upon environmental needs.\n  Well, this is where the rider comes in. This rider prevents funds \nfrom being used to remove any authorized road until the regional \nforester certifies that all the ghost roads have been either upgraded \nto U.S. Forest Service standards or closed. That is, the Forest Service \ncannot look at any of the authorized roads in a region until it looks \nat all the ghost roads and either closes or upgrades each of them.\n  What does that mean? That means the Forest Service could not close \nany authorized road no matter how great a safety hazard it is until the \nForest Service can certify that every single mile of the ghost roads, \nthat is these kinds of roads--the little pathways--who-knows-where-\nthey-are in the forest, have been either upgraded to either system \nstandards or have been removed.\n  For starters, this is virtually impossible. The Forest Service does \nnot even know where many of these ghost roads are. More important, this \nrider does not take into account whether these roads pose the greatest \nimmediate threat to public safety or the environment.\n  In sum, this simplistic one-size-fits-all approach would wreak havoc \non the ability of the Forest Service to sensibly manage roads in our \nNational Forests.\n  As I mentioned early, the Forest Service now sets priorities for \nclosing\n\n[[Page S11101]]\n\nroads on a forest-by-forest basis, based on what the public wants, \nbased on public safety, based on environmental protection and \nrestoration needs. A whole host of considerations go into it on a \nforest-by-forest basis or perhaps a district-by-district basis, not a \none-size-fits-all national standard imposed on a Washington, DC, basis \nthat you can't do anything with your system of roads until you either \nupgrade or close the ghost roads.\n\n  This rider would force the Forest Service to inventory thousands of \nmiles of ghost roads and spend limited taxpayers' money upgrading or \nremoving the roads, even if they are not causing safety or \nenvironmental problems.\n  Here is an example. Assume that the Deer Lodge National Forest in my \nState of Montana has an authorized road built to harvest timber, a very \ncommon occurrence. The timber has been harvested and the road is no \nlonger needed, also very typical. Soon, the road is sliding down the \nmountain and it is unsafe for travel because of slippage and erosion \nand the road is clogging a stream, choking the fish in that stream, \nwhich often happens, too.\n  If this rider passed, the forest managers could not remove that road \nuntil it had inventoried the entire forest and found where each of the \nghost roads were located and then either closed all those ghost roads \nor upgraded all to system standards. Let me repeat that. If this rider \npassed, the Forest Service could not remove the road I mentioned that \nis clogging up a stream until it has inventoried all ghost roads, and \neither upgraded the ghost roads--that is, the paths--to road standards, \nor closed them.\n  Plain and simple, this rider does not make sense. It does not meet \nthe ``common sense'' test. It prevents the Forest Service from closing \nroads that now pose a very significant threat to public safety and the \nenvironment. It would prevent the Forest Service from doing its job. I \nbelieve the Forest Service should be able to close roads based on \npublic needs, not on an arbitrary distinction of whether the road is \nauthorized or unauthorized.\n  To protect public safety and the environment, I believe this rider on \nthe Interior appropriations bill should be deleted.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ed Cole, a \ncongressional fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the \nremainder of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. One last rider I will mention. This rider is section 343 \nof the Interior appropriations bill which limits Federal and State \nactions to manage the Columbia/Snake River system.\n  I note that the chairman of the subcommittee is the present occupant \nof the Chair. In dealing with this subject, I have the utmost respect \nfor what he is doing, particularly the great job he did in the Interior \nappropriations bill, which has many, many good features in it. He has \nworked very, very hard. It is a very complex bill, with NEA, the Forest \nService, and Indian lands. I compliment the Chair.\n  With respect to this provision, we have a difference of opinion. I \nstate that with all due respect.\n  The Columbia/Snake River basin covers about 259,000 square miles, \nincluding large parts of the State of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, \nMontana, and British Columbia. It is home to several endangered fish \nspecies, including several stocks of salmon. The number of salmon has \nfallen dramatically from an estimated 10 million fish in the historical \nruns to about 1 million today.\n  For several years, we have been trying to bring salmon back, in part \nby improving the operations of the river system.\n  We have improved fish screens; we have improved fish ladders. We have \nbarged salmon around dams. We have modified water flows to help \njuvenile salmon migrate downstream and adult salmon migrate upstream.\n  These modifications have been controversial because they sometimes \nrestrict other uses of the river, such as power generation, irrigation, \ntransportation, and recreation.\n  Like many others in the Northwest delegation, I have not been \nparticularly happy with every decision that has been made. In fact, I \nsupported a cap on the amount of fish-related expenses that is passed \nalong to BPA ratepayers. We had to have that cap or else I believe the \nFederal agency would have gone too far. I also oppose some of the \ndrawdowns at the Libby dam and Hungry Horse dams in northwest Montana \nbecause of the effects on recreation and the adverse effects on the \nbull trout.\n  I have maintained, however, that we should work within the framework \nof our environmental laws. There are a lot of competing considerations, \nand one is the framework of our environmental laws. The rider that I am \nreferring to, section 343 of the Interior appropriations bill, would \nchange that. It would override the Endangered Species Act, it would \noverride the Clean Water Act, the Northwest Power Planning Act, and the \nFederal Power Act.\n  To put the issue in perspective, let me briefly explain how the \nColumbia/Snake River system is managed now. In 1995, under the \nEndangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued a \nbiological opinion describing the actions that the Corps of Engineers, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, and the Bonneville Power Administration must \ntake, consistent with their other obligations, to save the wild salmon \nfrom extinction. The biological opinion includes both short and long-\nterm measures.\n  In the short-term, it requires several changes. For example, it \nrequires increased flows during fish migration seasons, better use of \nspills, improved methods of barging fish, limits on ocean fishing, and \nthe use of more effective fish screens and fish ladders.\n  By 1999, it requires the Corps to assess the effect of a major \ndrawdown of dams on the lower Snake River. This could include the \nbreaching or removal of up to four dams. Those four dams are Ice \nHarbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite. They can be \nseen on this map of the Columbia Reserve Basin.\n  What does this rider do? How would it affect current operations? It \nwould have two main effects. The rider provides that the National \nMarine Fisheries Service, the Corps of Engineers and other agencies \nmust receive specific congressional authorization before breaching or \nremoving any federally operated or licensed dam on the Columbia/Snake \nsystem. In addition, the rider says that Federal and State agencies \nmust get specific congressional authorization before taking any action \nthat would ``diminish below present operational plans the \nCongressionally authorized uses of flood control, irrigation, \nnavigation and * * * energy generating capacity of any such dam.''\n  Let me address these effects one at a time. The first issue is \nbreaching or removing dams. As I said earlier, the Corps is studying \nthe breach or removal of four dams on the lower Snake River--Ice \nHarbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite.\n  I understand the argument that over time, over the long term, \nbreaching or removing the dam is the best way to protect and recover \nsalmon. After all, if you return a river to its natural condition, you \ndon't have to manage water levels to mimic the river's natural \ncondition when fish migrate up or down stream.\n  But we are not living in the abstract. In most cases, removing a dam \nis a big step with major consequences for power production, for \nirrigation, for transportation, and for recreation. For example, \nbreaching or removing the lower Snake River dams would most likely \neliminate Lewiston, ID, as a river port. Many farmers from Idaho, \nMontana and elsewhere ship grain by truck or rail to Lewiston and barge \nto Portland for export to Asia.\n  I believe an action of this kind should definitely require \ncongressional approval. But that is already the case. In testimony \nearlier this year, the Commander of the Corps' Northwest Division said,\n\n       It is our opinion that the Corps cannot use its existing \n     legal authority to remove lower Snake projects . . . New \n     statutory authority would be required to undertake these \n     actions since the proposed actions would eliminate or \n     significantly affect specific project purposes provided for \n     in the authorizing legislation.\n\n  That is the commander of the Corps' Northwest Division.\n  So there is not an issue here with respect to removing or breaching \ndams.\n\n[[Page S11102]]\n\n The rider is unnecessary in that respect. Congressional approval \nalready is required.\n  This takes us to the second part of the rider. It requires \ncongressional approval before an agency can take any action that will \n``diminish below present operational plans'' the congressionally \nauthorized uses of any dam on the Columbia/Snake system.\n  As I read the amendment, there would have to be specific \ncongressional approval before a Federal or State agency makes any \noperational or management change that would reduce power production, \nirrigation, flood control or recreation. I believe that goes too far \nfor three main reasons.\n  First, it is impractical. It would tie the management of the river \nsystem in knots. The management of the Columbia/Snake system is a very \ncomplex undertaking. It involves at least four Federal agencies: \nBonneville Power, National Marine and Fisheries Service, Corps of \nEngineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. It also involves the Northwest \nPower Planning Council, the States of Montana, Idaho, Washington, \nOregon, the government of Canada, many Indian tribes and scores of \npublic and private utilities. There are hundreds of people involved.\n  To coordinate operations, the Federal agencies develop at least three \noperational plans each year: A flood control plan, a hydropower plan \nand a water management plan. During the spring and summer, a technical \nmanagement team meets each week in Portland to review operations and \nmake any necessary changes.\n  By locking everything in and providing that Congress must approve any \naction that diminishes other uses of the system below ``present \noperational plans,'' we would be micromanaging one of the largest and \nmost complex river systems in the world.\n  The second problem is the congressional management may put several \nendangered species at risk of extinction. If changes are necessary to \nprotect a newly listed species or further protect a species already \nlisted to prevent it from being wiped out, the change would require \ncongressional approval. Even minimal changes to provide specie \nprotection may require Congress to act.\n  For example, new scientific evidence indicates that spills are more \neffective at protecting fish if they are conducted gradually over a 24-\nhour period rather than only at night. This approach slightly reduces \npower-generating capacity. So under the rider the agencies would need \nto get congressional approval before they can make a change.\n  The rider would not only threaten Federal efforts to protect the \nenvironment, but it would also threaten State efforts to protect the \nenvironment. Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, when a Federal \ndam is being licensed or relicensed, States can impose conditions on \nthe license in order to protect water quality. Many States do. For \nexample, several States in the West have imposed conditions necessary \nto prevent dams from generating elevated levels of dissolved oxygen \nwhich can harm fish.\n  Utilities have questioned whether States have this authority, but the \nSupreme Court has held that they do.\n  The Gorton amendment would change all that. As I read it, a State \nagency could not impose any license condition that diminished power \ngeneration, unless it received the approval of the licensee or \nCongress.\n  That would, in effect, eliminate the section 401 authority that \nStates have fought so hard to maintain.\n  The directors of the Western Governors' Association and the Western \nStates Water Council share this view. In a joint letter, they say that, \nalthough their organizations do not take a position about breaching or \nmaking operational changes at any dam, the rider ``appears to clearly \nhave the potential of diminishing State prerogatives under section 401, \nwith regard to the rivers and streams identified in the amendment.''\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also takes this view. In a \nletter, the FERC Chairman says that the rider ``would bar, absent \nspecific congressional approval, State and Federal agencies from \nrequiring or authorizing certain actions affecting the authorized uses \nof any Federal or federally-licensed dams on the Columbia or Snake \nrivers or their tributaries.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Western Governors' Association,\n\n\n                                 Western States Water Council,\n\n                                               September 18, 1998.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n       Dear Senators: We have just learned that the Committee is \n     considering the question of whether a proposed amendment \n     would affect state Section 401 authority under the Clean \n     Water Act. This relates to amendment No. 3555 offered on \n     behalf of Senator Gorton. Given the time constraints, our \n     organizations are not able to collectively express themselves \n     with regard to this question. However, after consulting with \n     our lead states on this issue, we are writing to express our \n     view that the amendment appears to clearly have the potential \n     of diminishing state prerogatives under Section 401, with \n     regard to the rivers and streams identified in the proposed \n     amendment. In so doing, we do not express an opinion as to \n     the merits of any action to breach or remove any dam or to \n     alter operational plans relative to any dam. Rather, the \n     point of this letter is to advise the Committee of the \n     position of the western states with regard to Section 401 \n     authority, and to convey our concerns that the proposed \n     amendment as written could diminish that authority.\n       The Western States Water Council has been working with the \n     Western Governor's Association for some time to preserve \n     state prerogatives relative to protecting water quality \n     associated with proposed federally licensed projects. A \n     resolution by the Western Governors' Association relative to \n     this matter is enclosed for your reference. Since the Supreme \n     Court upheld Washington's position in the so-called Tacoma \n     case regarding the scope of state 401 authority, the \n     hydropower industry has sought to persuade Congress to \n     reverse or limit this decision. We have strongly opposed such \n     efforts.\n       We hope that the Committee will consider these views as it \n     considers the potential effects of the proposed amendment. If \n     you have any questions regarding these matters, please let us \n     know.\n           Best regards,\n     D. Craig Bell,\n       Executive Director, WSWC.\n     Richard Bechtel,\n       Director, WGA-D.C.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Dale Bumpers,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: In response to your staff's request, \n     I am writing with respect to Section 343 of S. 2237 (the FY \n     1999 appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior). \n     That section, if enacted, could have a potentially \n     significant effect on the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission's regulation of non-federal hydroelectric projects \n     in the Columbia and Snake River Basins.\n       Section 343 of the bill would bar, absent specific \n     Congressional approval, state and federal agencies from \n     requiring or authorizing certain actions affecting the \n     authorized uses of any federal or FERC-licensed dams on the \n     Columbia or Snake Rivers or their tributaries. The proscribed \n     actions would include reducing the generating capacity of any \n     such dams; reducing their reservoirs below minimum operating \n     pools (except as necessary for flood control, navigation, and \n     safety); and requiring the release of stored water.\n       Section 343 would constrain the Commission's flexibility to \n     act responsibly in its continuous oversight of licensed \n     projects in these river basins. Moreover, as existing \n     licenses expire, the provision would constrain the \n     Commission's flexibility to balance the multiple public \n     interest considerations involved, as required by the Federal \n     Power Act, upon relicensing these projects.\n       Thank you for your interest in this matter. If you have \n     further questions concerning the implications of Section 343 \n     for the Commission's regulatory activities, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James J. Hoecker,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Third, the amendment will have some unintended, and \nperhaps dangerous, effects.\n  Not all changes to the operation of the Columbia/Snake river system \nare made for the purpose of protecting fish and wildlife. Often, there \nare other reasons.\n  Recently, there were concerns about sabotage of the Grand Coulee dam. \nThe water levels were lowered, so that emergency repairs could be made. \nThis reduced power generating capacity, probably worth a few million \ndollars. Under the rider, the reduction in water levels would have had \nto be approved by Congress.\n  Another example. In some situations, it may be appropriate to provide \nmore\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\nwater for irrigation, at the expense of power production. Or vice \nversa.\n  Or to set more space aside for flood control. Each year, the planning \nprocess starts by measuring the snowpack and predicting the runoff.\n  In a particularly wet year, like 1997, operational changes may be \nneeded to prevent downstream flooding, by setting aside more storage \nspace in upstream reservoirs.\n  In a particularly dry year, operational changes may need to be made \nto allocate scare water among competing uses.\n  In many of these cases, under the rider, the agencies could only act \nif they received specific Congressional approval.\n  Mr. President, we all know how hard it is to get anything passed \naround here. Any change that is at all controversial can be at least \ndelayed, and maybe stopped completely.\n  Do we really want decisions like this, that may need to be made \nquickly in response to constantly changing circumstances, to require \nspecific Congressional approval?\n  To sum it all up, this is no way to run one of the world's largest \nand most complex river systems. That's why we have expert federal and \nstate agencies, like the Northwest Power Planning Council and BPA.\n  Congress should set clear legal standards. When necessary, we must \nimprove those standards. That's why I support S. 1180, a bill to \nimprove the Endangered Species Act.\n  Congress also should conduct careful oversight.\n  But we should not require Congressional approval of the complex \ndecisions that managers must make so that the river system functions \nsmoothly.\n  By requiring Congressional approval of any changes that diminish the \nuse of the system below ``present operational plans,'' the rider goes \ntoo far.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11100-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ON THE DEATH OF TOM BRADLEY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for me, this is a sad day. Someone in \npolitics whom I have very much respected passed away this morning, and \nthat was Tom Bradley, former mayor of Los Angeles. Tom was one of \nAmerica's finest mayors, a tireless advocate on behalf of the cities of \nAmerica. I had an opportunity to work closely with him during the 1980s \nwhen we were both mayors.\n  I saw firsthand how he would go about solving a problem. He was kind \nand gentle, but he was tenacious about promoting the city of Los \nAngeles that he so deeply loved.\n  He leaves a rich legacy for Los Angeles and for the entire State of \nCalifornia. No Californian--and particularly no Los Angeleno--will ever \nforget the pride of hosting the 1984 Olympics. Tom Bradley showed that \nan American city could host a profitable and spirited Olympic ceremony.\n  His other accomplishments are many: Bringing public rail \ntransportation to his city; building an international airport--Tom \nBradley Airport--and a port that generated hundreds of thousands of \njobs for the region; opening the doors of city government so that city \nworkers reflected the rich cultural diversity of Los Angeles.\n  One particular vision I have of Tom Bradley which I will never forget \nis when we met, of all places, on the Great Wall of China as mayors in \nJune of 1979. I was there to secure a sister city relationship between \nSan Francisco and the city of Shanghai. While San Francisco got that \nrelationship, Tom Bradley went right out and secured a similar \nrelationship between Los Angeles and Guangzhou.\n  Tom knew the importance that the Pacific Rim would play in his city's \nfuture and he would literally travel anywhere in the world to help \npromote the city. He was a forceful and successful advocate for the \ncities of America every time cities needed a strong voice. His presence \nwas matched by a wonderful and soft gentleness that I, personally, will \nnever forget.\n  My deepest sorrow goes to his family and to his many friends. Mr. \nPresident, I know we all will do our part to see that Tom Bradley's \nvision for Los Angeles lives on and on for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11103-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

I want to address the Senate this afternoon because of \nmy continued concern that we are not addressing one of the most \nimportant areas of concern for American families, and that is the \nlegislation which is known as the Patients' Bill of Rights. I and a \nnumber of our colleagues have cosponsored Senator Daschle's \nlegislation. I had hoped that we could debate and reach conclusion on \nthis legislation. I believe the overwhelming majority of our colleagues \non this side of the aisle are in support of this legislation and, if we \nhad an opportunity to debate this issue, I think we would have support \nas well from Members on the other side.\n  Basically, it is a fundamental issue that I think all Americans can \nunderstand. This issue centers around whether doctors are going to make \ndecisions with regard to the treatment of patients in our country, or \nwhether we are going to have those decisions made by accountants--whose \nprimary interest is enhancing the profits of the HMOs rather than the \nhealth of its patients. That is really at the heart of the Patients' \nBill of Rights. There are other important protections, but that is at \nthe heart of it.\n  This issue affects about 160 million American policy holders. Our \nlegislation is supported by more than 180 leading health care \norganizations--virtually all of the major doctors' organizations, \nnursing organizations, and consumer organizations.\n  I have read the comments of some of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. They distort the provisions of this legislation and talk \nabout it as legislation which is unnecessary and legislation that will \ncomplicate the current practice of medicine. But, listen to the \ndoctors. They say it will simplify the practice of medicine.\n  It does seem to me valuable to consider what the doctors say about \nthis, what the nurses say about this, and what the overwhelming, \nvirtually unanimous sense of the health professionals is about it, and \nthey say that they strongly support our legislation. They are opposed \nto the Republican legislation. But all of them are asking when will the \nRepublican leadership yield and permit us--permit us meaning the \nSenate--to take up this legislation and debate it and reach a \nresolution on these various issues. That is the matter I am addressing \nhere this afternoon.\n  Over the period of the last 2 weeks in the Senate we have had votes \non the salting legislation. I bet if we asked the Americans who are \nlistening or watching this afternoon what the salting legislation is \nreally all about and where it fits on their list of priorities, many of \nthem would not know what it is all about. It is basically a technique \nwhich is used--and used effectively and legitimately according to the \nSupreme Court with its unanimous vote--to permit the organization of \nworkers in\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\nsites across this country. But some of our Republican friends desired \nto repeal that legislation. So we had votes on that.\n  We have had votes on the bankruptcy legislation which affects about \n1,200,000 of our fellow citizens. We have had votes on the so-called \nChild Custody Protection Act. We have now been debating in the last day \nor two the Vacancies Act. We are also considering the Internet tax \nprovision. The majority leader has talked about financial services \nlegislation. And then we are going to come into a situation, perhaps \nnext week, where we are going to have the opportunity to address the \ntax cut proposal of our Republican friends in the House of \nRepresentatives. They want to use tax revenues which have been paid \ninto the Treasury, which are Social Security revenues, to provide tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest individuals in our country.\n  But we understand the surplus this year and in future years is the \nresult of funds that have been paid in by workers to fund Social \nSecurity benefits. When you exclude these Social Security benefits, you \nsee that we really do not have a surplus. What we have is money raised \nby working families to pay for Social Security. Our Republican friends \nwant to take some $80 billion of that and use it for tax breaks that \nwould primarily benefit the wealthiest individuals in our society.\n  I see one provision in their plan will decrease the estate tax for \nmillionaires. Let me tell every taxpayer who might be watching that you \nwill have an interest in this provision only if you intend to leave \nmore than $600,000 to one of your children. This Republican-sponsored \nprovision will permit you to leave $1 million. It affects only 2 \npercent of the taxpayers, but it will cost some $18 billion--$18 \nbillion out of funds that are paid in by workers to pay for Social \nSecurity. The majority plans to take that money out and use the $18 \nbillion to offset the revenue losses that will result if the \nRepublicans pass their particular proposal to expand the estate tax. We \nwill have a chance to debate that issue.\n  But, Mr. President, where in this agenda is the issue of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, something that is of fundamental concern to \nvirtually every working family? Are we trying to suggest that the \nsalting legislation or the Vacancies Act or even the Internet tax issue \nis of nearly the consequence or importance of the Patients' Bill of \nRights? Not so. But still the majority leader refuses to permit us to \ndebate and discuss it in the Senate.\n  The Republican leadership didn't permit it last Friday when most \nAmericans were out working and the Senate effectively closed down at \nabout 11 o'clock. There were Members who spoke after 11 o clock, \nincluding myself, and we pointed out that we could have been debating \nHMO reform on Friday afternoon. We could have been debating it on \nMonday--when most of the afternoon was taken up in quorum calls before \nthe vote in the late afternoon--or even debated it on Monday evening.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take the time to review with the \nSenate the amount of hours we have spent in quorum calls over the \nperiod of the last 2 weeks. We could have debated this, taken votes on \nthese measures, and resolved these matters in a way that I think would \nhave yielded some very important and basic protections for families.\n  I think we would have resolved this in favor of protecting children \nin our country. I think we would have carried overwhelmingly in the \nSenate the provisions that would have permitted families with a sick \nchild to bring that child to the nearest emergency room. I think we \nwould have won that in the Senate. I can understand why our Republican \nfriends do not want to vote on that issue, and show the American people \nwhere they stand. I hope that at least a majority of them would have \nsupported our provision, if they were given the opportunity.\n  I think they would have supported our provision to guarantee \nspecialty care for children who have dread diseases like cancer. I \nthink they would have supported ensuring that a child with cancer \nshould have access to an oncologist who is trained to work with \nchildren and with the cancer of the particular child. I think we would \nhave done that, just as I think we would have provided additional \nspecialty care protections for adults who have certain medical needs, \nwhether it is physical or mental disabilities or challenges or chronic \nconditions like arthritis or diabetes. I think we would have won those.\n  I think we would have been successful in debating and reaching a \nsuccessful conclusion in ensuring access to clinical trials for women \nwho have breast cancer and other patients with life-threatening \ndiseases. With all the possibilities that are out there for \nbreakthrough therapies, why are we continuing to deny women the \nopportunity to go into clinical trials? We guarantee that in our \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The other side does not. Why aren't we \ndebating whether we are going to increase access to clinical trials for \nwomen or children who have cancer, or patients with other diseases that \ndo not respond to conventional therapies? I think we should be able to \ndebate that issue.\n  I think we ought to be able to debate the issues around having access \nto the kind of prescription drugs that are recommended by doctors, \ninstead of being limited to the medications preferred by the plan. We \nhave had heard testimony from the mental health community that \nindicates that many of the individuals who need certain kinds of \nprescription drugs are required to take older, less effective drugs \nthat are on the HMO's list. Before the plan will even consider giving \nthem access to the drugs that the doctor knows is best, the accountant \nin that HMO says, No, you can't use that one until you have shown that \nthe previous two failed to work. Mr. President, these patients are only \ngiven access to the drugs that the doctor knows are best after they \nhave shown that the plan s drugs failed to work at least two times. I \nthink we could have debated that. And I think we could have been \nsuccessful in that debate as well.\n  And the list goes on, Mr. President, including whether patients \nshould have the right to a timely and independent review, if an HMO \ndenies care. I think we could have won that particular measure, too.\n\n  We also should address whether we are going to say that HMOs should \nbe held accountable if their actions, as a result of negligence, result \nin the loss of life or grievous bodily injury.\n  Who else is going to be the breadwinner for a family if an insurance \ncompany's negligent actions result in the loss of life of that \nindividual? Why is the Republican leadership allowing the insurance \nindustry to remain the only particular protected industry in the United \nStates of America? If these companies are going to take certain action \nthat is going to result in the death or serious disability to an \nindividual, why should they be free from accountability? They should \nnot be. We ought to be able to debate that in the U.S. Senate.\n  These are just some of the points that are in the Daschle legislation \nwhich we wanted to debate. But, no. Instead, we are debating salting \nlegislation, we are debating the Vacancies Act, the Internet tax, and \nwe will soon be debating financial services legislation, but not the \nissues that affect the quality of life of our children, our parents, \nour loved ones, our families. Why? Because the Republican leadership \nrefuses to do it. Why? Because evidently they think we may have the \nvotes to pass it.\n  We are still asked, is there enough time to pass this? Absolutely. \nEvidently our Republican leaders think there must be, too, because they \ncontinue to refuse to let us have the chance to debate this.\n  Senator Daschle has requested time and time again the opportunity to \ndebate these issues. ``No way,'' says the Republican leadership. ``No \nway.'' They even closed the Senate down a little over a week ago when \nthey refused to let Members speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \n``No,'' the Republican leader said, ``We set the calendar, we set the \nschedule, and you are not even going to have the time-honored process \nthat is guaranteed under the rules of the Senate of being able to amend \na piece of legislation, because if you are not going to behave \nyourselves''--in other words, ``if you are not going to accept our \ngagging you,'' as so many of the HMOs are doing in terms of gagging \ndoctors from making recommendations about what is the appropriate kind \nof health treatment for\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\nthe illness and sickness of the patients they are dealing with--``we \nare not going to even debate that bill. We are going to pull the bill. \nWe are going to take it off the floor, and we are going to put it back \non the calendar,'' as he has done.\n  That is what is happening in the U.S. Senate these days. We were \nfortunate to have just had an opportunity to debate raising the minimum \nwage. We said that working men and women in this country, who work 40 \nhours a week and 52 weeks a year, ought to have a livable wage. We were \nnot successful on the issue. We lost on that, but we had the \nopportunity to debate and go on record with our positions. What we are \nsaying now is: Let us have a debate; let us have the debate on the \nquestions of health care quality. This is something which is of \nenormous importance.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, this isn't just something a number of \nus have been in strong support of. I want to mention an editorial in \nSunday's Washington Post that cut through the Republican leadership's \nsmokescreen of evasion and distortion on managed care. The editorial \nwas entitled ``Double Loss on Managed Care.'' The author says:\n\n       Mr. Clinton . . . took the lead months ago in proposing \n     that Congress pass a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' to limit \n     how far managed care companies and other insurers can go in \n     denying care in order to cut costs. Democrats in both Houses \n     built on his proposals. The initial reaction of House \n     Republican leaders was to say no bill was necessary. By July, \n     that had ceased to be a comfortable position and, to give \n     their members more cover, they allowed a mostly token bill to \n     pass.\n       In the Senate, the leadership also produced a token bill \n     but refused to bring it to the floor unless the Democrats \n     agreed to limit themselves to a handful of amendments, which \n     the Democrats said would make a shell of the proceedings. \n     To thwart the Democrats when they have tried to bring up \n     their own bill, the Republicans have all but shut the \n     Senate down.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President. That isn't Senator Daschle saying that or \nmyself saying that or any number of my colleagues--Senator Boxer, \nSenator Murray, Senator Durbin. You can call the roll on so many of our \ncolleagues. That isn't any individual Member saying that. Here it is in \na Washington Post editorial, which has captured in two paragraphs \nexactly what we have been saying day after day after day, week after \nweek after week, month after month after month. They understand it, Mr. \nPresident, and the American people understand.\n  The editorial goes on to say that it disagrees with some provisions \nof the Democratic bill but, in its words:\n\n       That could be dealt with in the normal legislative process, \n     if only the Republicans would allow the process to occur. For \n     a combination of political and doctrinal reasons, they won't, \n     anymore than earlier in the year, they allowed tobacco or \n     campaign reform legislation to pass. They ought to be made to \n     answer for their record, but so far they have not.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President, clear as can be for all to see, and the \nAmerican people are increasingly aware of the current situation. That \neditorial captures it. It is clear what is going on here. It is clear \nto the Washington Post. It is clear to every Member of the Senate. It \nshould be clear to the American people.\n  The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective \nlegislation to end the abuses by HMOs, managed care plans and health \ninsurance companies. The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by Senator \nDaschle and other Senate Democrats, provides the needed and long \noverdue antidote to these festering and growing abuses. Our goal is to \nprotect patients and see that insurance plans provide the quality care \nthey promise in brochures but too often fail to deliver.\n  Our bill has been on the Senate calendar since March. Earlier \nlegislation was introduced more than a year and a half ago, but the \nSenate has taken no action because the Republican leadership has been \ncompounding the HMO abuses by abusing the rules of the Senate to block \nmeaningful reform.\n  This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate, and, \ncertainly, unacceptable to the American people. One of the most \nindefensible gaps in the Republican plan is its failure to cover public \nemployees. The GOP plan offers no protection for the 23 million people \nwho serve the public by working for State and local governments. The \nRepublican leadership is saying ``No'' to the police officers and the \nfirefighters who put their lives on the line every day to safeguard the \npublic; ``No'' to the schoolteachers who educate our children; no to \nnurses; ``No'' to social workers, doctors, and others who spend their \ndays caring for people in public health agencies and State and county \nhospitals; and ``No'' to countless other professionals who serve the \npublic through State and local governments.\n  I will take just a few moments of the Senate's time to refer to three \nexcellent commentaries that we heard today. I will have the full \nstatements printed in the Record. First, we will hear from Jerry Flynn:\n\n       My name is Jerry Flynn. I am a police officer with the City \n     of Lowell, Massachusetts Police Department. I am also the \n     National Vice-President of the International Brotherhood of \n     Police Officers. . .\n       . . . Unlike the sham being proposed by the Republican \n     Leadership, [the Democratic leadership plan] is the only \n     legislation that would actually protect patients and address \n     the abuses of managed care.\n       . . . Of particular concern to me, is the fact that the \n     Senate Republican Leadership bill does not apply to public \n     employees. This means all state and local government \n     employees in Lowell, as well as millions of other public \n     workers who are covered under managed care plans, would not \n     be protected under the limited provisions of the Republican \n     version of the bill.\n\n  The fact is that the Republican bill leaves out more than 100 million \nAmericans with private insurance. Of that group, we have some 23 \nmillion who are public employees.\n  Let me continue with Jerry Flynn's comments:\n\n       Don't public employees deserve the same protections as \n     other Americans? Don't public employees deserve the same \n     medical treatment as other Americans? It's high time Senate \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott and the rest of the Republican \n     Leadership stop treating public employees as second class \n     citizens.\n       As police officers, we know the importance of comprehensive \n     medical coverage.\n       Whether the injury is slight or life threatening, whether \n     it involves a civilian or fellow officer, whether it involves \n     an elderly person or a small child, the single most important \n     factor is that we get the best medical treatment possible--\n     and that the quality of care be determined by need, not by \n     cost.\n\n  Mr. President, listen to Tom McEachin:\n\n       . . . I am a fire fighter in Prince George's County, \n     Maryland. Fire fighters and paramedics are the first \n     responders to the overwhelming majority of acute medical \n     incidents in this nation. Every day we see the faces of those \n     Americans that the Patients' Bill of Rights Act would \n     protect. We see the look of fear on their faces as they react \n     to the emergency situations their loved ones face. They're \n     not only afraid for the lives of those they love, they're \n     also afraid about what the accountants at their HMOs will say \n     about the decisions they have just made. They're afraid \n     they'll be denied coverage and have to find a way to pay \n     astronomical bills or face long-term indebtedness. The way \n     the system's set up now, they sometimes end up hoping that \n     there's something seriously wrong with their loved ones, \n     because they're afraid of what the bean counters will say if \n     they decide it wasn't a true emergency.\n\n  Listen to these last few lines, Mr. President.\n\n       Fire fighters work in the worst of conditions. We go where \n     the danger is the greatest, during careers that can last more \n     than 20 years. Each year, more than half of us are injured on \n     the job, and the environmental hazards we face have been \n     proven to cause various forms of cancer, heart disease and \n     other life-threatening diseases. All we ask in return for the \n     risks we take is the simple guarantee that our health \n     coverage will protect us and our loved ones when we need it. \n     The Patients' Bill of Rights will do just that.\n       The 23 million state and local public employees who are not \n     covered by the Republican leadership's bill deserve better. \n     The citizens we serve deserve better. The American public \n     deserves better. As a fire fighter, all I'm asking for is \n     that my elected leaders treat me as I would treat them or \n     their family members if I had to rescue them in an emergency \n     situation. It's only fair.\n\n  Listen to that, Mr. President. This is from a firefighter. He is left \nout of the Republican bill, but protected in our bill. Let's debate \nwhether he and his colleagues should be included or excluded. That is \nwhat we are saying to the Republican leadership. And we have silence \nover there. This is what Thomas McEachin said:\n\n       The citizens we serve deserve better. The American public \n     deserves better. As a fire fighter, all I'm asking for is \n     that my elected leaders treat me as I would treat them or \n     their family members if I had to rescue them in an emergency \n     situation. It's only fair.\n\n  Why can't we debate that? That is true with every firefighter in this \ncountry. It is true about every police\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\nofficer in this country. It is true about every teacher in this \ncountry--all of them are excluded under the Republican bill. Can't we \ndebate that? Twenty-three million Americans left out, left behind. We \nare not discussing this in the Senate--no, no. We have to debate the \nVacancies Act. We have to debate Internet tax. We have to debate \nsalting. We have to debate child custody. We have to debate all of \nthose issues. We have to debate all of those issues, but we cannot \ndebate the concerns raised by Thomas McEachin. We cannot seem to make \nevery Member in this body accountable for their vote. I can understand \nwhy the Republicans do not want to go on record with their position. I \ncan understand why they do not want to. But that is not a good enough \nanswer.\n  Mr. President, the statements keep coming. Here is one from Doris \nBrightful, a registered nurse, now retired after 32 years with the \nBaltimore City Health Department. And I will include, as I mentioned, \nin the Record all of these statements.\n\n       . . . I am not just here today as a health care \n     professional. Nurses are also health care consumers. Nursing \n     is a dangerous profession, and nurses are often injured on \n     the job or exposed to dangerous infectious diseases. We \n     know that, sooner or later, we will need medical care. My \n     family members and my loved ones also will one day need \n     health care. Therefore, I am outraged that Senator Lott \n     and other Republicans would exclude me, my family and some \n     23 million other state and local public employees from \n     even those few protections that are offered in their \n     health care proposal. School teachers, firefighters, \n     public safety officers--and, yes, doctors and nurses \n     working in public health facilities--work hard every day \n     looking out for the well-being of our communities. Yet, \n     the Republican bill would deny us many of the same \n     protections that our patients would have under this plan.\n\n  All they want are the same protections--``the same protections that \nour patients would have under this plan.'' Nurse Brightful concludes:\n\n       In closing, I would just like to point out that the first \n     guiding principle in the Health Care Consumer Bill of Rights, \n     as set forth by the President's Advisory Commission on \n     Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry \n     was this: All consumers are created equal. The Republican \n     bill violates this principle, and should be rejected.\n       Instead, the Senate should pass S. 1890, the Patients Bill \n     of Rights, so that all Americans are protected.\n\n  Here it is, Mr. President. These are the real stories of what is \nhappening out across America. These are the comments of three of our \nfellow citizens--a firefighter, a police officer, a nurse--talking \nabout the kinds of inequities that exist out there. There are 23 \nmillion Americans in their situation, and still we cannot get this \nlegislation up on the floor.\n  The Republican leadership says we have too many bills to debate but, \nMr. President, the American families know what is going on here. The \ndoctors know what is going on. The nurses understand what is going on. \nThe newspapers around this country know what is going on. We are being \ndenied the opportunity to have a debate of this bill and to try to pass \nsomething that would be worthy of the Senate's actions.\n  Mr. President, this is just one aspect of the differences between the \nDemocratic and Republican health programs. We have tried, over the \nperiod of recent weeks, to bring examples of those that would be \naffected by either the inclusion or exclusion of the various \nprotections in the proposals, and to bring those examples to the \nattention of the Senate over the period of recent days and weeks. We \nwill continue to do so.\n  How much time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at other forums we heard about the need \nfor access to specialty care--one of the most important ways in which \nmanaged care plans shortchange patients. This is a right guaranteed in \nour Patients' Bill of Rights but not in our Republican plan.\n  Dr. Mirtha Casimir, a distinguished oncologist from Houston, Texas, \noutlined the tragedy she sees every single day because HMOs unduly \nrestrict access to specialists. This is what Dr. Casimir's statement \nwas:\n\n       Cancer patients today are facing a painful irony. At a time \n     of unprecedented progress in the understanding of the genetic \n     and cellular origins of cancer, as well as parallel advances \n     in drug development and design, the insurance industry is \n     exposing new cost containment.\n       Many medical oncologists are concerned about timely access \n     to cancer care and how the significant delays and referrals \n     are impacting early diagnosis and the outcome of therapies in \n     the first and subsequent courses of treatment. Not \n     uncommonly, I now see in my practice delays of 2 to 4 months \n     in a diagnosis of a new primary cancer or the detection of a \n     recurrence.\n\n  And what the doctor continues to point out is that when she finally \nsees these cases, it is often too late. For example, she sees women in \nher practice who have started out with a very, very small tumor in \ntheir breast, and then they have been delayed access to a specialist \nand denied various kinds of treatment. Their appeals go on and on \nthrough the HMOs, and finally, when they get to a skilled oncologist, \nafter weeks and months, often it is too late--often it is too late. The \ntumor has spread too far.\n  And Dr. Casimir said that more often than not when she flips to the \nfront part of the chart, she will see that the patient is covered by an \nHMO. She will see that the initial request was denied for the kind of \ntreatment that she could provide. And more often than not, she \nbelieves, as a skilled physician, that she could have saved the life of \nthat individual if they had been able to get the prompt kind of a \ntreatment and care. She wraps up in her statement by saying:\n\n       Poor quality of care is always more expensive, both in \n     human terms as well as in the resources expended to try to \n     right the wrong. If the Patients' Bill of Rights is not \n     passed, patients will continue to experience the hostility \n     of this turbulent health care environment in which care is \n     constrained, physicians are controlled, needs of cancer \n     patients are not addressed, and critically important \n     quality of life interventions are viewed as dispensable.\n\n  That is the statement from one of the top oncologists in the country, \nand the rest of the testimony spells out additional reasons in support \nof those points.\n  On September 15, we heard from the past president of the American \nAcademy of Neurology, Dr. Ken Viste from Wisconsin:\n\n       This country needs fair and compassionate legislation \n     establishing the national standard for all health plans in \n     order to help not harm people with chronic conditions or \n     disabilities.\n\n  The American Academy of Neurology said:\n\n       The House Republican leadership's bill, which passed the \n     House, fails to protect the rights and address the needs of \n     patients.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President, from the American Academy of Neurology. \nDr. Viste continued:\n\n       It is critical for people who need a medical specialist's \n     care to be able to seek the treatment from them directly, \n     immediately, and without penalty. The Daschle-Kennedy bill \n     answers this need by assuring that people with complex, \n     chronic conditions have direct access to specialists within a \n     health plan. And, if no specialist exists in the plan, \n     consumers have a right at no cost to seek a specialist \n     outside of the plan. We believe any adequate patient \n     protection legislation must include these provisions.\n       Willis Lester, one of the speakers at the rally, explained \n     when his employer switched to a managed care plan, his new \n     primary care doctor took him off his blood pressure and \n     cholesterol medications. Consequently, Lester suffered a \n     stroke. According to Dr. Nancy Futrell . . . the stroke is a \n     direct result of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, \n     which would have been controlled by his medications.\n       Dr. Futrell added that Lester's plan has limited his \n     physical therapy, ``essentially impairing his recovery.''\n\n  Explains Dr. Viste:\n\n       With the rise of managed care, we've seen many patients \n     with chronic conditions denied access to quality, specialized \n     medical care that they need. As a result, some of these \n     patients suffer long-term effects and end up on disability, \n     driving up costs to employers. Patients need a law with \n     ``teeth'' that guarantees they will be able to see a \n     specialist, appeal to obtain a medically necessary drug when \n     denied such under a prescription plan, and appeal denial of \n     care to an independent decison-making body.\n       Not only will the patient benefit, but in the end, the \n     employers, as well.\n       The Epilepsy Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis \n     Society, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Parkinson's \n     Disease Foundation, the Brain Injury Association, the \n     Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities joined the \n     [American Academy of Neurology] leaders and members . . . in \n     advocating the passage of S. 1890.\n\n  The Epilepsy Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, United \nCerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease Foundation, Brain Injury \nAssociation--\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\nevery one of these groups say that our legislation provides the \nprotections which are necessary for our families, and the GOP bill does \nnot.\n  We don't even have an opportunity to debate or discuss this. The \nmajority refuses to debate. We are still waiting to hear the name of \nthat first major medical society that supports the Republican proposal. \nWe are still waiting. They haven't been able to come up with one, not \none. Virtually every major health care group supports our program. They \nall do.\n  We will make adjustments and changes in any legislation to try and \nmove the legislation forward, but we are not going to compromise on \nvital protections. Every major medical professional group supports \nours. None, not one, support theirs.\n  The list goes on. This is from a statement of Jeanne Carpenter, the \npresident of the Epilepsy Foundation, in support of the Patients Bill \nof Rights:\n\n       The Epilepsy Foundation historically has been a strong \n     advocate for patients rights. We support affordable and \n     quality health care for all Americans. And that begins with \n     giving consumers the choice of health plans, a feature we are \n     pleased to see included in the proposed legislation.\n       We especially support several key provisions [in the \n     legislation]--access to specialists and provider choice, \n     detailed patient information, independent internal and \n     external review of service denials, and coverage for \n     nonformulary prescriptions where medically necessary.\n       Many patients and families tell us they are deeply \n     frustrated being denied referrals to specialists and the full \n     range of treatment options that specialized treatment centers \n     can provide. Not only is patient quality of life adversely \n     affected, but denial of services is a false economy. It \n     produces added cost for unnecessary emergency room and dental \n     services, lost productivity and other seizure-related \n     expenses.\n       Seizure control for many epilepsy patients is a complex \n     matter with important subtleties not always recognized in the \n     primary care setting. Families whose children continue to \n     have seizures need and deserve the opportunity to have their \n     cases reviewed by third parties with full knowledge of the \n     disorder and rapid progress is now being made in its \n     treatment.\n       Patients' rights legislation is long overdue. Each day of \n     delay, there are children whose chances in life are being \n     jeopardized because of ongoing seizures. We strongly urge \n     passage of these protections during the current session of \n     Congress and at the earliest possible moment.\n\n  Do we hear that? Every day of delayed debate and inaction we are \nputting at risk children whose lives are being jeopardized because of \nongoing seizures. How many are being jeopardized if we don't complete \nthe Vacancies Act? Or the salting act or the Internet tax or the \nfinancial services legislation? How many? Here, Mr. President, are the \nreal issues. This is what is really important in our remaining time \nthis year.\n  It is very clear why all of these organizations support this \nproposal. We have built into it not only the guarantee of specialty \ncare, but real internal and external appeals.\n  I will make a brief comment about the appeal procedures under the \nRepublican proposal. Under their plan, the decision to allow a patient \nto proceed to a so-called independent appeal will be made by the HMO \nitself, in consultation with their lawyers. Talk about having the fox \nguard the hen house, this is putting the fox in there. Do you know what \nwill happen under the Republican House plan? Even if the patient wins \non the appeal, the plan doesn't have to accept it. If they choose, they \ndon't have to follow it. So they can show a brochure to anybody buying \ninsurance, look you have an appeal. But they probably don't explain \nthat it is decided by the plan and that the plan doesn t have to follow \nthe ruling if it benefits the patient.\n  Our Republican friends say yes, we have an appeal provision. They say \nyes, we have it in our proposal. But this is the appeal they have. It \ndoesn't work in quite the same way as ours.\n  I see two of my good friends and colleagues here, so I will wind up. \nIt is important to understand that this issue is not going to go away.\n  As I have mentioned many times, the provisions listed on this chart \nand included in our legislation have either been recommended by the \nPresident's bipartisan commission--which required unanimous support by \nits members-- or were put in Medicare by the Congress or have been \nendorsed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or \nrecommended by the American Association of Health Plans, which \nrepresents HMOs across the country.\n\n  And, while the President's Commission did not specifically draft \nlegislation, they did not rule out legislation either. They simply said \nthat all Americans should have these protections. Most of our bill \nreflects the Commission's recommendations. Many of these provisions \ncurrently protect our seniors in Medicare. There is a lot of overlap \nhere. The HMO trade group and the State insurance commissioners--again, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--have said these are important \nprotections. Virtually all of our proposals have been recommended or \nadopted by other health care programs or experts. Talk about a modest \nproposal.\n  This is really a reflection of the best of those who understand this \nissue and have studied it for some period of time--probably for 8 to 10 \nyears.\n  That is what this is all about. It is sensible. It is responsible. It \nis common sense. It is common sense to take a sick child to the nearest \nemergency room and not across town. It is common sense to get a \nspecialist to take care of a particular kind of need. That makes sense. \nIt is common sense to give the best medical prescription drug to \nsomebody who is ill. It is common sense, with the breakthrough \ntechnologies and unprecedented progress that we are making in medicine, \nto allow people who can benefit from clinical trials to be able to \nparticipate in those clinical trials. It doesn't cost the HMOs very \nmuch more because they are going to have to pay for the basic routine \ncare in any event, and that care will continue. The clinical trial pays \nfor the additional treatment. So the cost isn't that great. But too \nmany patients don't have this right, and those who think they do are \nincreasingly denied it.\n  The list goes on. These are common sense proposals, Mr. President. It \nis common sense to hold people accountable for their actions. When you \nhold them accountable, you get better performance. The best testimony \non the issues of appeals and accountability that we heard was when \nSenator Specter had his excellent hearing. We learned that court cases \nrarely occur, even when patients can hold their plans accountable. The \n23 million employees of state and local governments can take their \nplans to court, as can the 15 million patients with individual health \ninsurance. We know how that works. It is rarely used. Why? Because it \nis there. In most cases, the internal and external appeals resolve it \nbefore it needs to go to court. In the end, with few exceptions, it \ndoesn't involve a court case. But what is clear--and the testimony is \noverwhelming because it is there--is that you get better quality. These \nplans can be held accountable for their actions, but we see that there \nis not as great a need when that right exists for patients.\n  That is what we are interested in. We are interested in the best \nquality. We believe the American people should be entitled to it.\n  These are some of the stories that we have heard in recent times. We \ncan go right down the list of protections in our bill and in every one \nof these areas on this chart, you can find compelling stories. We just \nask to debate and vote on these issues.\n  All we ask is that we cut back on some of the quorum calls that we \nhave had here lately. All we ask is that we follow Senator Daschle's \nsuggestion that we may debate these in the course of the evenings, at \nthe end of this week and part of next week, and have some resolution of \nthese issues. All we ask is that we give the American people at least \nan understanding that this institution is addressing something that is \nfundamentally important to their lives and the lives of their loved \nones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I concur with the sense of urgency that \nour colleague from Massachusetts just presented on this issue. With \nevery day that goes by, another American family is at risk because they \ndo not have these guaranteed protections; another American family is in \na quandary because they do not have the kind of information that this \nwould assure.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has spoken in great detail--and the \nSenator from Rhode Island will shortly do\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\nlikewise--on this. If I could just focus on two items. The most \ncontentious area between patients and their health maintenance \norganization is the emergency room. That is where the greatest number \nof disputes as to the appropriateness of service and responsibility for \npayment of service occurs.\n  Recognizing that fact, last year, this Congress passed a very strong \nprovision for the 35 million Americans who receive their health care \nfinancing through Medicare, to protect them relative to their HMO in an \nemergency room setting. Basically, the standard is, if you are a \nreasonable lay person and you are suffering from symptoms that a \nreasonable lay person would feel appropriate for emergency room \ntreatment--say, you have a pain in your left chest--you can go to the \nemergency room, receive treatment, and not be faced a month later with \nan enormous bill from that same emergency room because the HMO denied \ncoverage. The HMO is required to provide coverage.\n  If you will notice on the chart, I believe it will indicate that both \nbills--the GOP's and the Democratic--have emergency room access. But \nthat is not the end of the matter. It is not just a matter of getting \ninto the emergency room and having assurance that somebody is going to \nlook at you and determine whether your pain is angina or a heart \nattack. Then, after that decision is made, there is another critical \nperiod. That is what is called the postdiagnostic stabilization period, \nwhere something is done to you to bring you back to a level of health \nthat will allow you to return home.\n  There is a significant difference, because the Democratic bill \nprovides that that postdiagnostic stabilization period is also \nguaranteed to be covered. That is not the case with the Republican \nbill. So you can't just look at a chart with three or four words behind \nthe number and assume that we are talking about parity protections. \nThat is what we ought to be debating. Is there a rational reason to \nhave emergency room access covered, as it is in Medicare, but not to \nhave, as it is in Medicare, the postdiagnostic stabilization covered? \nWe could have a good debate on that issue, and we ought to have that \ndebate.\n  Secondly, the issue of informed judgment. Many citizens now have the \nopportunity to select from a variety of HMOs. They may be with an \nemployer plan that provides multiple HMOs, or if they are purchasing \nfrom their own resources from the marketplace, what typically is absent \nis the means by which even the most concerned and conscientious citizen \ncan make an informed judgment among this variety of plans.\n  So we have a provision for information to be made available on the \nquality of the plan: What kind of things might we anticipate would come \nfrom that information about performance outcomes? How many of the \npatients under one particular plan who, for instance, have a particular \ntype of surgical procedure have a successful outcome? If you are about \nto have surgery, you would be pretty interested in knowing what the \nprospects were of your having a positive result.\n  Another provision that is likely to be included is information about \nwhat will this plan do to help you maintain your state of good health? \nWill this plan, for instance, provide for screening tests and periodic \nexaminations? Those kinds of things, we know, have the greatest \npotential of spotting a problem before it becomes a fatal condition, \ngiving you the opportunity to do something to maintain the quality of \nyour health. That provision is in the Democratic plan, but it is not in \nthe Republican plan. I think that is a critical matter for Americans \nattempting to use their own best efforts to select a plan that will \nbest protect the health of their family.\n  So, Mr. President, this is an urgent and critical issue. We are \ntaking up a lot of matters in this last couple of weeks, and I would \nlet the American people make a judgment as to our sense of priorities. \nIs it more important to be considering the Judicial Vacancies Act \nduring the last 6 or 7 days of this Congress, or to be considering the \nBill of Rights for 161 million Americans, in terms of their health \ncare? That is a judgment that the American people should make. I think \nit is a judgment about which we in the Congress should feel a sense of \nresponsibility to the citizens of this country--to prioritize our \nefforts on their behalf.\n  Mr. President, I am certain we will have more to say on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my following \nremarks be included in the Record when the energy and water \nappropriations conference report is considered by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is informed that the energy and \nwater appropriations bill is not on the calendar. It is scheduled to be \non the calendar. The acting President does not believe the remarks \ntoday can be put in tomorrow's Record.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of that comment, I will therefore \ndefer my comments until the appropriate day when this matter will be \nconsidered. I would like to alert the Senate that it will be my \nintention at the appropriate time to provide such a statement and a \ncolloquy among Senators Domenici, Reid, Mack, and myself on the issue \nof funding for the Kissimmee River Restoration Project as part of the \nEverglades Restoration Project as it relates to that item within the \nenergy and water appropriations conference committee.\n  Mr. President, in light of the comments of the Chair, the uncertainty \nas to whether this bill will be before us today, I will conclude my \ncomments with that information to the Senate and look forward to \nparticipating when this matter is before the Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11103-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11108-S11109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENERGY AND WATER CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first all, I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Rhode Island for letting me jump in front of him. I will only take \na couple minutes.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, was in the \nChamber earlier talking about the fact that I had not permitted the \nenergy and water conference report to proceed under a unanimous consent \nagreement. I objected to that. And the reason I did so not objection to \nthe energy bill; I have none. Rather I objected because I wanted to \nonce again bring the attention of the Senate to the fact that we have a \nvery unfair situation presented to us in terms of the allocation of \nmoney for the defense portion of fiscal year 1999 Appropriations and \nfor the nondefense portion.\n  I again ask Senators to look at the July 30 Congressional Record, \npage S9404, when I spoke, and there was a short colloquy with Senator \nSpecter, myself, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Domenici at that time.\n  Basically, it goes back to a letter that was written on April 2, \n1998, by Senator Domenici to Senator Stevens which basically said that \nby using OMB scoring figures and policy decisions, they had identified \n$2.2 billion more in outlays for defense by using the OMB policy \nassumptions rather than CBO policy assumptions.\n  At the end of the letter Senator Domenici writes, ``Pursuant to your \namendment, we are also looking at the issue of nondefense outlay \nscoring and will report back to you shortly.''\n  That was April 27, and we still don't have a report.\n  Right now, based on informal preliminary meetings being held with the \nHouse, it is clear that a considerable increase over the funding in the \nSenate bill will be required to meet all of the demands and get this \nbill signed into law.\n  Now, earlier today I spoke to Senator Domenici about this, and \nSenator Domenici mentioned something to me about $300 million that he \nhad already given. That unfortunately is not my understanding of where \nwe officially stand. We still haven't seen it, and I do not know where \nit is. If it is $215 million or even $300 million, that still means we \nare going to have to trim over half a billion dollars from what the \npreliminary discussions with the House have led us to.\n  So where are we going to trim? Head Start? Are we going to cut IDEA, \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act? Are we going to cut \ncommunity health centers? Are we going to cut the Ryan White AIDS \nProgram? Drug\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\ntreatment? How about our vitally important medical research at NIH? Are \nwe going to cut all those? A half a billion dollars we are going to \nhave to cut.\n  Well, I and others have said what is fair is fair, and if you use OMB \npolicy statements for defense scoring, you ought to use them for \nnondefense also. If that were the case, the Labor, Health, and Human \nServices Subcommittee would not be getting $215 million; it would, in \nfact, get $770 million--not $215 million.\n  So the reason I have said that we need this time--and I will not take \na lot of time now because I know that Senator Reed has prepared a \nspeech here, and I don't want to interrupt his time. He was kind enough \nto give me a couple minutes here just to lay this out. But right now we \nneed fair treatment for these domestic programs, and $215 million \ndoesn't do it. But if we have the same kind of scoring as we got for \ndefense, we should get about $770 million.\n  So I just wanted to alert Senators as to why I was taking this course \nof action. We have been waiting since April 22. We talked about it on \nJuly 30. Here we are in the final closing days of the Congress and \nprograms vital to the health, to the education, and the security of the \npeople of this country are going underfunded.\n  I don't know what kind of games are being played. I don't know what \nall is going on behind the scenes. But we are going to continue to \ndemand fairness until we get it. I am sorry that Senator Specter can't \nbe here. Of course, he is home because of the Jewish holy day. I would \njust again refer to Senator Specter's comments on July 30 of this year \nin which he basically echoed what I was saying, and that is that we \nneed to get this correct scoring. I would not want to put words in \nSenator Specter's mouth without him being here, but I believe he feels \nthe same way I do.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for letting me get ahead of \nhim. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11108-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11109-S11110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights and join my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Graham, Senator Harkin, and many others in urging that this \nvery important legislation be brought to this floor immediately, \ndebated thoroughly, and passed.\n  When I go back to my home State of Rhode Island, I encounter lots of \nissues. But there is no issue that is more important to my State and to \nthis Nation than having a health care system that works for them, \nhaving a health care system that is governed by rules which require \nthat people get what they pay for. There are thousands and thousands of \nindividuals who are paying for managed care coverage, thousands and \nthousands and thousands of companies that are providing coverage. The \nshocking thing is that many times people discover they really do not \nhave the coverage they need when they need it. With the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, we are going to provide a framework of sensible rules which \nwill guarantee access to quality health care coverage for the vast \nmajority of Americans.\n  The Democratic bill, S. 1890, does that. In stark contrast to the \nRepublican proposal, it will provide broad coverage to the American \npeople. As illustrated by this chart, the only group of people covered \nby the Republican proposal are just those who are covered through a \nself-funded employer plan, only 48 million Americans. The Republican \nbill leaves out 113 million Americans. It leaves out people whose \nemployer provides coverage through an insurance policy or an HMO \ndirectly. It leaves out State and local government workers and people \nbuying individual health insurance policies.\n  I hope that we can at least agree that if we are going to do \nsomething with respect to reforming managed care in the United States, \nwe will do something that covers all people who are insured by HMOs \nthroughout the United States.\n  As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, just pointed \nout, when you leave out State and local government workers, you are \nleaving out police officers, firefighters--those people who not only do \nwe depend upon, but people who we hope will have access to high-quality \ncare. That is just one example of groups of people who are denied \nprotections under the Republican version but will be provided these \nprotections under the Democratic bill, S. 1890.\n  Throughout this debate, we have heard a lot about what we must do \nwith respect to health care. Again, as my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, pointed out, the Democratic bill is supported by the \nbroadest possible coalition of health care organizations. Here is a \npartial list of those organizations: The American Medical Association, \nthe American Cancer Society, the National Association of Children's \nHospitals. Every major health care organization in the United States \nhas recognized the need for protections with respect to managed care \nand has recognized the value of S. 1890, the Democratic bill, and is \nstrongly supportive of this proposal.\n  We have people throughout this country demanding that we take \nappropriate action. We have every major organization committed to the \nhealth and welfare of this country and its people--all of them--\ntogether asking us to act. And yet here we find inaction; we are not \nable to bring this bill to the floor for a thorough debate and for a \nvote. I think that is wrong, and I think we are not doing our job as \nrepresentatives of the American people. Congress is not responding to \none of the critical needs of every family in this country: Providing \nhigh quality health care for all families.\n  My focus throughout the debate has been to ensure particularly that \nchildren are treated fairly by managed care health care plans. If a \nfamily has a problem with a managed care plan, it is serious. When it \nis an adult, a mother or father, it is serious. But it is particularly \nserious, and many times tragic, when it involves a child.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that deals specifically \nwith the issue of children in managed care. This legislation was \nprompted by my own observations and advice I received from the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, by the National Association of Childrens \nHospitals, by many pediatric specialty organizations--all of these \ngroups together pointed out to me that we just can't consider children \nas small adults. If a child has a particular condition, the expertise \nneeded to deal with that pediatric condition is not something gained \ngenerally in medical education. Pediatric specialists are vital to our \nhealth care system because they can treat the unique needs of children. \nChildren often need access to these specialists, and frequently they \nare denied that type of care.\n  Earlier this year in the Labor Committee, we heard the story of \nMelissa Froelich. I have a picture of Melissa right here. She is 2 \nyears old and has become the poster child for the American Red Cross. \nAs this poster describes, ``Melissa spent her first 18 months in a \nhospital clinging to life. Thanks to medical miracles and blood donors \nlike you, she is finally home and doing well.'' I would imagine her \nparents would hasten to add something along the lines of, ``No thanks \nto the managed care plan'' because her medical ordeal was matched by a \nbureaucratic ordeal waged by her parents, particularly her mother, on \nher behalf.\n  Melissa was born with serious congenital heart defects. In the first \n2 years of her life, she spent a great deal of time in and out of \nhospitals. Her mother, Staci Froelich, had to fight a battle every day, \na relentless battle to get Melissa the kind of care she needed and \ndeserved and that they had paid for.\n  Staci Froelich is a registered nurse, a licensed nursing home \nadministrator. She is someone very sophisticated in the way the system \noperates. I hesitate to speculate what would have happened if Melissa's \nmother hadn't had that kind of expertise--if she were, like so many \nAmericans, not prepared to deal with all the bureaucratic red tape, all \nthe hurdles that HMOs can throw up when they deny coverage and deny \ncare.\n  She persevered, and she did it day in and day out. In her words, this \nis what her struggle was like:\n\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\n\n       My husband and I are responsible middle-class American \n     citizens. We were both employed and had two healthy children. \n     We took out the best health insurance policies our places of \n     employment had to offer. We believed if there were ever a \n     medical emergency, we would be covered. After all, we had \n     done everything in our power to have the necessary coverage \n     should that occur. We were in for a rude awakening.\n\n  With the birth of Melissa, with her serious heart problems, they \nfound out that literally that their HMO didn't provide much coverage at \nall when they needed it most. This HMO forced this family to jump \nthrough repeated hurdles. For example, after Melissa's first open heart \nsurgery, the HMO wanted to transfer her to a nursing center for senior \ncitizens. Can you imagine that, an infant being sent to a senior \ncitizens nursing home facility where the only specialists are \ngeriatricians, not pediatricians? That is what the HMO wanted to do to \nsave some money. Of course, her mother had to fight tooth and nail to \nprevent that from happening.\n  This example illustrates something else that underlies my concerns: \nThe presumption by many HMOs that a child is no different from an \nadult, and if there is an open bed in a senior nursing center, send the \nchild there. That is not the type of care that those parents expected \nto get for their child when they paid their premiums and when they \nsought out the best coverage they could.\n  During the course of Melissa's illness, oftentimes the HMO would try \nto switch her specialist or try to suggest she didn't need pediatric \nspecialists. All of this added up to an ordeal on top of the basic \nordeal of a very sick child. In this country, we should not tolerate \nthat situation.\n  I am happy to say, as Melissa's picture demonstrates, she is a \nthriving, beautiful child of 2 years--the result of her family's \nefforts, the result of many people, but certainly not the result of a \nhealth care system that was out there to assist her and to provide for \nher family.\n  Her story illustrates all too well what we hear constantly: every day \nconsumers face difficulties to get the services that they need, they \nface delays, complex rules and regulations which an average lay person \ncan't understand. We can change this situation if we act promptly and \ntimely, and if we act immediately to bring this legislation to the \nfloor.\n  Managed care has provided great benefits to our country, particularly \nwhen it comes to preventive services. The emphasis on prevention is \ngood. But all too often we hear stories like Melissa's story, and other \nstories, where the system is not working to the benefit of the public, \nand where people are not getting the health care services they've paid \nfor. It is our responsibility to make sure that this situation does not \ncontinue.\n  We also sometimes look at HMOs and think, ``Well, maybe they've got \nsome problems, but maybe the problems are not really being addressed \nhere.'' There was a study done at the University of California at San \nFrancisco by Elizabeth Jameson at the University of California. She \ncompared the pediatric care provided to children by private and public \nmanaged care plans.\n  Frequently people consider Medicaid and say, ``Well, that's not top-\ngrade health care because that's a public health care program for low-\nincome Americans and, you know, it is not good compared to some of the \nlarge employer programs, the blue chip HMOs.'' Her study was very \nrevealing though. It found that low-income children in California s \nMedicaid program received age-appropriate care that is consistent with \nrecognized clinical guidelines, while those in private health care \nplans often did not.\n  In effect, there was a better chance for a child in the California \nMedicaid system to have access to a pediatric specialist, to have the \nkind of focused specialized care that we assume would be found in the \nHMOs. Certainly, both the employer and the employee are paying a lot of \nmoney for those HMO premiums. I assume that he or she believes that all \nthat money is buying care at least as good and probably better than \nwhat you would find in a public program. But the reality is, that is \nnot the case. This is another indication that we should act to improve \nthe quality of health care that is delivered by HMOs throughout this \ncountry. That is, we should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This study in California also found that some managed care plans \nimpose restrictions on referrals to pediatric specialists. Jameson also \nfound that complex pediatric diseases are being treated by providers \nwithout pediatric expertise when, in fact, a pediatric specialist would \nprovide more appropriate care. All of this, again, suggests that we \nhave to act promptly to pass this bill to ensure that the American \npublic gets what it is paying for: Good quality care through managed \ncare plans.\n  Again, I am particularly pleased that the Democratic bill \nincorporates many of the provisions from my legislation that would deal \nparticularly with the problems of children and managed care. The \nDemocratic bill includes, for example, a guarantee of access to \nnecessary pediatric services, and appeal rights that address the \nspecial needs of children, such as an expedited review if the child's \nlife or development is in jeopardy.\n  Again, here is another example where adults and children differ. \nChildren have special needs, not just with their present health state \nlike adults, but also with their development. And if our insurance \nplans are not keenly attuned to the developmental aspects of children, \nthey are going to provide inferior care. So this legislation would \nrequire HMOs, in the context of appeals rights, to consider not just \nthe present health status of the child as they do with adults, but also \nwith the child s development.\n  Also, the Democratic bill would require pediatric expertise in staff \nperforming utilization review. Under our proposal, when the HMO is \nexamining the use of services for a child, the HMO would have to ensure \nthat reviewers had pediatric expertise. Too often today HMO plans' \nutilization review is solely in the context of adults. This practice \noverlooks our children, and overlooks the fact that children often have \nvery different health care needs than adults.\n  The bill would also require that HMOs give information to parents \nabout quality and satisfaction related to the treatment of children. \nThis information should be easily obtainable so that when a parent \nsigns up for a health care plan, they will know upfront what to expect \nfor their children. They will not have to wait until that child has a \nserious, serious illness.\n  All of these provisions are incorporated in the legislation that we \nshould be debating here in the Senate today. All of this is \nincorporated in the legislation that has been endorsed by over 18 \norganizations whose sole commitment is to the health care quality of \nthe American people.\n  The Patients Bill of Rights legislation, too, will cover the vast \nmajority of Americans. It will cover all who are in private health care \nplans, unlike the Republican alternative. In the days ahead, we have to \nmake critical choices. I can think of no more important issue to \ndebate, to discuss, and to act upon than improving the quality of \nhealth care in the United States, passing the Patients' Bill of Rights, \ngiving each American family an opportunity to know what they are \ngetting, and ensure that they are getting the health care they are \npaying for.\n  I hope we can do that. I hope that this debate will begin. I hope \nthat we can go back to our states in a very few weeks and report to the \nAmerican people that we have listened to their concerns, we have \nlistened to what they feel is important and that we have acted in their \nbest interests by passing the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that we are in a 30-hour \npostcloture debate on the motion to bring to the floor the Internet tax \nbill. I believe I am correct in that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11109-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11110-S11111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say that piece of legislation and a lot of other \nlegislation that has been considered by the Congress, by this 105th \nCongress, in my judgement pales in importance to the responsibility we \nhave to deal with the current farm crisis that exists in this country.\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\n  Last evening, I drove home from the Capitol, and I thought about the \nday. When I left, I left the conference committee between the House and \nthe Senate on agriculture appropriations. It was a conference committee \nin a small room. There were a lot of people. It was cramped and hot. \nThe result of that conference committee was a party-line vote to reject \na proposal by President Clinton to provide nearly $8 billion of \nemergency aid to deal with the farm crisis.\n  Instead, the conference committee accepted the majority party's \nproposal of roughly $3.9 billion which almost everyone understands \ncomes far short of what is necessary. I also thought about the news \nyesterday that was described in a story in the Washington Post this \nmorning. I was thinking about it on the way home because I was thinking \nabout the juxtaposition. It was a story about a hedge fund. This \nparticular hedge fund apparently had liabilities upwards of $100 \nbillion and ran into serious problems. And then the rescuers were \nbrought together under the Federal Reserve Board's so-called official \nsponsorship.\n  The banks were brought together, and they put together a rescue \npackage for this group that is involved in hedging. By the way, the Fed \nspokesman said they are helping sponsor this rescue package not with \nFederal funds but from all of the lenders. The Fed felt it had to get \nthese lenders together for a rescue package because it had a ``concern \nabout the good working of the marketplace and the large risk exposure \nand potential for a disruption of payments.''\n  One wonders about such an organization that is involved in hedging. \nBy definition this is a rather speculative occupation. In fact, one of \nthe principals had been one of the top officials at the Federal Reserve \nBoard. He went over to this hedging operation. It grows and expands, \nand then has liabilities up to $100 billion. I have no idea what the \nassets were. Then it gets in trouble. But then instead of having the \nmarketplace assess its future, the Federal Reserve Board apparently \nbrings together the lenders and says, ``Well, gosh, you're too big to \nfail.''\n  If you apparently work in these environs, have these contacts, and \nare involved in this kind of risk, you are too big to fail. But what if \nyou are one of those family farms out there that has seen what has \nhappened to their wheat price. The price of wheat has been going down, \ndown, down, down. These family farmers are told, ``You're too small to \nmatter.'' What is the difference between those who are too big to fail \nand those who are too small to matter?\n  I guess it is economic clout in the form of sheer raw economic power.\n  I would hope that we would have the opportunity to decide in this \nCongress that family farmers ought not be failing in this country \neither. The fact is this country will lose something very important to \nits future if we decide that family farmers do not matter. Right now \nthey are suffering through a crisis that is very significant and one \nthat we must address.\n  The question is whether we will address it in a kind of a puny, cheap \nway that does not solve it? Will Congress do just enough to pull us \nthrough the election for a month or two? Or is Congress going to \naddress it and say, ``Farmers, we're on your side. You matter to this \ncountry. We're going to do something significant to help you get in the \nfield next spring, help you harvest next fall, and give you some hope \nthat maybe you can make a decent living\"?\n  Mr. President, I notice that a couple of my colleagues perhaps want \nto propound a unanimous consent request. And I will be happy to yield \nthe floor briefly provided that I retain my right to the floor and \nprovided it is not going to take 15 or 20 minutes. If they intend to \npropound a unanimous consent request that is very brief, I am happy to \ninterrupt my presentation and allow them to do that so they don't have \nto wait.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from North Dakota. I wanted to join him \nin talking about the agriculture situation, but I appreciate if he \nwould yield the floor, and he can get the floor back when Senator \nDomenici and I finish.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent I regain the floor following the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11110-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11111-S11112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4060\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4060 and that there be 45 minutes for debate, with 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Graham of Florida, 5 minutes under the control of \nSenator Jeffords, and the remaining 10 minutes equally divided between \nSenator Reid, the minority manager, and myself; further, I ask that \nupon the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the conference report \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, and I won't object, but I \ndid want to engage in a brief colloquy here with the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee regarding statements I made earlier on \nthe floor that Senator Domenici also made earlier on the floor.\n  I did not want to hold up the energy and water bill at all, but I did \nwant to make a strong case that the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee is having some very, very severe problems \nin meeting the basic health and education needs of the country and the \nrequirements that other Senators and House Members have imposed on us. \nWe simply don't have the outlays necessary to do the job. I asked the \nhelp of the Budget Committee chairman in this regard.\n  At the outset, again, I want to make clear for the record that \nSenator Domenici has been a strong supporter of our subcommittee. I \nknow he has worked very hard and very diligently to make sure we do \nhave the kind of resources that we need. However, it is clear that we \nhave come up short.\n  I just wanted to ask the Senator from New Mexico if he could, \nperhaps, enlighten me further as to where we might be on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Harkin, let me thank you very, very much for \nthe consideration you are giving us today in letting this very \nimportant bill pass.\n  I think the Senator knows that while a lot of what I do as chairman \nof the Budget Committee is fun work, a lot of it isn't very much fun. \nThat part that isn't very much fun is the issue of who is right on the \nscoring--OMB or CBO. I am charged with the responsibility, if there is \na difference between them, of going through it, line by line, program \nby program, with my staff, and if there are, indeed, errors that run in \nfavor of OMB, which means you would have more money to spend, if they \nare based on policy differences that were not taken into consideration \nwhen CBO did theirs, we make the adjustment.\n  I can report, as staff on your committee knows, we have found $215 \nmillion in outlays where we found policy errors, and they came mostly \nfrom the IDEA program where they made changes and they were taken into \nconsideration regarding the new policy costs, so we are at $215 now.\n  I assure the Senator that I am totally aware of the difficulties in \nthe bill. I will continue to review the scorekeeping baseline \nassumptions made for your bill by both OMB and CBO and see if there are \nany other adjustments that need to be done to accommodate the concerns \nthe Senator has expressed on the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his diligence in looking at this.\n  Believe me, I know it is a tough job. I can only imagine being \nchairman of the Budget Committee in these times, working under the \nconstraints under which we have to work. I have a lot of sympathy for \nthe Senator's position on this.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, I know from my past experience in \ndealing with the Senator from New Mexico of his strong support for \nthose programs that we have, whether it is IDEA, whether it is drug \ntreatment, or NIH research or community health centers. I could go down \nthe list. I know the Senator from New Mexico has been a strong \nsupporter of these. I am very grateful for his work in diligently \nfinding this extra money in terms of finding the policy differences. \nAnd I appreciate his commitment to\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\ncontinue to review these differences and to make other appropriate \nadjustments. Hopefully, as we move along, there will be others. I \npledge to him that I will work closely with him as we move towards \ncompletion of the important work on this bill.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Senator for his consideration and \nhis efforts in helping us to get to this point. I appreciate it very \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the regular order says we finish this \ndiscussion, but we are waiting for one of the Senators to see if they \nreally want to speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The regular order is that I am recognized following the \nunanimous consent request, and I was recognized for an hour. I will not \ntake all of that hour. The regular order is that the Chair would \nrecognize me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, thank you very much. I was happy to allow \nthe unanimous consent request to be granted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11111-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11112-S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Iowa wishes to \njoin in this discussion, and I am happy to have his input.\n  I was driving home last evening after the Agriculture appropriations \nconference committee, and I was once again struck by how some in \npolitics here just sort of shrug off some things that are so important. \nI am referring especially to the future of family farming. It is true \nthat almost every day you see something around here in which someone \ntreats the important things too lightly and then someone treats the \nlight things in a far too serious way. It is hard to see that things \nare treated appropriately.\n  There is no more urgent need in this country, in my judgment, than to \naddress the farm crisis at this time. If we do not act on a timely \nbasis, we will not have family farmers left in the Farm Belt given \ntheir current circumstances.\n  Again, this chart shows the price of wheat. This is the income our \nfarmers receive for their production. In 1 year in North Dakota, our \nfarmers lost 98 percent of all their net income. It was just washed \naway. Their net income was virtually all gone. It was a 98 percent drop \nin their paycheck. Think of it this way: What if this were your salary \nor your wage? Look at what has happened, month after month after month \nafter month. This is the gross returns that our farmers receive. The \nprice of wheat in our part of the country is down, down, down, way \ndown. In fact, the price of wheat has fallen 57 percent since the \nFreedom to Farm law was passed.\n  These families are out there living on the land, turning the yard \nlight on, illuminating the dreams and hopes of a family that is trying \nto make a go of it. They are discovering they are going broke in record \nnumbers and nobody seems to care much because we have people that chant \non street corners in Washington, DC, ``the marketplace, the \nmarketplace, the free market.''\n  There is no free market. What a bunch of unmitigated baloney. This is \nno free market. There has never been a free market in agriculture, and \nthere will not be one.\n  This is picture of a farmer that is being sold out. This is an \nauction sale. All his equipment is being sold. These farmers go broke \nand they have an auction sale. They are told, gee, you didn't make it \nin the free market.\n  Let's examine this free market. This farmer plants some wheat in the \nspring and harvests it in the fall, if the farmer has some good luck. \nIf it doesn't rain too much, and if it rains enough; if the insects \ndon't come and if the crop disease doesn't come; if it doesn't hail; if \nall those things don't occur or do occur, this farmer may or may not \nget a crop. And then this farmer puts that crop, after a hard day's \nharvest, into a truck and puts it on a county road and goes to market. \nHe pulls up to an elevator and the elevator manager says, ``You can \ndump that grain in my country elevator.'' Guess what it costs a farmer \nto produce that crop? It costs five dollars a bushel to produce that \nbushel of wheat, and the elevator man says he is prepared to give the \nfarmer $2.50. In other words, he is prepared to give only half of what \nit costs the farmer to raise it.\n  The elevator man says, ``What I want to do is to put that grain on \nthe railroad car and the railroad company will charge you twice what it \nis worth to haul it, and they will haul to the miller who will make a \nrecord profit grinding it, and they will send it perhaps to a grocery \nmanufacturer and they will puff it and pop it and crisp it and flake it \nand they will put it in a bright colored box.'' Then they are going to \nship it to the grocery store shelf and somebody out there is going to \ncome and buy it in Pittsburgh, or Fargo, or Los Angeles. These \nconsumers are going to pay $4 a box for a bright-colored box of wheat \nthat is puffed up and called puffed wheat now. The person who put the \npuff in it is making record profits, the person who hauled it on the \nrailroad car is making record profits, and the miller is making record \nprofits. Everybody is making record profits, except the farmers who got \ntheir hands dirty, gassed up the tractor, plowed the ground, seeded and \nfertilized the ground, harvested the crop, and hauled it to market. \nThey are going broke in record numbers. Yet, nobody seems to care a \nbit.\n\n  Last night, in that conference committee, they were stone deaf to a \nproposal by this President who said we need $8 billion in emergency \naid, and we need it now if we are going to solve this farm crisis. They \nrejected that on a straight party-line vote. It is not that there is \nnot enough money. They think they have enough to give an $80 billion \ntax cut. The sky is the limit there. But how about another $4 billion \nfor family farmers? That is what we were talking about last night. We \nwere asking just another $4 billion more to save family farmers. They \nhave $80 billion for a tax cut, but they don't have another $4 billion \nto invest in the lives of these people, who I think are the salt of the \nEarth. Family farmers are the ultimate risk-takers.\n  Let me mention one more point about this free market. I talked about \nthe monopoly railroads that haul the grain and the monopoly grain trade \nfirms. Wherever you look, in every direction our farmers face a \nmonopoly. It doesn't matter which way they turn. Let's say we have a \ncow out here. They are raising wheat, corn, soybeans, and they are \nraising some cows. They are going to send the cow to market. But are \nthey going to make money off that cow? I don't think so, because that \ncow is going to be sold into a monopoly. Four firms control over 80 \npercent of all the slaughter of beef cattle in this country. That \nfarmer markets up to a monopoly. That farmer moves the grain to a \nmonopoly railroad and markets into a monopoly grain trade.\n  Then we have these half-baked economists who talk about the free \nmarket. Harry Truman used to say, ``Give me a one-armed economist. I'm \nsick and tired hearing `on this hand' and `on the other hand.''' I am \nnot sure how many economists we have around here talking about the free \nmarket. Maybe we ought to put a robot out on the street corner and let \nhim chant, ``There is no free market here.''\n  In every direction, the farmer is getting fleeced. This Congress, for \na change, needs to say we are going to be on the side of the ultimate \nproducers in this country, who are the economic all-stars in this \ncountry. If we don't, we won't have any family farmers left.\n  I had a young boy named Wyatt write to me. He is a sophomore at a \nschool in Stanley, ND. The other day in a letter to me, he said, ``I am \na 15-year-old farm boy. My dad can feed 180 people, but he can't feed \nhis own family.'' That says something about family farming. It says how \nproductive they are, how important they are, how incredible they are as \nproducers, and what they have to face in a market controlled by \neconomic giants that pillage and prey on these family farmers every day \nand in every way. And, they do it in such a way that family farmers \ncan't make a living.\n  This Government and this Congress, has to decide whether we are going \nto stand up for these people or not. We are going to force another vote \non the floor of the Senate. We have had two votes to get a decent \nsupport price, and we lost by a handful each time. But for those who \ndon't want to vote on this, I say: Brace yourself, because you are \ngoing to have to vote again. We are not\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\ngoing to quit. Family farmers would not expect us to quit. They don't \nquit and we are not going to quit them. We are going to vote on this \nagain until we get a result that says this Congress stands with family \nfarmers and that this Congress cares about the future of farm families.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa, if he has a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding for a \nquestion. First of all, I thank the Senator for a very eloquent and \nforceful statement on what is happening out there and, really, the \nshame of this Congress in not addressing it.\n  As I look at your charts here and see the free-fall in the price of \nwheat over the last couple of years--since the 1996 so-called Freedom \nto Farm bill was passed--I look at that and I wonder what happened to \nthe price of bread. Has that come down? What about all the wheat \nproducts, like pasta and all the things into which wheat goes? I ask \nthe Senator, what happened? Are the consumers making out on this and \ngetting a cut-rate deal at the grocery store?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, no. This is about corporate profits, not about \nadvantages to consumers at the disadvantage of farmers. What is taken \nout of the hide of family farmers in collapsed prices doesn't go into \nthe pockets of consumers through cheaper bread prices. Take a look at \nthe price of a loaf of bread when the price of wheat peaked about 2\\1/\n2\\ years ago. Then go to your grocery store and look at the price of a \nloaf of bread today. Ask yourself, gee, if farmers suffered a nearly \n60-percent drop in the price for wheat, what happened to the price of a \nloaf of bread? The answer is that somebody in between is taking more \nprofit. But the consumer hasn't gotten the benefit. This country always \nhad a cheap food policy. Will it have a policy that protects the basic \nincome requirements of family farmers?\n  Mr. HARKIN. One of my neighbors keeps asking me. He said, ``I hear \nabout all these farm problems.'' He lives in a city. He said, ``I can't \nunderstand, if the farmers aren't making money, how come I'm not seeing \nlower prices in the store?'' They don't understand that. I think the \nSenator from North Dakota pointed out that consumers aren't seeing it \nin the store. The fact is that bread has gone up in the last couple \nyears, not down. The large grain companies, the shippers, the \nmonopolies are reaping a windfall. They are buying these products from \nthe farmer, not at wholesale, but at fire sale prices.\n  In listening to the Senator, I could not help but remember what John \nKennedy said in Sioux City, IA, when he was running for President in \n1960. He made the statement: ``The farmer is the only person who buys \nretail, sells wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.'' Well, now \ntoday farmers aren't even selling wholesale. They are selling at fire \nsale prices--not only wheat, but corn and soybeans. And pork prices, \nthis year, are probably going to average their lowest since 1974. They \nare working at extremely low cattle prices. So all across the \nagricultural sector, we have a terrible crisis.\n  Now, as the Senator pointed out again last night in our conference \ncommittee, when we met to try to do something, to answer this crisis \nand need in rural America, we were told that, no, we would not do it, \nwe can only do a little bit. I liken last night to somebody dying of \nthirst and you give them a thimbleful of water. That is what those who \nwe were in conference with last night basically did to the farmers. \nThey slapped them in the face and gave them a thimbleful of water when \nthey are dying of thirst. It is a shame.\n  It came down to a straight party-line vote. It is very unfortunate \nthat it had to be on a party-line basis when this issue begs for \nnonpartisanship and bipartisanship. Yet, it has evolved into a partisan \nsituation. That is a real shame. I think it is a shame that our \ncolleagues voted against any meaningful help. As the Senator pointed \nout, we had about a $3 billion difference. In other words, for $3 \nbillion, we could have really met the needs of farmers all over this \ncountry--not only the farmers in Iowa and North Dakota, but the farmers \nin Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and all over the country. Farmers who \nare either suffering from the fall in prices, or because they have had \na drought, or floods, or disease. All of these things have piled up \nthis year to really put agriculture in dire straits.\n  No, they don't have the money for that, as the Senator pointed out, \nbut they do have money for an $80 billion tax cut.\n  I am sure the Senator would agree with me. I met with farmers in Iowa \nnot too long ago and I talked about this tax cut. I said, ``Who do you \nthink is going to get it? I will give you a hint: It isn't you.'' They \nare not going to get it; it is going to go to upper-income people. We \nknow that. But for $3 billion we could have really helped pull these \nfarmers out. And we still can if we have the will.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota in my closing question--and I \nthank him again for his strong support for the American farmer, the \nfamily farmer, and for always being front and center here on the floor \nand in our committee meetings, for fighting for those family farmers. \nLord knows, we don't have too many people around here fighting for them \nanymore. But the strength and the passion and courage of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has gone a long way toward at least helping us get \nthis far, getting something through to help our farmers--even though it \nis not going to be enough to save them, unless we can have some more \naction on the floor. The Senator has indicated that when that bill \ncomes back, we are going to have more action on this floor. We are not \ngoing to go away quietly. I join with the Senator from North Dakota in \nsaying that. We are not going to go away quietly. We are going to be \nhere until the last bell rings of this Congress to do everything we can \nto help those family farmers.\n\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota again for his eloquent remarks \nand for his steadfastness in standing up for those who really are the \nbackbone of this country, those who have worked hard, produced our food \nand fiber and the products they have raised in our export channels have \nbeen the only thing that has kept our balance of payments and our \nbalance of trade with other countries at least somewhat positive. It \nhas only been agriculture. It hasn't been anything else, just \nagriculture. And yet to let them go down the drain because of monopoly \npractices I think is just a shame, and I think it is something we have \nto address.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for, again, leading the fight.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. He and I \nand others from the farm belt feel very strongly about this issue \nbecause it is not just some cerebral discussion about economic theory. \nIt is about thousands and thousands of people who have had dreams and \nhopes of continuing to operate their family farm and raising their \nfamily out in the country and tilling the soil and producing food. It \nis about whether they are going to be able to continue to do that. This \nisn't a bluff nor is this crying wolf.\n  What has happened in my State is the complete collapse of grain \nprices coupled with the worst crop disease in a century. It has just \nput thousands of family farmers in a position where they are not going \nto be able to continue to farm.\n  I would like to read just a couple of letters. This one is from a \nyoung man named Eric. He graduated from high school 10 years ago. He is \na farmer. His family and his wife's family were farmers. Eric wrote to \nme and he said, ``When I started out, I knew it wasn't going to be \neasy. The only support either family, mine or my wife's, was able to \nafford was advice and hard work.'' They could not afford more support \nthan that.\n  He goes on to say, ``In our area we have been hit with heavy rains \nthe past 5 years which has greatly reduced the yield of our crops, and \ncaused crop disease. One of those years we had to burn the crop off of \nthe fields so it would be able to dry enough to farm the following \nyear.'' That, he said, was like ``burning dreams.''\n  He is raising cattle, crops, hogs. He writes, ``As of this fall we \ndecided that we would have to reduce the number of acres we farm. I am \nwatching my hopes and dreams fade away as I reduce these acres. Yet, I \nwork 16 plus hours a day to try to keep the farm going again for \nanother year.''\n\n[[Page S11114]]\n\n  He adds, ``My wife works about 55 hours a week just to try to pay \nhousehold bills. She works off the farm and then comes home and does \nthe farm work as well. At one time I had hopes of being able to pass \nthis farm down to the next generation. Now the only hope I have is that \nwe can just continue.''\n  This is a letter I received the other day from Barbara. Barbara says, \n``I have been married for 19 years. I have two sons. It was our dream, \nmy dream and my husband's that one day this farm of ours would belong \nto our boys.''\n  Then she describes the way they have tried to make ends meet and \ncan't. ``My husband not only farms, he works out in the winter and \nfinds as many part-time jobs in the summer as he can to help supplement \nour income. We raise hogs to help supplement the farming also. I work \nin the county school system during the school year. I am a cook in the \nelementary school. I also drive a bus some evenings after working in \nthe cafeteria. I also work as part-time help in our local hospital and \ndental office. I'm an emergency medical technician and, my husband is a \nfirefighter with the local fire district.''\n  She writes, ``Our oldest son is 17 and works part-time during the \nschool year and this past summer went on part of a run with a custom \nharvesting crew to make some money. Our youngest son has a job mowing \ncemeteries for our local church and helps on the farm. He is 15.''\n  ``As you can see we have full schedules which don't allow us much in \nthe form of extra cash or time for vacation or leisure. The part I \ncan't understand,'' Barbara writes, ``is why after working 17 or 18 \nhours a day we can't make enough to live on. My husband went to the \nelevator yesterday to haul in some wheat to pay our expenses for the \ncoming month. He was told he would get $1.82 a bushel for the wheat.''\n  By the way, she doesn't write this, but USDA says it costs them at \nleast $4.75 a bushel to raise that. Her husband goes to the elevator \nand is told that he will be paid $1.82 a bushel. ``You tell me,'' she \nwrites, ``how we are supposed to pay our bills with these prices?\n  She said, ``A couple of weeks ago, our youngest son came to me and he \nasked if he could talk to me. I said yes. And he asked if we would be \nmad at him if he chose not to farm after he finished school. He didn't \nwant his dad or grandfather to be upset with him. He has seen how much \nwork it is and how little the family is getting out of it, but still \nfeels the love of the land and pride in continuing another generation \nof farmers.''\n  This young boy asks if they would be angry if he doesn't try it. She \nsays, ``I have come to fear that my generation is the last, if we \nsurvive. It's hard to tell your children that you really wish they \nwould not come back to farming because there's no future there for \nthem.''\n  Mr. President, these are two letters from Eric and Barbara, a farmer \nand farm wife, both struggling out there, trying to make a living with \ncollapsed prices and crop disease and a farm crisis that gives these \nfolks depression-era prices for their crops.\n  What makes me so angry about all this is in thinking about it in \ndriving home last night after the conference committee. What makes me \nso angry is there is this kind of blithe attitude about it here. It is \nan attitude that dismisses this crisis and says: Well, this is just \nanother day; this is just another problem; this is just another group \nof Americans who want something.\n  These people don't want anything special. But they don't want to be \nturned loose in a circumstance where they are told you compete in a \nfree market and the market isn't free. Everything that they do in this \neconomic system means that someone is preying upon them, and that \nsomeone is taking money out of their pockets unfairly. Then the \nCongress somehow says we don't have the time to help; we don't have the \nresources to help; you are too small to matter; all we care about are \nthose who are too big to fail.\n  And as I said when I started, I drove home last night thinking about \nthe story I read about a $100 billion liability outfit that gets in \ntrouble and the Federal Reserve Board apparently convenes a meeting of \nbankers. They get a bunch of aspirin together and fluff up the pillows \nand say, ``Gee, can't we make you comfortable. We sure wouldn't want \nyou to fail. You are too big to fail.'' They got 20-some banks in that \ncircumstance. I guess we got other hedge funds out there and a whole \nseries of speculators as well.\n  But what about these folks? What about the folks who Congress says \nare too small to matter. These are the folks who day after day are \nholding auction sales, standing around watching their farm implements \nand watching their personal possessions being auctioned off because \nthey can't make a living. It is not because they are not good at what \nthey do. They are the best in the world. There is nobody in the world \nwho measures up. Nobody. Not even close. Yet this economic system is \nstacked against them, stacked against them in a way that is almost \ncriminal.\n  You know what we ought to do?\n  These folks face a railroad that hauls their grain and charges them \ndouble the price they ought to be charged, and they market that grain \nup through a grain trade in which there are just a few companies. That \nis not free enterprise. And then they send their cattle up where you \nhave four companies controlling over 80 percent of the slaughter.\n  You know what we ought to do? We ought to put an independent counsel \non all those issues. How about an independent counsel investigating the \nmarketing of cattle, and looking into the four companies that control \nthe slaughter of over 80 percent of the cattle in this country.\n  How about an independent counsel tracking down railroad prices on \nbehalf of family farmers to see if they are fair? How about an \nindependent counsel looking at the grain trade to see whether this is \ntruly a fair market?\n  I could go on at great length about that. What about an investigation \non behalf of these folks that says to them we are intending that you \nhave a fair deal, and that you have a fair opportunity to make a \nliving. And, if you don't, we are going to help. That is part of what \nyesterday was about. It is part of what last night's conference \ncommittee was about when, unfortunately, on a party-line vote the folks \nin that committee said, no, we can't afford it; we don't have any \nmoney.\n  The President says, I need $8 billion in emergency aid to deal with \nthe farm crisis. The same people who said we have $80 billion to \nprovide a new tax cut said we don't have $8 billion above the current \nbudget level to meet the President's request to deal with the farm \ncrisis.\n  I am telling you, that is a misplaced sense of priorities. We have \nhad two votes in the Senate on this issue of providing a decent support \nprice. When I say ``decent,'' this is very modest. It is much more \nmodest than I think is necessary. But even at that, we lost each of \nthose votes by a handful.\n  I say to those who were in the conference committee last night, who \nvoted against standing up for family farmers, you are going to vote \nagain. One way or the other, you are going to vote again in the U.S. \nSenate, and the vote is going to be on this question: Are you willing \nto stand up and support family farming in times of crisis? When prices \ncollapse and you have this price valley, and those family farms simply \nfall through the cracks, are you willing to stand and say, ``Let us \nbuild a bridge across that valley,'' or do you say that family farmers \ndon't matter?\n  Are you willing to say that it doesn't matter that corporate \nagrifactories will farm America from California to Maine? Will big \ncorporate agrifactories get up in the morning, put on their Big Ben \ncoveralls and milk 3,500 cows at one lick, because that is corporate \nagrifactories? Or will they plow their tractors as far as they can go \non a tank of gas and then turn around and plow back? Do you think it \nwill benefit this country to turn out all the farm yard lights in the \ncountry and say to these families, ``You don't matter; we will replace \nyou with a big agrifactory''? This country will have lost something \nvery important and it will have done so because this Congress said that \nthey don't matter. If they do that, this Congress will have to answer \nto a lot of the American people about their sense of priorities.\n  This has become a legislative landfill in recent months. I can go \ndown on two hands the list of important things we should have done that \nhave been taken\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nout in the country and covered over with dirt, because we have too many \npeople in here saying, ``No, you can't do the important issues; we have \nto track around chasing the tail of unimportant issues.''\n  This is one issue that a number of us from farm country are not going \nto let be sent out to some legislative landfill and be covered up. One \nway or another, we are going to push and fight and scrap on behalf of \nthose families who still have their hopes and dreams to make a living \nas family farmers. We are going to push and fight to the end to get a \ndecent, kinder program out of this country that will say to family \nfarmers in this country, ``You matter; you matter to this country and \nits future.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Dorgan, for once again standing up and speaking \nout on behalf of the farm families of our State and farm families all \nacross the country, because these are desperate times.\n  In North Dakota, from 1996 to 1997, farm income declined 98 percent. \nThat is according to the Government's own figures. That is a disaster \nby any definition.\n  Last night, I was absolutely shocked to learn our Republican \ncolleagues killed each and every attempt to strengthen the financial \naid package for farmers. It makes me wonder what part of disaster they \ndon't understand.\n  We have the lowest prices for farm commodities in 50 years. That is \nright, the lowest prices in 50 years. Combined with that, we have a \nwhole series of natural disasters all across the country, including our \nState, where a terrible fungus called scab is loose in the fields that \ndramatically reduces production and that which is produced is \ndiscounted when the farmer takes it to the elevator to sell it. The \nresult is a tremendous cash flow crunch on our farmers, forcing \nthousands of them off the land. We have record farm auctions. I have \nbankers stopping me in every town I go to and saying, ``Senator, there \nis a disaster occurring. There is something radically wrong. What is \nbeing done?''\n  Last night, our Republican colleagues said, ``Well, what we propose \nto do is provide a dime and three pennies for every bushel of wheat and \nother grains.'' A dime and three pennies. Frankly, that is worse than a \nBand-Aid. A Band-Aid at least covers a wound. If that is going to be \nthe answer, then we might just as well say that the farm policy coming \nfrom our friends is a policy of liquidation; a policy that says to \nfamily farmers, ``You're done; you might as well sell out, because this \ncountry does not value what you do.''\n  Mr. President, this can't be the way it ends. We have a disastrous \nfarm policy. I have said our farmers are being hit by a triple whammy \nof bad prices, bad weather and bad policy. We can't control the \nweather, we can't control the prices, but we can do something about \nfarm policy, and we have an obligation to do so.\n  When our colleagues are saying we ought to cut taxes by $80 billion \nand then turn around and say, ``But we can't add $3 billion to this \npackage to provide financial support for family farmers,'' they have \ndescribed their priorities very clearly. Unfortunately, the conclusion \nis, family farmers are left out. They are being told, ``Forget it, you \ndon't matter.'' That is just unacceptable. There is going to be a \nfight. We are not going to go quietly in the night as thousands of farm \nfamilies are shoved off the land. That cannot be an acceptable \nconclusion to this year's legislative business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are some who don't want to take the time to deal \nwith important issues. This is, I think, one of the most important \nissues. We just dealt with the Vacancies Act on judicial nominations. \nHow does the Senator view the farm crisis versus the judicial Vacancies \nAct we spent some time debating?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think back to the Interior appropriations bill. I don't \nknow how many days that was on the floor here. It was day after day \nafter day. In fact, when I look back on the last several months, it is \nhard for me to recall our dealing with anything of great significance. \nIn fact, there have been long periods where nothing was dealt with on \nthe floor, and then we are told, ``Well, the future of family farmers \nthat hangs in the balance, there is just not enough time to deal with \nthat, not enough resources to deal with it.''\n  Interestingly enough, our competitors don't have that view. The \nEuropeans, who are our major competitors, are spending $50 billion a \nyear to support their producers. We spend $5 billion, and we wonder why \nwe are losing the fight. We would never do this in a military \nconfrontation, but in a trade confrontation we seem to think it is fine \nto say to our farmers, ``Well, you go out there and compete against the \nFrench farmer and the German farmer, and while your at it, go take on \nthe French Government and the German Government as well.'' That is not \na fair fight.\n  I say to my colleague, it seems to me as though we have the time to \nmake a difference in the lives of literally thousands of farm families \nall across America who are facing a financial disaster. This isn't some \nkind of downturn, this is a cliff, and thousands of farmers are being \npushed right off it.\n  The question is, What are we going to do? Are we going to do nothing \nor next to nothing, or are we going to fight back? Are we going to say \nto the Europeans, ``No, we're not going to accept a circumstance in \nwhich you simply buy these markets, you go out there and because you \nhave so many more resources,'' because somehow in Europe they have \ndecided they want people out across the land, that that is good social \npolicy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have been talking about financial modernization. It \nseems to me the farm crisis is more important than that. That is ahead \nof us. The Internet tax freedom bill, it seems to me the farm crisis is \nmore important than that. We apparently are going to take that up.\n  I mentioned when I began this discussion the juxtaposition of a hedge \nfund nearly going broke on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Board \ngetting so concerned that they convened the bankers and said, ``Gee, \ncan't we help those people; prop up their pillow, help them get back to \nbed, give them a nap and get them some strength again?''\n  And it is interesting to me that, in fact, the Fed even signaled when \nthat was going on, they were going to reduce interest rates. So today, \nlo and behold, they lowered interest rates. It is the ``too big to \nfail'' thing.\n  It reminded me of what Will Rogers once said. He said, ``You know, if \none day all the lawyers on Wall Street failed to show up for work, \nwouldn't anybody miss lunch. But if all the cows in America failed to \nshow up to the barn to get milked, then we would have a problem.'' What \nWill Rogers was trying to say in a humorous way is ``What really \nmatters in this country is what we produce.'' And there is no more all-\nstar producer in America than the family farmer.\n  Yet this country has an economic system that says to them, ``There's \nno connection between effort and reward. You make the effort. You go \nbroke.'' And that is what is wrong with this system. This farm bill of \nours does not work. Everybody ought to now be willing to confess that \nand decide that this farm bill does not work and we want to save family \nfarmers. Let us join together in a bipartisan way to make something \nhappen that really will work to save family farmers.\n  Mr. CONRAD. My colleague is precisely right. It will be a tragedy for \nthis country if we let this circumstance unfold. The hard reality is if \nwe fail to act and act decisively, literally thousands of family \nfarmers are going to be pushed out of business. And they are not coming \nback.\n  I just went to a meeting in my State--one of the major farm \norganizations--and I stood at the back of the room. It was so striking \nbecause so many of the heads sitting in the chairs in front of me were \nwhite haired. The farmers of this country are aging and aging \ndramatically. There were hardly any young people in the room.\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\n  It is easy to understand why, because, as Senator Dorgan read from \nthe letters of young people, they were saying to their parents, ``Gee, \nwill you hold it against me if I don't go into farming?'' Well, it is \npretty hard to justify going into farming. It is pretty hard to justify \nstaying on the family farm because we, as a country, have said, as a \nmatter of policy, ``We're not going to be there for you.'' Our \ncompetitors are going to spend $50 billion a year supporting their \nproducers, and we are going to spend one-tenth as much. So we say, \n``You go into the fight, but you go unarmed.''\n  Mr. President, we can do better than that. America is better than \nthat. And the loss to this country will be incalculable if we push an \nentire generation of farmers off the land. I know that at some point we \nwill wake up and we will say, ``Gee, we have a program to get people \nback out there.'' And what will it cost us then, as we realize it makes \nno sense to push everybody into the cities of America, that instead we \nought to have people spread out across the land?\n  But right now we are headed on a collision course with economic \nreality. And that reality is: Our farmers are at such a disadvantage \nthat they cannot survive. So that is the question that is before the \nbody tonight. And that is the question that is going to be before the \nbody tomorrow. Are we going to do something to help these family \nfarmers through this valley of extraordinarily low prices and natural \ndisasters or are we just going to let them go? I pray that we respond \nand help family farm agriculture survive in this country. It is right \nat the heart of what makes this country strong.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

The Senator from New Mexico and Senator Reid \ncontrol 10 minutes jointly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to stay within 5 minutes. I \nthank the Senate which will be adopting the conference report. It is a \ngood report.\n  We will put a statement in that identifies some of the very new \napproaches to better governance. We do not have that completely in the \nDepartment yet, but we have some new ideas that we are imposing on the \nDepartment that will permit it to be run a little better than in the \npast.\n  I want to change to another subject, and that is the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and the $75 million that was, this year, put in the \nPresident's budget for the nonpower aspects of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority.\n  Mr. President, I hope that nobody is trying to make political hay out \nof the fact that the U.S. House of Representatives would not fund the \n$75 million for the TVA in this year's appropriations bill, and as a \nconsequence we did not fund it. Let me tell you why the House would not \nfund it, and make sure that the Record is replete with the background \ninformation that the U.S. House had last year and this year regarding \nthe $75 million.\n  First of all, there is a gentleman, who I do not know, named Craven \nCrowell--Chairman Craven Crowell. I think he was appointed to the board \nby the Clinton-Gore administration in 1993.\n  In 1997, meeting with Members of Congress and the administration, the \nChairman argued that TVA's so-called ``nonpower programs,'' which \ninclude flood control and navigation on the Tennessee River, as well as \nmanagement of some unique resources on the Land Between the Lakes \nNational Recreation Area, indicated that these nonpower programs should \nbe transferred to other Federal agencies, leaving the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority to focus solely on the production of electrical power.\n  Less than 1 month later, this very proposal to no longer fund that \nkind of activity because it should be transferred to other Federal \nagencies found its way into the 1998 budget request. The TVA Chairman \nhad made an interesting proposal just a couple of weeks prior, and \nalready it had been incorporated into the administration's budget. \nThere is no way that that would have happened if people in the \nadministration had not been aware of what Chairman Crowell was planning \nto propose, and if they had not given him the green light to do that.\n  I would like to incorporate in the Record a news release dated \nFebruary 6, 1997, ``President's Budget Supports Ending TVA \nAppropriations.'' I ask unanimous consent that the news release be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         President's Budget Supports Ending TVA Appropriations\n\n       TVA's request for $106 million in federal funding for 1998 \n     and its proposal to eliminate all taxpayer funding of TVA's \n     appropriated programs by Fiscal Year 1999 received support \n     from the Clinton Administration today in the President's \n     budget submitted to Congress.\n       ``We very much appreciate the administration's support of \n     this funding level for 1998 and the proposal to phase out all \n     federal funding of appropriated programs by Fiscal Year \n     1999,'' TVA Chairman Craven Crowell said at a news conference \n     in Knoxville.\n       The President's budget also directs TVA and the Army Corps \n     of Engineers to complete a joint study by September 1, 1997, \n     on the integration of TVA and Corps activities to improve the \n     operation of the Tennessee and Cumberland river systems.\n       ``Future cooperation between TVA and the Corps could be the \n     linchpin that makes it possible to end all federal funding \n     for TVA's appropriated programs,'' Crowell said. ``We believe \n     more cooperation between TVA and the Corps would be a win-win \n     situation for both of us and would greatly reduce \n     expenditures of tax dollars.''\n       As noted in the President's budget, TVA will work with \n     Congress, state and local governments and other interested \n     parties in a major effort to find alternate ways to fund, \n     organize and manage the taxpayer-funded programs.\n       Crowel also said that a 17-member task force has been \n     formed to work out the details of the proposal. Kate Jackson, \n     executive vice president of the Resource Group, will chair \n     the task force, which includes representatives from all parts \n     of TVA.\n       In his 1998 budget, the President recommends the same level \n     of funding TVA received in 1997. The budget recommendation \n     includes $81.5 million for water and land stewardship; $7.9 \n     million for Land Between The Lakes, an increase of nearly $2 \n     million over this year's funding; $6.6 million for a \n     feasibility study on a proposed new navigation lock at \n     Chickamauga Dam; $6 million for the TVA Environmental \n     Research Center in Muscle Shoals; and $4 million for economic \n     development.\n       Funding requests for the Environmental Research Center and \n     economic development are down $9 million and $11 million, \n     respectively, reflecting TVA's previously announced plan to \n     phase out appropriated funds for those activities.\n       TVA uses federal funds to manage the Tennessee River \n     system, maintain 11,000 miles of shoreline and 420,000 acres \n     of public land, conduct environmental research and promote \n     economic development.\n       The federally appropriated funds are separate from TVA's \n     power budget which is financed from power sales. Revenues \n     from power sales totaled almost $5.7 billion in 1996. TVA \n     provides power to 160 distributors who serve nearly 8 million \n     customers in seven southeastern state.\n       The 1998 fiscal year begins Oct. 1, 1997, and ends Sept. \n     30, 1998.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is a TVA release that suggests that Chairman \nCrowell and others have decided that they do not need the $75 million \nand that other Federal agencies are going to take over. And the U.S. \nHouse had this release, had the proposal to eliminate Federal funding \nof TVA's appropriated programs in January of 1997.\n\n[[Page S11117]]\n\n  Mr. President, what has happened is that after doing this, and \nleaving the distinct impression with the U.S. House Subcommittee on \nAppropriations that they were not going to need the money anymore, and \nsurely were not going to need it for the 1999 appropriations bill, they \nhave changed their mind. That is, both the Chairman down there in the \nTennessee Valley Authority area and the White House. They now want the \nmoney, after going through all of this that I have just discussed with \nthe Senate.\n  Let me tell you, what they did by proposing this was to get all of \nthose in the surrounding areas who do not necessarily agree with the \nTVA to join in saying they do not need the money. And there are private \npower companies who clearly do not think TVA needs this nonpower money. \nBut both the administration and the Chairman, Chairman Crowell, had \nindicated they do not need the money.\n  Mr. President, in spite of that, because the administration changed \nits mind, and the Senators from Tennessee and from Kentucky and others \ncame to me and said, ``Well, we know we said we don't need the funding \nanymore, but will you fund it another time for us?'' I did. The Senate \napproved.\n  Mr. President, what has happened is the U.S. House said no, and, \nfrankly, there is no way to change their mind because what they throw \nback at us is, we were just told in 1997 that that was the last year we \nneeded that subsidy, that $75 million.\n\n  Frankly, if there is any blame to go around, it does not lie with the \nSenators, who did everything humanly possible. They got the Senate to \nfund it, they encouraged me to hold it, they even met with Members of \nthe House to tell them to put it back in, but what they got was what we \nmight have expected.\n  You just told us last year you don't need it anymore. The chairman \ndown there issued this plan saying we don't need it. The President's \nbudget said we don't need it.\n  Now, if there is any reason that we didn't get it, it is because of \nthat, not because of partisan politics. There are no Democrats on the \ncommittee who went to conference with me who are in favor of that. No \none in the House is in favor of it, because you tell the House, and \napparently this is how it works over there; it is not too bad. It \nsounds like the way you would behave. Tell the House this is the last \nyear we are funding TVA $75 million, and they aren't too sure you want \nto fund it anyway. You do it and then you come around and change your \nmind after you have had this exhaustive plan and this commission \nappointed so that you won't have to have this money. You come along and \nsay, as I said, we need it in another year, and they are saying the \nHouse will not vote for it another year, we can stay here until Hades \ngets a little cool, but we will not approve it because you told us you \ndon't need it, and now we have too much support against it and it will \nnot be funded.\n  I am very hopeful for those who wanted to point fingers either at \nthis Senator because he is Republican or some of the other Senators \nfrom the Tennessee Valley area. It is not their fault. Frankly, I don't \nthink it is the committee's fault. It is just one of those things \nwhere, the way the House argued the case, you can't make them change \ntheir mind. And what they said was pretty logical. They had some good \npoints. I know the occupant of the Chair served in the House. When you \ntell the House committee you are not going to fund it one single year \nbeyond this one and come back and say, after all those plans and us \ngetting money out of you, we need another year, it is not easy.\n  Nonetheless, I want to say I am trying, because the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority has some very expensive interests on some outstanding long-\nterm obligations, bonds and indebtedness, that they know they have to \nrefinance, and in the process of refinancing, there would be a change \nin the interest rates. Obviously, it would be better and they would \nsave money. We are trying to put together an amendment that would be \ntaken care of as part of overall appropriations which would give them \nsome interest rebate. So to the extent that this would help offset what \nthey now think will be a big void because of the $75 million, we will \ntry that.\n  It actually has strong support from a number of Senators, including \nthe Tennessee Senators, that we try to do this. I say to the people \nthere, I am going to try to do this with their help and with the help \nof Chairman Stevens and others here in the U.S. Senate who I think will \nunderstand this issue and have understood it and will try to help us.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this last week the Conference on the Energy \nand Water Development Appropriations concluded and has provided \n$21,332,135 for the programs, projects and activities of the Department \nof Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and other \nindependent agencies. I would like to say that I generally support the \nConference Report which Chairman Domenici recommend to the Senate \ntoday.\n  Just as a balanced bill cannot accommodate all the priorities and \nprojects of Members of Congress, neither could this conference report. \nNevertheless, it is because of the scope of this bill, providing vital \nservices of the Department of Energy and the many water projects around \nthe nation that the Senate needs to support the Conference Report.\n  For instance, the Department of Energy's breadth of responsibilities \nrange from activities in nonproliferation to fissile materials \ndisposition and from the projects in solar and renewable resources to \nthe clean up of defense facilities such as Savannah River, Oak Ridge \nand Hanford.\n  Specifically, in the Defense part of the bill, we were told that the \nStockpile Stewardship Management, the program that provides safety and \nreliability of the nuclear stockpile, needed $4.5 billion, yet even as \nwe are providing it $4.4 billion we are increasing our oversight of \nconstruction projects to prevent waste and mismanagement. Without the \nStockpile Stewardship program we would not have the ability to be able \nto verify to the President that the nuclear stockpile is safe and \nreliable and we would be living under continued testing of nuclear \nweapons.\n  In the Nondefense work at the Department of Energy, the Office of \nScience (formerly known as Energy Research) has facilitated many \nprojects in science that will have practical impacts on the future of \nour society including the treatment of cancer, the isolation of \ndiseased genes, and the tracing of contaminants in soils. I would note \nthe vast research effort being made in the Fusion Energy Sciences. The \nDepartment has tried to cover its bases by funding different types of \nfusion energy research, but it eventually will have to make choices to \nfocus on the most feasible technologies and the Conferees have provided \nthis research almost $230 million.\n  We, as a subcommittee and Conference, were placed in an impossible \ndilemma regarding the funding of water projects and, in particular, the \nconstruction projects of the Corps of Engineers. The Conferees \nrecognize the value of the civil works program in protecting lives and \nproperty throughout the United States and in preserving commercial \ntrade in our ports and harbors; but we simply were not given the funds \nto reflect the importance of the Corps projects. Consequently, while \nthe Conferees provided $1.429 billion in Corps Construction, there were \nmany construction projects that could not receive the funding that they \nneeded. This is unfortunate since the Corps has many projects around \nthe United States that will now be hindered by uncertain schedules and \nplanning that may become useless. On the other hand, projects such as \nthe Chicago Shoreline, the Kill Van Kull Channel in New York and New \nJersey, Charleston Harbor and Virginia Beach, among many others, were \nable to receive enough to address their emergency circumstances. The \ndredging of the ports and harbors along both the Atlantic and Pacific \ncoastlines as well as the harbors in the Gulf of Mexico is no small \ntask and responsibility for the Corps. On an annual basis, the U.S. \nports and harbors handle an estimated $600 billion in international \ncargo generating over $150 billion in tax revenue. There are small \nnavigation projects totaling $6 million; but there are larger projects \nthat require an even greater commitment. It is unfortunate that, \nbecause of the funding dilemmas that we faced, water projects that are \nvital to communities and industries around the nation will now be \nstalled and mired in uncertainty. The administration should take note \nof the many\n\n[[Page S11118]]\n\ncriticisms of the budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers and \nrecognize the essential role it has throughout the nation.\n  Another major agency under the jurisdiction of this appropriation is \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, whose historical responsibility to manage \nthe precious waters in the West extends back to the Newland Project in \nNevada. I will not subscribe to any notion that the Bureau is obsolete \nor unneeded and will oppose any effort to minimize the Bureau's role in \nwater preservation. It's responsibility of reclaiming water and reusing \nit in communities is as needed now as ever. In the first half of the \ncentury, dams were built in managing the water systems, now we must be \nfocusing on other reuse methods like desalination systems.\n  Throughout the arid West the Bureau has assisted in the use and \nmanagement of water and has even facilitated the cooperation of \ncommunity interests such as the CALFED Bay Delta Project in California \nwhich received $75 million to continue its management of the Delta \nsystem which means that agriculture, environmental, and industry are \ncooperating in unprecedented ways. There are reclamation and water \nsupply projects from Arizona to Idaho and from Washington to New \nMexico. The communities benefit from new sources of water such as the \ncommunity in Montana that will no longer have to haul their water for \nmiles in pickup trucks so that their homes can have water. This was the \ngoal of the Bureau of Reclamation when it was founded: to provide the \nhomes and communities throughout the West with water and it remains the \ngoal today.\n  Mr. President, this conference report does not satisfy everybody, nor \ndoes it do justice to the many water projects that need our support, \nbut it is the best the conference could arrive at with the funding \nallocations that we were given. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to \nsupport this Conference Report. And I thank the staff of the Energy and \nWater Subcommittee for their hard work and diligence throughout the \nprocess: Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Gregory Daines, Lashwanda \nLeftwich, Elizabeth Blevins and Bob Perret on my personal staff.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, H.R. 5060, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act, 1999, complies with the Budget Act's \nsection 302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays.\n  The conference report provides $20.9 billion in budget authority and \n$13.0 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent \nagencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When \noutlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken \ninto account, this bill provides a total of $20.7 billion in outlays.\n  For defense discretionary programs, the conference report is below \nits allocation by $11 million in budget authority and $1 million in \noutlays. The conference report also is below its nondefense \ndiscretionary allocation by $20 million in budget authority and $46 \nmillion in outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this conference report be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            H.R. 4060, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 1999, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   (Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Defense   Nondefense  Crime  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget authority........................................     12,019       8,889  .....  .........     20,908\n    Outlays.................................................     11,819       8,853  .....  .........     20,672\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority........................................     12,030       8,909  .....  .........     20,939\n    Outlays.................................................     11,820       8,899  .....  .........     20,719\n1998 level:\n    Budget authority........................................     11,680       8,999  .....  .........     20,679\n    Outlays.................................................     11,675       9,008  .....  .........     20,683\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority........................................     12,298       9,003  .....  .........     21,301\n    Outlays.................................................     11,875       9,150  .....  .........     21,025\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority........................................     11,934       8,719  .....  .........     20,653\n    Outlays.................................................     11,171       8,742  .....  .........     20,513\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority........................................     12,030       8,912  .....  .........     20,942\n    Outlays.................................................     11,818       8,896  .....  .........     20,714\nConference Report Compared To:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority....................................        -11         -20  .....  .........        -31\n        Outlays.............................................         -1         -46  .....  .........        -47\n    1998 level:\n        Budget authority....................................        339        -110  .....  .........        229\n        Outlays.............................................        144        -155  .....  .........        -11\n    President's request\n        Budget authority....................................       -279        -114  .....  .........       -393\n        Outlays.............................................        -56        -297  .....  .........       -353\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority....................................         85         170  .....  .........        255\n        Outlays.............................................         48         111  .....  .........        159\n    Senate-passed bill:\n        Budget authority....................................        -11         -23  .....  .........        -34\n        Outlays.............................................          1         -43  .....  .........       -42\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

I rise today with my \ncolleague, Senator Mack, to discuss the status of the Kissimmee River \nRestoration project in the state of Florida. This project is a land \nacquisition and canal backfilling project. it was authorized by \nCongress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992. The state of \nFlorida has spent approximately $95 million in land acquisition and \nrestoration evaluation. The state of Florida has met all of the \nnecessary schedule requirements defined in the Project Cooperation \nAgreement with the Corps to keep this project on schedule.\n  To date, the state's expenditures far exceed the federal \ncontribution--a situation that occurred by design. The state of Florida \nhas front-loaded the land acquisition costs and the federal government \nis supposed to back-load construction costs.\n  Mr. MACK. The first backfilling contract is scheduled to be awarded \non March 30, 1999. For this contract to be awarded, the Corps has \nindicated that between $22 and $23 million must be appropriated for \nthis project. Today we are reviewing an Energy and Water appropriations \nbill that includes only $8 million for the Kissimmee River project.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have been involved in the Kissimmee River project since \nmy days as Governor of the state of Florida. This project is the first \nstep in a long series of individual projects that seek to restore the \nFlorida Everglades to a state as close to their natural state as \npossible. The results of this backfill contract will be visible to the \nnaked eye. This first contract would backfill 9 miles of the Kissimmee \nCanal; restoring approximately 16 square miles of restored river/\nfloodplain ecosystem and 17 miles of river channel. Not only will this \nhave important ecological benefits, but it will also make an important \ncontribution to increasing water storage capacity and improving water \nquality north of Lake Okechobee.\n  Mr. MACK. The Kissimmee River restoration project is at a critical \nphase. With the current funding levels in the 1999 Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, this project will not move forward. We both \nunderstand the difficult nature of funding decisions in these times of \ntight budgets, but we also recognize the responsibility of the federal \ngovernment to meet its costshare requirements with the state of Florida \nand fund the construction phase of this project.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Today, I ask the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Committee, Senators Domenici and Reid, \nof your intentions for the future of the Kissimmee project.\n  Senator Mack and I remain committed to forward progress on the \nKissimmee River restoration. We would like to work with the committee \nto identify potential reprogramming opportunities within the Army Corps \nbudget that might allow forward progress on this project which is so \ncritical to Everglades restoration.\n  We would also like to work with the committee during the fiscal year \n2000 appropriations process to ensure that the Kissimmee River \nrestoration is funded at appropriate levels.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I recognize the importance of this project to the state \nof Florida, and I look forward to working with the Senators from \nFlorida to identify any potential funding alternatives or reprogramming \noptions for the Kissimmee River project. We will work together in the \nnext year to include appropriate funding levels for the Kissimmee River \nrestoration project in the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to echo the comments of Senator Domenici by \nstating my support for the Kissimmee River restoration project. I, too, \nlook\n\n[[Page S11119]]\n\nforward to working with both Senators Graham and Mack in the next week \nto identify any funding or reprogramming opportunities for the \nKissimmee River project.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nSubcommittee, Senator Domenici, in a brief colloquy. It has come to my \nattention that, due to some confusion regarding the funding of an on-\ngoing Section 1135 ecosystem restoration project of a similar name, the \nconference report to accompany the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill eliminated funding for the Duwamish and Green River \nBasin study. Would the chairman agree that neither the Committee nor \nthe conferees are opposed to the ongoing Duwamish and Green River Basin \nstudy?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington is correct. \nThere has been some confusion regarding this study and the funding for \nthe Green-Duwamish ecosystem restoration project under the Section 1135 \nprogram.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Chairman also agree that the Corps of Engineers \nshould seek a reprogramming of funds to keep this important project on \nschedule and, if sought, would the chairman be inclined to approve such \na request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I agree that, if appropriate, the Corps \nof Engineers should seek to reprogram funds to keep this study moving \nforward. I am not aware of any opposition to the project and do not \nanticipate a problem with a reprogramming request.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the Chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, for the outstanding work he has done on this bill. This \nis an extremely tough bill covering a diverse range of issues from our \nnation's nuclear defenses, to scientific research to water projects \nimpacting each and every state. He has done a superb job in balancing \nthese needs. I wish to especially thank him for recognizing the special \nneeds for Positron Emission Tomography work at the Medical University \nof South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I appreciate \nhis interest in this bill and in medical research. The Subcommittee \nappreciated the Senator bringing the Medical University of South \nCarolina's needs to the Committee's attention last year and he has \nagain made a convincing case for them this year.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Cancer rates in South Carolina are some of the highest \nin the nation, with more than 17,000 new cases diagnosed and more than \n8,100 deaths each year. The funding in this bill is critical to our \nefforts to combat cancer in South Carolina as well as the nation and I \nthank the Senator.\n  In closing, there may be some slight confusion regarding the funds \nfor the Medical University of South Carolina. I want to make sure \neveryone understands these funds are to build upon last year's efforts \nand are to be used to design and construct an expansion of the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina's cancer research center to provide space \nfor Positron Emission Tomography treatment. Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from South Carolina is correct. I thank him \nfor clarifying this matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have read and agree with the \nsubcommittee's views on improving the efficiency of Nuclear Regulation \nCommission regulation. There is significant evidence that different, \nbut equally protective, approaches to regulation could result in more \nefficient regulatory practices.\n  As I am sure the Senator from New Mexico is aware, there are some \nareas within the Commission's purview that will be challenged to keep \nup with the growing workload even in the face of significant \nimprovements in efficiency. An example is the Spent Fuel Project Office \n(SFPO) which is responsible for approving domestic use new dual purpose \ncanister systems for the safe storage and transportation of spent \nnuclear fuel; ensuring the safety of existing technologies that have \nbeen deployed throughout the nuclear energy industry as needs for out-\nof-pool storage have emerged; reviewing and approving cask technologies \nnecessary to support high priority non-proliferation activities of the \nUnited States, including the DOE Foreign Research Reactor Spent Fuel \nReceipt Program; reviewing and approving the transportation \ntechnologies for nuclear materials other than spent fuel; and reviewing \nand approving or providing support to a host of other spent fuel \nstorage and transportation initiatives sponsored by either the federal \ngovernment or private interests.\n  Does the Chairman agree with me that this plays an important role and \ndoes he believe that the agency recognizes the importance of the \noffice's work?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator's observations. The licensing \nof technologies to handle the storage and transportation of various \ntypes of spent fuel is one of the few areas within the Commission's \nbudget in which the demand for regulatory activity is clearly \nincreasing.\n  In addition, I hope the agency will examine further management \ninitiatives, such as those currently under review, that might be \nnecessary in the short term to address existing budget constraints and \nto ensure that the resources that are available are being utilized to \nmaximize the likelihood of succession review of application for new \ntechnologies.\n  I agree with the Senator from Georgia that the Commission should \ncontinue to monitor the workload of the SFPO to ensure that adequate \nresources are available to meet demand for application reviews.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, all time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the conference report.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11116-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11119-S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE TASK FORCE ON PLUTONIUM DISPOSITION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the end of the Cold War served to greatly \nreduce the threat of global instability, but the world is far from \nbeing a safe place today. Challenges to continued world peace--from \nincreased terrorist activities to display of nuclear weapon \ncapabilities by new countries--seem to occur weekly. To date, we have \nnot had to face the dreaded combination of terrorists with nuclear \narms, but that possibility must be considered as we evaluate new \nterrorist threats.\n  Designs for crude nuclear weapons, potentially more powerful than the \nHiroshima bomb, are readily available today. The only hurdle for \nterrorists to overcome is acquisition of the plutonium or highly \nenriched uranium needed to build the weapon.\n  Senator Pete Domenici, my colleague from New Mexico, has grappled \nwith these issues for many years. He led the Senate's efforts through \nthe U.S./Russian Agreement on Highly Enriched Uranium to secure 500 \ntons of this material from Russia, enough for perhaps 20,000 bombs.\n  More recently, Senator Domenici has focused his attention on 50 tons \nof weapons-grade plutonium that Russia has declared to be surplus; \nthat's enough material for almost 10,000 nuclear weapons. He has led \nefforts to ensure that this surplus plutonium won't present us with a \nfuture threat.\n  His trips to Russia, first last July with Senator Thompson and \nSenator Grams, and then more recently to the Moscow Summit, focus on \nthis issue. Through those trips, Senator Domenici is well known to the \nleadership of the Russian weapon programs. His proposals for rapid \nprogress on this surplus plutonium have been thoroughly studied \nthroughout the world, from Japan to France.\n  Senator Domenici discussed his proposals with President Clinton in \nlate July and encouraged that plutonium disposition be a focus of this \npast Summit. The protocol on plutonium disposition at the Moscow Summit \nis an\n\n[[Page S11120]]\n\nimportant first step, but it is only the first step.\n  We have to go far beyond just signing the protocol to secure the \nbenefits that it can provide--to ensure that the material is never \nrebuilt into weapons or found in the hands of terrorists or rogue \nstates. Furthermore, the Senate needs to advise the Administration on \nthe detailed agreements that will enable real progress.\n  Today, I'm appointing a Senate Task Force on Plutonium Disposition to \nprovide this input from the Senate to the Administration. I'm pleased \nthat Senator Domenici has agreed to chair this task force, to continue \nhis leadership on this vital topic.\n  Also serving on the task force will be Senator Richard Lugar of \nIndiana, Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, \nSenator Carl Levin of Michigan, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and \nSenator Patty Murray of Washington. Each of these Members brings \nknowledge and concern that will be valuable in guiding the Senate on \nthis issue.\n  As agreements are finalized, the Senate may be called upon to approve \nprograms or provide resources; we will depend on this task force to \nprovide information for informed debates on these subjects.\n  Disposition of the current 50 tons of Russian excess weapons-grade \nplutonium is an important national goal. We have a golden window of \nopportunity to rid the world of materials for thousands of nuclear \nweapons. We must seize this moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11119-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I supported Senator Wellstone's amendment \nto the Higher Education Act and I regret that it was not included in \nthe conference report. The amendment would have increased educational \nopportunities for people on welfare. It passed the Senate with a \nbipartisan majority, but was rejected by House Republicans, even though \nit was also supported by the White House, and by more than 150 social \nwelfare groups.\n  The goal of this amendment is to correct a serious deficiency in the \nharsh welfare reform law enacted two years ago. Too often, welfare \nreform around the country has focused on immediate work experience as a \nmeans to achieve financial independence, but the focus is excessive, \nbecause it reduced options for welfare recipients who wish to complete \nto two- or four-year college degrees.\n  Welfare reform around the country has tended to focus on immediate \nwork experience as a means to achieve financial independence. The new \ndirection of welfare reform at both state and federal levels has \ngenerally reduced the options available for welfare recipients who wish \nto complete a two- or four-year college degree. It is extremely \ndifficult for single parents to be full-time students and work part-\ntime and still give adequate time to their families.\n  The welfare reform program called Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies, is based on the idea that work is the best way to achieve \nindependence, especially if the work comes with job security and fair \nwages. For many people, education is the best road to jobs that achieve \nthese goals. Higher education is often the best way to earn higher \nwages, achieve independence from welfare, and provide protection from \nfuture poverty and unemployment.\n  Recent studies have found that the average wage for a person who was \npreviously on welfare and then earned a degree is $11.00 an hour, and \nthat each year of education completed by welfare recipients increases \nwages by as much as $1.14 per hour. A study of 4,500 working mothers in \nthe Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation found \nthat a college degree is worth an additional $2.58 per hour for working \nmothers, compared to the wages of high school graduates. The special \nimportance of higher education for women is emphasized by other data \nshowing that women need a college degree to make the same amount of \nmoney that men earn with only a high school education.\n  The results of these studies are hardly surprising. We know the \nimportance of higher education and the advantages it opens up. The \nBureau of Labor Statistics reported in March 1995 that adult workers \nwith less than a high school diploma earned an annual average of only \n$13,697. Adult workers with a high school degree earned $20,248. With \nan associates degree, they earned $26,363, and with a bachelor's degree \nthey earned $37,224.\n  The job and career benefits of higher education are also demonstrated \nby the poverty statistics of the Department of Labor. In 1995 only 1.5 \npercent of those with a four-year college degree were living in poverty \ncompared to 3.3 percent of those with an associates degree, 6.1 percent \nof those with a high school diploma, and 17.2 percent of those without \na high school diploma.\n  The evidence for the Wellstone amendment is overwhelming, and a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate was right to pass it. Under its \nprovisions, 24 months of post-secondary education or vocational \neducational training would be permissible work activities under welfare \nreform.\n  I commend Senator Wellstone's leadership on this important issue. \nStates should have the flexibility to create responsible ways to move \npeople from welfare to work, by allowing welfare recipients to include \nhigher education as a part of their effort to achieve financial \nindependence and provide effectively for their families. The House \nconferees were wrong to reject this positive reform, and we should do \nall we can to enact it as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11120-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11120-S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT ON HEALTH INSURANCE FOR WORKING FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this weekend, the New York Times reported \non the latest data on Americans without health insurance. According to \nthe Census Bureau, the number of uninsured has now reached 43.4 million \nof our fellow citizens--an increase of 1.7 million since last year. \nThis increase is on top of the growth in the uninsured of one million \nlast year. The proportion of Americans without health insurance is now \nhigher than it has been for more than a decade. It is especially \nominous that this increase in the number of uninsured has occurred at a \ntime when the economy is strong and joblessness is low.\n  Congress should be addressing this issue, but the Republican \nleadership is just not interested. What is important to average \nfamilies is not important to them. Whether the issue is protecting \npatients against the abuses of managed care, or protecting the public \nagainst the tobacco industry, or saving social security, or raising the \nminimum wage, or improving education, or closing the loopholes in the \ncampaign financing laws, the Republican leadership just doesn't think \nit is a priority. Their primary goal is to protect the special \ninterests--not to protect American families.\n  The plight of workers without health insurance--and of families that \nmay be protected today but could lose their insurance tomorrow--is a \nparticularly compelling example of the need for action. Under President \nClinton's leadership, Democrats in Congress have repeatedly tried to \naddress this problem four years ago--Republicans always say, ``no.'' \nMillions of Americans have suffered because we failed to act. \nAddressing this crisis is clearly a priority\n\n[[Page S11121]]\n\nfor Democrats and the nation, and it ought to be a priority for \nRepublicans too.\n  We have taken incremental steps in recent years. We have made it \neasier for workers who change jobs to keep their health insurance, and \nwe have expanded coverage for children. These efforts were resisted \nevery step of the way by the Republican leadership in Congress. The new \nCensus Bureau report confirms what everyone who deals with this problem \nalready knows--these limited steps, as important as they are, are not \nnearly enough.\n  It should be unacceptable that 43 million Americans have no health \ninsurance today. It should be intolerable that no American family can \nbe confident that the health insurance they have today will be there \nfor them tomorrow, if serious illness strikes. It is indefensible that \nthis Congress is doing nothing to keep this problem from getting worse \nevery year.\n  The vast majority--85%--of uninsured Americans are workers or members \nof their families. These citizens work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks \nof the year in most cases--but all their hard work cannot buy them the \nhealth insurance they need to protect their families, because they \ncan't afford it and their employers won't provide it.\n  Every uninsured American is an American tragedy waiting to happen. \nInfants lose their chance to grow up strong and healthy because they do \nnot get basic prenatal and post-natal care. A young family loses its \nlivelihood because a breadwinner cannot afford needed medical care. \nMiddle-aged parents see their savings swept away by a tidal wave of \nmedical debt.\n\n  Earlier this year, I proposed legislation that be an important step \ntoward the day when every job carries with it a guarantee of affordable \nhealth care, so that every family can be confident that the quality of \nits health will not be determined by the amount of its wealth.\n  Every business is expected to pay a minimum wage, and to obey the \nchild labor laws. Every business is expected to provide safe and \nhealthy working conditions, and to protect against injury on the job \nthrough worker's compensation. Every business is expected to contribute \nto retirement through Social Security, and to the health needs of the \nelderly through Medicare. It is long past time for businesses also to \ncontribute to the cost of basic health insurance coverage for their \nworkers.\n  Some small firms may have special problems that call for special \nsolutions. But there is no excuse for large firms to avoid their \nresponsibility to provide affordable health insurance for their \nworkers.\n  Under the bill I proposed, businesses with 50 or more workers will be \nrequired to provide health insurance coverage. Approximately half of \nall uninsured employees and their families--15 million people--will \ngain the coverage they need and deserve. This legislation is a giant \nstep toward the day when every American will be guaranteed the \nfundamental right to health care.\n  Many--even most--businesses already provide insurance. The vast \nmajority of large businesses fulfill this obligation. But too many \nothers do not. In more and more cases, unfair competition from firms \nthat refuse to provide insurance for their workers is compelling other \nfirms to reduce health benefits or drop coverage altogether.\n  Health insurance for working Americans does not have to mean complex \nregulations or excessive government intervention. The legislation I \nintroduced was simple--less than ten pages. it will not cost taxpayers \na dime. It includes no specific mandated benefits or burdensome red \ntape. it simply says that every business with 50 workers or more must \noffer its employees coverage equal in value to the Blue Cross/Blue \nShield Standard Option Plan that is available to every Senator and \nRepresentative, and must pay at least 72% of the cost--the same \nproportion that taxpayers contribute for every member of Congress.\n  The American people deserve health care for their families that is \nevery bit as good as the health care they provide to every member of \nCongress. Shame on the Congress for ignoring this need. Shame on the \nRepublican leadership for its misguided priorities.\n  When the people go to the polls in November, they deserve to know who \nstands with the special interests and who stands with families who need \naffordable health coverage.\n  When the new Congress returns next year, I will do everything I can \nto assure that health care for every American is as high on that \nCongress's priority list as it is on the priority list of American \nfamilies. It is time to end the suffering. It is time for Americans to \njoin every other country in the industrialized world and guarantee its \ncitizens the basic right to health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11120-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11121-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 29, 1998, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that House agrees to the report of the \ncommittee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on \nthe amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 6) to extend the \nauthorization of programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11121-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2071.

A bill to establish a program to support a transition to \ndemocracy in Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                      iraq liberation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation allowing the \nPresident to provide direct and overt military assistance to the Iraqi \nopposition. This is a bipartisan initiative. I am joined by Senator \nKerrey of Nebraska, Senator McCain of Arizona, Senator Lieberman of \nConnecticut, Senator Helms of North Carolina, Senator Shelby of \nAlabama, Senator Brownback of Kansas, and Senator Kyl of Arizona.\n  Today is the 55th day without weapons inspections in Iraq. For \nmonths, I have urged the Administration to fundamentally change its \npolicy on Iraq. Monitoring the concealment of weapons of mass \ndestruction is not enough. Our goal should be to remove the regime of \nSaddam Hussein from power.\n  We should have no illusions. This will not be easy and it will not \nhappen quickly. But it can happen. the U.S. has worked with Iraqi \nopponents of Saddam Hussein in the past. We can and should do so in the \nfuture.\n  I have been working with a bipartisan group of Senators throughout \nmuch of the year to support a change in U.S. policy toward Iraq. In \nState Department Authorization Conference Report, $38 million is \nauthorized for political and humanitarian support for the Iraqi \nopposition.\n  In P.L. 105-174, Congress appropriated $5 million to support the \npolitical opposition and $5 million to establish Radio Free Iraq.\n  In the Senate passed version of the Fiscal Year 1999 Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act, there is an additional $10 million for \npolitical support to the Iraq opposition.\n  These steps have been important. But they are not enough. It is time \nto move beyond political support to direct military assistance. It is \ntime to openly state our policy goal is the removal of Saddam Hussein's \nregime from power.\n  As long as Saddam Hussein remains in power, Iraq will pose a threat \nto stability in the Persian Gulf. As long as he remains in power, Iraq \nwill pursue weapons of mass destruction programs. His record speaks for \nitself.\n  The answer is not just ``containment'' or a US-led invasion. There \nare Iraqis willing to fight and die for the\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\nfreedom of their country. There are significant portions of Iraq today \nwhich are not under the control of Saddam Hussein.\n  Our goal should be to support Iraqi freedom fighters and expand the \narea under their control.\n  I have discussed this approach with senior Administration officials. \nI have consulted with distinguished outside experts. I have raised this \napproach with heads of states and government officials from the region. \nI believe this approach can work.\n  S. 2525, the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, has four major components. \nFirst, it calls for a policy to seek the removal of the Saddam Hussein \nregime.\n  Second, it authorizes the President to provide $2 million for \nbroadcasting and $97 million in military aid to Iraqi opposition \nforces. The President is given the discretion to designate the \nrecipients of this assistance. The military aid authority is similar to \nthat used to support anti-narcotics operations in South America and to \ntrain and equip the Bosnian army.\n  Third, it renews Congressional calls for an international tribunal to \ntry Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials for war crimes. This will \nbe a crucial step in delegitimizing his reign of terror.\n  Finally, the bill looks toward post-Saddam Iraq and calls for a \ncomprehensive response to the challenges of rebuilding the country \ndevastated by decades of Saddam Hussein' rule.\n  Similar legislation has already been introduced in the House. We will \nmake every effort to work with the Administration to see if we can \nenact this legislation before we leave.\n  We need bipartisanship now more than ever in foreign policy. This is \na bipartisan approach to U.S. policy toward Iraq. We are interested in \nlooking to the future. We are interested in protecting American \ninterests and ensuring that Saddam Hussein can never again threaten his \nneighbors with military force or weapons of mass destruction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2525\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq Liberation Act of \n     1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, starting an \n     eight year war in which Iraq employed chemical weapons \n     against Iranian troops and ballistic missiles against Iranian \n     cities.\n       (2) In February 1988, Iraq forcibly relocated Kurdish \n     civilians from their home villages in the Anfal campaign, \n     killing an estimated 50,000 to 180,000 Kurds.\n       (3) On March 16, 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons against \n     Iraqi Kurdish civilian opponents in the town of Halabja, \n     killing an estimated 5,000 Kurds and causing numerous birth \n     defects that affect the town today.\n       (4) On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded and began a seven month \n     occupation of Kuwait, killing and committing numerous abuses \n     against Kuwaiti civilians, and setting Kuwait's oil wells \n     ablaze upon retreat.\n       (5) Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February \n     28, 1991, and Iraq subsequently accepted the ceasefire \n     conditions specified in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 687 (April 3, 1991) requiring Iraq, among other \n     things, to disclose fully and permit the dismantlement of its \n     weapons of mass destruction programs and submit to long-term \n     monitoring and verification of such dismantlement.\n       (6) In April 1993, Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to \n     assassinate former President George Bush during his April 14-\n     16, 1993, visit to Kuwait.\n       (7) In October 1994, Iraq moved 80,000 troops to areas near \n     the border with Kuwait, posing an imminent threat of a \n     renewed invasion of or attack against Kuwait.\n       (8) On August 31, 1996, Iraq suppressed many of its \n     opponents by helping one Kurdish faction capture Irbil, the \n     seat of the Kurdish regional government.\n       (9) Since March 1996, Iraq has systematically sought to \n     deny weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special \n     Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) access to key facilities and \n     documents, has on several occasions endangered the safe \n     operation of UNSCOM helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel \n     in Iraq, and has persisted in a pattern of deception and \n     concealment regarding the history of its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs.\n       (10) On August 5, 1998, Iraq ceased all cooperation with \n     UNSCOM, and subsequently threatened to end long-term \n     monitoring activities by the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency and UNSCOM.\n       (11) On August 14, 1998, President Clinton signed Public \n     Law 105-235, which declared that ``the Government of Iraq is \n     in material and unacceptable breach of its international \n     obligations'' and urged the President ``to take appropriate \n     action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws \n     of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its \n     international obligations.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to seek to \n     remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq \n     and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to \n     replace that regime.\n\n     SEC. 4. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT A TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IN \n                   IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Authority To Provide Assistance.--The President may \n     provide to the Iraqi democratic opposition organizations \n     designated in accordance with section 5 the following \n     assistance:\n       (1) Broadcasting.--(A) Grant assistance to such \n     organizations for radio and television broadcasting by such \n     organizations to Iraq.\n       (B) There is authorized to be appropriated to the United \n     States Information Agency $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to \n     carry out this paragraph.\n       (2) Military assistance.--(A) The President is authorized \n     to direct the drawdown of defense articles from the stocks of \n     the Department of Defense, defense services of the Department \n     of Defense, and military education and training for such \n     organizations.\n       (B) The aggregate value (as defined in section 644(m) of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961) of assistance provided \n     under this paragraph may not exceed $97,000,000.\n       (b) Humanitarian Assistance.--The Congress urges the \n     President to use existing authorities under the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 to provide humanitarian assistance to \n     individuals living in areas of Iraq controlled by \n     organizations designated in accordance with section 5, with \n     emphasis on addressing the needs of individuals who have fled \n     to such areas from areas under the control of the Saddam \n     Hussein regime.\n       (c) Restriction on Assistance.--No assistance under this \n     section shall be provided to any group within an organization \n     designated in accordance with section 5 which group is, at \n     the time the assistance is to be provided, engaged in \n     military cooperation with the Saddam Hussein regime.\n       (d) Notification Requirement.--The President shall notify \n     the congressional committees specified in section 634A of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 at least 15 days in advance of \n     each obligation of assistance under this section in \n     accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming \n     notifications under such section 634A.\n       (e) Reimbursement Relating to Military Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--Defense articles, defense services, and \n     military education and training provided under subsection \n     (a)(2) shall be made available without reimbursement to the \n     Department of Defense except to the extent that funds are \n     appropriated pursuant to paragraph (2).\n       (2) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President for each of the fiscal \n     years 1998 and 1999 such sums as may be necessary to \n     reimburse the applicable appropriation, fund, or account for \n     the value (as defined in section 644(m) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act if 1961) of defense articles, defense \n     services, or military education and training provided under \n     subsection (a)(2).\n       (f) Availability of Funds.--(1) Amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under this section are authorized to remain \n     available until expended.\n       (2) Amounts authorized to be appropriated under this \n     section are in addition to amounts otherwise available for \n     the purposes described in this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF IRAQI DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION \n                   ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Initial Designation.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the President shall designate \n     one or more Iraqi democratic opposition organizations that \n     satisfy the criteria set forth in subsection (c) as eligible \n     to receive assistance under section 4.\n       (b) Designation of Additional Groups.--At any time \n     subsequent to the initial designation pursuant to subsection \n     (a), the President may designate one or more additional Iraqi \n     democratic opposition organizations that satisfy the criteria \n     set forth in subsection (c) as eligible to receive assistance \n     under section 4.\n       (c) Criteria for Designation.--In designating an \n     organization pursuant to this section, the President shall \n     consider only organizations that--\n       (1) include a broad spectrum of Iraqi individuals and \n     groups opposed to the Saddam Hussein regime; and\n       (2) are committed to democratic values, to respect for \n     human rights, to peaceful relations with Iraq's neighbors, to \n     maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity, and to fostering \n     cooperation among democratic opponents of the Saddam Hussein \n     regime.\n       (d) Notification Requirement.--At least 15 days in advance \n     of designating an Iraqi democratic opposition organization \n     pursuant to this section, the President shall notify the \n     congressional committees specified in section 634A of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 of his proposed designation in \n     accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming \n     notifications under such section 634A.\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\n     SEC. 6. WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL FOR IRAQ.\n\n       Consistent with section 301 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (Public Law \n     102-138), House Concurrent Resolution 137, 105th Congress \n     (approved by the House of Representatives on November 13, \n     1997), and Senate Concurrent Resolution 78, 105th Congress \n     (approved by the Senate on March 13, 1998), the Congress \n     urges the President to call upon the United Nations to \n     establish an international criminal tribunal for the purpose \n     of indicting, prosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and \n     other Iraqi officials who are responsible for crimes against \n     humanity, genocide, and other criminal violations of \n     international law.\n\n     SEC. 7. ASSISTANCE FOR IRAQ UPON REPLACEMENT OF SADDAM \n                   HUSSEIN REGIME.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, once Saddam Hussein is \n     removed from power in Iraq, the United States should support \n     Iraq's transition to democracy by providing immediate and \n     substantial humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, by \n     providing democracy transition assistance to Iraqi parties \n     and movements with democratic goals, and by convening Iraq's \n     foreign creditors to develop a multilateral response to \n     Iraq's foreign debt incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the situation in Iraq \nand to urge my colleagues to support the legislation introduced by the \nMajority Leader today.\n  I spoke on Iraq on this floor last November and again in February, \nbut Saddam Hussein is still in power, still threatening his neighbors \nand oppressing his people, so I must turn again to this topic. In fact, \nI will keep turning to it, joining my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle, trying to change U.S. policy toward Iraq, because I cannot abide \nthe idea of Saddam Hussein as the dictator of Iraq and I will never \naccept the status quo in Iraq. One of three things will happen, Mr. \nPresident: Saddam Hussein will lose his job, I will lose my job, or I \nwill keep talking about him on this floor. 1998 has unfortunately \nbrought us a new and less advantageous situation in our relationship \nwith Iraq. First of all, other threats have pushed Iraq into the \nbackground.\n  Asia's recession and the collapse of the Russian ruble have sent \nshock waves through all the emerging markets. Economic instability is \nusually the harbinger of political instability, which in turn threatens \nthe peace between nations and the ability of weakened nations to \nmaintain their own security. The Indian-Pakistani nuclear confrontation \nand the unravelling of Russia's military are two highly significant \nexamples of this trend. Russia's crisis is particularly important \nbecause our security and that of our allies depends on Russia keeping \nits nuclear weapons and fissile materials out of the hands of the rogue \nstates and terrorist groups which would deliver them to us, either by \nballistic missile or by the rented or stolen truck favored by \nterrorists.\n  Terrorism may or may not actually be on the rise, but terrorists have \nrecently shown the intention and ability to attack American targets \noverseas. As we confront organizations like that of Usama bin Ladin, we \ncome face to face with people who will go to great efforts to kill \nAmericans, and we react strongly. In the aftermath of events like the \nbombing of Khobar Towers or the two embassies in Africa, we naturally \nmove terrorism to the forefront of our threat concerns. As peace is \ngradually made in the world's most intractable ethnic and religious \nconflicts, terrorism ought to decline, but our rationality can not \npenetrate terrorist motivation.\n  In addition, there is proliferation. Rogue missiles and their deadly \ncargoes are rapidly developing, and spreading: the North Korean launch \nfollows launches by Pakistan and Iran and tests of nuclear weapons in \nboth India and Pakistan. The trend in the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction is running against us as an increasing number of \ncountries come to view these missiles as a low-cost way of placing the \nU.S. and our allies at risk without expending the resources to confront \nus militarily across the board. In a way, Iraq during the Gulf War was \nthe precursor of this kind of thinking: they entered the war with a big \narmy and air force, but in the end the only thing that made them a \nserious and deadly opponent was their arsenal of SCUD missiles. SCUDs \nand the like may be 1950's technology, but armed with biological, \nchemical, or nuclear warheads, these missiles are equalizers in 1998.\n  And so, in this time of uncertainty and change, we rank the threats \nto our national life and to our individual lives and livelihoods, and \nwe tend to forget Iraq. It is an old threat, after all, and we have \nlived with it for all this decade. In addition, Iraq seems held in \ncheck by its neighbors and by economic sanctions. Yet although the \nIraqi threat may appear to be dormant, in fact the risk we and our \nallies run from the continuation of Saddam Hussein in power is in fact \ngreater than it has been for years.\n  We know, most recently and unambiguously from the former U.N. weapons \ninspector Scott Ritter, that Iraq's program to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction continues. We know that more than fifty days have elapsed \nsince the last UNSCOM weapons inspection. Almost two months of immunity \nhave been granted to a regime which used chemical weapons on its own \npeople, which seeks biological weapons, and which had an active and \nadvanced nuclear weapons program. Further, Iraqi regime rhetoric, \nstated most recently by Tariq Aziz at the U.N. General Assembly meeting \nthis week, notifies us that Iraq will no longer accept UNSCOM \nmonitoring, at least not in an effective form. So Iraq's neighbors, and \nwe, can expect to be threatened by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction of \never-growing lethality in coming years, with no collective \ninternational action to halt it.\n  Saddam Hussein pays for his weapons programs by smuggling oil, at \nwhich he is getting more proficient, and by diverting resources which \nshould be going to the Iraqi people. His military may be less capable \nthan before the Gulf War, but his troops could still overwhelm the \nremaining areas of Iraqi Kurdistan outside his control. They could move \nnorth at any time or attack pockets of resistance in the southern marsh \nareas.\n  It is strongly in America's interest that Iraq's neighbors and our \nallies in the region live in peace and security. That interest alone \nmore than justifies a policy to change the Iraqi government. But there \nis an additional reason which ought to have particular resonance in the \nUnited States. Mr President, I refer to the need to free the Iraqi \npeople from one of the most oppressive dictatorships on earth.\n  We Americans, who have striven for more than two centuries to govern \nourselves, should particularly feel the cruel anomaly which is the \nIraqi government. In an age in which democracy is in the ascendant, in \nwhich democracy is universally recognized as a government's seal of \nlegitimacy, the continued existence of a Stalinist regime like the one \nin Baghdad should inspire us to action. Saddam Hussein rules by raw \nfear. In terms of absolutism, personality cult, and terror applied at \nevery level of society, only North Korea rivals Iraq today. The \nexistence of such a government is a daily affront to every freedom-\nloving person, to everyone who is revolted by the degradation of our \nfellow human beings. I refuse to accept it, and I want the United \nStates to refuse to accept it. As I have said on this floor before, \nwhen Saddam's prisons and secret police records and burial grounds are \nopened, when the Iraqis can at last tell their horrifying story to the \ninternational court which will try Saddam for his many crimes against \nhis own people, we Americans will be proud we took this stand.\n  Mr. President, over the past year we have made some progress toward a \npolicy of replacing the Iraqi regime. The Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Bill passed by this body included funding for assistance \nto Iraqi opposition movements and for broadcasting to Iraq. The \nAdministration has proposed a program to assist the Iraqi opposition \nabroad, to link the different groups together and get them organized. I \nsupport all these efforts, but they don't go far enough. The \nlegislation before us takes the additional steps which indicate full \ncommitment to helping the Iraqi people get rid of Saddam and his \nregime: the legislation states the commitment, and it enables the \nAdministration to supply military assistance to the Iraqi opposition.\n  Mr. President, should this legislation come into effect, we and the \nAdministration should be prepared for the possibility that the Iraqi \nopposition may use the military equipment they receive, together with \ntheir own resources, to liberate some portion of\n\n[[Page S11125]]\n\nIraq. As I have said before that will be the time for the United States \nto recognize the opposition as Iraq's government and lift economic \nsanctions on the liberated part of the country.\n  At this time in history, when some in the world seem ready to set \naside their moral scruples and interact with Saddam, when the UNSCOM \ninspection system is at grave risk, when Saddam may attempt to break \nfree of the sanctions which have restrained him since the Gulf War, it \nis urgent for the United States to clearly state its implacable \nopposition to Saddam and his regime. This legislation is the way to do \nthat, and to simultaneously help Iraqis make their revolution. Besides \nstrengthening the Iraqi opposition, this legislation tells Iraqis to \nkeep up hope. It enables the Administration to tell Iraqis we know how \nbad Saddam is, we have the facts on him, and we will not rest until we \nsee him in court. Iraqis will also learn that we understand the need to \ndeal with the burden of debt Saddam has incurred, and we will work with \nIraq's international creditors to find a solution for a post-Saddam \nIraq. Iraqis will learn of our commitment to provide humanitarian \nassistance and democracy transition assistance to a post-Saddam Iraq. \nThey will learn that an Iraq committed to democracy will be a welcome \nmember in the family of nations. As they learn what we have done and \nwhat we are prepared to do, the Iraqi people will be our allies in an \nenterprise which will make them free, and America and its allies more \nsecure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 2526. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Little Toot; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n      certificate of documentation for the vessel ``little toot''\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \ndirect that the vessel Little Toot, Official Number 938858, be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. Code.\n  The Little Toot was constructed in Panama City, Florida in 1988. It \nis a tender vessel, which can be used also as a small tugboat, and was \nconstructed by Marine Fabricators for Structures, Inc. It is 25.2 feet \nlong, 12.2 feet wide, 4.1 feet deep, and self-propelled.\n  The vessel was purchased by Marinex Construction Company, Inc. of \nJohns Island, South Carolina, which purchased it in 1997 for intended \nuse as a working tugboat in the harbor of Charleston, SC. The vessel \nhas never been registered with the Coast Guard and has been sold a \nnumber of times. U.S. documentation laws require documentary proof of \ncontinuous U.S. ownership. The current owner has not been able to \nlocate all the necessary documentation to prove continuous U.S. \nownership, and therefore I am introducing legislation to waive the \nrequirements of the coastwise trade law.\n  The owner of the Little Toot is seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause he wishes to use the vessel as a tugboat. His desired \nintentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise \ntrade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his intention \nto comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The \npurpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Little Toot \nto engage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries of the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bumpers, and Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 2527. A bill to better regulate the transfer of firearms at gun \nshows; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the gun show sunshine act of 1998\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Bumpers, Dodd, and Moseley-Braun, I introduce the Gun Show \nSunshine Act of 1998. This bill addresses the serious problem of gun \nshows where criminals can buy and sell dangerous weapons without any \nrecord of the sale, and without any background checks.\n  Let me outline the scope of the problem.\n  Since the Brady Act went into effect in 1994, more than 242,000 \nhandgun purchases have been denied to convicted felons, fugitives, drug \naddicts and other dangerous persons. The Domestic Violence Gun Ban in \nthe Brady Act, which I sponsored, went into effect in 1996 and has \nprevented more than 6,800 firearms sales to people convicted of abusing \na spouse or child.\n  However, because of a loophole in our laws, those same people merely \nneed to drive to a gun show and they can buy as many weapons as they \nwant. Just walk in with cash and walk out with a weapon--no waiting, no \nbackground check, and no record of the transaction.\n  Simply put, gun shows are firearm flea markets for felons.\n  Because gun shows are largely unregulated, no one knows for sure how \nmany gun shows are held each year, or how many guns are sold at them. \nEstimates range from 2,000 to 5,200 shows a year. These shows generate \nbillions of dollars in gun sales and put thousands of guns into the \nhands of people who would be stopped from buying a gun if a background \ncheck were done.\n  The system is perfectly geared to the anonymity criminals crave. \nTommy Dillon, a serial killer in Ohio, used gun shows to both buy and \nsell his murder weapons without a trace--even though police suspected \nhe was the killer. Dillon was so sure he found a perfect system that he \ntaunted police with an anonymous letter promising he would never be \ncaught. He was caught after killing five people, but only because of a \nfreak coincidence. After Dillon was picked up on an unrelated weapons \ncharge, someone he had sold one of his murder weapons to recognized \nDillon from a newspaper photo, and called the police when he realized \nhe had one of the murder weapons police sought.\n  One California gun dealer used the unregulated flea-market atmosphere \nof gun shows to sell 1,700 guns in a four-year period. Some of these \nguns made their way to gang members and juveniles. Of the guns that \ncould be traced, at least 30 were used in crimes, including three \nmurders and a shoot out with police.\n  The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 341,000 guns a year \nwere stolen from private citizens between 1987 and 1992. Because there \nis no requirement to keep records, gun shows provide a safe haven to \ndispose of these weapons.\n  How did it come to be like this?\n  Back in 1986, under intense pressure from the gun lobby, Congress \npassed and President Reagan signed into law the Firearm Owners' \nProtection Act. The law substantially weakened the Gun Control Act of \n1968, which was passed after the assassinations of Sen. Robert F. \nKennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.\n  Among the changes was a loosening of the law regarding who needs a \nlicense to sell firearms and what records must be kept. Under the new \nlaw, anyone selling from their ``private collection'' or who is engaged \nin ``occasional sales'' was made exempt from federal record-keeping.\n  But the law does not define ``occasional sales'' or precisely what \nconstitutes a ``personal collection.'' And, to make matters worse, the \nlaw prohibits agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nfrom even entering a gun show unless they are there on a specific case.\n  This has to stop. This bill would bring these weapons sales into the \nlight and strip criminals of their government-granted anonymity. Under \nthis bill, gun show operators would be required to obtain a license \nfrom the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and meet the same \nstandards as federally licensed gun dealers--they must be more than 21 \nyears of age and have no convictions for gun-law violations.\n  Any person selling a firearm at a gun show would be required to \nnotify the gun-show operator. The gun-show operator would then conduct \na background check of the purchaser using the Instant Check system, \njust as a licensed gun dealer is required to do. The gun-show operator \nwould also be required to keep the same records as a licensed gun \ndealer, including the name and address of the purchaser, the type of \ngun and its serial number. The operator would also be required to \nsubmit to the ATF a list of the serial numbers of all guns sold at the \nshow so that if these guns are later recovered at a crime scene, the \nATF will be able to trace the gun.\n  This bill simply takes the laws that already apply to licensed gun \ndealers,\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n\nand applies them to the thousands of transactions conducted by \nunlicensed sellers at gun shows.\n  Mr. President, we must do more to stop the gun violence on our \nstreets. Firearms are involved in 35,000 deaths a year. That's more \nAmerican killed than in the entire Korean War.\n  I urge my colleagues to help cut this weapons supply line that fuels \nan arms race on our streets. Let's work together to pass the Gun Show \nSunshine Act and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Commissioner of Social Security to \nestablish a demonstration project to conduct outreach efforts to \nincrease awareness of the availability of Medicare cost-sharing \nassistance to eligible low-income Medicare beneficiaries; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         social security administration outreach demonstration\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, since 1988, Congress has \nestablished three programs to provide low-income elderly and disabled \nindividuals with Medicare cost-sharing assistance under Medicaid. \nDespite the availability of these dual-eligible programs, gaps in \nbeneficiary knowledge and deficiencies in program administration by \nfederal and state agencies have created persistent barriers to \nenrollment by eligible Medicare recipients.\n  For several years, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nand the Social Security Administration have sought to educate seniors \non the availability of Medicare cost-sharing programs through mass \nmailings, informational hotlines, and pamphlet distribution. While \nthese initiatives have helped, a study by Families USA found that over \nthree million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are not enrolled in any \ncost-sharing program. In Kentucky, the study estimates that the lack of \ninformation about and participation in Medicare cost-sharing programs \ncost more than 49,000 low-income Kentuckians about $25 million a year. \nIn order to overcome these troubling blockades to enrollment, the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services,the Health Care Financing \nAdministration and the Social Security Administration are studying \noptions to more effectively serve our nation's financially vulnerable \nseniors and disabled.\n  A key aspect to improving participation in cost-sharing programs is \nthe capacity for federal and state agencies to identify those who \nexperience critical income shifts after their initial enrollment in \nMedicare and Social Security. One group at particular risk of reduced \nincome in later life is widowed spouses.\n  For anyone who has lost a loved one, the experience is overwhelming \nboth mentally and emotionally. The loss of a spouse, often after a \nlong, intensive illness, leaves many elderly with the difficult task of \nrestructuring their lives in order to regain personal and financial \nstability. At this critical time of change, widowed spouses rely on \ntheir revised Social Security benefit as the foundation for their \nfuture budget planning. Statistics furnished by the Social Security \nAdministration show that 40 percent of nonmarried women, a category \nwhich includes widows, rely on Social Security for 90 percent of their \nincome in comparison to only 18 percent of married couples. In \naddition, nearly one-fourth of nonmarried women rely on Social Security \nas their sole source of income.\n  In an effort to focus federal and state agencies on the health and \nwelfare needs of low-income, widowed spouses, I am introducing \nlegislation for a research demonstration to identify potential dual \neligibles during the recalculation of Social Security benefits for \nwidowed spouses. The Social Security Administration would refer this \ninformation to the state administrators of Medicare cost-sharing \nprograms for their followup.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Arlen \nSpecter for including my request to fund this research effort by the \nSocial Security Administration in the committee report to FY 1999 \nLabor, Health\n\n[[Page S11127]]\n\nand Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill approved by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee in September. As the House and Senate \nwork to complete the omnibus appropriations bill for FY 1999, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to include this research endeavor in the \nfinal measure as part of our commitment to improving the responsiveness \nof federal and state agencies to the health and welfare needs of our \nnation's at-risk seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2530. A bill to designate certain lands in the Valley Forge \nNational Historical Park as the Valley Forge National Cemetery, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    VALLEY FORGE NATIONAL CEMETERY.\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \ncreating a Valley Forge National Cemetery and calling on the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to determine the feasibility of a national cemetery \nin southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  This legislation specifically authorizes the Department of the \nInterior to transfer a portion of the Valley Forge National Historic \nPark to the Department of Veterans Affairs for establishment of a \nValley Forge National Cemetery in Southeastern Pennsylvania. This new \ncemetery will be constructed and operated by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs' National Cemetery System (NCS). The NCS was established by \nCongress and approved by President Lincoln in 1862 to provide for the \nproper burial and registration of graves of Civil War soldiers. The NCS \ncurrently operates 115 cemeteries throughout the nation and in Puerto \nRico. Since its establishment, the National Cemetery System has been \nfulfilling one of our nation's most solemn obligations; it has provided \nfor the proper burial of our nation's veterans. This mission is perhaps \nmore important today than it has been in the entire history of the NCS. \nThe General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in a September 1997 report \nthat the numbers of veteran deaths and interments performed by NCS \ncontinue to grow each year and are projected to peak between 2005 and \n2010. This expected increase in workload has been reiterated by Mr. \nRoger Rapp, Acting Director of the National Cemetery System, at an \nApril 29, 1998 hearing before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nSubcommittee on Benefits. According to Mr. Rapp, annual veteran deaths \nare expected to peak in 2008.\n  With the fifth largest 65 and older veteran population in the \ncountry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania faces many challenges in \nfulfilling the nation's solemn obligation to its deceased veterans and \ntheir families. Striving to meet these challenges, the NCS operates two \nPennsylvania national cemeteries: Indiantown Gap National Cemetery and \nthe Philadelphia National Cemetery. The Indiantown Gap National \nCemetery is a 677-acre cemetery, which opened in 1982 and is expected \nto remain open until 2030 under estimated rates of interment. The \nPhiladelphia National Cemetery opened in 1885 with 13 acres, reached \ncasket capacity in 1962 and is expected to reach cremation capacity in \n1999.\n  A Valley Forge National Cemetery would provide the Philadelphia area \nwith new gravesites and alleviate the need for families to travel over \ntwo hours to the Indiantown Gap National Cemetery. I am informed that \nthe land to be transferred to the Department of Veterans Affairs does \nnot contain any historical markers and is a suitable site for such an \nimportant facility.\n  Also, there is no national cemetery in the southern or western parts \nof Pennsylvania, where the veteran population is heavy. In an effort to \naddress the burial needs of these veterans, I have included a provision \nin the Senate legislation requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto report to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs \nwithin 90 days of enactment on the feasibility of establishing and \noperating a national cemetery in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  The House legislation, H.R. 4365, introduced by my good friend, \nCongressman Jon Fox, is co-sponsored by the entire Pennsylvania \ndelegation. I join my House colleagues in introducing this legislation \nfor consideration in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

NECESSARY MEASURES TO RESPOND TO THE \n                       INCREASE IN STEEL IMPORTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Santorum, \nMr. Ford, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nCoats, and Mr. Levin) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas the current financial crises in Asia, the \n     independent States of the former Soviet Union (as defined in \n     section 3 of the FREEDOM Support Act), Russia, and other \n     areas of the world, involve significant depreciation in the \n     currencies of several key steel-producing and steel-consuming \n     countries, along with a collapse in the domestic demand for \n     steel in the countries;\n       Whereas the crises have generated and will continue to \n     generate increases in United States imports of steel, both \n     from the countries whose currencies have been depreciated and \n     from other Asian steel-producing countries that are no longer \n     able to export steel to the countries that are experiencing \n     an economic crisis;\n       Whereas United States imports of finished steel mill \n     products from Asian steel-producing countries, such as the \n     People's Republic of China, Japan, Korea, India, Taiwan, \n     Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, increased by 79 percent in \n     the first 5 months of 1998;\n       Whereas year-to-date imports of steel from Russia now \n     exceed the record import levels of 1997, and steel imports \n     from Russia and the Ukraine now approach 2,500,000 net tons;\n       Whereas foreign government trade restrictions and private \n     restraints of trade distort international trade and \n     investment patterns and result in burdens on United States \n     commerce, including absorption of a disproportionate share of \n     steel diverted from other countries;\n       Whereas the European Union, for example, despite also being \n     a major economy, in 1997 imported only one-tenth as much \n     finished steel products from Asian steel-producing countries \n     as the United States did and has restricted imports of steel \n     from the independent states of the former Soviet Union and \n     Russia;\n       Whereas the United States is simultaneously facing a \n     substantial increase in steel imports from the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union and Russia, caused in part \n     by the closure of Asian markets to steel imports; and\n       Whereas there is a well recognized need for improvement in \n     the enforcement of the United States trade laws to provide an \n     effective response to situations of such increased imports: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress calls upon the President to--\n       (1) pursue enhanced enforcement of the United States trade \n     laws with respect to the increase in steel imports into the \n     United States, using all remedies available under United \n     States laws including imposition of offsetting duties, \n     quantitative restrictions, and other appropriate remedial \n     measures;\n       (2) pursue with all methods at the President's disposal to \n     achieve a more equitable sharing of the burden of accepting \n     imports of finished steel products from Asia and the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union;\n       (3) establish a task force within the executive branch that \n     has responsibility for closely monitoring imports of steel \n     into the United States; and\n       (4) report to Congress not later than January 5, 1999, with \n     a comprehensive plan for responding to the increase in steel \n     imports, including ways of limiting the deleterious effects \n     on employment, prices, and investment in the United States \n     steel industry.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to offer \na bipartisan Senate concurrent resolution addressing the current steel \nimport crisis, which has been brought about due to the Asian and \nRussian financial crisis.\n  On Thursday, September 10, 1998, as chairman of the Senate Steel \nCaucus, I joined Congressman Regula in convening a joint meeting of the \nSenate and House Steel Caucus with executives from a number of the \nnation's largest steel manufacturers and members of the United \nSteelworkers of America to learn more about the current influx of \nimported steel into the United States. At that meeting, I expressed my \nprofound concern regarding the impact of\n\n[[Page S11129]]\n\nour steel companies and steelworkers of the current financial crisis in \nAsia and Russia, which have generated surges in U.S. imports of Asian \nand Russian steel.\n  According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the past \nthree months have been the highest monthly import volumes in U.S. \nhistory and, with Asia and Russia in economic crisis and with other \nmajor industrial nations not accepting their fair share of the \nadjustment burden, U.S. steel companies and employees are being damaged \nby this injurious unfair trade.\n  As Hank Barnette, Chief Executive Officer of Bethlehem Steel, wrote \nin an August 6, 1998 op-ed in the Washington Times, the United States \nhas become the dumping ground for foreign steel. He noted that Russia \nhas become the world's number one steel exporting nation and that China \nis now the world's number one steel-producing nation, which enormous \nsubsidies to foreign steel producers have continued. As one example, \nMr. Barnette cited the Commerce Department's recent revelation that \nRussia, one of the world's least efficient producers, was selling steel \nplate in the United States at more than 50 percent, or $110 per ton, \nbelow the constructed cost to make plate steel, which ultimately costs \nour steel companies in lost sales and results in fewer jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  Specifically, in the first half of 1998, total U.S. steel imports \nwere 18.2 million net tons, which is a 12.4 percent increase over \n1997's record level of 16.2 million tons for the same period. For the \nmonth of June 1998, total U.S. imports of steel mill products totaled \nover 3.7 million net tons, which is up 39.2 percent from June, 1997 \nlevel of 2.6 million net tons. In June 1998, U.S. imports of finished \nsteel imports were a record 3 million net tons, a 41.6 percent increase \nover the June 1997 2.1 million net tons.\n  Also in the first half of 1998, compared to the same period in 1997, \nsteel imports from Japan are up 114 percent, steel imports from Korea \nare up 90 percent, and imports from Indonesia are up 309 percent. Most \nsignificantly, the U.S. steel industry currently employs 163,000 people \ndown from 500,000 people in the 1980's. This situation is untenable for \nthe American steelworkers, steel manufacturers, their customers, and \nthe American people in general.\n  I believe that the growing coalition of steel manufacturers, and \nCongress must work together to remedy this import crisis before it is \ntoo late and the U.S. steel industry is forced to endure an \nexcruciatingly painful economic downturn. We have many of the tools we \nneed at our disposal to protect our steel industry from unfair and \nillegally dumped steel, and we must act now. At the caucus meeting, I \nnoted my intention to once again seek enactment of my longstanding \nproposal to establish a private legal right of action for aggrieved \nsteel companies and steelworkers where they can prove harm caused by \nillegal dumping of foreign goods.\n  This resolution calls on the President to take all necessary measures \nto respond to the surge of steel imports resulting from the Asian and \nRussian financial crisis. Specifically, the attached resolution calls \non the President to: pursue enhanced enforcement of the U.S. trade \nlaws, pursue all tools available to ensure that other nations accept a \nmore equitable sharing of these steel imports; establish a task force \nto closely monitor U.S.imports of steel, and, report to Congress by \nJanuary 5, 1999, on a comprehensive plan to respond to this surge of \nsteel imports.\n  The U.S. steel industry has become a world class industry with a very \nhigh-quality product. This has been achieved at a great cost: $50 \nbillion in new investment to restructure and modernize; 40 million tons \nof capacity taken out of the industry; and a work force dramatically \ndownsized from 500,000 to 170,000. This resolution is essential to \nrespond promptly to the current steel import crisis and prevent the \nloss of thousands of high-paying jobs in the steel industry. For these \nreasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting adoption of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Senate \nConcurrent Resolution offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter. In brief, the resolution calls for action by the U.S. \ngovernment on several fronts to address the steel import crisis. More \nimportantly, it reassures the U.S. steel industry, and steel workers, \nthat the United States Congress is concerned about the state of the \nsteel industry and is committed to ensuring that a fair trade policy \nprevails.\n  The aim of this resolution is straightforward: to respond to the \nimport crisis affecting the domestic steel industry. In this regard, \nthe Senate Concurrent Resolution calls for enforcement of U.S. trade \nlaws, equitable sharing of steel import surpluses, the establishment of \na task force to monitor U.S. imports of steel, and a report from the \nPresident with a plan to respond to the surge of steel imports.\n  Senator Specter's resolution is a companion to H. Con Res. 328. The \nresolution is supported by the leadership of the Senate Steel Caucus \nand it is endorsed by the domestic steel industry.\n  For those not familiar with the steel import crisis, as the markets \nhave struggled in Asia, Russia, and other regions of the world, and the \npurchasing power evaporates within these countries' borders, foreign \nsteel producers are diverting record levels of steel products from \nstalling economies into the United States. Desperate to find hard \ncurrency, our trading partners are flooding the U.S. market with \nimported steel that is creating a glut that is placing thousands of \nU.S. steel jobs at risk. This is a looming crisis that could have a \ndomino effect, which may jeopardize the security of families across the \nnation and the communities in which they live.\n  Regrettably, the impact of current trade and capital flow throughout \nthe so-called modern global economy is becoming a familiar story. The \neffects of far-flung economic trouble not only play havoc with the U.S. \nsteel industry, but also ripple through the auto industry, the farming \nindustry, and a host of other domestic industries.\n  Live and let live? Is that the appropriate U.S. reaction to this \ncrisis?\n  Through the International Monetary Fund, the United States reacts to \nthe crises of our trading partners overseas with generous participation \nin bailout programs. We have risen to the occasion many times to help \nother nations facing grave economic dilemmas. But, can we afford to \ncontinue to help if our trading partners thank us by attempting to \nexport their way out of their crises at the expense of the U.S. \neconomy?\n  I would like to share one sentiment expressed to me about this \nsituation in a letter by Mr. Jim Bowen, President of the West Virginia \nAFL-CIO: ``Working Americans have always generously helped out those in \nneed, but they can't be expected to do so by sacrificing their jobs and \ntheir families' security.'' And hear the words of Mr. Stephen Parks, a \nmanager with Ameristeel in St. Albans, West Virginia: ``We are cost-\ncompetitive with the best in the world. But we cannot compete fairly \nwith foreign economies driven by the impetus to export their own \nunemployment through subsidization or which export solely for the \npurpose of acquiring tradeable currency at any cost.''\n  Many of my colleagues have recently urged action on behalf of the \nnation's farmers. I certainly sympathize with the problems facing \nAmerican farmers whose overseas markets have been adversely affected by \nthese same economic downturns. This is no less a crisis, and, equally, \ndeserves swift and sure action by the Congress. As this Congress begins \nthe serious business of examining the international financial crisis, \nand formulating the appropriate U.S. response, the measures called for \nin this resolution are simple logic. After hearing the words of \nmanagers and workers in the U.S. steel industry, I believe that this \nresolution might also accomplish another worthy goal: restoring the \nconfidence in our international trade agenda.\n  Let us be realistic. This international steel crisis did not occur \novernight. In fact, the crisis is in part a result of decades-long \ngovernment-sponsored illegal subsidies by our trading partners that \nthis nation has not aggressively sought to correct. These subsidies \nhave kept too many steel producers around the world eagerly fostering \novercapacity because of unfair competitive advantages. Now, not only \nare the steel producers in Asia, Russia, and other parts of the world \nsuffering, but so are American steel workers, who have played fair, and \ntrusted our trade enforcement mechanisms.\n\n[[Page S11130]]\n\n  As called for in the resolution being submitted today, we must move \nforward with the full and timely enforcement of our trade laws. We must \ndo that before any serious thought is given to the adoption of trade \nmeasures to liberalize trade with additional nations not currently on \nthe books. Existing trade agreements must be enforced and the long-term \nimplications of these agreements must be understood. I hope that the \nresponsible government trade officials share my concern.\n  I understand that the United States Trade Representative, Charlene \nBarshefsky, met with steel industry representatives in early September \nand, while I was unable to attend that meeting, I am advised that in \nher press release the Ambassador reaffirmed the Administration's \n``commitment to strong U.S. trade laws designed to prevent injury to \nU.S. industry and workers from unfair trade practices and from import \nsurges, and to the expeditious and effective enforcement of these \nlaws.'' I was pleased to learn of these encouraging words from the \nAmbassador, and I hope that she will be successful in carrying out this \nagenda.\n\n  In this regard, I believe that this Congress should assist USTR in \nmoving this agenda forward. Let us help the Ambassador by stating \nclearly to our trading partners the Congress' stance on this matter. I \nam confident that Ambassador Barshefsky intends to negotiate the deal \nof all deals. In good faith, she intends to negotiate a global free \ntrade paradise where all can compete on a level and transparent playing \nfield.\n  Unfortunately, I have heard that very intent voiced many times by \nU.S. and foreign negotiators--and so have the U.S. steel workers. They \nheard it in 1974, during the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on \nTariff and Trade (GATT). That agreement cost this country hundreds of \nthousands of steel jobs. Many listeners may remember the result that \ndeal had on Allentown. Well, I also remember Clarksburg, Wheeling, and \nWeirton, West Virginia, all losers in that trade agreement.\n  The U.S. steel industry has stuck it out, and U.S. steel producers \ndid what the new 1974 trade rules said to do: restructure and \nmodernize, and become the most efficient producers of steel in the \nworld. The deal struck in that agreement was that the industry was to \naccomplish this restructuring and modernization and, then, the \ngovernment would ensure that there would be a level global playing \nfield on which to compete.\n  However, today, over 20 years later, the U.S. steel industry \ncontinues to face unfair trade practices from every corner of the \nworld. In the global free trade garden of paradise, apparently, some \nplayers keep eating off the forbidden subsidy tree, because the so-\ncalled paradise is a pretty shabby place for U.S. workers.\n  In closing, I want to address the Constitutional component of \nsupporting this resolution. This debate is a good place for Congress to \nreflect the myths and the realities of our current trade policies. It \nis time that the Congress takes seriously its constitutional role in \nthe regulation of foreign commerce. The Constitution vests the Congress \nwith the power ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' It is the \ntask of Congress to understand the benefits and risks of global trade, \nbut to promote only trade policies that are fair to all Americans, \nwhether they be steel or auto workers, farmers, or bankers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the important steel resolution \noffered by Senator Specter.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nSenior Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) in his efforts to describe \nsome of the provisions of concern that were attached to the Interior \nAppropriations legislation, the fate of which is now uncertain. I hope \nthat all the provisions that will harm the environment, impede the \nenforcement of environmental law, or weaken federal environmental \npolicy, will be removed from this legislation if it either returns to \nthe floor or is incorporated in a broader appropriations bill.\n  This is not the first time that I have supported the Senior Senator \nfrom Montana in his efforts to address environmentally harmful \nlegislative riders in appropriations legislation. In September 1995, I \njoined in his efforts to mitigate the effects of riders in the FY 96 \nVA-HUD appropriations legislation regarding the operations of the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Once again, I applaud his leadership \nin championing the protection of the environment.\n  Mr. President, for more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable \nbipartisan consensus on protecting the environment. As a consequence of \nthis broad agreement, today we breathe cleaner air, drink cleaner \nwater, and enjoy spectacular public lands.\n  Unfortunately, again during this Congress, we have faced numerous \nproposals to modify the environmental protections upon which American \nfamilies depend. We have seen bills that would undermine the Wilderness \nAct and the management of our public lands, block implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act, rollback wetlands standards and weaken \nenforcement of clean water laws, and slow down or stop cleanup of \nhazardous waste sites. Congressional consideration of these proposals \nhas been divisive, time-consuming, and ultimately unproductive.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have a responsibility to the American \npeople to protect the quality of our public lands and resources. That \nresponsibility of stewardship requires that I oppose legislative \nefforts to include proposals in routine spending bills that weaken \nenvironmental laws or prevent potentially beneficial environmental \nregulations from being promulgated by the\n\n[[Page S11131]]\n\nfederal agencies that carry out federal law.\n  In addition to my substantive concerns, Mr. President, I also share \nwith the Senator from Montana a procedural concern about these riders. \nThe people of Wisconsin have been calling my office in the last few \nweeks to express their grave concern that when riders are placed in \nspending bills major decisions regarding environmental protection are \nbeing made without the benefit of an up or down vote. Wisconsinites \nhave very strong views that Congress has a responsibility to discuss \nand publicly debate matters effecting the environment. Thus, the Senior \nSenator from Montana is making an important procedural point for the \nSenate. We should be on record with regard to our position on this \nmatter of open government and environmental stewardship.\n  Though I have substantive concerns about all of the riders that the \nSenior Senator from Montana has detailed, and others, I wanted to share \nmy concerns by highlighting in detail a few riders contained in the \nInterior Appropriations legislation.\n  I am concerned about the language on forest road decommissioning that \nis contained in Title II of the Interior bill. This language prohibits \nthe use of funds to decommission National Forest System roads until the \nRegional Forester certifies that all ``unauthorized'' roads are \ndecommissioned or reconstructed. Mr. President, this mandate simply \ndoes not recognize that maintaining existing roads is a priority both \nin Wisconsin's national forests and throughout Forest Service Region 9. \nOur existing road system in the Nicolet and Chequamegon National \nForests not only serves those who visit our forests, but also serves \nour local communities. Forest Service roads are important routes \nbetween communities in the northern part of my state. I also travel \nthem when I attend Listening Sessions and other events in northern \nWisconsin. I am concerned that if our forests have to spend time \ndocumenting all unauthorized roads this fiscal year, such as snowmobile \ncrossings and other rights of way, we will neither get to accomplish \nany needed decomissioning, nor any much needed maintenance.\n  I also oppose the rider regarding logging in Tongass National Forest \ncontained in the Interior bill. While Wisconsin's national forests have \nstruggled to bring their timber sales above cost, I am concerned that \nthis rider requires that the Forest Service offer for sale, and allow \nthe logging of, ninety percent of the timber volume proposed by the \nTongass Land Management Plan, a plan which is currently under appeal to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture. Moreover, this rider contains a \ndangerous, precedent-setting provision that makes this requirement \nlegally enforceable. I strongly believe that taxpayers should be \ngetting a better return for the sale of timber from public lands, and I \nam concerned about increasing cut volumes when we still need to address \nbelow cost issues on the Tongass.\n  These are a few of my concerns, Mr. President. I believe that the \nSenate should act to strip these riders from the bill and send clean \nInterior funding provisions to the President for his signature. I \nencourage my colleagues to take the advice of the Senior Senator from \nMontana, and act to fund the programs we must fund without taking \nenvironmental policy actions that the public opposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11130-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ACTIVATION OF THE MONTANA GUARD CAVALRY TROOP, THE BLACKHORSE UNIT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand here today to recognize the \nbeginning of a new era for the Montana Army National Guard. Activation \nof the Montana Guard Cavalry Troop, also known as the Blackhorse unit, \nwill commence on October 3, 1998. This will be an integrated cavalry \ntroop that is part of a regiment whose distinguished history dates back \nto the turn of the century.\n  The Blackhorse is currently one of only three armored cavalry \nregiments in the United States Army. The mission of this regiment is to \ntrain Army units for the next possible war and does so by challenging \nthose units in real life scenarios to meet the test of active warfare. \nThe Blackhorse unit is considered the most highly trained unit in the \nUnited States Army. The Montana Army National Guard is both honored and \nprivileged to join the Blackhorse unit as an equal partner.\n  The Montana Army National Guard must be prepared to meet the \nchallenges of what the future may hold.

Mr. President, I rise to take just a minute of the \nSenate's time to let my colleagues know of an honor that Senator Roth \nreceived from the Delaware Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  In a gala event last night in Wilmington, Delaware, Senator Roth was \nhonored for his achievements as a legislator and for his outstanding \ncontributions to Delaware and to the nation. This was the Multiple \nSclerosis Society's first-ever Dinner of Champions, and it is quite an \nhonor for Senator Roth to be one of the first two individuals \nrecognized by the organization.\n  The other individual recognized last evening was Richard Christopher, \nthe President of Patterson-Schwartz Real Estate. He and his company \nhave been sponsors of and participants in the Bike-to-the-Bay \nfundraising event. The DuPont Company also received an award for its \ndecade-long support of the popular Read-a-thon program. Senator Roth \nwas in excellent company last night.\n  And, fortunately, he was able to be there and accept the award in \nperson. That is, Mr. President, one of the advantages of representing a \nState that is close to Washington. Senator Roth could both vote here in \nthe Senate and still get back to Wilmington in time to receive the \naward. I know that was important to him.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to take this brief time. And, I \ncongratulate Senator Roth on his award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11131-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECURITY AT GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I was delighted to see that the \nSenate passed S. 2392 (``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness \nDisclosure Act'') yesterday. I introduced this legislation with \nSenators Robert F. Bennett (R-UT) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-CT) on \nJuly 30, 1998. This ``Good Samaritan'' legislation is intended to \npromote the open sharing of information about Y2K solutions by \nprotecting those who share information in good faith from liability \nclaims based on the dissemination of that information. I want to make \nit clear that this legislation does not address liability that may \narise separately from actual Y2K failures of systems or devices. The \nhead of the President's Council on Y2K, John Koskinen, said that \npassing this bill is one of the most important things that we could do \non the Y2K front. I agree.\n  Over two years ago I stated ``that the year 2000 problem is indeed \nserious, and that fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. The \nproblem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the Federal \nGovernment, as well as the private sector, in order to avert major \ndisruptions on January 1, 2000.'' On\n\n[[Page S11132]]\n\nJuly 31, 1996 I sent President Clinton a letter expressing my views and \nconcerns about Y2K. I warned him of the ``extreme negative economic \nconsequences of the Y2K Time Bomb,'' and suggested that ``a \npresidential aide be appointed to take responsibility for assuring that \nall Federal Agencies, including the military, be Y2K compliant by \nJanuary 1, 1999 [leaving a year for `testing'] and that all commercial \nand industrial firms doing business with the federal government must \nalso be compliant by that date.''\n  January 1, 1999 is quickly approaching. I believe the ``Good \nSamaritan'' legislation that my colleagues passed last night will play \na significant role in helping private firms and the government in \naddressing the computer problem. I am hopeful that we will have this \nproblem in check come the year 2000, but, as the Duke said of Waterloo, \nit will be ``close run thing.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11131-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY FOR SWISSAIR 111 RECOVERY EFFORTS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the U.S. \nNavy for their initial efforts in search and recovery operations in the \nwake of the SwissAir Flight 111 tragedy.\n  At the request of the Canadian government, the U.S. Navy sent the \nHampton Roads-based Rescue and Salvage Ship USS GRAPPLE and members of \nMobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two to assist our friends and neighbors \nin this operation. The ship, commanded by Lieutenant Commander David E. \nDavis, has a lifting capability of 300 tons and employs the latest high \ntechnology sonar and diving equipment. This enables her to conduct \ndiving operations up to 190 feet beneath the ocean's surface.\n  Specifically, I'd like to commend the men and women who are carrying \nout this important mission. These sailors are highly-trained \nprofessionals who have experience in handling challenging and dangerous \ndiving operations. Some of the team members worked with the TWA Flight \n800 recovery and can draw upon those experiences. Although the \ncircumstances that sent GRAPPLE and our sailors to Nova Scotia are \ntragic and unusual, the teamwork of our Navy and that of Canada has \nbeen fostered for many years. This allows us to work together \neffectively in such times of crisis. It is our hope that the efforts of \nGRAPPLE and Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two will help provide \ncomfort and closure to those people who lost loved ones in this \naccident.\n  Mr. President, please join me in recognizing the significant \ncontribution of America's high-tech Navy and brave sailors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11132-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAVELERS AID SOCIETY OF \n                                DETROIT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nTravelers Aid Society of Detroit, which is celebrating its 75th \nAnniversary on October 15, 1998. Travelers Aid has been an important \npart of Metropolitan Detroit's network of community service \norganizations since its inception in 1923.\n  Travelers Aid was first created as an arm of the YWCA to assist young \nwomen who had recently settled in Detroit. In 1923, as the City of \nDetroit was growing by leaps and bounds, the Travelers Aid Society of \nDetroit was chartered as an independent institution to serve people who \nbecame stranded or lost. Since its chartering as an independent \ninstitution, Travelers Aid has broadened its activities from its \noriginal mandate to include assisting men and women, the homeless, \nrunaway youths, victims of domestic violence, children traveling alone, \nthe physically challenged and travelers at Detroit Metropolitan \nAirport. Travelers Aid has developed innovative programs, like Homeward \nBound and the Supportive Housing Opportunities Program, which have \nhelped thousands of people recover from homelessness. Each year, \nDetroit Metropolitan Airport, Travelers Aid helps 250 runaway children \nfind their way back home and introduces 150 adopted babies from foreign \nlands to their new American families. Along with the City of Detroit \nand the Lovelight Foundation, Travelers Aid sponsors the annual ``A \nSpecial Gift'' Christmas party for 2,500 homeless children at Detroit's \nCobo Hall.\n  On October 15, 1998, many people from my hometown will join together \nat the historic Wayne County Building to celebrate Travelers Aid's 75 \nyears of service to the community. This celebration is being chaired by \nN. Brewster Broder, with the assistance of Honorary Chair Nettie \nSeabrooks and Honorary Co-Chairs Charlie Williams and Larry Givens. \nCommunity Service awards will be given to four outstanding individuals \nwhose commitment to improving their community is truly inspiring. The \naward recipients are Aaliyah, an Oscar nominated recording artist; \nDelphine Fairbanks, a tireless volunteer at Detroit Metropolitan \nAirport; Geneva Williams, COO of United Way Community Services; and \nWilliam McKenzie of Michigan Rehabilitation Service.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of the Travelers Aid Society of \nDetroit exemplify so many of the qualities that make our country great. \nTheir dedication to their community, compassion for those in need and \ninnovative problem-solving skills affect the lives of tens of thousands \nof people each year. I invite my colleagues to join me in expressing \ngratitude to the Travelers Aid Society of Detroit for the important \nservices they have provided for the past 75 years, and in offering \ncongratulations to the four Community Service Award recipients on this \nspecial occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11132-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MR.

Mr. President, today Mr. S.W. ``Mel'' Melidosian \nis being recognized for his distinguished service in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center in Philadelphia, \nthe place where much of his illustrious career has taken place. After \nan astounding 57 years of devoted service to our nation, this \nremarkable man continues to serve veterans and their families. I am \ncertain that this august body will join me in commending Mr. Melidosian \non this special day.\n  Mr. Melidosian's service began in the Armed Services during World War \nII. From 1941 to 1946, he served as a U.S. Army Ordinance Management \nOfficer at the European Theater Headquarters and on the faculty of the \nOrdnance School. From 1951 to 1953, he served at the U.S. Army \nLogistics Command, Korea and at the U.S. Army Frankford Arsenal.\n  He began serving veterans at the Veterans Administration (now the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs) in 1946 in the Insurance Service but \nwas recalled to active duty in Korea. In 1953, he resumed his VA job \nand in 1959, he was appointed Deputy Chief Insurance Director. From \n1961 to 1984, he served as Director of the VA Regional Office and \nInsurance Center in Philadelphia, where he was instrumental in the \ninstallation of VA's first computer system for the Life Insurance \nPrograms; consolidation of VA Regional Offices and Insurance Offices; \ncreation of the Executive Program ``Leadership VA''; and test site \ndevelopment of the VA Compensation & Pension on-line computer system \n``TARGET.''\n  Mr. Melidosian has received many awards, including the Presidential \nRank Award of ``Distinguished Executive.''

Mr. President, after this week, someone very \nspecial will be missing from my morning commute from Wilmington. Jon \nBroscious, one of the Amtrak conductors who has been riding the trains \nwith me for the past 25 years, is beginning a well-earned retirement. \nThe mornings will not be the same without him.\n  Jon is one of those individuals--like so many of the conductors, \nbaggage handlers, flagmen, and attendants I\n\n[[Page S11133]]\n\nhave known who have worked so hard to maintain Amtrak's excellent \nreputation as an efficient and user-friendly service--who takes a great \ndeal of pride in his work, making the care and comfort of his \npassengers always his first priority. These are men and women who have \nlong understood that Amtrak's greatest assets are neither its miles of \ntrack nor its extensive rolling stock, but the good will of the \nthousands of Americans who depend upon rail transportation to get to \nwork, to visit their loved ones, and to expand their horizons. For many \nyears, Jon Broscious has earned the good will of countless passengers, \nsome of whom--like myself--see him every day, and others for whom his \nconscientious service is their one and only contact with America's rail \nsystem. He has treated each and every one--whether in club car or in \ncoach--as a first-class passenger. His example is one which all of us \nwould do well to follow.\n  During the twenty-five years that I have been sharing my mornings \nwith Jon, we have learned a great deal about one another's lives and \nfamilies. He has heard all about my children as they grew up, began to \nface the challenges of adulthood, embarked on their own careers, and \ngave me the joy of being a grandfather. And I shared Jon's pride as his \nson passed the bar and set up his practice in Virginia; anguished with \nhim throughout his son's battle with cancer; and shared his joy when \nthe disease was finally conquered. I'll never forget the time that Jon \nand his whole family, including his grandchildren, visited with me in \nmy office here in Washington. Though it was my first meeting with many \nof them, I felt like I knew each one well because Jon had spoken of \nthem so often.\n  Jon and his family have a great many plans for his well-deserved \nretirement. He has earned the comfort and happiness that he brought to \nso many others over the years. Along with his colleagues and the many \nothers who ride the trains each morning, I wish him all the best.\n  But the mornings will never be the same. I'll miss you, Jon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11132-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAUL A.

Spending the past twenty-five years in \ninternational trade, both in government and the private sector, Paul \nhas advanced agricultural trade policy and opened important and \nessential new markets to America's farmers and ranchers.\n  Paul Drazek came by his love for agriculture naturally, with both of \nhis grandparents running farms in upstate New York. At an early age he \nchose to use his intellect and energies to help one of our most export \ndependant industries find and expand market opportunities. To prepare \nhim for his life's mission, Paul furthered his knowledge in agriculture \nby receiving a degree in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the \nUniversity of Maryland.\n  Mr. Drazek began his career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nForeign Agricultural Service, serving fourteen years as a trade policy \nand marketing specialist. During that time he served four years as an \nagricultural negotiator for the U.S. delegation to the Tokyo Round of \nmultilateral trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and as the \nAgricultural Attache in our Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico.\n  Prior to joining the Department of Agriculture as Special Assistant \nto the Secretary, Mr. Drazek served as Director of Government Relations \nfor the American Farm Bureau Federation for ten years. He specialized \nin international affairs and legislative issues affecting U.S. \nagricultural trade. In that capacity, Mr. Drazek gained a familiarity \nwith the political and economic sensitivities that shape farm and trade \npolicies around the world. He also provided essential private sector \ninput to the Uruguay Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n  Paul has spent the last three years at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture representing American agricultural interests overseas \nopening and expanding new markets for our farmers and ranchers. Making \nprogress in international trade policy is a formidable challenge in \nthis dynamic global economy. Paul's unwavering dedication and \ncommitment to bringing prosperity to the world through trade and \neconomic interdependence will pay dividends for our nation well into \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute and say thank \nyou to Paul Drazek, and I wish him, his wife Sue and their two sons, \nKeith and Greg, the best in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/29/senate-section/article/S11133-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
