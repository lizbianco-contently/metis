Mr. President, I remind all Senators that we will be \nrecessing from 11:55 a.m. until 12:15 p.m. so that the Senate may \nproceed as a body to the Rotunda to pay our proper respects to the two \nfallen U.S. Capitol policemen and their families. The Senate will \nrecess again today from 2:45 p.m. until 3:45 p.m. so Members may attend \nthe memorial service for these two heroes.\n  With regard to the Senate's schedule this morning, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the credit union bill, with 15 minutes for \ndebate remaining on the Shelby amendment regarding small business \nexemptions. At approximately 10 a.m; the Senate will proceed to vote \non, or in relation to, the Shelby amendment. Following that vote, it is \nthe hope that the Senate will move quickly to final passage of the \ncredit union legislation.\n  For the remainder of today's session, the Senate may begin \nconsideration of the Treasury appropriations bill, health care \nlegislation, or other appropriations bills or conference reports as \navailable and after consultation with the leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle. Therefore, Members should expect votes throughout today's \nsession and into the evening as the Senate attempts to complete its \nwork prior to the August recess.\n  I want to emphasize something here, too. The plan has been we would \nspend Friday afternoon on the credit union bill, and we would have \nvotes Monday afternoon late, and this morning we would vote on the \nShelby amendment and go to passage. I understand the managers are not \nsure they are ready to do that, or other people are showing up with \namendments. I discourage amendments. Senators had an opportunity Monday \nafternoon and Friday afternoon to offer amendments, and to show up now \nand say, ``Oh, by the way, I have another amendment,'' I think, is not \nhelpful in trying to get done what we agreed to and move our schedule \nalong.\n  Let's have the final debate on the Shelby amendment and let's vote \nand move to passage of this legislation, and then go to an \nappropriations bill.

Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes equally divided prior to a motion to table Shelby amendment No. \n3338.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, does this side have 7\\1/2\\ and a half \nminutes and the other side 7\\1/2\\ minutes? That is my understanding.\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, there has been a lot said about the \namendment that we have offered to exempt small banks from the Community \nReinvestment Act. A popular mantra is that if the small bank exemption \namendment passes, President Clinton will veto the bill; therefore, the \nSenate should not take up this amendment. I have also been told this is \nnot the time or the place to take up an amendment to CRA. But I \nbelieve, Mr. President, that such assertions are not valid.\n  H.R. 1151 essentially eliminates the common bond requirement, \nallowing credit unions to serve virtually any and every group now.\n  In addition, H.R. 1151 explicitly authorizes credit unions to perform \ncommercial lending activities. In doing so, this Congress is \noverturning a historical Supreme Court decision and the law of the land \nfor about 60 years. While expanding the role of credit unions, we \ncontinue to protect the tax exemption credit unions now enjoy.\n  Small community banks, Mr. President, however, serve the local \ncommunity but have to compete with the higher cost of funds, a higher \nregulatory burden, and of course a considerable tax burden. While we \nincrease the competitive advantage of small bank competitors in this \nbill, we do nothing to help small banks compete on a more level playing \nfield.\n  So, Mr. President, for those who suggest that this is not the time or \nthe place for this amendment to exempt the small banks of America from \nthe CRA, I have to disagree. Credit unions are increasing their market \nshare over community banks in small local markets with higher savings \nrates and lower lending rates, rates small banks cannot match thanks to \nthe tax and regulatory burdens that constitute the competitive \ndisadvantage here. The small bank exemption from the Community \nReinvestment Act has everything to do with the competitive equity we \nare talking about--leveling the playing field between local community \nbanks and credit unions.\n  The President, of course, has the right to veto a bill if he so \nchooses. That is the legislative process. We all know that. However, I \ndo not believe the President would veto this bill if this amendment \nwere part of it. The Senate Banking Committee worked very hard to draft \na responsible bill, and, by and large, I think we did just that. \nNevertheless, Mr. President, I believe H.R. 1151, the bill before us \nnow, can be improved. And, to that extent, this is the time and this is \nthe place to improve the bill.\n  Yesterday, the Senate failed to table Senator Gramm's amendment to \nstrike the community-reinvestment-like provisions on credit unions from \nthe bill. I supported that. As a result, it appears the Senate has \nchosen to adopt Senator Gramm's amendment to eliminate the expansion of \nregulatory burden and mandated credit allocation on to credit unions, \nwhich I think is good.\n  If the Senate votes to table the small bank exemption from CRA, the \nSenate will make a very hypocritical policy statement to the American \npeople, I believe, saying, essentially, that we do not support the \nexpansion of mandated credit allocation and regulatory burden on credit \nunions, but, Mr. President, on the other hand, we do support the \nmandated credit allocation and regulatory burden on small community \nbanks. Now that is not what we call competitive equity.\n  I believe the worst part about this inconsistent policy is that \nconsumers are the ones who bear the brunt of the cost of the Community \nReinvestment Act. The CRA tax on banks only gets passed on to the \nconsumer. While the intention, Mr. President, of the Community \nReinvestment Act may have been to help consumers, in practice I believe \nit hurts them. CRA is bad for consumers. CRA is, I believe, bad public \npolicy.\n  Contrary to what opponents of the amendment would have you believe, \nthe small bank exemption would not gut CRA. Banks with less than $250 \nmillion in assets account for less than 12 percent of bank assets \nnationwide. This is a vote for small community banks in America. I \nthink it is time to do it and the time is now.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say that I am deeply appreciative \nof the problem that my good friend, the senior Senator from Alabama, \nSenator Shelby, expresses as it relates to community banks. I believe \nthey do need help. Indeed, I think we have to give them some tax \nrelief. I think we can and we should. That is why I have cosponsored \nthe Small Business Financial Institution Tax Relief Act. I believe \nSenator Shelby is also a cosponsor. And I believe the Presiding Officer \nis a cosponsor as well. There are other things we can do.\n  I think we have to examine CRA as it applies to those who have \noutstanding records year after year. Should they be subjected to the \nsame compliance requirements or shouldn't there be some way to relieve \nthem of the annual reporting process? Shouldn't there be more \nflexibility, if an institution has been exemplary for X number of \nyears? Let us discuss that in a different arena and let us not put it \non this bill. We can work towards a solution on this important issue \nand other relief for small banks so they can continue to compete and \nserve in communities that otherwise would be left without.\n  So I am sympathetic to the issue of CRA. But again, to put it on this \nbill, when the administration said clearly they will veto it, I say, \nwill only undo all the effort put into preserving credit unions and \nmaking them safer and sounder. I urge restraint on the part of my \ncolleagues, notwithstanding the fact that we need to do something to \nhelp that segment of our community which is so vital--the community \nbank.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Shelby \namendment to create a small bank exception to the Community \nReinvestment Act.\n  Mr. President, the Community Reinvestment Act requires financial \ninstitutions to meet the credit needs of local communities--including \nlow and moderate income areas--consistent with safe and sound lending \npractices.\n  Unfortunately, many proponents of the Shelby amendment have argued \nthat this obligation is tantamount to government mandated credit \nallocation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Neither the Act \nnor the regulations specify the number of loans, the type of loans, or \nthe parties to CRA loans. To the contrary, CRA relies on market forces \nand private sector ingenuity to promote community development lending. \nThis is evidenced by the tremendous flexibility that financial \ninstitutions have in satisfying CRA. For example, loans to nonprofits \nserving primarily low- and moderate-income housing needs; loans to \nfinancial intermediaries such as Community Development Financial \nInstitutions; and loans to local, state, and tribal governments may \nqualify for CRA coverage. Moreover, loans to finance environmental \nclean-up or redevelop industrial sites in low- and moderate-income \nareas also qualify as CRA loans.\n  In addition to lending, CRA is satisfied through investments by \nfinancial institutions in organizations engaged in affordable housing \nrehabilitation, and facilities that promote community development such \nas child care centers, homeless centers, and soup kitchens. These all \nqualify for CRA coverage.\n  Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has weighed in on this \nissue, arguing:\n\n       The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage \n     institutions who are not involved in areas where their own \n     self-interest in involved, in doing so. If you are indicating \n     to an institution that there is a foregone business \n     opportunity in an area X or loan product Y, that is not \n     credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market.\n\n  As illustrated by these examples and Chairman Greenspan's comments, \nit is clear that CRA is a far cry from government mandated credit \nallocation. To be sure, CRA is predicated on two simple assumptions \nthat should be shared by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: (1) \nthat a public charter for a bank or savings institution conveys \nnumerous benefits, including deposit insurance, and it is fair for the \npublic to ask something in return, and (2) government cannot and should \nnot provide more than a limited part of the capital required for local \nhousing and economic development needs; financial institutions in our \nfree economic system must play the leading role.\n  In the words of former Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, \n``CRA is\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nin many respects a model statute. It requires no public subsidy, no \nprivate subsidy, and no massive Washington bureaucracy.''\n  These simple concepts, which are the embodiment of CRA, are perhaps \nmost responsible for the significant democratization of credit that we \nhave seen over the last 20 years. Since its enactment in 1977, CRA has \nresulted in more than $397 billion in loan commitments for low- and \nmoderate-income borrowers. In my state of Rhode Island, it has been \nestimated that CRA has resulted in over $61 million in commitments for \ncommunity development lending since 1977.\n  Mr. President, I fear that the Shelby amendment will significantly \nundermine these advances. This amendment will exempt 86 percent of all \nbanks from CRA, thereby doing irreparable harm to our communities that \nare in dire need of investment and opportunity. The adverse impact on \ncommunity lending will be particularly severe in states such as Iowa, \nKansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, and Oklahoma, where 95 percent of \nall banks are small and would be exempt from CRA. If communities in \nthese states are not able to turn to their financial institutions for \nrural and community development lending, to whom will they turn?\n  Mr. President, this amendment is unnecessary. In response to concerns \nabout regulatory burdens voiced by small banks, CRA was revised in 1995 \nto provide regulatory relief. The new regulations provide a streamlined \nexamination process for independent banks and thrifts with assets under \n$250 million. In addition, under the new regulations, the smallest \nbanks have been exempted from all reporting requirements, and are no \nlonger subject to process-based documentation requirements. Moreover, \nthe actual time spent in the smallest banks on CRA examinations has \ndropped by 30 percent.\n  Following promulgation of the revised CRA regulations, many small \nbankers were effusive in their praise of the reforms. For example, \nRichard Mount of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which \nrepresents small banks, indicated,\n\n       We commend the regulators for instituting a meaningful, \n     streamlined, tiered examination system that recognizes the \n     differences between community banks and their large regional \n     and multinational brethren. The new rules should eliminate \n     the paperwork nightmare of CRA for community banks and allow \n     them to concentrate on what they do best--reinvest in their \n     communities.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment will significantly weaken one \nof our most important tools in preventing lending discrimination. \nPerhaps because of its success, many have forgotten the embarrassing \nstate of lending in many urban communities prior to CRA's enactment. In \na Senate Banking Committee hearing in 1977, a study of six banks was \npresented which showed that these banks, which held $144 million in \ndeposits from low-income and minority communities, returned an \nembarrassing one-half cent on the dollar in home loans. Throughout \nhearings on CRA, witnesses from around the country recounted similar \nstories of lending discrimination.\n  While certainly we have come a long way since 1977, lending \ndiscrimination, unfortunately, persists. In a study published earlier \nthis year by the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington, it was \nrevealed that Washington area lenders discriminate against two out of \nfive African American and Hispanic mortgage applicants. In one incident \ncited in the study, a Rockville lender advised a black tester that the \nlender did not make loans to first-time home buyers. The same lender \nlater met with a white tester, also posing as a first-time home buyer, \ngiving the tester an appointment and encouraging him to apply for a \nmortgage loan. Lending studies by other organizations reveal similar \nfindings. These studies have shown that minority borrowers receive \nfewer bank loans even when their financial status is the same as or \nbetter than white borrowers.\n  By encouraging lenders to extend credit to all communities, CRA has \nbeen an important weapon in fighting lending discrimination. Because \nthe Shelby amendment would exempt 86 percent of all banks from its \ncoverage, lenders could find it easier to discriminate in the provision \nof credit.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we want to return to the dark days \nbefore CRA, where access to credit and investment in our urban and \nrural communities was limited for all the wrong reasons. Instead, with \nthe movement of assets out of the banking system and with increasing \nindustry consolidation, we should be seeking ways to expand community \ninvestment, not limit it. For this reason, I will strongly oppose the \nShelby amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator from New York, the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, knows I am very sympathetic to the goals of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Alabama. I am concerned about the \nburden that the CRA imposes on our small community banks. It is my \nunderstanding, however, based on the representations of the chairman \nand a letter from the administration, that if this amendment is \nadopted, it will lead to the veto of this legislation, which I strongly \nsupport.\n  So I find myself in a real quandary. I support the amendment of the \nSenator from Alabama, yet I strongly support the underlying bill and do \nnot want to jeopardize it being signed into law.\n  Could the distinguished chairman give me assurances that he is \nwilling to work with me, with the Senator from Alabama, and others who \nare concerned about easing this burden on our small banks?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I not only give that assurance to you, but to all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House. I think we can do a better job \nensuring that small community banks have the ability to compete. We \nwill address some of the requirements that are placed upon them that \npreclude them from using chapter S corporations in the bill Senator \nAllard has introduced. And while we are at it, we will review some of \nthe regulatory requirements for reporting as required by CRA and we \nwill look for ways to diminish the burdens these requirements place on \nbanks that have exemplary CRA records.\n  That would be the absolute priority of this Senator, starting now. We \nwill begin with holding hearings, and from the information we gather, \nwe will craft and seek the support of legislation. Certainly I think \nnext year we will be able to come forth and pass, in both Houses, and \nget signed into law, the kind of relief that does not jeopardize the \nlegitimate use of CRA but, by the same token, does not compromise those \ninstitutions that are doing a good job.\n  I believe my colleagues on the Democratic side would join with us in \nthat effort, but not here, not now, without study and careful \ncraftsmanship.\n  Again, I understand the need to make these reforms.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator very much for his assurances. This \nis a matter of great concern for me. I would very much like to vote for \nthis amendment, but in view of the fact that the President has made it \nvery clear he would veto the bill if it were included, I, \nunfortunately, am going to have to vote against the amendment.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when this debate on the Shelby amendment \nfirst began, my colleague from Alabama quoted the introductory \nstatement made by former chairman William Proxmire when he introduced \nthe CRA legislation. We pointed out at the time that we thought the \nProxmire rationale still supported his original position.\n  I have received a letter from Senator Proxmire and he has asked me to \nread it into the Record. I will do that now.\n\n       Dear Paul: I would appreciate your reading this letter into \n     the Congressional Record at the appropriate time during the \n     debate on the Credit Union bill.\n       I am totally opposed to the Shelby amendment which would \n     exempt small banks from the Community Reinvestment Act and \n     take strong exception to the thrust of his ``Dear Colleague'' \n     letter which quotes my remarks as the author of CRA and the \n     Chairman of the Banking Committee at some length.\n       Throughout my 32 year career in the Senate I championed the \n     cause of the independent small banks of America. In my home \n     state of Wisconsin they represented an important \n     constituency. As Chairman of the Banking Committee from 1975-\n     1980 and 1987-1989 and a member of the Committee from 1957-\n     1989 no one fought harder to protect their interests.\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\n       I count the enactment of CRA as one of the achievements of \n     which I am most proud. I introduced CRA in 1977 because banks \n     receive significant public benefits, such as federal deposit \n     insurance and access to the Federal Reserve Board's discount \n     window. In turn, banks have an obligation to help meet the \n     credit needs of the localities they are chartered to serve. \n     This obligation should apply to all banks, large and small \n     alike, all of whom receive significant public benefits.\n       I regret that the statement I made on the Senate floor in \n     1977 introducing the Community Reinvestment Act is being used \n     to undermine the purpose for which I introduced the \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          William Proxmire, U.S.S.\n                                                 (Retired--D-Wis.)\n\n  That is Senator Proxmire's direct response to the effort to use his \nstatement to, in effect, undermine support for the CRA.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 46 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, very quickly, let me just say to my \ncolleagues that this legislation is not an allocation of credit. Larry \nLindsey has said, and I quote him, former member of the Federal \nReserve:\n\n       Many [institutions] now recognize in an era of growing \n     competition, CRA performance may be critical to an \n     institution's ability to adjust to the new banking \n     environment. CRA-related activities can help to develop new \n     markets, potentially profitable business and improve a bank's \n     public image.\n\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated:\n\n       The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage \n     institutions who are not involved in areas where their own \n     self-interest is involved in doing so. If you are indicating \n     to an institution that there is a foregone business \n     opportunity in an area X or loan product Y, that is not \n     credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market.\n\n  Let's continue to enhance the market by supporting CRA and rejecting \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from Alabama \nhas 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield the remaining time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague from \nAlabama for bringing this amendment because it is a really good, \ncommonsense amendment.\n  I might mention to our colleagues, yesterday we voted to exempt \ncredit unions from the Community Reinvestment Act. Most of us support \nthat amendment. I supported that amendment. I mentioned to somebody \nthat said I am not sure we should do that because banks have to comply, \nand I said we have the Shelby amendment that will at least exempt small \nbanks.\n  Most of my banks in the State of Oklahoma are small banks. They don't \nneed the Federal Government to tell them to invest in their community--\nthey do it anyway. If you have a meeting with your bankers in your \nState, particularly your small bankers, they will tell you the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act is one of the most bureaucratic messes they \ndeal with. They really don't have to have the Federal Government to \ntell them to invest in their own community. So now we are going to say \nwe will exempt credit unions from the CRA, but we will not exempt small \nbanks? That is not fair. That is not equitable.\n  Senator Shelby's amendment would correct that for the small banks. I \ncompliment him for doing it. I think now is the time to do it. We are \ngoing to create greater inequities between credit unions and banks; I \ndon't think that is fair. So Senator Shelby's amendment would at least \nprovide relief for small banks. That is the right thing to do. It is \nthe timely thing to do.\n  The fact that the President says he might veto--if we pass this by an \noverwhelming vote, and if we have the Shelby amendment, it would be \npassed overwhelmingly, it would be adopted by the House, and I think \nthe President would see the wisdom of signing the bill as amended with \nthe Shelby amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I understand my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, has yielded back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). All time has expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Shelby amendment.

Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3339) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1151, the \nCredit Union Membership Access Act. I do so because I believe that the \nlegislation is necessary to preserve membership opportunities in these \nfinancial cooperatives. Given the Supreme Court ruling limiting \nmembership, it is both appropriate and necessary for Congress to pass \nthis legislation to ensure that the requirements for membership in a \nspecific credit union reflect current practices.\n  As my colleagues know, since 1982, credit unions have been able to \ntake in new groups of members outside their original common bond \nprovided that the additional groups brought in shared a common bond. \nNot only was this done for safety and soundness concerns, but it also \nhas helped individuals maintain their credit union ties through base \nclosings and other employment changes.\n  The bill before us today guarantees that no existing member will be \nforced to give up his or her ties to their current credit union as a \nresult of the Supreme Court decision. It also allows credit unions to \ncontinue to attract new members who are part of an existing membership \ngroup as well as new groups provided that the new group has a common \nbond of occupation or association and has less than 3,000 members at \nthe time they join the credit union. This effectively covers 98% of all \nbusinesses in America.\n  I for one have never quarreled with the need for credit unions to \ncontinue to attract new members. But with new opportunities come new \nresponsibilities. If credit unions are to have all the rights of a for-\nprofit financial institution, equity requires that they share in their \nresponsibilities. For this reason, I voted to keep the community \nreinvestment responsibilities in the bill and I also voted to further \nlimit commercial lending activities of credit unions, hoping thereby to \nkeep them to their original focus of consumer lending. In my view, the \ncontinuation of their tax-exempt status is threatened by efforts to \nhave credit unions undertake all the rights of a for-profit financial \ninstitution.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want credit union members in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia to know that I am a strong supporter of their \ninstitutions and their rights of membership. As a credit union member \nmyself, I will continue to preserve membership opportunities in these \nimportant institutions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe Community Reinvestment Act or ``CRA'' as it is commonly known. The \nCRA requires banks to extend loans and credit to low- and moderate-\nincome Americans who reside in low-income areas.\n  Obviously, as we can tell by the tone of the debate in the Senate \ntoday, there are strong feelings about whether it's a good idea for the \nFederal Government to require that credit be extended to people of \nmodest means since these people may not be good credit risks. I would \nlike to focus on some of the comments of those who support the CRA. \nThey claim that credit should be as widely available as possible. The \nsupporters of the CRA argue that requiring banks to open up credit is \ngood for low- and moderate-income people. It gives these people the \nopportunity to purchase a home, pay for college or better their lives \nin important ways.\n  On last Friday--July 24th--several Senators took to the floor to talk \nabout the value of making credit as widely available as possible. For \ninstance, Senator Kennedy said ``In this period of sustained economic \ngrowth, it is vital that all families have the opportunity to obtain \ncredit in order to buy a home, start a small business or send a child \nto college.'' Senator Kennedy went on to observe that ``There is no \ncapitalism without capital.'' These are strong words in favor of making \ncredit widely available.\n  It will be interesting, Mr. President, to see if the supporters of \nthe CRA take the same position when my bankruptcy reform bill comes to \nthe Senate floor in September. There is a fringe element which opposes \nall bankruptcy reform who wish to derail this legislation, which passed \nthe Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. One part of the effort to \nstop bankruptcy reform involves criticizing banks which send out a lot \nof credit card solicitations. The argument is apparently that the banks \nhave made too many risky loans and that Congress should restrict these \nlending practices. I've heard that bankruptcy reform which doesn't \ninclude such restrictions wouldn't be fair or balanced.\n  Mr. President, I find it interesting that many of those who support \nthe CRA, which requires banks to make risky loans to low-income \nAmericans, are also arguing that we should punish banks for issuing \ncredit cards to low- and moderate-income Americans. It seems to me that \nthe opponents of bankruptcy reform can't have it both ways. It's \ntotally inconsistent to push\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nbanks to make risky loans to poorer Americans, as the CRA would have \nit, but then to oppose bankruptcy reform because banks have issued too \nmany loans to poorer Americans.\n  I wanted to point out this striking contradiction today, Mr. \nPresident, while we're considering lending practices and the CRA and \nwhile the memory of the debate is fresh in our minds. I will return to \nthis topic later, when the bankruptcy bill is on the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Credit Union \nMembership Access Act of 1998. This legislation will clearly define who \nis eligible to join a credit union. It will also provide important \nsafeguards and reforms to keep our credit unions strong and to protect \nour constituents who use credit unions.\n  One of my priorities for Maryland is to maintain Maryland's robust \neconomy. Credit unions offer an important alternative to consumers in \nthe financial services market. Keeping financial services competitive \nand keeping fees down will help to keep Maryland's economy strong.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is finally taking up this legislation \nalmost four months after it was passed overwhelmingly by the House. I \nam pleased because I know how important credit unions are for Maryland \nand the Nation. In fact, I helped to start a credit union at a church \nin Baltimore.\n  Credit unions are important because they provide good value and good \nservice in a community setting. A setting where the person behind the \ncounter knows your name not just your account number. In the current \nera of mega-mergers in the financial services industry, credit unions \nare needed more than ever.\n  Credit unions are a part of our communities. I have heard from many \nof my constituents in Maryland about this legislation. They have \nwritten letters, sent e-mail, and visited my office, all to express \ntheir support for their credit unions. I have heard from Marylanders \nwho are members of credit unions from the Allegany County Teachers \nCredit Union in LaVale to the Douglas Memorial Credit Union in \nBaltimore to the Choptank Electric Cooperative Credit Union in Denton. \nThey love their credit unions because they know their credit unions \ndeliver.\n  I have also heard from members of the Maryland banking community \nabout their concerns with this legislation. Although I can appreciate \ntheir reservations, I believe many of their concerns are addressed in \nthis compromise legislation. However, on one significant point I \ndisagree with them. Credit unions should not pay taxes because credit \nunions are non-profits. The credit union slogan is ``not for profit, \nnot for charity, but for service.'' I applaud that slogan and I stand \nwith the credit unions today.\n  There are several provisions in this legislation that I feel deserve \nto be noted. Not only will this legislation allow small groups that \nshare a common bond to join credit unions, but this legislation will \nimprove credit unions by strengthening regulations to ensure safety and \nsoundness of credit unions and to strengthen the credit union deposit \ninsurance fund.\n  I also want to praise the ``common sense'' reforms that are included \nin this legislation, such as the use of Generally Accepted Accounting \nPrinciples in credit union reports filed with the National Credit Union \nAdministration, Independent Audits of Credit Unions with more than $500 \nmillion in assets, and restrictions on the compensation packages of \nsenior managers in credit unions that convert to for-profit banks.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to send my thanks to the 1.6 million \ncredit union members in Maryland. I am proud of them and the work they \ndo every day. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to support \ntheir local credit unions.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a point that was \nraised on the floor yesterday concerning an unfortunate event that \noccurred in my home State of Rhode Island almost a decade ago: the \nfailure of the Rhode Island Share Deposit Insurance Corporation \n(RISDIC). Some Senators have suggested that the failure of RISDIC was \ntriggered by credit unions getting overly involved in business lending. \nThat is not entirely accurate.\n  The credit unions did not trigger the RISDIC crisis. Instead, the \ncollapse of the system can be traced to a substantial embezzlement from \nthe Heritage Loan and Investment Corporation, a type of state-chartered \nbank. In fact, of all the credit unions that were closed in Rhode \nIsland during that crisis, none was federally insured and none was \neither supervised or examined by federal regulators. Indeed, during \nthat entire period of the so-called credit union crisis, those credit \nunions that were chartered, insured, supervised, and regulated by the \nfederal government continued to perform flawlessly, despite the \ndisastrous economic turmoil around them.\n  So I just want to say again that the RISDIC crisis was not caused by \ncredit unions. Rather, the credit unions were the unfortunate victims \nof a crisis brought about by embezzlement from a bank.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of H.R. 1151. \nCredit unions have been, and remain, a vital component of our national \nbanking system. At a time when credit unions serve more than 74 million \npeople nationally, any initiative that would impede the ability of \ncredit unions to provide services to their members, would seriously \nundermine the financial well-being of the public, and the fortitude of \nour financial industry. That is why today's action is so important to \nthe future of the credit union industry.\n  Despite the claims by opponents of credit unions that state \notherwise, credit unions are nonprofit entities that provide much \nneeded opportunities for hard-working people. To millions of Americans, \nthe low-interest loans that credit unions offer represent the \nopportunity to buy their first home, the chance to purchase a much \nneeded automobile, the ability to send their children to college, or \nachieving the dream of starting their own business. For example, in my \nhome State of New Jersey, there are over 315 credit unions that serve \nmore than 1.1 million people.\n  Passage of this credit union legislation demonstrates a commitment by \nthe U.S. Senate to millions of hard-working American families. \nSupporting credit unions means bolstering our economy and providing \nmore financial opportunities to save and invest soundly.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support credit unions by \nvoting in favor of H.R. 1151.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to state my strong support for the \nSenate version of H.R. 1151. This legislation is important, bipartisan \nand should be adopted unanimously by my Senate colleagues. I commend \nthe members of the Banking Committee, where I served for four years, \nfor crafting this legislation and moving it to the floor for full \nSenate consideration.\n  I will vote for the Credit Union Membership Access Act. It is the \nright thing to do and the Senate is overdue in taking this action. This \nlegislation clarifies credit union membership in a manner that protects \nconsumers and the competitive financial services industry. In the \nSenate bill, existing credit union members are grand-fathered into \ntheir current credit unions and new common bond criteria are \nestablished for future growth in the credit union industry.\n  Mr. President, the credit union legislation is widely supported by \nconsumer rights organizations including the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica and the American Association of Retired Persons. Other key \nsupporters of this legislation include the National Farmers Union, the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the Fraternal Order of Police and the American \nSmall Business Association. Perhaps most noteworthy to me is the strong \nsupport of my constituents for this legislation. Thousands and \nthousands of credit union members have contacted me, hundreds have \nvisited my office with personal credit union anecdotes, and numerous \nothers have approached me on my travels through Washington state. This \nissue has resonated with my constituents who value and want to preserve \nand protect credit unions and the services they provide.\n  Importantly, with the August recess approaching and the 105th \nCongress soon to adjourn, we still have time to get this legislation to \nPresident Clinton for his signature. That must be the\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nSenate's objective today; to get this legislation to President Clinton \nso that we may address the field of membership situation created by \nlast February's Supreme Court decision.\n  The Senate did make a number of important changes to the House passed \nbill. For example, the Senate version of credit union legislation \nincludes new provisions to protect the soundness of credit unions, new \ncapital standards and prompt corrective action for undercapitalized \ninstitutions, limitations on commercial lending, new accounting and \nauditing procedures, and community reinvestment requirements.\n  While I support the Senate Banking Committee's efforts to improve the \nHouse adopted bill, the field of membership issue is really what this \nbill is all about. The Senate should not lose sight of this objective \nand certainly, the Senate should not let additional issues imperil this \nbill. Therefore, I will vote against the amendments to this bill; some \nof which have been described as killer amendments, and others that will \ncomplicate final passage of this bill.\n  I urge prompt passage of the credit union legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of the credit union \nindustry, I rise to express my support for H.R. 1151, the Credit Union \nMembership Access Act, on which the Senate will vote today.\n  As my colleagues are aware, this bill was overwhelmingly passed in \nthe House of Representatives by a vote of 411-8. I anticipate that the \nsupport for this bill in the Senate will reflect that of the House of \nRepresentatives, and will again pass with a notable bipartisan \nmajority.\n  Mr. President, this issue came to the forefront when the Supreme \nCourt agreed to hear the Credit Union's arguments for increasing the \nsize of their base membership. While I understand the objections which \nthe banks raised regarding the growth of credit unions, I have always \nbelieved that consumers should have the broadest range of choices in \nfinancial services.\n  I support the Credit Union Membership Access Act because I believe \nthat members on both sides of the aisle have worked hard to ensure that \nthis bill is fair and balanced and protects both the rights and \nsecurities of consumers.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \noffer my congratulations to Chairman D'Amato and Democratic Ranking \nMember Sarbanes for their fine work on the Credit Union Membership \nAccess Act and for successfully completing this work on this important \nbill today. Working families in the United States, whether they live in \nurban or rural areas, deserve access to fairly priced credit and other \nfinancial services.\n  Credit unions have historically served as a way for people of average \nmeans, without easy access to affordable credit, to pool their savings \nto make credit available to themselves and their fellow credit union \nmembers at competitive interest rates. In 1934, the Federal Credit \nUnion Act created the federal credit union charter. Today in \nMassachusetts, there are 317 Credit Unions serving approximately 1.7 \nmillion people.\n  Since 1934, credit unions have been helping both individuals and \nworking families. They have helped launch and sustain small businesses. \nSome of them have played an important role in the development and \nrevitalization of economically distressed communities.\n  Historic mergers, consolidations and acquisitions have taken place in \nthe financial service industry in recent years. Consumers have less \nchoice, not more. Simultaneously, the Supreme Court earlier this year \ndecided a case pertaining to how widely credit unions may reach for \nmembership. These factors have created a necessity for the Congress to \nconsider carefully the role credit unions should play in the mix of \nfinancial institutions in our nation.\n  Federal credit unions have traditionally had ``fields of membership'' \ndefined by ``common bond'' of association, occupation or geographic \nlocation. In 1982, the National Credit Union Administration developed \nregulations that allowed credit unions to be composed of multiple \nunrelated employer groups, each having its own distinct common bond of \noccupation. In February, the Supreme Court ruled that this NCUA \nregulation interpreted the law so broadly that it would be permissible \nto grant a charter to a conglomerate credit union whose members would \ninclude employees of every company in the United States. Without the \npassage of the Credit Union Membership Access Act, some credit unions \ncould be forced to expel current members not affiliated with the \noriginal occupation group.\n  I believe that the members of all current multiple-group credit \nunions should be allowed to continue in the credit unions they have \nchosen. It is vital to maintain the current credit union model as a key \npiece of the financial services system and credit unions must be \npermitted to prospect for members sufficiently to maintain their \nviability. Dislocating approximately 10 million credit union members \nnot affiliated with their credit union's original occupation group \ncould potentially have serious effects on the safety and soundness of \ncredit unions in Massachusetts, and across the nation.\n  This legislation establishes that separate groups having their own \ncommon bond of occupation or association that have less than 3,000 \nmembers are eligible to join an existing credit union. It assures that \n10 million Americans have continued access to their credit union. It \nwill allow another 25 million the right to join a credit union as a \nresult of their employment within a certain company or organization. \nFinally, this act will help insure that 62 million Americans who own, \noperate or are employed by a small business will not be limited in \ntheir choice of financial institutions in the future.\n  The purpose of credit unions--and for the tax exemption they \nreceive--is to facilitate loans and other services to low-income \ncommunities, individuals, and very small businesses. They were never \nintended to be simply alternative, tax-exempt commercial banks.\n  I have heard from a number of community banks in Massachusetts that \nbelieve credit unions which offer business loans have a substantial \nadvantage over banks because of their tax exemption. Most credit unions \nare not involved in business lending and most of those who are focus on \nassisting very small businesses. However, some community banks believe \nthat a small minority of credit unions that are involved in business \nlending has taken advantage of the current rules and expanded their \nproduct lines to the point that they are banks in all but name.\n  I am also concerned about the lack of available information on the \ndetails of credit union business lending. The National Credit Union \nAdministration does not have accurate information on the size or types \nof business loans made by credit unions.\n  That is why I successfully included in this legislation an amendment \nrequiring the Department of Treasury to study the issue of credit union \nbusiness lending. This study would include an overall examination of \ncredit union member business lending including the amount of business \nlending more than $500,000 and less than $50,000, and a breakdown of \nwhat types of businesses and the size of businesses that receive loans. \nIt would determine how much credit union business lending goes to low- \nand moderate-income areas and the extent to which credit union member \nbusiness lending meets the financial services needs low- and moderate-\nincome individuals. Finally, it would determine whether credit unions \nwhich engage in member business lending have an advantage over \ncommunity banks and if those advantages affect the survival and \nprofitability of community banks. I am grateful to Chairman D'Amato and \nDemocratic Ranking Member Sarbanes for including this study in the \ncredit union legislation.\n  I remain concerned as to how this legislation will affect the smaller \ncommunity banks in Massachusetts and across the nation. That is why I \nworked to include in this legislation a study on legislative and \nadministrative action to reduce and simplify the tax burden for \ncommunity banks with less than one billion dollars in assets.\n  I strongly support the requirement that credit unions must hold seven \npercent of net worth in retained earnings to be considered well-\ncapitalized. If a credit union is critically undercapitalized, this \nlegislation allows the NCUA to appoint a conservator or liquidating \nagent to take action to avoid losses to\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nthe National Credit Share Insurance Fund. This will limit the use of \ntaxpayer funds to assist insolvent credit unions, and insure the credit \nunion system remains safe and sound. In addition, I heartily endorse \nthe section of this legislation that requires prompt corrective action \nfor credit unions facing financial difficulty.\n  I am disappointed that the provision to require the NCUA to evaluate \nannually the record of credit unions in meeting the credit needs of \ntheir local communities and low- and moderate-income individuals was \ntaken out of the bill. I believe that this provision would have \nassisted credit unions in refocusing their energies toward those who \nneed access to financial services the most. These are the people who \ncredit unions were designed to serve.\n  While not perfect, this legislation will ensure that credit unions \ncontinue to offer needed financial services to underserved, low- and \nmoderate-income working families. This is a worthwhile compromise that \nI believe is basically fair to both credit unions and banks, as well as \ntheir customers. I will join my colleagues in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is a special class of credit unions--known as \ncommunity development credit unions--that bear special mention. \nCommunity development credit unions serve consumers, neighborhoods, and \nrural areas that are predominantly low-income. Because of their special \nmission and circumstances, some community development credit unions may \nhave difficulty in generating capital.\n  On the deposit side, community development credit unions have high \noperating costs because they serve an extremely labor-intensive market \nof very low-balance depositors. The average depositor in a community \ndevelopment credit union has $1,462, which is one-third the $4,300 of \nthe average depositor in non-low-income credit unions. Typically, as \nmuch as 40 percent to 60 percent of the community development credit \nunions' membership base consists of persons with less than $200 on \ndeposit. Moreover, many of community development credit unions' very-\nlow-balance depositors use the credit union solely for transactions--\nthat is, they deposit checks and immediately withdraw virtually the \nentire balance.\n  On the lending side, community development credit union's business \nconsists primarily of making small loans to borrowers with imperfect \ncredit. The average loan balance per member at a community development \ncredit union is $1,190 compared to $3,200 at all credit unions. Thus, \ncommunity development credit union loans tend to have more credit risk \nand higher transaction costs (i.e., noninterest costs per dollar \nloaned) than loans made by other credit unions, thereby resulting in \nlower net returns. These lower net returns mean relatively lower income \nfor the community development credit union, which makes capital \naccumulation more difficult.\n  The challenges community development credit unions face from credit \nrisk and low returns are exacerbated because communities served by \ncommunity development credit unions are especially vulnerable to \neconomic downturns. Unemployment rates in such communities are \ntypically two or three times the national average. Unemployment in low-\nincome communities is slow to decline as the economy improves, and \nquick to worsen when the economy deteriorates.\n  Despite these challenges, most community development credit unions \ntoday are quite strong and have capital ratios similar to those of \nother credit unions. And the changes brought about by new capital \nrequirements and prompt corrective action will ultimately strengthen \nall community development credit unions.\n  Does the Senator agree that this is a fair description of the \nchallenges facing community development credit unions?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes. I think that the Senator has set forth a good \nanalysis of the challenges community development credit unions face.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The bill gives all credit unions two years before these \nprovisions become effective. Because of their mission and the special \ncharacteristics that arise from that mission, some community \ndevelopment credit unions may have unique difficulties in becoming and \nremaining adequately capitalized. Accordingly, some community \ndevelopment credit unions may need more time than most other credit \nunions to build capital in order to comply with the legislation's new \ncapital standards and prompt corrective action provisions. Does the \nSenator agree?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, it is possible that some community development \ncredit unions may require added time to increase their capital.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So, the question arises: How may the NCUA deal with \nthis issue while implementing the bill's safety and soundness \nprovisions?\n  In my view, the NCUA should be mindful of community development \ncredit unions' unique circumstances in applying the bill's prompt \ncorrective action provisions. In addition, community development credit \nunions that demonstrate that they can build their capital over time to \nthe required levels--as evidenced by an acceptable net worth \nrestoration plan--should be given the full opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator is correct. Community development credit \nunions must meet the bill's capital requirements like any other credit \nunion. At the same time, there is a transition period, and the bill's \nprompt corrective action provisions give the NCUA sufficient \nflexibility to work with undercapitalized community development credit \nunions that have an acceptable plan for meeting the bill's capital \nrequirements.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to make a few closing remarks on a \njob we are close to finishing--to preserve and protect the right of all \nAmericans to join a credit union, now and into the future, and ensure \nthat none of the 73 million Americans who are now members of credit \nunions have their membership status threatened in any way.\n\n\n                 credit unions work for the little guy\n\n  People love their credit unions and why? Because credit unions take \ncare of the little guy. This Senator is committed to not let these \npeople down. We must pass this legislation and have it enacted to \npreserve the right of Americans to be members of a credit union.\n\n\n  credit unions invest in people and communities when others will not\n\n  For decades, the American dream has been made a reality by credit \nunions. These cooperatives have reached out to individuals, \nassociations and communities that have had the door slammed in their \nfaces by other institutions. Tens of millions of hard working people \nhave improved their quality of life and passed the benefits along to \ntheir families, but all of that could change if we don't act.\n\n\n credit unions provide basic financial services without excessive fees\n\n  Mr. President, I know this is a very personal issue, a pocketbook \nissue, for the over 70 million current members. For example, many \npeople may not be aware that--\n  Credit unions have had the highest customer service and satisfaction \nranking of any depository institution for the past 14 years.\n  Credit unions offer more services at lower costs than most banks.\n  Credit union competition is a major force keeping bank service fees \nand loan rates lower, and interest on savings higher.\n  Why such amazing support for a financial institution? The answer is \nsimple. Credit unions are for the little guy. Credit unions make a \ndifference.\n\n\n                   credit unions put consumers first\n\n  To their customers, credit unions are far more than just a safe place \nto put away a few dollars for tomorrow. Making a deposit or withdrawal \nis more than just a business transaction.\n  A credit union has an atmosphere that says friendship and family. The \nelected leadership is made up of volunteers who actually listen. \nTellers actually talk to their customers. With service like that, why \nwouldn't customers like going to their credit union? It's all about \nneighbors and fellow employees getting together, working together and \ninvesting together for everyone's benefit. Just ask any credit union \nmember.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that those who support credit unions \nare not anti-bank. After all, many credit union members also have bank \naccounts. And it also deserves comment that--without any cost to the \ntaxpayer--credit unions have weathered the serious economic downturns \nthat\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nhave affected other financial providers. And that's something to be \nproud of.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should follow the House vote of 411 to 8 to \nact to save credit unions based on the principle that competition is \nbeneficial. Without competition, interest rates paid to customers would \nbe lower and loans and ATM fees would be more expensive. Congress \nshould only act in ways that would increase competition between \nfinancial institutions.\n\n\n            credit unions care about hard working Americans\n\n  As a matter of principle, it should also be the responsibility of \nCongress to put the consumer first. We should pass legislation that is \nall about what is best for individuals, small businesses, large \nbusinesses and anyone who needs the services of a financial \ninstitution. And that means no one--no one--should be thrown out of a \ncredit union and then forced to do business with another financial \ninstitution against their will.\n  This Senator intends to make sure that does not happen.\n  Mr. President, hardworking families have a right to choices and \nopportunities. People with savings of less than $1,000--individuals who \nstruggle each week to pay the mortgage, put food on the table, and put \nsomething away for the future--deserve the same financial choices and \nopportunities that other Americans enjoy. Credit unions are good for \nthe consumer and good for the country.\n  Mr. President, credit unions work for working families.\n  Mr. President, again I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand vote to pass H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act as \nour colleagues did in the House with an overwhelming vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendment to be \nproposed, the question is on agreeing to the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \ncommittee amendment, as amended, and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues, not only \nfor the final vote on this important legislation, but for the manner in \nwhich an excellent debate was conducted. I very much appreciate Senator \nLott scheduling this important bill. But a special commendation is in \norder to a number of people, starting with the ranking member, my \nfriend, Senator Sarbanes. I thank him for his steadfast support in \ndeveloping the opportunity for Members to be heard, and for Members to \nhave their concerns listened to, and debated, resulting in final \npassage of the bill, notwithstanding some very contentious issues. I \nbelieve that the credit unions, not only of Maryland but of this \ncountry, have a demonstrated champion in Senator Sarbanes.\n  The fact is that credit unions support the little guy. Historically, \ncredit unions have invested in people and in communities when others \nwould not--yes, when others would not.\n  Credit unions have provided the basic financial services without \nexcessive fees, and they continue to do that. We need them in this day \nof consolidations and megamergers to be out there to service all \ncommunities, especially the small communities and, again, the little \nguy. I don't mean ``little'' in terms of size and stature, because they \nare the hard-working, middle-class Americans who are the backbone of \nthis country. Indeed, they set a standard and they challenge, even when \nothers don't like that challenge.\n  And likewise, there may be unfair burdens on some of the community \nbanks, and we have to deal with that challenge. But you don't do it at \nthe expense of an organization of the thousands and thousands of credit \nunions and the hundreds and hundreds of members who work in these \ncredit unions on a voluntary basis, without pay, and in many cases, \nwithout any compensation. Yes, truly, America can be proud of our \ncredit unions. Credit unions care about hard-working Americans.\n\n  None of this could have been possible without staff because I believe \nthat we have had the best staff that anyone could have, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, working to bring about substantial \nimprovements over the legislation that came from the House--I mean \nsubstantial.\n  For the first time, we set rigorous standards to protect the \ntaxpayers of the United States--that is right--to protect them. For the \nfirst time, we limit--and I think prudently so--commercial lending \nactivities that credit unions can undertake while giving them the \nopportunity to continue doing so and to continue serving their \ncommunities. And again, I believe we applied limits to commercial \nlending in a prudent manner.\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank the hard-working \nstaff, a bipartisan staff. I want to acknowledge Senator Sarbanes' \nstaff--Steve Harris and Marty Gruenberg and Dean Shahinian. And Phil \nBechtel, Madelyn Simmons, Rachel Forward, and our staff director Howard \nMenell, I thank them for their hard work on this bill. They have done a \nunique job in working together, never allowing political differences to \ninterfere with the people's work.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that the House is to be applauded for \nmoving so speedily on their legislation. I hope\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\nthat they will accept the improvements that we have made without the \nnecessity of going to conference. Representatives Kanjorski and \nLaTourette took the lead on this bill in the House. I am hopeful they \nwill view the Senate's well-considered modifications to the original \nbill as positive changes to enhance the safety and soundness of credit \nunions and expedite the enactment of this legislation.\n  I also commend Chairman Leach and the House leadership in sending us \nH.R. 1151 as speedily as they did, because were we not to have gotten \nit in such a timely manner, we could never have completed the \nlegislative changes that we have made part of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank all of my colleagues for their \noutstanding work and for their cooperation, notwithstanding the \ndifferences that may have existed. We passed a good bill for working \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, I express my appreciation \nto the distinguished chairman for his very kind remarks about my \nefforts with respect to this legislation. But I really want to \nunderscore the very skillful leadership which Chairman D'Amato provided \nin helping to move the bill through the committee and then through the \nSenate on the Senate floor.\n  This was not a bill without significant controversy in it. I think \nthe committee worked out a balanced package and preserved most of it on \nthe Senate floor--I regret not all of it. But in any event, I think the \nlegislation we now have passed is a reaffirmation for the credit union \nmovement of their important role in serving consumers.\n  When the cooperative movement was established in the early part of \nthe century, it was premised on the proposition that individuals coming \ntogether, ``small people,'' would gain access to credit; that the \ncredit union movement would remain concerned and dedicated to their \nneeds and would provide them an opportunity to share in the American \neconomy.\n  Credit unions, by and large, have done a good job of that over the \nyears. And this legislation, I think, will enable them to continue to \ndo a good job. It has important safety and soundness provisions in it, \nthe consequence of a very comprehensive and thorough Treasury study on \nthe basis of which the committee was able to incorporate into the \nlegislation some very important safeguards.\n  But I say to the credit union movement: We worked very hard in the \naftermath of the Supreme Court decision which, of course, cast a pall \nover the credit union movement. It really raised very severe questions \nas to what the future of the credit union movement would be. This \nlegislation has answered that question.\n  But I think implicit on the part of the Congress, in answering that \nquestion, is that credit unions will redouble their efforts in terms of \nserving the purposes for which they were established.\n  Some have criticized the credit union movement. They say they are \ngetting away from those purposes. I am frank to say I do not think that \nis generally true of the credit union movement. I think you can point \nto isolated exceptions. And I only raise the warning flag that to the \nextent those exist, they tarnish the image of the credit union movement \nin the eyes of many.\n  So with this legislation, which has given them a path to move \nforward, a firm and secure path to move forward, I look forward to the \ncredit union movement reaffirming its basic and original purposes and \nlook forward to continuing to try to work closely with them in \nachieving those objectives.\n  I, too, like the chairman, express my very deep appreciation to the \nstaff on both sides, to Howard Menell and Phil Bechtel and Rachel \nForward and Madelyn Simmons on the Republican side--we depend very \nheavily on our staff; they are extremely competent and dedicated; they \nwere in here many nights, late into morning hours in order to help put \nthis legislation together--and Steve Harris and Marty Gruenberg and \nDean Shahinian and Mike Beresik on our side of the aisle.\n  We were able to work together in a cooperative and positive and \nconstructive manner on this legislation. I always look forward to those \nopportunities with the chairman. It is not always possible. Usually \nwhen it is not possible, we set up a separate committee to deal with \nthe issues and work within our own committee.\n  I close, again, by commending the chairman for a very skillful job in \nhelping to move this legislation through the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed--I tell \nmy colleagues I will be very brief--as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9089-6", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9098-S9099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO JOHN GIBSON AND JACOB CHESTNUT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, much has been said on the Senate and the \nHouse floor about John Gibson and Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut, two police \nofficers on the Capitol Police Force. And much more will be said. I add \nmy words of praise and appreciation to both of them.\n  I knew both these police officers. Officer Chestnut--J.J.--would see \nus come through the Senate at several different times, and he would \ntell me a member of my family has already gone through because he had \nseen them, or conversely, if they came through he would tell them where \nI was.\n  Detective Gibson traveled with many of us at different occasions. He \neven came to one, I believe, with the ``Singing Senators'' from the \nother side of the aisle. He was the man who at events where Senators \nwould gather, would be there because he would recognize not only the \nSenators, but their spouses; would wave them on through, would greet \nthem, would make them know they were among friends. We always knew we \nwere.\n  Mr. President, I have been a Senator now for nearly 24 years. I walk \ninto this building every day that we are in session, many when we are \nnot. I have gotten to know many of the police officers, and so many \nothers, the hundreds of people that make this body run, make this \nCapitol run.\n  This truly is a death in the family.\n  Even if I had not known the officers as I did, I would feel that way. \nBut knowing them in some ways makes it even sadder, more poignant, more \ndifficult.\n  I love the Senate and I love the symbol of democracy that our Capitol \nholds to the public. To see this terrible, terrible thing happen in \nsomething that means so much to all of us, it is almost impossible to \ndescribe my feelings.\n  My wife and I had flown to Vermont last Friday. We got to my office \nin Burlington and were there only a matter of minutes and heard the \nnews. Much of the rest of the evening was a blur, just sitting in our \nfarmhouse watching the news and not believing it.\n  Probably the greatest tribute to two brave police officers was the \nfact that this Capitol, this symbol of democracy not only to our own \nNation of a quarter of a billion people but to the rest of the world, \nthis Capitol was open almost immediately thereafter.\n  There is no way we could bring these officers back. It is a tragedy \nthat will be felt by their spouses and their children, in one case, \ngrandchildren, for the rest of their lives. No matter what we do as \nMembers of the Senate or the House, we cannot bring them back to their \nfamilies. We can only offer our profound sympathy to their families. It \nis a sympathy that is felt deeply by every single Member of the \nCongress, Republican or Democrat. It makes no difference whether they \nhave been here a long time or a short time. Our hearts go out as human \nbeings to the families of these officers.\n  What we have done in immediately reopening the Capitol, in saying to \nthe public today they can walk in here at any time as they do in the \ngalleries today, we are saying to those officers that your deaths were \nnot in vain. Think, Mr. President, what a different country this would \nbe if somehow this Capitol, this symbol of democracy, was closed down. \nThink what it would be like if the public, not only Americans but those \nvisiting from around the world, think what it would be like if\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nthey could not come into this Capitol, as I did when I was a law \nstudent here in Washington or when I first came here with my parents as \na teenager. If we could not be here, the public could not come in and \nsee us debate great matters and tiny matters, they could not see that.\n  Mr. President, at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, I \nremember so many who came here and met with all of us and asked, ``How \ndoes your democracy work,'' and they told me--I heard this over and \nover again--that they would see the picture of our Capitol when they \ncame to Washington, that was the thing they recognized before anything \nelse. They said they saw it sitting up here.\n  I have been coming to this Capitol Building as a Senator for 24 \nyears. I feel a thrill every time I come up here. I hope I always will \nbecause I know it represents democracy. These two brave officers, just \nlike the hundreds of other men and women who guard these Halls, they \nkeep it open. Let's hope they always will. Let us hope that we always \nhave the courage to do that. Then the lives that every one of us would \npray we could bring to the family, those lives would not be lost in \nvain.\n  Like some others in this body, I had the privilege to serve in law \nenforcement for years before coming here. I know how all of us felt in \nlaw enforcement at that time if one of our own was cut down. I think if \nyou have not served in law enforcement it is almost impossible to \nexplain to the American public how other law enforcement officials feel \nwhen they lose one of their own. I know how the men and women in the \npolice force here on Capitol Hill feel, but also how they feel all over \nthe Nation. This is a loss. This is a family, a fraternity, a sorority. \nIt is something that binds all law enforcement people together.\n  I am joined with every single person who works on Capitol Hill in an \nexpression of appreciation to them and to everybody who responded--all \nthe police officers responded, medical personnel responded. I will take \njust 1 minute more to express my personal appreciation to Senator Bill \nFrist for what he did. I spoke with Senator Frist yesterday and told \nhim how much his actions meant to me, to my wife, who is a registered \nnurse. She knows when something like this happens, if you are a medical \npersonnel, you respond. But he responded not only with his great skill \nas a cardiac surgeon, he responded when there was gunfire erupting only \nmoments before and there might have been more, with no thought to his \nsafety, but thinking of only those who may have been injured.\n  Mr. President, it is a sad day. Let us say also it is a proud day to \nour country because this symbol of democracy will not be closed down by \nthe actions of one deranged American, any more than it was in the 1980s \nwhen the bomb went off outside this Chamber at night just minutes after \nwe recessed. I remember so well the next morning, every single one of \nus was in our seats. We were here to show we wouldn't stay home. And we \nwill be here today, as will the President and the Vice President, all \nof the House and Senate leadership, and the Members, to show nothing \ncloses us down.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9098-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 4250\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. 2312, the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2312) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to lay before the Senate \nthe committee recommendation for the Treasury Department, the Postal \nService, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent \nagencies. The bill crafted by the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal \nService, and General Government contains a total of $29,923,547,000 in \nnew budget authority.\n  Of that amount, $13,613,547,000 is in mandatory accounts, and \n$3,250,000,000 is provided for much-needed funding for all Federal \nagencies to address the year 2000, or Y2K, computer problem, contingent \nupon an emergency designation by the administration.\n  The committee recommendation is within the 302(b) allocations and \nstrikes a delicate balance between congressional priorities, \nadministrative initiatives, and agency needs. This would not have been \npossible without the hard work and cooperation from my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kohl, the subcommittee ranking member, and his \nstaff. It was not easy to strike this balance while staying within our \nmutually agreed-upon fiscal constraints. As most of our colleagues are \naware, approximately 80 percent of the accounts in this bill are for \nsalaries and expenses, meeting those needs, and increasing our \nflexibility to fund new initiatives and congressional priorities.\n  The committee recommends a funding of $11,555,000,137 for title I for \nthe Department of Treasury. This is $176.653 million more than the \nfiscal year 1998 enacted level. The committee has again placed a \npriority on promoting the Treasury's law enforcement, ensuring that \nthey can hire, train, and retrain the best of Federal law enforcement, \nwhile at the same time support efforts by State and local law \nenforcement.\n  There are some provisions of title I that I would like to highlight \nfor colleagues. This bill includes $132 million for law enforcement \ninitiatives through the violent crime reduction trust fund, known as \nthe VCRTF; continuation and expansion of the Gang Resistance Education \nAnd Training Program, called the GREAT Program--to help our young \npeople develop the skills to stay out of trouble; $27 million to \ncontinue and expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative--to \nallow Federal, State, and local law enforcement to stem the tide of \nillegal firearms trafficking to the youth of this country. It includes \ndoubling a staff level for the Customs Service antichild pornography \nefforts; full funding for Southwest border technology enhancements and \nstaffing; additional funding for the IRS for much-needed customer \nservice initiatives.\n  In title II, the committee recommends an appropriation of $71.195 \nmillion for the U.S. Postal Service. Under the provisions of this bill, \nthe Postal Service is required to provide free mailing for overseas \nvoters and the blind, maintain 6-day delivery and rural delivery, as \nwell as prohibited from consolidating or closing small and rural post \noffices.\n  Title III is the Executive Office of the President and funds \nappropriated to the President. The total recommendation for title III \nis $3,838,441,000. This includes the White House Office, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Office of the National Drug Control Policy, \nthe Federal drug control programs, and funding for the National \nAntidrug Media Campaign.\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\nAlso included is the information technology system and related expenses \naccount to deal with the year 2000 problems.\n  Of special note are: $13 million for the continuation of the \ntechnology transfer program under the drug czar's office--to allow \nState and local law enforcement to benefit from research and \ndevelopment; $175 million to continue the National Antidrug Media \nCampaign; continued funding for high-intensity drug trafficking areas, \nknown as HIDTAs.\n  Title IV is independent agencies such as the Federal Election \nCommission, General Services Administration, and the National Archives, \nin addition to agencies involved in Federal employment, such as the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, \nthe Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Office of Special Counsel. The committee recommends \n$14,458,969,000 for this title.\n  Of particular interest to many of our colleagues is the funding level \nfor the General Services Administration, which includes $500 million \nfor new courthouse construction.\n  In order to stay within the 302(b) allocations, we were forced to \nmake many difficult decisions regarding outlays. Although I know this \nis not unique to the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, our \noutlays allocations forced us to make difficult choices, which we would \nnot have otherwise made.\n  This bill deserves the support of the Senate. I believe I can \nhonestly say that although not everybody got what they wanted, we did \nour best to accommodate all of our colleagues' requests. I must remind \nmy colleagues that if you are considering any additional spending in \nthis bill, it must be offset.\n  Finally, none of this would have been possible without the work and \nsupport of Senator Kohl. I particularly thank Barbara Retzlaff of his \nstaff, who consistently brings her knowledge and expertise to this \nbill, and also our own staff, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin and Lula \nEdwards, who have worked so hard and so many evenings on this bill.\n  At this time, I yield the floor to my friend, Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, before I get started, I express my deep \nsympathy to the families of Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut. I \nalso want to express my thanks to these brave heroes and to all the \nother law enforcement officers here in the Capitol and all over our \ngreat country who put their lives on the line every day to keep the \nrest of us safe. The two fallen officers are true heroes. They died \nprotecting the Nation's most precious symbol of democracy and \nprotecting the people who work here and who visit here. I hope their \nfamilies take some comfort in the deep respect, gratitude, and pride \nall of us here feel for their acts of bravery.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Campbell for his dedication to \nresolving many issues, large and small, on this Treasury and General \nGovernment appropriations bill.\n  Throughout this process, he has forged a cooperative relationship not \nonly with me, but with all of the subcommittee members. Throughout his \ncooperative approach, we were able to work out a reasonable balance \namong the many programs and activities under the jurisdiction of this \nsubcommittee. In addition, I want to acknowledge the very fine work of \nthe chairman's staff, including Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula \nEdwards.\n  As Senator Campbell mentioned, the Treasury and General Government \nappropriations bill continues and expands many investments in our \nfuture. Just for example, the Internal Revenue Service funding level is \nof critical importance. By passing the IRS restructuring legislation, \nCongress sent a clear message to the public and to the IRS that it is \ntime for the IRS to provide American taxpayers with the kind of service \nthey have a right to expect. In response, IRS is undertaking its most \nprofound restructuring in more than 40 years. From business practices \nto organizational structure, the IRS of the future will act differently \nthan the agency we know today.\n  This appropriations bill provides the IRS over $7.8 billion to \ncontinue basic operations while initiating these changes. These funds \nwill launch the new customer service initiatives, the submission and \nprocessing of investments, and the compliance research systems \nrequested by the administration. The funding level will let the IRS \nrevamp its business practices so IRS staff can focus on understanding, \nsolving, and preventing taxpayer problems.\n  To effectively update the Federal Government's computer system for \nthe century date change, the committee added $3.2 billion to the \nTreasury and General Government appropriations bill. This work must be \ncompleted in the next 12 months, so money must reach all Federal \nagencies quickly. By including this emergency funding, the committee \nprovides the Federal Government with the tools it needs to ensure that \ncritical Government functions continue smoothly.\n  Law enforcement activities are another important part of this bill, \nand the committee has provided over $3 billion to continue and expand \nthese programs. Included in this funding level is full funding for the \nGREAT Program, which provides local police departments the resources \nnecessary to help children avoid the temptation of gangs or drugs; the \nYouth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, which traces illegal guns and \nestablishes State and local links necessary to end gun trafficking and \nyouth and gang-related violence; and the Customs' Child Pornography and \nCyber Smuggling Program, which prevents illegal trafficking and \ndistribution of child pornography both into and throughout the United \nStates.\n  The Office of National Drug Control Policy's media campaign receives \ncontinued funding of $175 million in this bill. This is the second year \nof a 5-year program aimed at changing attitudes towards drugs. The \ncommittee hopes to see dramatic results from this investment--an \ninvestment that is four times greater than the funding provided for \nGREAT, Youth Gun Crime, and Child Pornography Prevention Programs \ncombined.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the Federal Election Commission. This \nbill provides the FEC with $33.7 million. This is $2.8 million less \nthan the funding provided by the House, and I hope we will bring the \nfunding level up to the House figure. The need for this funding is \nclear. In congressional testimony earlier this year, FEC officials said \nthey were forced to drop more than 100 cases because they did not have \nenough people to handle the caseload.\n  As you all know, Congress has not been able to agree on campaign \nfinance reforms. But we all agree that the current law must be \nenforced. And that cannot happen without a fully funded FEC.\n  In an era of explosive spending on campaigns through innumerable \navenues, both legal and illegal, we owe it to the American people to \nfully fund the only campaign watchdog we have.\n  Finally, we have tried to accommodate numerous requests for funds \nwhile remaining within the funding restrictions imposed by the \nsubcommittee allocation. Although we are required to make substantial \nreductions in the President's request level, I believe that \nprogrammatic funding levels included in this bill are fiscally \nresponsible and very reasonable.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing individuals have floor privileges for the duration of the \nconsideration of S. 2312, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General \nGovernment appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999: Ms. Tammy Perrin \nand Ms. Lula Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I send the first amendment to the \ndesk, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senator \nLeahy, whom I found to be very poignant and very moving in his tribute \nto the two slain officers.\n  Today, Mr. President, is sad day indeed for the congressional family, \nbecause in just 30 minutes--in fact, a little less than that--we will \nall participate in a memorial for Detective John Gibson and Officer \n``J.J.'' Jacob Joseph Chestnut, who gave their lives in the line of \nduty this past Friday.\n  In fact, the Capitol Police patch which I wear today in memory and \nhonor was given to me by Detective\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nGibson just a few weeks ago. As late as 2 weeks ago, he was kind enough \nto come out all the way to Dulles Airport when I had a delayed flight \nand get me here on time for a vote on Monday night.\n  I was a military policeman, Mr. President, and a deputy sheriff in my \nyounger days. Like most former law enforcement officers, like Senator \nLeahy was, perhaps the death of these two wonderful men touched us in a \nvery special way, because for law enforcement people, when a law \nenforcement officer is killed, it is not like losing a stranger or a \ncolleague, it is like losing a brother or a sister.\n  But our system of democracy mandates that our citizens, who own this \nbuilding, have a right to enter it at any time. I think that is the way \nit should be. Most of us want to keep it that way, as Senator Kohl has \nalluded to.\n  Today, however, we debate the Treasury, Postal, and General \nGovernment appropriations bill. This bill, above any bill with which we \nhave wrestled, determines the use of and restrictions on firearms. The \nframers of the Constitution, I believe, could never have foreseen the \nnuances that have come into play in modern America when we discuss our \nsecond amendment rights.\n  Mr. President, in this very saddened atmosphere in which we bring our \nbill to the floor, I suppose some of our colleagues may be tempted in \nthe heat of the time to load this bill down with gun amendments. I, \nfrankly, hope that does not happen. It may be the right issue. It may \nbe the right place to talk about them. But this is not the right time. \nTo use this bill as a vehicle for any rush to judgment with those \namendments, or to use it as an anti-second amendment platform, I think \nwould be inappropriate and unwise.\n  No one is more saddened at the loss of our two officer heroes than I \nam. But I would like to tell my colleagues who are watching these \nproceedings in their offices now that I intend to move to table any gun \namendments that may be offered during this tragic time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3340\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. With that, Mr. President, I send the first amendment to \nthe desk on behalf of Senator Faircloth, Senator Kohl, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for himself, Mr. \n     Faircloth, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 3340.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike Section 639 on pages 96 and 97 in its entirety and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``Sec. 639. For purposes of each provision of law amended \n     by section 704(a)(2) of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (5 \n     U.S.C. 5318 note), no adjustment under section 5303 of title \n     5, United States Code, shall be considered to have taken \n     effect in fiscal year 1999 in the rates of basic pay for the \n     statutory pay systems.''.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in January of 1999 the rank-and-file \nFederal employees will automatically receive a salary adjustment based \nupon the employment cost index. Most people refer to this as the COLA. \nSome simply call it a pay raise.\n  Under current law, a similar adjustment is made to the salaries of \nsenior-level Federal employees, Members of Congress, and Federal judges \nalso. This adjustment is automatic under the provisions of the Ethics \nReform Act of 1989, unless Congress takes an affirmative action to \nblock the increase.\n  The bill before us today includes the language to prevent the \nautomatic pay adjustment from going into effect in January for Members \nof Congress, Federal judges, and senior-level employees of the \nexecutive branch.\n  The text of the provision is slightly different from that which \npassed the House of Representatives and, therefore, makes it a \nconferenceable item.\n  This amendment which we offer today makes that provision identical to \nthe House-passed version.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague, Senator Kohl, if he has any \nstatement on this.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I agree with the comments of Senator \nCampbell.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Colorado.\n  The amendment (No. 3340) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3341 through 3346, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk the managers' package \nof amendments and ask unanimous consent that they be considered en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), proposes \n     amendments numbered 3341 through 3346 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments, en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3341\n\n       At the appropriate place at the end of title I, insert:\n       Sec. ____. Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (5), by striking ``the explosive in a \n     fixed shotgun shell'' and insert ``an explosive'';\n       (2) in paragraph (7), by striking ``the explosive in a \n     fixed metallic cartridge'' and inserting ``an explosive''; \n     and\n       (3) by striking paragraph (16) and inserting the following:\n       ``(16) The term `antique firearm'--\n       ``(A) means any--\n       ``(i) firearm (including any firearm with a matchlock, \n     flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition \n     system) manufactured in or before 1898;\n       ``(ii) replica of any firearm described in clause (i), if \n     such replica--\n       ``(I) is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or \n     conventional centerfire fixed ammunition; or\n       ``(II) uses rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed \n     ammunition that is no longer manufactured in the United \n     States and that is not readily available in the ordinary \n     channels of commercial trade; and\n       ``(iii) muzzle loading rifle, muzzle loading shotgun, or \n     muzzle loading pistol, that--\n       ``(I) is designed to use black powder, or a black powder \n     substitute; and\n       ``(II) cannot use fixed ammunition; and\n       ``(B) does not include any--\n       ``(i) weapon that incorporates a firearm frame or receiver;\n       ``(ii) firearm that is converted into a muzzle loading \n     weapon; or\n       ``(iii) muzzle loading weapon that can be readily converted \n     to fire fixed ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, \n     breechblock, or any combination thereof.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the \nmuzzle loader amendment which we are considering.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to exempt certain muzzle loading \nweapons from regulation under the Gun Control Act (GCA), 18 U.S.C. \nChapter 44. Under current law, ``antique firearms'' are exempted from \nthe definition of ``firearm'' in section 921(a)(3) of the GCA and are, \ntherefore, not subject to the interstate controls, licensing \nprovisions, record keeping requirements, or restrictions on possession \nthat apply to firearms. Thus, antique firearms can be sold interstate \nvia mail-order, no records of their sale are kept, and they may be \nlawfully possessed by any U.S. citizen. The existing definition of \n``antique firearm'' exempts firearms manufactured in or before 1898, \nreplicas of such firearms that utilize matchlock, flintlock, percussion \ncap, or other primitive types of ignition systems including primers and \nbattery cup primers and other replica firearms that utilize ammunition \nthat is no longer available in commercial channels.\n  In recent years, there has been a strong increase in popularity in \nhunting and target shooting involving muzzle loading firearms which \ncould not have been foreseen when the current law was written. As in \nany other sporting equipment, the technology was refined to provide \nsafer and more reliable equipment, much like the compound bow evolved \nfrom the original long bow. Most states now offer a muzzle loading \nhunting season to improve deer herd management. There have been \nnumerous technological improvements in\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\nmuzzle loading weapons, including safer propellant, safety mechanism, \nprojectiles, and ignition systems.\n  As is the case with the compound bow, many of the muzzle loading \nweapons now produced bear little physical resemblance to traditional \nantique firearms produced prior to 1898. Significantly, they all \nrequire the placing of a propellant down the barrel, pushing a bullet \ndown the barrel on top of the powder, then placing an ignition system \nbehind the powder just as all muzzle loaders have for more than 100 \nyears. Since the BATF has determined that certain of these weapons are \nnot ``replicas'' under the definition of ``antique firearms'', they are \nregulated as ``firearms'' under the GCA. The BATF has restricted only \none inline muzzle loader, the Knight DISC rifle, which is produced in \nmy home state of Iowa, even though Remington states that their muzzle \nloader is built from their 700 Centerfire.\n  The amendment would expand the definition of the term ``antique \nfirearm'' to encompass these modern muzzle loading sporting firearms \nused by hunters, target shooters, and other sportsmen. The amendment \nwould include within the definition of ``antique firearm'' a weapon \nthat: (1) is a muzzle loading rifle, muzzle loading shotgun, or muzzle \nloading pistol; (2) is designed to use black powder or a black powder \nsubstitute; (3) uses any ignition system; (4) cannot use fixed \nammunition; (5) does not use the serial numbered frame or receiver of a \nfirearm; (6) has not been converted from a firearm; and (7) cannot be \nreadily converted to fire fixed ammunition by replacing the barrel, \nbolt, or breechlock.\n  The language requiring that the antique firearm not use the frame or \nreceiver of a serial numbered firearm, not be converted from a firearm, \nand cannot be readily converted to fire fixed ammunition is to prevent \nthe conversion of modern firearms into percussion cap ``antique \nfirearms''. BATF is concerned that, without this language, various \nsingle shot, bolt action, slide action and semi-automatic weapons, and \neven certain machine guns, could be converted into muzzle loading \nweapons and then converted back to fire conventional fixed ammunition \nmerely by replacing the barrel or other components. The weapon could \nthen be sold as an ``antique firearm'' without any GCA controls. Many \ncomponents which alter the form and function of firearms are available \nto be easily converted from one form of firearm to another. However, \nthere are no products currently in commercial trade which would convert \na muzzle loader to a firearm or a firearm to a muzzle loader.\n  Since the amendment is limited to muzzle loading rifles, muzzle \nloading shotguns, and muzzle loading pistols, it would not allow \ngrenade launchers, bazookas, machine guns, or anti-tank guns to be \nexcluded from the regulation. Also, since this amendment will be \nadopted on the floor, there isn't any report language to assist courts \nand industry in interpreting the status of muzzle loaders.

Mr. President, there are a number of things that many of \nus feel to be very important in terms of principles. One of them is \nfederalism, of course--making the appropriate division between those \nthings that are done in State government and those things that are done \nin local government, and the role of Federal Government. Another, it \nseems to me, is to do those things that can be done in the private \nsector, and that has, indeed, been the policy of this Government for a \nvery long time.\n  I rise today to express my deep appreciation for the members of the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee and staff for their time and \neffort in developing a consensus on my legislation to codify this 40-\nyear-old Federal principle that has been in place.\n  In the beginning of this Congress, I introduced S. 314, the Freedom \nfrom Government Competition Act. This legislation is an attempt to put \nin statute a workable process by which the Federal Government utilizes \nthe private sector to do those things that are commercial in nature. \nThis, indeed, has been the policy of the Government for a very long \ntime. In fact, as early as 1932, Congress first became aware of the \nfact that the Federal Government was starting to carry out activities \nof a commercial nature and said that is not necessary and we should not \ndo that.\n  In 1954, a bill to address the issue passed the House and was \nreported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs. At that time, the \nEisenhower administration said that we would take care of it \nadministratively. Therefore, Bureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4 was \nissued, and there was no further action taken.\n  To make a relatively long story short, all the administrations since \nthat time in one way or another have endorsed the idea of taking those \nthings that could at least as well be done in the private sector as in \nthe Government, allowing for some competition.\n  There is a circular now called A-76 which has been endorsed since \n1955. Unfortunately, it hasn't been enforced. Unfortunately, when it is \nonly a bulletin or Executive order, there is no real appeal process. \nWhat we are seeking to do is to put that concept into statute--it has \nnow been approved by the committee in the Senate; it has been approved \nby the committee in the House--that would simply say to agencies, we \nwant you to take an annual inventory of those kinds of things that you \ndo, those that are commercial in nature. There ought to be a fair \nopportunity for the private sector to seek to compete in those areas.\n  Mr. President, we hope that that will come before the Senate and the \nHouse before this session is over; that it would, indeed, be put in \nstatute, that concept that has been there for a very long time, the \nnotion simply being that the taxpayers benefit from the cost, and \nwhoever can do this the most efficiently, whether it be mapping, \nwhether it be laboratory work, whether it be all kinds of things that \nare often and always done in the private sector, that can be done \nbetter and more efficiently there, will, indeed, be done there.\n  To reiterate, that policy is now found in OMB Circular A-76 and has \nbeen endorsed by every administration, of both parties, since 1955. \nHowever, the degree of enthusiasm for implementation of the circular \nhas varied from one administration to another. In fact, the issue of \ngovernment competition has become so pervasive that all three sessions \nof the White House Conference on Small Business, held in 1980, 1986 and \n1995, ranked this as one of the top problems facing America's small \nbusinesses. According to testimony we received, it is estimated that \nmore than half a million Federal employees are engaged in activities \nthat are commercial in nature.\n  However, the purpose of my legislation is not to bash Federal \nemployees. I believe most are motivated by public service and are \ndedicated individuals. However, from a policy standpoint, I believe we \nhave gone too far in defining the role of government and the private \nsector in our economy. Because A-76 is nonbinding and discretionary on \nthe part of agencies, too many commercial activities have been started \nand carried out in Federal agencies. Because A-76 is not statutory, \nCongress has failed to exercise its oversight responsibilities. \nFurther, by leaving ``make or buy'' decisions to agency managers, there \nhas been no means to assure that agencies ``govern'' or restrict \nthemselves to inherently governmental activities, rather than produce \ngoods and services that can otherwise be performed in and obtained from \nthe private sector.\n  Among the problems we have seen with Circular A-76 is (1) agencies do \nnot develop accurate inventories of activities (2) they do not conduct \nthe reviews outlined in the Circular, (3) when reviews are conducted \nthey drag out over extended periods of time and (4) the criteria for \nthe reviews are not fair and equitable. These are complaints we heard \nfrom the private sector, government employees, and in some cases from \nboth.\n  In the 1980's our former colleague Senator Warren Rudman first \nintroduced the ``Freedom from Government Competition Act'' in the \nSenate. Later, Representative John J. Duncan, Jr. (R-TN) introduced \nsimilar legislation in the House. I was a cosponsor of that bill when I \nserved in the other body. Upon my election to the Senate in the 104th \nCongress, I introduced the companion to Representative Duncan's bill in \nthe Senate.\n  On Wednesday, July 15, 1998 the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nunanimously reported a version of S. 314 that is a result of many \nmonths of discussions among both the majority and minority on the \ncommittee, OMB, Federal employee unions and private sector \norganizations. The amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by \nChairman Fred Thompson and approved by the committee is a consensus and \na compromise.\n  It is important to point out that the bill that I introduced in the \n104th Congress was an attempt to codify the original 1955 policy that \nthe government should rely on the private sector. After a hearing on \nthat bill was convened by Senator Stevens, during his tenure as \nchairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, it became clear to \nme that it was necessary to add to the bill the concept of competition \nto determine whether government performance or private sector \nperformance resulted in the best value to the American taxpayer. While \nS. 314 as introduced, and H.R. 716 introduced in the House, was still \nentitled the ``Freedom from Government Competition Act,'' it in fact \nnot only did not prevent government competition, but it mandated it. \nThis was not a change that private sector organizations came to \ncomfortably support. However, inasmuch as OMB Circular A-76 changed \nthrough the years from its original 1955 philosophical statement to its \nmore recent iterations that required public-private competition, I \nrevised my bill when introducing it last year to include such \ncompetitions, provided they in fact are conducted and that when \nconducted, they are fair and equitable comparisons carried out on a \nlevel playing field.\n  I would also hasten to add that the measure reported by the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which I hope will be promptly approved \nby the\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nfull Senate, is significantly different than S. 314 as introduced. \nWhile S. 314 as introduced was opposed by the administration and by the \nFederal employee unions, the compromise measure reported from the \ncommittee is not opposed by these groups.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation that I believe will \ntruly result in a government that works better and costs less. \nCertainly government agency officials should have the ability to \ncontract with the private sector for goods and services needed for the \nconduct of government activities. This bill will not inhibit ability. \nHowever, it should not be the practice of the government to carry on \ncommercial activities for months, years, even decades without reviewing \nwhether such activities can be carried out in a more cost effective or \nefficient manner by the private sector. I believe that the drive to \nreduce the size and scope of the Federal Government will be successful \nonly when we force the government to do less and allow the private \nsector to do more.\n\n  During the course of our hearings, it became abundantly clear that \nthere are certain activities that the Federal Government has performed \nin-house which can and should be converted to the private sector. Areas \nsuch as architecture, engineering, surveying and mapping, laboratory \ntesting, information technology, and laundry services have no place in \ngovernment. These activities should be promptly transitioned to the \nprivate sector.\n  There are other activities in which a public-private competition \nshould be conducted to determine which provider can deliver the best \nvalue to the taxpayer. This includes base and facility operation, \ncampgrounds, and auctioning.\n  There are several key provisions in the bill upon which I would like \nto comment. In particular, section 2(d) requires the head of an agency \nto review the activities on his or her list of commercial activities \n``within a reasonable time''. OMB strongly opposed a legislative \ntimetable for conducting these reviews. As a result of the compromise \nlanguage on this matter, it will be incumbent on OMB to make certain \nthese reviews are indeed conducted in a reasonable time frame. These \nreviews should be scheduled and completed within months, not years. I \nwill personally monitor progress on this matter, as will the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I urge OMB to exercise strong oversight \nto assure timely implementation of this requirement by the agencies.\n  This provision also requires that agencies use a ``competitive \nprocess'' to select the source of goods or services. In my view, this \nterm has the same meaning as ``competitive procedure'' as defined in \nFederal law (10 U.S.C. 2302(2) and 41 U.S.C. 259(b)). To the extent \nthat a government agency competes for work under this section of the \nbill, the government agency will be treated as any other contractor or \nofferor in order to assure that the competition is conducted on a level \nplaying field.\n  Another issue that I have been concerned about is the proliferation \nof Interservice Support Agreement's (ISSA's). Under the ``FAIR'' Act, \nconsistent with the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535), items on the \ncommercial inventory that have not been reviewed may not be performed \nfor another federal agency. In addition, any item on the inventory \ncannot be provided to state or local governments unless there is a \ncertification, pursuant to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 \nU.S.C. 6505(a)).\n  Enactment of the ``FAIR'' Act is a major achievement because it \ncodifies a process to assure government reliance on the private sector \nto the maximum extent feasible. Further, it will put some teeth into \nExecutive Order 12615 issued by President Reagan, which is still on the \nbooks today.\n  Again, I thank the members of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the committee's staff, for all of the hard work necessary \nto forge this compromise. I look forward to working with them on \nthorough congressional oversight on the implementation of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, following my remarks, it will be my \nintention to offer an amendment to close a gaping loophole in \nlegislation which we passed 4 years ago to make the streets of this \ncountry safe. That specific legislation was legislation that prohibited \nthe manufacture and sale of 19 commonly used assault weapons, \nsemiautomatic assault weapons, that have been used to kill police, used \nby grievance killers, used by gangs, used by cartels, used by drive-by \nshooters.\n\n  The legislation also contained provisions that sought to eliminate \nthe sale and transfer of the high-capacity clips and magazines that \nwould hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And, in fact, today it is \nillegal in this country to domestically manufacture and sell a new \nclip, drum or strip that was made in this country, except to the \nmilitary, police, or for nuclear power plant protection. It has become \nevident that though this legislation has been successful in reducing \nthe criminal use of the 19 banned assault weapons, the provisions in \nthis law aimed at reducing the availability of these large-capacity \nammunition feeding devices have been rendered ineffective.\n  At the request of the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who was on \nthe floor a moment ago, the 1994 law grandfathered existing high-\ncapacity clips which were manufactured before the effective date of the \nban to allow those clips which had a bill of lading on them to enter \nthe country and to allow dealers to recover their expenses by selling \noff their existing stocks. The same thing existed for assault weapons \nthemselves.\n  The President and Secretary of the Treasury closed this loophole \nthrough his executive decision which used the 1968 law, which said that \nany weapon imported into this country must meet a sporting use test. \nAnd 1.6 million of these semiautomatic assault weapons were essentially \ncut off from importation. The thrust of the legislation was to \neliminate the supply over time --not to prohibit possession, but over \ntime, because there are so many of these weapons and clips in this \ncountry now, to cut down on their supply.\n  I will never forget, because the distinguished Senator from Idaho did \napproach me on the floor--we were standing right down in the well; I \nremember it as clear as if it was yesterday, although it was almost 5 \nyears ago--and indicated that he was concerned about weapons that had a \nbill of lading on them which had been manufactured pre-assault weapons \nban and which were in the process of transit into this country.\n  My point, Mr. President, is that now, 4 or 5 years later, the \nexisting supply of these clips surely has been used up. However, \nforeign clips have continued to pour into the United States.\n  From July of 1996 to March of 1998, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms approved 2,500,000 large-capacity clips for importation \ninto this country.\n  Recently, that number has skyrocketed even further. In just the last \n5 months, BATF has approved permits for 8.1 million large-capacity \nclips for importation into America. That represents a 314-percent \nincrease in one-fourth of the time.\n  These clips have been approved to come through at least 20 different \ncountries. It is difficult to know the place of manufacture, but they \ncome through 20 different countries into this country.\n  I would like to just quickly go through the countries that they come \nthrough. And there are some interesting things. Austria, Belgium, \nChile, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, England--and clips \nmanufactured somewhere abroad come through Great Britain; there are \nactually 250-round magazines--250-round magazines--for sale in this \ncountry and 177-round magazines for sale in this country--Germany, \nGreece, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Nicaragua, South Africa, \nSwitzerland, Taiwan, and Zimbabwe.\n  So the total is 8.8 million in two years approved to come in.\n  Unfortunately, there is virtually no reliable method to determine the \ndate of manufacture on the millions of clips\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\nthat the BATF has estimated are in circulation now in the United \nStates. The inability to determine the date of manufacture is \nparticularly true regarding the foreign importation of large-capacity \nmagazines because BATF has no ability to independently determine \nwhether such clips imported into the country are legal or illegal. It \nhas allowed the continued importation of clips represented to be \nmanufactured before the assault weapons ban took place.\n  Let me show you how this happened. Here is a clip from Shotgun News, \ndated February 1998: ``Banned semiautomatics, Bulgarian SLR 95. 1 free \n40-rd magazine with each purchase.''\n  Here is another one: ``Quality replacements, 30 rounds, the choice of \nthe Canadian military. Will not bend or rust, $8.99 a clip.''\n  Here is where you see the impact of, now, the foreign rounds: ``30-rd \nEast German''--East German-made--``Ribbed back, AK-47 magazines, \n$7.99.''\n  Here is one: An ``AK magazine special,'' coming with the pouch, \n``including 4 Chinese AK-47 30-rd magazines with pouch, $27.50.'' It \nalso includes ``four East German AK-47, 20 rd magazines with a pouch, \n$29.95.''\n\n  Now, my staff called a shotgun store and asked to buy some of these \nmagazines. The only question he was asked, ``Is it legal to buy this \nstuff where you are''--he was in Washington, DC, where it is not legal \nto own a gun, and he said, ``I don t know, as far as I know it is,'' \nand they said, ``We will send it to you.''\n  My point is, you can get these big clips very easily--on the phone, \nby mail order. And because now the supply of the domestic clips is \nrunning out, most of the clips being sold in this country are of \nforeign manufacture. So we have two sets. We have the domestic \nmanufacturers prohibited. We have the sale and transfer of new clips \nprohibited. And you have the grandfather clause creating this gigantic \nloophole which allows these big clips to continue to come into the \ncountry.\n  In April of this year, President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Rubin \nclosed one loophole created by this grandfather clause by blocking \nfurther importation of modified semiautomatic assault weapons. About 30 \nof us sent him a letter. We pointed out there were 1.6 million of these \nwhich received approval that were coming in from all over the world. \nThe Treasury Department looked at the 1968 law, which requires all \nimported weapons to meet a sporting test, and decided that they don't \nmeet this sporting test, and therefore the Executive order is in place \nand this importation has been prohibited. The remaining loophole to \nclose is this loophole for the big clips. The amendment that we will \nshortly offer will do just that.\n  So the change to the law that I have proposed is simple: It would bar \nfurther imports of large-capacity clips and magazines, just as U.S. \ndomestic manufacturers have been stopped from producing these \nmagazines. This amendment would not--I repeat, not--ban further \ndomestic sales and possession of large-capacity clips which are already \nlegally in the United States. There are tens of millions of these \nalready.\n  Now, let's talk about who uses these high-capacity clips. I pointed \nout, coming through Great Britain, there were ammunition-feeding \ndevices carrying 250 rounds. You can expel 250 rounds before you have \nto reload. Do hunters use them? Do marksmen use them? Do skeet shooters \nuse them? Do Olympic team members use them?\n  Let's take hunters. The answer is no, hunters don't use them. Most \nStates limit the magazine capacity allowed for hunting, usually eight \nrounds or less. Federal law clearly outlines the ammunition magazine \nsize limits for bird shooting. Federal law does not allow the use of a \nshotgun that has a capacity of more than three shells--one in the \nchamber and two in the magazine--when hunting migratory game birds.\n  How about the Olympic team and other competitive shooters? No.\n  So who really uses these large-capacity clips? Let me read a list of \nevents that have taken place fairly recently. July, 1998, earlier this \nmonth, Rio Hondo, TX, a killing spree leaves five dead, including two \nBorder Patrol officers. In one day, 24-year-old Ernest Moore killed \nfour people in what police called a planned situation. He killed two \npeople and wounded another in a private residence. Police at the scene \nrecovered an MK-70 assault rifle and a 30-round clip. Approximately 30 \nminutes later, Moore fired as many as 100 rounds at law enforcement \nofficers from a .223-caliber assault rifle. Two Border Patrol agents \nwere killed at the scene and a sheriff's deputy was wounded.\n  That is who uses these big clips.\n  June 17, Coeur d'Alene, ID: A State trooper ambushed by merciless \nassassin. State trooper Linda Huff was ambushed and killed by a man \nwielding a 9-millimeter pistol with a 15-round clip. Police were not \nimmediately certain why 34-year-old Scott David Yeager bicycled to the \npolice station and fired 17 rounds at Huff in the rear parking lot. \nInvestigators say Yeager fired all 15 rounds from one 15-round clip, \ndisposed of it, reloaded, and continued to fire.\n  In May of this year, Springfield, OR: A 50-round clip. High school \nstudent kills four, injures dozens. After killing his parents, went on \na shooting spree at his high school--most of us are familiar with this. \nTo carry out his fatal assault, he used a Ruger 10.22 hunting rifle, a \nRuger .22 caliber handgun and a Glock model 19. Found attached to the \nrifle, a traditional hunting gun, was an empty 50-round clip and found \non the student were four 30-round clips and two 20-round clips. During \nthe attack, he fired from the rifle indiscriminately, and it was not \nuntil he emptied the 50-round clip that several of his classmates were \nable to tackle and subdue him.\n  In March of this year, Jonesboro, AR: 15-round clips. Two middle \nschool students ambush classmates. Two students, age 11 and age 13, \npulled the fire alarm in their school in order to draw their classmates \noutside. The boys lay in wait and ambushed the other students when they \ngot outside. They fired 24 shots into the crowd, 15 of which came from \na Universal carbine rifle with a 15-round clip. The shots from the \nrifle were fired as fast as the shooter could pull the trigger.\n  February of this year, New Orleans, LA: A 30-round clip. Police \nrecover 30-round clip after chase. After a routine traffic stop, a man \nled police on a 3-mile chase during which he pointed a 9-millimeter \nassault pistol with a 30-round clip.\n  And then it goes on and on and on. Elmhurst, NY, 30-round clip. \nIndianapolis, 30-round clip; traffic stop pulls the weapon. Orange, CA, \n30-round clip; disgruntled employee kills five with 30-round clip; five \npeople were killed, and a police officer was seriously wounded when a \ndisgruntled Caltrans employee began randomly firing from an AK-47S with \na 30-round clip. Denver, CO, last November, police officer killed by \nSKS with a 30-round clip; Denver police officer Bruce VanderJagt was \nkilled by a barrage of gunfire from an SKS assault rifle as he chased a \nburglary suspect; police later recovered the rifle and the 30-round \nclip. Magna, UT, police officers shot by SKS with 20-round clip.\n  It goes on and on and on. The point is, there are so many of these \nbig clips available in this Nation that they become the ammunition-\nfeeding device of choice for the grievance killer, the person going up \nagainst police, the gang that wants to engage in intimidation, drive-by \nshootings, the cartels--these are the weapons of choice, and the \nweapons of choice are useless if you don't have that big-round clip.\n  What are we seeing? Five months and 8.1 million of these receiving \napproval to come into this country because BATF could not assert when \nthey were manufactured. BATF can't go to another country to check a \nfactory supply. Therefore, an understanding that I have with the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho--and I am pleased he is on the floor \nnow; these would apply to clips or weapons that had bills of lading \nattached to them--is clearly not the case today. Bills of lading that \npreexisted a 4-year-old piece of legislation now. The time has come to \nclose this grandfather clause.\n  Now, a number of the tragedies that I have just indicated probably \nwould have occurred without the availability of killer clips. Some are \nfond of saying, ``Guns don't kill, people do.'' Yes, that is true. But \nI don't think ever before in the history of this Nation we have ever\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\nhad a time when more weapons of destruction were falling into the hands \nof children.\n  The case that really struck me was a case in Memphis, TN, when a 5-\nyear-old took a loaded weapon to school to kill a teacher who had given \nthat youngster a ``time out'' the day before.\n  All we are trying to do is close the grandfather clause, say all of \nthe clips that were in transit on the day we passed this legislation, 4 \nyears ago, have been used up, and now is the time to close the \nloophole.\n  Interestingly enough, some have told me, and Members of this body \nhave told me, ``Well, we know people who like to use them plinking.'' \nThey told me, ``Yes, I like to use them plinking.'' Well, we are not \ntaking away anybody's right to possess or to plink. There are plenty of \nclips around for plinking. What we are trying to do is stop what is now \na massive flood of clips, even those that now carry 250 rounds in these \nmagazines, from coming into this country.\n  I don't like to do this amendment, frankly, this day, because this is \na solemn day and I don't like to mix the two. Unfortunately, the \nTreasury-Postal bill is on the floor at this time, and this is an \nopportunity to move the amendment.\n  I hope that those who know the intent of the grandfather clause to \nonly affect those guns and clips that were in transit at the time of \nthe enactment of the legislation--something that I agreed to because I \nthought it was fair--will agree to let this legislation go into place. \nIt will not take a clip out of anyone's hands; it will not prohibit \npossession. Domestic manufacturers of ammunition feeding devices, \ntoday, cannot manufacture clips for general sale that are in excess of \n10 bullets. We know they are not used in hunting, but we do know that \nin case after case they are used to kill police officers, they are used \nto kill employees, used by grievance killers, drive-by shooters, drug \ngangs, cartels, etc. The real question in my mind is: Do the rights of \nthe majority outweigh the rights of those few who would like to plink, \nwho would like to continue the flood of weapons coming into this \ncountry? There is no civilized, industrialized power on Earth in which \nthere are more weapons or in which there are more of these big clips \nfloating around.\n  The instant case that really jettisoned me into the assault weapons \nlegislation was the 1994 case of Luigi Ferri, who had Tec-9 copycats \nand a 9 millimeter pistol. When he went into 101 California Street, \nthis was his array of ammunition-feeding devices that he brought with \nhim. He carried with him 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, \n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25--25 different ammunition \nfeeding devices, with enough rounds that exceeded 500 rounds. I think \nit was actually over a thousand rounds of ammunition used to do his \ndastardly deed. Indeed, he left 8 people dead and about 14 people \nwounded. And no one could get to him to disarm him. In this case, I \ndon't know whether these are domestic or foreign made clips.\n  The point I want to make is that the large number, the incredible \nfire power and the lack of sanity seemed to prevail.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3351\n\n (Purpose: To ban the importation of large capacity ammunition feeding \n                                devices)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

CHILD CARE SERVICES FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--An Executive agency which provides or \n     proposes to provide child care services for Federal employees \n     may use agency funds to provide child care, in a Federal or \n     leased facility, or through contract, for civilian employees \n     of such agency.\n       (b) Affordability.--Amounts provided under subsection (a) \n     with respect to any facility or contractor described in such \n     subsection shall be applied to improve the affordability of \n     child care for lower income\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\n     Federal employees using or seeking to use the child care \n     services offered by such facility or contractor.\n       (c) Regulations.--The Office of Personnel Management and \n     the General Services Administration shall, within 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, issue regulations \n     necessary to carry out this section.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``Executive agency'' has the meaning given such term by \n     section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but does not \n     include the General Accounting Office.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this is an amendment which has been \ncleared by both sides of the aisle. This amendment is about child care \nservices for children of Federal employees, which allows agencies to \nprovide child care at an affordable cost.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we support this amendment fully.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3352) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, at this time, I yield time to Senator \nThompson for the purpose of submitting an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nColorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n(Purpose: To require the addition of use of forced or indentured child \n  labor to the list of grounds on which a potential contractor may be \n     debarred or suspended from eligibility for award of a Federal \n                          Government contract)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3353.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out section 642 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n       Sec. 642. The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be \n     revised, within 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, to include the use of forced or indentured child labor \n     in mining, production, or manufacturing as a cause on the \n     lists of causes for debarment and suspension from contracting \n     with executive agencies that are set forth in the regulation.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a certain \nprovision in the Postal-Treasury appropriations bill at section 642. It \nis a section that deals with procurement policies. It is a section that \ndeals with a problem of goods that are produced by child labor--a \nproblem about which we are all sensitive. I do think that this \nprovision should not be in this bill. I offer this amendment to amend \nthe provision, leaving in the portion that addresses the child labor \nissue, but taking out certain portions that I believe are clearly \nunconstitutional and unneeded.\n  In the first place, Mr. President, this is an area of some \ncomplexity--the procurement laws and regulations of this country. It is \nan area that is within the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, of which I am chairman. Our committee has spent a good deal \nof time dealing with this issue. We have passed legislation over the \nlast two Congresses that deal with our procurement policies in this \ncountry. We have passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n1994--this is a provision that Senator Glenn sponsored--and we passed \nthe Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996--all dealing, at least in part, with the \nproblem of Government procurement, and procurement practices and \npolicies. I think, as most people who deal with this realize, it is \ncertainly a balancing act. There are considerations that have to be \ngiven to the contractors. There are considerations certainly that have \nto be given to the Government--what is fair.\n  We want to place reasonable requirements and restrictions with regard \nto the practices and policies that the Government uses when they go out \nand acquire goods and services, and so forth. Everyone comes in and \ngets a seat at the table, and we hash those things out. We have been \ndoing that in a free and open debate for some time now.\n  We discover now that with regard to this provision, instead of it \ngoing through the regular process, instead of our having debate on the \nissue, and instead of us having a discussion on the issue, we find that \nit winds up being a substantive provision with regard to policies that \napply across the board and winds up as a part of this appropriations \nbill. I do not believe that is a good way to legislate.\n  We hear a lot of times complaints about amendments on appropriations \nbills. But here we actually have a provision within the appropriations \nbill which, as I say, really substantively addresses an issue not only \nunder the jurisdiction of the committee that has been wrestling with \nthis problem for some time but without any really public discussion or \ndebate.\n  What does this 642 require?\n  First of all, it requires that the Secretary of Labor publish a list \nof items that might have been produced by child labor--``might have \nbeen produced'' by child labor. I am not sure whether or not there is \nanother provision in the law that places a requirement on people based \nupon the determination that certain items might have had a certain \norigin, or anything of that nature. But be that as it may, there is \nnothing wrong with putting something on a list in and of itself.\n  Then the provision says that the Government may not require an item \non that list unless the person or company providing the goods or \nservices certify that it was not a product of child labor.\n  In other words, apparently the best the Government can do, or the \nrequirement that the Government has, is simply to come up with whether \nor not an item might have been produced by child labor. But then the \nsupplier of the goods has to certify, based on that list, that in fact \nit was not produced by child labor.\n  Then, 642 goes on to say that the contract may be terminated based \nupon violation of this provision and that the contractor may be \ndisbarred.\n  So far, so good, although this is, I believe, very, very troublesome \nlanguage that is used here. But so far, so good. You are debarring \nsomeone. You are terminating the contract, if there is any indication \nthat child labor is used.\n  I must point out that this activity is already not only grounds for \ndebarment but a crime. It is already a crime to place materials \nproduced by child labor in interstate commerce, punishable by a $10,000 \nfine per child employee and 6 months imprisonment.\n  In addition, under 18 U.S.C. 1581, whoever holds or returns any \nperson to a condition of peonage shall be fined not more than $5,000, \nor imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n  As far as the criminal law is concerned, anyone who would be in a \ndisbarment situation would be violating a very severe criminal law.\n  But, be that as it may, so we are duplicative. So what? What is the \nbig problem with that?\n  The biggest problem with all of this is not what I have been \ndiscussing so far, although as we see troublesome language duplicative, \nit is already a criminal act in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. It \nalready has cause for disbarment for the commission of any other \noffense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty \nthat seriously and directly affects the responsibility of the \nGovernment contractor or subcontractor.\n  I can't think of anything that would be more indicative of a lack of \nbusiness integrity than using child labor.\n  So not only do we have a criminal act prohibiting this activity, but \nwe have a regulation now saying that you can disbar on the basis of \nthis activity.\n  But, again, as I say, so far, so good, as far as I am concerned. So \nwe are duplicative. So we use vague language.\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\n  The problem that is the major one in this particular section has to \ndo with the provision that is on CB, a capital B, which says the \nfollowing: That an acquisition contract has to include the following \nlanguage:\n\n       A clause that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully \n     and provide access for any official of the United States to \n     the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises, if \n     requested by the official for the purpose of determining \n     whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, \n     produce, or manufacture any item furnished under this \n     contract.\n\n  I believe this is clearly unconstitutional. I know the intent was \ngood. We all have the same intent with regard to the end result here. \nBut we have picked out a particular area--not drug dealing, not selling \nfaulty parts for an airplane that crashes and kills our pilots, and not \nfaulty parts that go on machines that kill our Armed Forces--all the \nterrible things that could happen.\n  We have picked out one and have given some Government officials, any \nGovernment official, total, unlimited access to the books, records, and \npersons of anyone whom they choose to exercise that with regard to.\n  There is a body of law, of course, with regard to unwarranted \nadministrative searches. Under certain circumstances, warrantless \nadministrative searches are permissible. But we have to keep in mind \nthat under those circumstances, under the warrant clause of the \nConstitution, there is no probable cause requirement.\n  So these are dangerous things that the courts have said you have to \nbe careful with, and you have to have certain requirements in the \nstatute giving you the right to carry out these warrantless searches, \nif they are going to be constitutional.\n  First of all, the Government needs to have a substantial interest. I \nthink that is covered here.\n  Second, the regulation of the business had to serve that interest. I \nam willing to concede that.\n  Third, statutory safeguards are needed to provide an adequate \nsubstitute for a warrant requirement.\n  We have a warrant requirement. Whether we are dealing with the most \nheinous criminal activity imaginable, we have generally been speaking \nabout a warrant requirement, a due process requirement, under the \nConstitution. But the courts have said that if you do not have that, if \nyou are going to carry out a warrantless administrative search, you \nhave to have certain statutory safeguards.\n  They have discussed what they are. None of them is here, Mr. \nPresident.\n  First of all, there is total discretion with regard to the Government \nofficial as to which business he decides to check on that day, or which \nindividual. There is no probable cause requirement, or no evidentiary \nrequirement at all. He has total and complete discretion under this \nlanguage to decide which business he wants to check on.\n  That is constitutionally suspect from the outset, according to the \ncourt cases.\n  Second, any official of the United States can do it.\n  I don't know if that includes me or not, or the staff. But any \nofficial of the United States, I guess from fire marshals to officials \nover at the Department of Energy, or whoever.\n  Third, there is no statutory procedure for challenging of the warrant \nat all. Some of the statutes say that if the concern refuses to consent \nto this kind of process, search and seizure, there is a statute, a \ncivil provision, whereby it can be contested. That is not here.\n  Lastly, it is not just the premises that we are talking about here, \nbut it has to do with all records and documents and persons apparently \nthat are subject to this particular provision. It is a provision that \nhas not been applied to and cannot constitutionally be applied to the \nmost heinous criminal activities imaginable. And although these are \ncertainly reprehensible activities we are dealing with, they cannot \namend the Constitution of the United States with regard to all of the \nvarious things for which a person or a business can be debarred. Your \nimagination is the only limitation as to what those things might be. \nThere could be some very, very terrible things, as I indicated, and \nthis is one of them. But here we have selected this particular activity \nand placed a burden on the supplier of Government goods that, frankly, \ncannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n  The bill in section 642 has an exception, and it says that this \nsection does not apply to a contract that is for the procurement of any \nproduct, article, material or supply containing a product that is \nmined, produced or manufactured in any foreign country or \ninstrumentality if the foreign country or instrumentality is a party to \nthe agreement on Government procurement annexed to the WTO agreement.\n  In other words, this provision that I have just been talking about \ndoes not apply to a foreign country if it is a party to the WTO \nagreement or a party to the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. As I \nunderstand this, if a country is a party to the WTO agreement or is a \nsignatory or a party to NAFTA, they are not covered by this, and \npresumably goods coming from that country would not be covered by this, \nso a manufacturer in a country that is a part of NAFTA or WTO \npresumably would not be covered by this.\n  The United States of America is a party to NAFTA, but goods emanating \nfrom this country would not be covered by this. Now, I am not sure in \npractical terms how this would work out or what kind of problems this \nwould present, but I do not see why companies of a foreign country \nshould be exempted from this law when companies from this country are \ntargeted by this law and are having these, what I believe are fairly \nclearly unconstitutional, requirements and burdens placed on them.\n  So the proper action would be to bring this language back to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and consider it in the normal course of \nSenate business. But the fact remains that the language is pending \nbefore the Senate so we must deal with it.\n  So, Mr. President, I am offering an amendment which will give Federal \nagencies the ability to debar or suspend companies. And I repeat that. \nThis will give, if there is any question--I don't think there is any \nquestion that they have the ability to do that now. It is against the \nFederal law, and it is provided for in the FAR. But in case there is \nany question about that, my amendment will give Federal agencies the \nability to debar or suspend companies which use forced or indentured \nchild labor, but in a way that is consistent with the current \nprocurement system of the delicate balance that has been worked out \nwhich has specific regulatory history and due process requirements, and \nnot in the vague way that this language addresses it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I request that we defer action on this issue \nuntil Senator Harkin, who has taken the lead on this issue, returns. He \nis away today in Minnesota at a funeral of his father-in-law. I \nunderstand he will be back tonight, but I cannot be certain of that. It \nseems to me, until he is back to respond to Senator Thompson's \nconcerns, it would not be fair to take up this amendment. So I request \nthat this amendment be laid aside at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will yield, I have absolutely no \nobjection. I was not aware of Senator Harkin's situation, and I will \ncertainly defer it until he can be here. I have no objection.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. While we have a few moments, I thought I would describe \na couple of sections of this bill. One that might be of interest to our \ncolleagues deals with the vehicle program description.\n  This bill contains a significant amount of funding for the Treasury's \nlaw enforcement activities. Senator Kohl and myself are very strong \nsupporters of Treasury's law enforcement efforts.\n  As our colleagues know, in our fiscal year 1998 bill, we included a \nrequest for GAO to do a study on the utilization of vehicles by \nTreasury's law enforcement bureaus. I have to tell you at the outset, \nthis committee does all it can to\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\nensure that the law enforcement agents within Treasury are well \nequipped to do their duties.\n  However, when I became chairman of the subcommittee, I noticed that \nall law enforcement bureaus in Treasury would put forth requests for \nnew vehicles, stating that many of their vehicles ``were well above GSA \nstandards,'' which in this case means the speedometers said 100,000 \nmiles or more on them.\n  Upon further discussion with the bureaus, it became apparent that \nagents have door-to-door use of their vehicles. The rationale here was, \nif the law enforcement officer is called for duty during their off-duty \nhours, they need to be able to reach the scene in a vehicle which is up \nto law enforcement standards.\n  Having been a former law enforcement officer myself, as I mentioned \nearlier in the day, I understand and support that rationale that agents \nmust have a vehicle in case they are called to duty unexpectedly. But I \ndo have some difficulty with the fact that it appears that all agents \nare getting cars which they use for home-to-work transportation, \nregardless of their position, regardless of the probability of being \ncalled while they are at home at all.\n  The GAO study told us that there is no consistent management of these \nvehicles, nor is there any determination of need based on how likely it \nis for one agent to be called to duty once at home. Many of our \ncolleagues may not know this, but when the Government purchases a law \nenforcement vehicle, it is different from a vehicle that we drive on \nthe highway. For example, it has to be especially equipped with a \nlarger engine, sometimes the springs or shocks are reworked, and they \ncertainly have special radios, and it is not uncommon for this special \nequipment to cost $10,000 or more per vehicle.\n  Therefore, when the vehicles are used for transportation to and from \nwork, the useful life of the vehicle is certainly decreased, and the \nGovernment carries the burden of replacing the vehicles sooner than \nthey had planned. Given our tighter budgets, I felt the Treasury needed \nto get a handle on how they manage this vehicle pool. This year alone, \nthe Treasury requested approximately $30 million to acquire new \nvehicles. Currently, the bureau manages the usage terms of the vehicles \nand all the associated costs in a rather indiscriminate fashion. In \nTreasury's defense, we were pleased to see that they had requested $1 \nmillion in this year's budget for a vehicle tracking program, which we \nhave funded.\n  What we did not fund was the acquisition of new vehicles beyond what \nthe bureaus are already carrying in their budgets. However, I should \nmake it clear that there is funding contained in each bureau's budget \nto cover the cost of replacing the oldest vehicles. So what we are \nreally doing here is maintaining the current fleet while replacing the \noldest, while not adding to the total number of vehicles in the fleet. \nThe rationale here is that the Treasury needs to put this management \nsystem in place before we appropriate additional moneys to purchase \neven more new vehicles. I tell my colleagues, it is a very plain and \nsimple, good Government provision. Senator Kohl and I support law \nenforcement agents within the Treasury, but I cannot imagine that each \nand every one of them will have a reasonable chance to be called for \nduty every night.\n  As an appropriator, I think it is my responsibility to ask questions \nabout cost management, and we have told the agencies that we will hold \nthem accountable for their costs. In this case, it is vehicle usage \nwhich directly impacts the life of the vehicle and ultimately the cost \nto the Government. During fiscal year 1998, the Department of the \nTreasury spent a great amount of money for vehicle-related expenses.\n  I believe this is a much-needed step, and I hope this new vehicle \nmanagement program will improve Treasury's ability to accurately \nproject vehicle replacement, maintenance, and need for new vehicles. In \naddition, I hope the Treasury's program will include the impact that \nportal-to-portal usage has on the maintenance or life of the vehicle. \nWe are certainly looking forward to working with the Treasury to put \nthis new system in place.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3355\n\n   (Purpose: To extend certain prohibitions relating to undetectable \n                               firearms)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to continue \nprotecting our airports and our government buildings from terrorist \nthreats. Our proposal would extend the already existing ban on \nundetectable firearms--guns that don't set off metal detectors--for \nfive more years.\n  In 1988, we passed the Undetectable Firearms Act to bar the \nmanufacture, sale, and possession of any firearm that is not detectable \nby metal detectors or the type of x-ray machines commonly used at \nairports. It passed unanimously in the Senate. It was endorsed by the \nNRA, and the NRA has no objection to this amendment being offered \ntoday.\n  At the time we passed this law, ``plastic'' or undetectable guns were \nnot yet developed. But Congress was concerned that technology might \nmake ``plastic'' guns possible. Ten years later, plastic guns are still \nnot a problem. This law deserves some for that. In fact, on a few \noccasions, ATF has refused to approve guns intended for commercial \ndistribution because the guns didn't have enough metal in them.\n  The Act, however, is scheduled to ``sunset'' this December. The \nsunset provision exists because in 1988 it was predicted that new \ntechnology would soon be able to detect non-metallic firearms. \nUnfortunately, technology has not developed so rapidly, so extension of \nthis law appears to be warranted.\n  While the Department of Treasury has requested a permanent extension, \nwe propose a five year extension. A five year extension allows us to \nstudy whether a permanent law is necessary, and whether non-detectable \nguns are really a possibility.\n  But an extension is appropriate, especially in light of recent \nevents. Indeed, several years ago, it was reported that the columnist \nJack Anderson sneaked a ``plastic gun'' past security into the Capitol. \nMore recently, the New York Times reported that tiny guns made to look \nlike ``key chains'' could get around metal detectors in Europe.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration. I ask for unanimous consent that it be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3355.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 104, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 644. EXTENSION OF SUNSET PROVISION.\n\n       Section 2(f)(2) of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 \n     (18 U.S.C. 922 note) is amended by striking ``(2)'' and all \n     that follows through ``10 years'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Sunset.--Effective 15 years''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this amendment is not new language, as \nSenator Kohl has alluded, because under current law, there was an \noriginal ban of 10 years. This simply extends that current language for \nanother 5 years.\n  I have checked with the majority, and the people I have checked with \nso far are supportive of this amendment, but Senator Hatch has asked if \nwe can lay this amendment aside for a few minutes because he would like \nto read it more carefully, if that is acceptable to Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. KOHL. That is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have just returned from a most moving \nceremony in the great Rotunda of the Capitol. The flag-draped coffins \nof Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson, who died while doing their \nsolemn duties protecting the public, the employees, and the members of \nthe institution they served, rested imposingly on catafalques, mere \nyards from where these two brave men were brutally cut down by an armed \nassailant on last Friday. The sublime majesty of the great marble dome \nrising above us was somehow magnified by the solemn and eerie silence \nwhich was broken only by an occasional cough. The sense of loss was \npalpable. Sadness permeated the very air.\n  Such times as these cause all of us to ponder anew the fragile \nbrevity and uncertainty of the human condition. Officer Chestnut was \napparently writing directions for a tourist--doing a kind deed--when \nhis life was suddenly ended. I am sure that when he arose and dressed \nfor work on Friday morning he expected nothing more than an ordinary \nday, followed by a night at home with his family and the simple \npleasures of a sunny weekend.\n  Officer Gibson, as he began his day, likewise, probably had no \nexpectations of the bloody gun battle which would, in just hours, mean \nhis death. It is at times like these, when we witness the anguish of \nfamilies and friends trying to cope with the incomprehensible reality \nof brutal and sudden death, that some may wonder how a just God could \nallow such seemingly mindless violence and misery. In the face of such \ntragedies, some may even question the very existence of a Creator. We \nreach for answers that elude our grasp. Why do such things happen? \nWhat, after all, is the point of human existence? It seems that our \nfaith is tested most severely when good men senselessly die.\n  Yet, the proof of a living Creator is in abundant evidence all around \nus. It is in the perfection and order of the natural world in which we \nlive. It is in the beauty and endless variety of the millions of \nspecies which inhabit the planet. It is in the mystery and complexity \nof the human genetic code. It is in the intangible and unconquerable \nbravery of the human spirit. It is in the magnificence of the wonders \nwhich modern science daily unveils. And I, for one, find no disparity \nbetween scientific discovery and God's living word in the Holy Bible.\n  Genesis, the first book of the Bible, gives the account of all \nCreation, tells of the establishment of the family, the origin of sin, \nthe giving of divine revelation, the development of the human race, and \nthe inauguration of God's plan of redemption through its chosen people. \nGenesis takes the reader to the moment when the omnipotent Creator \nspoke into being the matchless wonders of sun, moon, stars, planets, \ngalaxies, plants, and moving creatures, and man, whom He made in His \nimage. It is the first book of the Pentateuch, which both Scripture and \ntradition attribute to Moses.\n  If a student expects to find in Genesis a scientific account of how \nthe world came into existence, with all questions concerning primitive \nlife answered in technical language familiar to the professor or \nstudent of science, he will be disappointed. Genesis is not an attempt \nto answer such questions. It deals with matters far beyond the realm of \nscience. Yet, I have not personally read of any disagreement within the \nscience community concerning the chronological order of the events of \ncreation as set forth in the book of Genesis. Instead of disagreement, \nit has been my perception that there is agreement.\n  The opening sentence of the first chapter of Genesis states, ``In the \nbeginning God created the heaven and the earth.'' That is as far back \nin time as one can get--``in the beginning.'' And it could include a \nbillion years or ten billion years or 500 billion years.\n  The second sentence of Genesis, Chapter 1, reads as follows: ``And \nthe earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of \nthe deep.'' I doubt that any scientist would disagree with this.\n  According to the account in Genesis, God then divided the light from \nthe darkness, and scientists agree that there could have been cosmic \nlight before the sun, moon and stars were created. The Creator then \nproceeded to divide the waters and to let the dry land appear. The dry \nland was called ``earth,'' and the gathering together of the waters was \ncalled ``seas.''\n  The next step as related by Genesis was the bringing forth of grass, \nthe herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit.\n  Then, according to Genesis, God said, ``Let the waters bring forth \nabundantly the moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly \nabove the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n  ``And God created great whales, and every living creature that \nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, \nand every winged fowl after his kind.''\n  On the scientific side, facts from fossils, plus other data, have \nshown that mammals (animals with solid bones, warm blood, lungs that \nbreathe air, and nourish their young with milk) form the final stage in \na long series of development, which began with tiny sea-dwelling \ncreatures. Scientists seem to think that an early type of fish was the \nancestor of amphibians and thereafter evolved into mammal-like \nreptiles. The primitive amphibians also branched into creatures with \nwings and thus became birds and other fowl. Great changes occurred over \ntime. Primitive true mammals, according to science, lived during the \nage of reptiles and these were the probable ancestors of the mammals \nalive today.\n  Returning, now, to the biblical account of Creation, by the \nconclusion of the ``fifth day,'' God had said: ``Let the earth bring \nforth the living creatures after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, \nand beast of the earth after his kind,'' and, in the ``sixth day,'' God \nsaid: ``Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them \nhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, \nand over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping \nthing that creepeth upon the earth.''\n  We have reached the ``sixth day'' in the biblical account. A day, in \nGod's divine revelation to Moses, evidently meant a period of some \nundetermined length. In Psalm 90--a prayer of Moses--we are told: \n``Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed \nthe earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art \nGod. . . . For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when \nit is past, and as a watch in the night.''\n  Regardless of the length of the Creation ``days'', in the sixth, all \npreparations had been completed for the advent of man. ``So God created \nman''--we are told--``in His own image, in the image of God created He \nhim; male and female created He them.''\n  On the seventh day, God rested from his work. Hence, both science and \nthe Bible seem to agree, in broad terms, regarding the chronological \norder of the events of Creation.\n  The modern explanation of evolution dates from 1859, when Charles \nDarwin published the ``Origin of Species.'' According to Darwin, \nmembers of each species compete with each other for a chance to live, \nas well as with members of different species. In this competition\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nany helpful variation gives its owner an advantage over others in the \nspecies that are not so well adapted. Members with such variations, \ntherefore, will win the struggle for existence. They will live and \nreproduce their kind, while forms not so well equipped will die. Darwin \ncalled this process natural selection; it is also referred to as \n``survival of the fittest.''\n  According to a national poll that was published earlier this year, \nonly 40% of the nation's scientists are said to believe in God. I was \namazed that 60% of the scientists, according to the poll, share no \nbelief in a Creator. Darwin, however, apparently did not share such \ndisbelief. Some years ago, I read his ``Origin of Species.'' In this \nbrilliant work of a great British naturalist, I came across this \nincisive question, posed by Darwin himself: ``Have we any right to \nassume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of \nman?''\n  What a pertinent question? I think we human beings are prone to \nforget that the Creator, as Darwin observed, may work by intellectual \npowers unlike those of man.\n  In comparing the eye of a human being to an optical instrument made \nby man, Darwin had this to say: ``If we must compare the eye to an \noptical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of \ntransparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerve \nsensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer \nto be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into \nlayers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different \ndistances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly \nchanging in form. Further, we must suppose that there is a power, \nrepresented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always \nintently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and \ncarefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way \nor in any degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must suppose \neach new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each \nto be preserved until a better one is produced, and then the old ones \nto be all destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight \nalterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and \nnatural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. \nLet this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on \nmillions of individuals of many kinds''--this is the question that \nDarwin poses--``and may we not believe that a living optical instrument \nmight best be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the \nCreator are to those of man?''\n  Thus, Darwin appears to acknowledge a Creator back of the Creation--a \nmaster mind back of the work. I suggest that the 60% of today's \nscientists today who, according to the poll, doubt the existence of a \nCreator, read what Darwin has to say in this regard, if they have not \nalready done so, and if they have already done so, it may be valid for \nthem to read Darwin's observation again.\n  Darwin's work is sprinkled throughout with conjecture, assumptions, \npresumptions, and, in some cases, just plain guess work. For example: \nthe reader often finds such words and phrases as: ``Has probably played \na more important part'', ``there can be little doubt'', ``we may \ninfer'', ``seems probable,'' ``I have come to the conclusion,'' ``it \ncannot be doubted,'' ``I am fully convinced'' --this is Darwin \ntalking--``it must be assumed,'' ``seems to have been,'' ``appears to \nhave played an important part in the origins of our breeds,'' ``seems \nto have been the predominant power,'' ``it is probable that they were \nonce thus connected,'' ``thus it is, as I believe,'' ``bearing such \nfacts in mind, it may be believed,'' ``we may conclude,'' ``seem to \nhave been the chief agents in causing organs to become rudimentary,'' \n``is probably often aided,'' ``is perhaps intelligible by the aid of \nthe hypothesis of pangenesis, and apparently in no other way,'' ``it \nmay be,'' ``every character, however slight, must be the result of some \ndefinite cause,'' ``one chief cause seems to be,'' ``some additional \nrudimentary structures might here have been adduced,'' ``we have only \nto suppose that a former progenitor possessed the parts in question in \na perfect state,'' ``the more complex instincts seem to have originated \nindependently of intelligence,'' ``appears to have been gained,'' \n``such variations appear to arise from the same unknown causes,'' ``it \nis not improbable,'' . . . and so on and so on.\n  Darwin, posing the question, ``whether there exists a Creator and \nRuler of the universe,'' responds. Listen to his response to his own \nquestion: ``And this has been answered in the affirmative by the \nhighest intellects that have ever lived.''\n  Twelve years after the publishing of the ``Origin of Species,'' \nDarwin published ``The Descent of Man.'' In his second book, Darwin \napplied his theory of evolution to the human race. In Chapter IV, \nDarwin makes an interesting admission. Here is what he said:\n\n       I now admit . . . that in the earlier editions of my \n     ``Origin of Species,'' I probably attributed too much to the \n     action of natural selection or the survival of the fittest. I \n     have altered the fifth edition of the Origin so as to confine \n     my remarks to adaptive changes of structure. . . . I may be \n     permitted to say as some excuse, that I had two distinct \n     objects in view, firstly, to show that species had not been \n     separately created, and secondly, that natural selection had \n     been the chief agent of change, though largely aided by the \n     inherited effects of habit, and slightly by the direct action \n     of the surrounding conditions. . . . Hence, if I have erred \n     in giving to natural selection great power, which I am far \n     from admitting, or in having exaggerated its power, which is \n     in itself probable, I have at least, as I hope, done good \n     service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate \n     creations.\n\n  Darwin was not alone in his effort. Since the earliest days of man's \nexploration of his universe, science and religion--when not simply \nignoring each other--have often been at odds. Throughout the ages, it \nseems that the more man has learned about the physical nature of the \nuniverse and its creatures, the greater the gap between religion and \nscience has become.\n  To many in the scientific community, the world has largely become \ndivided between that which can be scientifically and mathematically \nexplained away, and that for which the mathematical equation or \nscientific basis has not yet been discovered. The Creator has had no \nrole. He has been left out. The fabulously intricate pattern of \noccurrences, which had to exist in order to account for the strictly \nscientific view of the creation of the universe, has been viewed as \nmerely chance--a lucky shot!--with no connection to any sort of greater \nintelligence. How absurd!\n  Mr. President, I have in my pocket a gold watch and a golden chain. \nWatches are not in the habit of assembling themselves. There has to be \na designer. There has to be a maker back of the watch, a creator back \nof the chain. There has to be a greater intelligence, a Creator.\n  On the other side, to many of those in the religious community, too \ntightly held religious doctrine has precluded all possibilities \nsuggested by scientific investigation of the physical world.\n  Happily, however, scientists and men of the cloth both appear to be \nrejecting doctrinal absolutism and discovering some common ground.\n  Recent articles in Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report, point to \na change in attitude among scientists and theologians. Rather than \nopposing one another, the study of science and the practice of religion \nmay at last be able to enhance one another. Science may be recognizing \nthat rules, or tangible events, or even the laws of physics may not \nalways be entirely explainable. As we search for scientific truth we \nmay also provoke a faith that instills in the previously cynical, a \nwonder for the unexplainable and a tacit admission that there must be a \nhigher power.\n  In innumerable cases, science is apparently unearthing instances of \nperfection in the physical world which are so far beyond even the \nwildest imaginings of the human mind that chance could not account for \nthem, and even nondevout scientists have tended to conclude that such \nminute miracles can only have been wrought by some form of divine \ndesign.\n  Newsweek, in its edition of July 20, said, ``Physicists have stumbled \nupon signs that the cosmos is custom-made for life and consciousness. \nIt turns out that if the constants of nature--unchanging numbers like \nthe strength of gravity, the charge of an electron and the mass of a \nproton--were even the tiniest bit different, then atoms would not hold \ntogether, stars would not burn, and life would never have made\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\nan appearance.'' As Nobel-prize-winning Physicist and Christian Charles \nTownes put it, ``somehow intelligence must have been involved in the \nlaws of the universe.'' And, consider the words of Physicist-turned-\npriest John Polkinghorne, who said that the most fundamental component \nin the belief in God ``is that there is a mind and a purpose behind the \nUniverse.''\n  Similarly, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report relate the story \nof Allan Sandage, one of the world's most preeminent, respected, and \naccomplished astronomers, who spoke at a recent meeting of cosmologists \ngathered together to consider the theological implications of their \nwork. Sandage, who reportedly admits to having been ``almost a \npracticing atheist as a boy,'' has come to the conclusion through his \nwork that Creation can only be explained as a ``miracle''. ``It is my \nscience that drove me to the conclusion that the world is much more \ncomplicated than can be explained by science. It is only through the \nsupernatural that I can understand the mystery of existence.''\n  I find it rather exhilarating that men like Sandage and Townes and \nPolkinghorne, who have devoted so much of their lives to questioning \ntheir universe in order to discover its secrets, have come to a \nconclusion that to me was answered long ago through simple, basic, \nunquestionable faith, and simple, common-sense reasoning.\n  There are those who will only ever be comfortable with a world of \nrules and measurements, in which events are quantifiable and reliable, \nand a ``miracle'' is defined only as that which has not yet been \nthoroughly dissected and concretely explained. There are also those who \nwill always reject scientific theory if it seems in any way to \nchallenge their religious doctrine.\n  But it seems to me that scientists such as Allan Sandage, who embrace \nboth religion and science, can teach a valuable lesson to us all. A \nblack-and-white science of stiff rules and blinders is fatally flawed. \nIt is the scientist who looks to the heavens for divine intervention \nand is willing to admit that not all things are explainable, who has \nthe greatest opportunity to achieve medical breakthroughs, uncover the \nmysteries of outer space and develop life-changing technologies. His is \nan intellect which is truly free, for he allows for all possibilities.\n  The two great disciplines of the world, science and religion, \nrepresent the ceaseless human probing for answers to the mysteries of \nlife. They are, at their cores, nothing more than man's quest for \ntruth.\n  As we search, may we never close our hearts to the abundant evidence \nof His love and his miracles all around us.\n  Even in the midst of great sorrow and profound tragedy, He is there \nand His love will prevail and will triumph. So my heart goes out today \nto the families of the two brave men whose lives and dedication we \nhonored today in this magnificent Capitol, itself a symbol of man's \nbelief in things which cannot be seen. And I hope that these loved ones \nwill remember the words of hope from the Scriptures and the words of \nWilliam Jennings Bryan:\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn, to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, again the mighty oak, will He \n     leave neglected in the Earth the soul of man, created in his \n     own image.\n       If He stoops to give to the rosebush whose withered \n     blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of \n     another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the \n     sons of men when the frosts of winter come?\n       If matter, mute and inanimate, though changed by the forces \n     of Nature into a multitude of forms, can never be destroyed, \n     will the imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it \n     has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to this tenement of \n     clay?\n       No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent \n     prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted \n     not a single atom in all His creation, has made provision for \n     a future life in which man's universal longing for \n     immortality will find its realization. I am as sure that we \n     live again as I am sure that we live today.\n\n  With those words of William Jennings Bryan, Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9111-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9113-S9130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3355\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nconsider amendment No. 3355, offered by Senator Kohl, and that I be \nadded as a cosponsor. I urge this amendment be adopted. There is \nsupport by both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3355) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I yield time to Senator Hutchinson for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       Tax Code Sunset Amendment\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, shortly I will call up the Tax Code \nsunsetting amendment. I ask unanimous consent to add the following \ncosponsors: Senator Brownback, Senator McCain, Senator Abraham, Senator \nInhofe, Senator Grams, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, Senator Helms, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Coats, Senator Sessions, and Senator \nCoverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nColorado for his leadership on this appropriations bill, his leadership \non tax reform in this Congress, and his support for the provision \nsunsetting the Tax Code. The amendment I will be offering on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Brownback would sunset the entire Tax Code, December \n31, 2002. I appreciate so much the Senator from Colorado in his \ncosponsorship of the original legislation that was introduced, and his \nsupport of this very, very important concept.\n  I also point out to my colleagues, with my appreciation, the various \norganizations that have endorsed the scrapping of the code, the \nsunsetting, the terminating of the existing Tax Code. The Americans for \nHope, Growth and Opportunity, the National Taxpayers Union, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the American Conservative \nUnion, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens for a Sound Economy have \nall lent their support for what I think is an essential step for all of \nus who believe the existing Tax Code does not work for the American \npeople, and that the first step in replacing it with something that is \nsimpler and something that is more fair and something that is less of a \nburden upon the American people would be to set a date certain in which \nwe terminate and sunset the existing Tax Code.\n  Congress recently took an important step to protect the American \npeople from an overarching IRS. In the House, and in the Senate under \nthe leadership of the distinguished Finance Committee chairman, Senator \nRoth, Congress passed the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \nReform Act. Under this legislation, the burden of proof has now been \nshifted to the IRS. A newly restructured IRS will now be overseen by an \nindependent panel, and I commend the work of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and Chairman Roth for bringing this proposal to fruition.\n  But this legislation, which I firmly supported, must not be the end \nof protecting the American taxpayer. On April 2, 1998, the Senate \nexpressed itself on the need for fundamental change in passing an \namendment to the budget resolution, not only to restructure the IRS but \nalso to terminate and sunset the Federal Tax Code by the end of 2001. \nWe passed that sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and we have a list of \nall of those who voted for that sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying \nwe should sunset, we should set a date certain, and we should terminate \nthe existing Tax Code. I invite all my colleagues in the Senate to look \nat that list of those who voted, on both sides of the aisle, on a \nbipartisan basis, to sunset the Tax Code.\n  The House took a bold stride beyond this sense of the Senate in \npassing the Tax Code Termination Act on June 17, 1998.\n  Today, the Senate has the opportunity to do the same. The amendment \nI, along with Senator Brownback and all of our cosponsors, have offered \nto the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, that we will be calling up \nsoon, would eliminate the Tax Code by December 31, 2002. Originally, \nway back\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\nlast year, the original bill introduced would have sunset it back in \nthe year 2000. Then there was an agreement among all the cosponsors to \nmove that to December 31, 2001, to respond to those who said that is \nnot enough time and the new Congress would not have enough time to \nenact comprehensive tax reform.\n  Now, in the spirit of being as responsible as possible, and \nresponding to, I think, the misguided and flawed allegations of the \nadministration concerning Tax Code termination, we have moved that date \nto December 31, 2002. That allows us 4\\1/2\\ years in order to write a \nnew Tax Code. We say, in this amendment, that it should be in place \nJuly 4, prior to the sunset date.\n  I know the Department of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, has sent a letter \nout. Everybody, I am sure, will have seen this letter opposing this \namendment, saying the President is going to veto this appropriations \nbill if the amendment is attached. It is not the first time that those \nkinds of threats have been made. It is, if you will read the letter, \nbased upon misguided and flawed assumptions, making all kinds of \nassumptions as to what might be enacted or what might not be enacted at \nthe time of the sunset date.\n  So I believe what we are proposing is eminently responsible. So we \nneed to join, I believe, the House of Representatives in passing this \nsunset date. It would allow the Social Security provisions, Medicare, \nand the Railroad Retirement Board to remain. But we would say the \nCongress, the President, the American people would replace the current \nTax Code with a lean and honest system by no later than Independence \nDay, July 4, 2002.\n  For too long, the American people have suffered under the chains of \nthe oppressive regime we call our Federal Tax Code. It is just not \nenough to reform the IRS when the more fundamental problem is the Tax \nCode that we ask them to enforce. Each year, Americans spend over 5.4 \nbillion hours slaving away to comply with tax provisions, the \nequivalent amount of time it takes to produce all of the cars in this \ncountry, all of the trucks in this country, to manufacture all of the \nairplanes in this country for a year. That is how much time we ask the \nAmerican people to spend just trying to comply with complicated, \narcane, and inexplicable tax provisions. A humble family of four will \nspend the equivalent of 2 weeks just for Tax Code compliance.\n  Ironically, every year $13.7 billion of the money that taxpayers \nstruggle to pay the Federal Government is spent enforcing tax laws, yet \nthe IRS, the bureaucracy of 110,000 people in over 650 offices \nnationwide, provides misinformation one-fourth of the time taxpayers \ncall to seek assistance.\n  Not too long ago, Money magazine did, as they do every year, an \ninteresting study. They found this: 45, the number of professional tax \npreparers who came up with different answers when asked by Money \nmagazine, in 1997, to fill out a hypothetical family's 1996 tax return. \nThat was the April 1997 edition of Money magazine. They found that 45 \nprofessional tax preparers, with the same information, came up with \ndifferent answers on a hypothetical family's tax return. I think that \nis powerful evidence that we have a Tax Code that even the \nprofessionals cannot understand.\n  They found also that the average hourly fee charged by professional \ntax preparers who came up with the 45 wrong answers is $81 an hour. \nThat is what the American people are paying professional tax preparers \nwho come up with the wrong answers time and time again.\n  Mr. President, 6.4 million--that is the number of taxpayers who \nvisited IRS customer service centers seeking answers to their tax \nquestions in 1996. Over 6 million, according to the General Accounting \nOffice, actually went to the IRS customer service centers seeking \nanswers.\n  Another figure, though, is 99 million, because it was 99 million \ntaxpayers who called the IRS hotlines in 1996 seeking answers to \nquestions about how they could comply with this complicated Tax Code; \n99 million, one-fourth of them getting incorrect answers from the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  The Tax Code is not a stagnant creature. This code has mutated from \nits original form into an 800,000-word, 7,500-page monster preying on \nthe American taxpayer. We in Congress are culpable for this feeding \nfrenzy, for even in our attempts of incremental reform, even in our \nattempts to help the American taxpayer, we have made the Tax Code more \ncomplex.\n  In 1997, Congress made serious attempts to ease the burdens of the \nAmerican taxpayer. It was the first significant tax cut, I think, in 16 \nyears. Yet, even in those efforts to provide tax relief, we unwittingly \ncreated new complications. I think everyone in this body would agree if \nwe somehow could just start over and write a tax code, there is not one \nof us who would say, ``Write the Tax Code the way we have it now,'' \nbecause it has been a creation of these incremental changes made by \nspecial interest groups who had enough power to get that change enacted \ninto law.\n  We need to terminate, not complicate, the Tax Code. If you look at \nthis chart, it says:\n\n       The number of new sections in the Tax Code created by the \n     1997 Budget Act--\n\n  This was our Tax Relief Act--we created 285 new sections.\n  The number of changes in the Tax Code accompanying the 1997 tax cut, \n824, and the number of pages needed by the Research Institute of \nAmerica to explain the changes in the tax law of 1997 was 3,132 pages. \nIt was a lawyer's dream and tax accountant's dream when we passed that \nTax Relief Act.\n  While the American people were glad to receive some tax cuts --the \n$500-per-child tax cut, the change in the estate tax laws, change in \nthe capital gains tax laws--the fact is, the great winners were the tax \nlawyers and the accountants--3,132 pages just to explain what we did in \ncutting taxes.\n  The American people have called for this termination, this \ncomprehensive reform of our tax laws. A recent poll that was conducted \nby the Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity discovered several \nthings. In asking the question, ``Do you approve or disapprove of a new \nFederal law to abolish the current tax system and require that a new \nFederal tax system be approved by Congress by July 4, 2001, and that \nthis new system should then take effect 6 months after that date?''\n  The response was 48.9 percent approved of that proposition, which we \nare going to be voting on, while only 24.1 percent disapproved. By a \nmargin of 2 to 1, the American people are saying we ought to set a date \ncertain. Six months prior to that date certain, we should have a new \ncomprehensive fair tax system in place.\n  The poll went ahead: ``Do you approve or disapprove of a new Federal \nlaw to abolish the current tax system and require that a new Federal \ntax system be approved by Congress July 4, 2002?''\n  Overwhelming support.\n  They asked this question: ``If you knew that Congress passed a law to \ncreate a new Federal Tax Code with the following specific principles: \napply one low tax rate to all Americans; provide tax relief for working \nAmericans; protect the rights of taxpayers and reduce tax collection \nabuses; eliminate bias against savings and investment; promote economic \ngrowth and job creation; and not penalize marriage or families--do you \nbelieve it is possible that Congress could accomplish these goals?''\n  That was the question, and 57.3 percent of Americans answered yes, \nwith 34.1 percent saying no, and 8.6 percent saying they did not know \nor refusing to answer.\n  That is really quite remarkable, because what that response tells us \nis that the American people still have faith that their elected \nrepresentatives can and should replace the current tax system with a \nsimpler, fairer system. They think we can do it.\n  Americans rapidly, though, I believe are reaching the level of \noutrage about this tax cut that would resemble even the kind of tax \nrebellion that occurred in the early days of this Republic in 1776. As \nan aside, I offer my own statistic. No official poll. No Gallup. No \nscientific sample. But I suggest this: That 100 percent of the people \nin this country and 100 Senators in this institution believe that an \noverhaul of the tax system is overdue and that it should occur.\n  Mr. President, in the Senate today, we have three options before us--\nand I can't find another--we have these three options confronting every \nSenator in\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\nthis body: We can ignore the plight of the American taxpayer and do \nnothing. That is what we have done for far too long. We have done \nnothing. We have passed resolutions. We have passed sense of the \nSenates. We have made speeches, and we have debated. We have introduced \nbills, and we have even passed tax cuts that further complicated the \nTax Code. But in the end, what we have really done about comprehensive \ntax reform is nothing.\n  Tonight we have that option before us. We can continue to do nothing. \nWe can vote down this amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill, or we can move to table it when it is offered, and we can go down \nthe path of defending the status quo. I suspect there will be a lot of \nmy colleagues who will make that choice tonight.\n  Or we can implement incremental reforms and try our best to make \nrepairs to a house built on shifting sand as we have almost every year \nfor the last 12 years. In fact, one study found that since 1913, since \nthe institution of the income tax, we have added about 100 pages to the \nTax Code every year; on average, 100 pages are added to the Tax Code.\n  We can continue to do that. We can continue to make small incremental \nchanges in this complicated Tax Code and hope that somehow we are able \nto repair this house that is built on shifting sand. I do not believe \nthat is a viable option.\n  This is the third thing we can do: We can lay a solid foundation for \na new house by voting for real reform, the termination of the current \nTax Code. I believe the choice is clear.\n  Secretary Rubin, President Clinton and other critics of this proposal \nwill say that sunsetting is reckless. I suggest that when the opponents \nof this rise to oppose this amendment, that is what we are going to \nhear: ``This is a reckless proposal.'' We will hear it over and over.\n  They have characterized it as irresponsible, reckless, certain to \ncause uncertainty. The President wants to pretend that sunsetting \nprovisions are somehow unusual, somehow irresponsible. They are \nneither. He would have us believe they create paralyzing uncertainty, \nand yet if you will look at the sunset provisions that we have in law, \nall major spending legislation is sunsetted. We recently debated \nlegislation to replace both the Higher Education Act and the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act, the ISTEA bill, both of which \nexpired this year due to sunset provisions included in the original \nlegislation. All major spending legislation contains sunsetting \nprovisions. Sunsetting forces Congress to periodically review the \nmerits, effectiveness and efficiency of the programs it creates. Only \nthen can these programs be continued.\n  In testimony before Congress, Alan Greenspan expressed his support \nfor the concept of sunsetting. He is the guru, many believe, of the \nunprecedented period of economic expansion, but he said he believed \nthat everything in Government should face these sunset provisions.\n  The President has said he believes sunsetting will cause instability. \nI believe we are going to hear that. He imagines that the current tax \nsystem is somehow stable. The truth is, the current Tax Code is riddled \nwith uncertainty. The only certainty in this system is that it will \nbecome more complex through incremental reform and that special \ninterests will thread their way through these special loopholes.\n\n  To my colleagues who say this is going to create uncertainty, this is \nmy response: If you believe that we need to get from where we are to a \nsimpler, fairer tax system, there is no way, I suggest, to get from \nwhere we are to where we all want to be without some degree of \nuncertainty. You cannot replace this entire Tax Code, no matter how \nincremental you may do it, over a long period of time without there \nbeing certain uncertainties in markets or business planning or \nwhatever.\n  But I suggest what Senator Brownback and myself have proposed is the \nmost rational way to get from where we are to comprehensive tax reform. \nBecause we allow 4\\1/2\\ years, we set a date certain, we ensure that \nthere are going to be proper oversight hearings by the Finance \nCommittee, that all of the various proposals that have been submitted \nwill have ample time for debate, and that the American people and the \nAmerican business community will have adequate time to plan for the \nchanges that will be enacted.\n  I would assume that those changes would be phased in over a period of \nyears as well. But what we have proposed is eminently responsible, not \ngoing to create uncertainty, and is not reckless. It is only those who \nwant to defend the status quo, I believe, who throw out those kinds of \narguments.\n  I have a number of other points I would like to make, and perhaps as \nthe debate goes on I will have an opportunity to do that. I know there \nare a number of others who are cosponsors of this legislation who will \nbe wanting to seek recognition.\n  Senator Warner has requested a period of time to discuss the Capitol \nsecurity program and the new visitor center. I know that is something \nthat is heavy on all of our minds today. And Senator Brownback is \ncertainly willing to postpone his comments.\n  At this point I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We have several Senators who want to speak in \nopposition to this amendment who are not on the floor yet, but I ask \nunanimous consent that we lay the present amendment aside for the \npurpose of allowing Senator Warner from Virginia to introduce another \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been offered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3356\n\n(Purpose: To require the Administrator of General Services to acquire a \nlease for the Department of Transportation headquarters and to provide \n        additional funding for security for the Capitol complex)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Mr. Chafee, \n     for himself, Mr. Warner and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3356.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 47, strike lines 11 and 12.\n       On page 62, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4____. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HEADQUARTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of General Services, \n     without further review or approval by any other office of the \n     executive branch, shall--\n       (1) acquire an operating lease for the Department of \n     Transportation headquarters; and\n       (2) commence procurement of the lease not later than \n     November 1, 1998;\n\n     in accordance with the authorizing resolutions passed by the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate on \n     November 6, 1997, and the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives on July 23, \n     1997.\n       (b) Authorization To Reduce Annual Lease Amounts.--In order \n     to procure an operating lease, the Administrator of General \n     Services shall reduce the annual lease amounts authorized by \n     the resolutions to such extent as is necessary to effectuate \n     an operating lease at the time at which the lease is \n     executed.\n\n     SEC. 4____. SECURITY OF CAPITOL COMPLEX.\n\n       There is appropriated to the Architect of the Capitol for \n     costs associated with the security of the Capitol complex \n     $14,105,000.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the Department \nof Transportation headquarters and redirects the funds for Capitol \nsecurity. I know Senator Warner would like to speak to this. I yield \nhim time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of the \nbill. I will speak to the amendment. I would suggest, however, as I am \nspeaking, that the distinguished managers look at what possibly could \nbe a rewrite of the bill; and then at such time, if you agree, we will \nsubstitute this for the one that is at the desk.\n  Mr. President, I wish to just speak briefly, as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, on behalf of the work that our committee has been doing \nsince I have been privileged to take over the chairmanship.\n  We have been looking at, first, a program by which the security of \nthe overall square here--we call it a square--\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\nboth the building security and the outside security can be enhanced.\n  There is an ongoing--almost weekly--meeting on security at some level \nin this system. The Rules Committee has given the clearest instructions \nto the Architect of the Capitol, indeed, to the chief of the police, \nand others, to bring to the attention of the committee, and others, any \nnew type of equipment or concept that can help improve the security of \nthe Nation's Capitol. That has been done, and done very, very well.\n  On August 20 of last year--about a year ago--a plan was put forward \nentitled ``United States Capitol Square Perimeter Security Plan.'' A \nhearing was held before my committee, the Rules Committee, on September \n25, and the Rules Committee accepted the plan on November 4, 1997. It \nwas a concept to upgrade the security on the exterior of the building.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an executive summary of \nthat report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   United States Capitol Square Perimeter Security--Executive Summary\n\n       This report was prepared by the Task Force appointed by the \n     Capitol Police Board (CPB). The membership of the Task Force \n     consists of representatives of the House and Senate Sergeants \n     at Arms, the U.S. Capitol Police and the Architect of the \n     Capitol. Technical support was provided by outside security \n     and architectural consultants.\n       In light of recent incidents at other public and private \n     facilities, the CPB charged the Task Force with developing \n     options for improved perimeter security at Capitol Square. \n     The options were to incorporate the best available \n     technology, blend with the existing historic Frederick Law \n     Olmsted landscape design and provide for an appropriate and \n     cost effective coupling of these improvements with the \n     security concepts and criteria employed in the design of the \n     proposed U.S. Capitol Visitor Center (CVC).\n       Four preliminary schemes were developed for evaluation by \n     the Task Force ranging from the simple replacement of the \n     concrete sewer pipes and planters with bollards to an \n     extensive perimeter fence concept that enclosed Capitol \n     Square behind the appropriately designed security barrier.\n       Of the four schemes, one was chosen for development and \n     forms the basis for the recommendations. The recommended \n     scheme will work within the current constraints of the site \n     and will also support the CVC concept when executed.\n       The recommended and preliminary schemes built upon the \n     concepts developed in the late 1980's that came to be known \n     as the ``Whip's Plan'' and expanded those concepts to \n     incorporate the proposed CVC and improved security \n     technology. The primary focus of the current effort is to \n     enhance the deterrents, detection and response capabilities \n     of security systems both existing and planned. In addition, \n     support was also provided by the U.S. Secret Service and \n     other law enforcement entities with overlapping \n     jurisdictional concerns.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Standards for systems, hardware and physical barrier \n     devices were developed as part of the process. These \n     standards are included in the recommended scheme. The systems \n     and other security methodologies used in the recommended \n     scheme for Capitol Square have been organized in a manner \n     that will enable them to be deployed consistently through the \n     Capitol complex.\n       In that regard, a schematic design was also prepared that \n     eliminates the unsightly concrete ``Jersey' barriers, \n     commonly used along highways, from around the Russell, \n     Dirksen and Hart Senate Office Buildings and replaces them \n     with landscaped roundabouts similar to those being proposed \n     for the North and South Entrances of the U.S. Capitol \n     Building. The designs for both Capitol Square and the \n     exterior areas around the Senate Office Buildings are \n     proposed with thoughtful landscape treatments consistent with \n     existing architectural openness and aesthetics that typifies \n     the Capitol complex today. This work is shown to test and \n     expand the concepts on sites contiguous to Capitol Square.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. WARNER, Mr. President, integral to that plan is a visitor center \nwhich, while it has been considered separately, it is to be tied in \nwith the overall Capitol security plan.\n  Tomorrow, the Rules Committee will, hopefully, proceed with a markup \nof a redraft of a bill submitted by the distinguished majority leader, \nthe minority leader, and myself several months ago. There are meetings \ngoing on right now with the Speaker, with the majority leader, and, \nindeed, their counterparts in the minority, to try to get some \nrefinements to the concept which, hopefully, will be put into the \nmarkup tomorrow before the Rules Committee.\n  I am proud to say the Senate has been moving with steady, firm \nmomentum on this whole concept of security--both external and \ninternal--for some months now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the distinguished Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell from myself and others asking that this \nparticular amendment reflect the change of the status of the funds \nwhich is in the amendment--it is in section 4, ``Security Of Capitol \nComplex . . . is appropriated to the Architect of the Capitol for costs \nassociated with the security of the Capitol complex $14,105,000.''\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Environment and Public Works,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1998.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and \n         General Government, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and \n         General Government, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Campbell and Ranking Member Kohl: We write to \n     request your assistance in resolving an important matter \n     involving the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), its \n     thousands of headquarters employees, and the taxpayers.\n       As you know, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n     at the Administration's behest and the personal request of \n     the Secretary of Transportation, has been working to \n     authorize suitable housing arrangements for DOT headquarters. \n     DOT currently occupies the Nassif Building, which has been \n     under Federal lease for nearly 30 years. However, the \n     building is inadequate for DOT needs and may pose health \n     concerns for the 5,600 DOT employees who work at that \n     location.\n       The lease on the Nassif Building expires in March of 2000, \n     presenting the government with an opportunity to obtain new \n     housing for DOT. Toward that end, on November 6, 1997, the \n     Committee approved a resolution authorizing the General \n     Services Administration (GSA) to enter into a long-term \n     operating lease for a headquarters building, with the \n     possibility of government ownership at a later point. The \n     terms of the Committee's resolution were based on discussions \n     with, and approved by, Administration officials.\n       Since that time, however, the Administration has changed \n     its position and prefers a government owned building. Its \n     FY99 budget request included $14.1 million for the design \n     costs associated with the construction of a new government-\n     owned building. This change has resulted in an eight month \n     delay--a delay that has meant no relief for DOT employees, \n     and is threatening to result in significantly higher interim \n     lease payments by the government.\n       More importantly, while construction of a government-owned \n     building may be a cost-effective solution to DOT's housing \n     needs over the long term, we are concerned that such an \n     option is not realistic in light of our limited budgetary \n     resources. Frankly, we are skeptical that the $300 million \n     necessary for construction of a government-owned building \n     will be made available over the next few years, given the \n     backlog for priority courthouse construction. Should the \n     money become available, however, the Committee's resolution \n     explicitly invites the Administration to return to request \n     authority for government ownership. We have expressed these \n     views in recent meetings and discussions with Administration \n     officials from DOT, GSA, and the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB).\n       Therefore, we believe that it is critical for GSA to move \n     ahead immediately with the lease procurement. Toward that \n     end, we would propose to work with you and your staff to \n     include language in S. 2312 that would ensure that the \n     Solicitation for Offers goes forward. Furthermore, in order \n     to send a clear and unambiguous signal to the Administration \n     to proceed expeditiously, we request that the current earmark \n     of $14.1 million for design of a new DOT building be deleted. \n     We consider this request to be of the utmost importance, as \n     we wish to resolve this situation for the benefit of the \n     Department, DOT employees, and the taxpayer.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our request. Attached \n     is the text of our proposed amendment; we look forward to \n     working with you toward a satisfactory resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n         Max Baucus, John Warner, Bob Graham, Daniel Moynihan, Joe \n           Lieberman, James Inhofe, Craig Thomas, Kit Bond, Frank \n           R. Lautenberg, John H. Chafee, Tim Hutchinson, Wayne \n           Allard, Dirk Kempthorne, Barbara Boxer, Ron Wylen, Jeff \n           Sessions, Bob Smith.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment is really twofold: one, to transfer those \nfunds; and, secondly, to establish a procedure by which the other \nproblem can be taken care of. I know right now the manager of the bill \nis comparing the two amendments.\n  I believe our distinguished chairman of the full committee, Senator \nChafee,\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\nis here to speak to the DOT headquarters issue.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is incorporated in the amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that this amendment regarding the DOT building and the \nlease arrangement is acceptable by the managers. While I----\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. Could I finish my statement and then you \naddress that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have nothing further to say. If they are prepared to \ntake that part, I am delighted.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I thank the chairman, and I appreciate \nhis work.\n  The funds are transferred. As soon as we can reconcile some minor \ntechnical differences between the amendment at the desk and another \ncopy, I say to our chairman, we will soon vote on that amendment. The \nletter I just had printed in the Record sets forth the chronology.\n  Now, the reason that we are transferring this money is that--I am \nspeaking for myself, but I am very optimistic that under the leadership \nof Senators Lott and Daschle, the Senate will come together in its \nconcept for funding for the visitor center and its concept of how we \ncan make some adjustments to the previous plan, and tomorrow in markup \nreport out a bill which can then be considered by the full Senate and \nthen eventually by the House.\n  But I would like to read a little background to show you the need for \nmoving ahead. Yes, the tragic events of the last few days--and we have \njust completed what I regard as a magnificent --magnificent--tribute to \nthe two fallen Capitol policemen, together with their families, the \nPresident of the United States, the Vice President of the United \nStates, Senator Lott, the Speaker, and Chief of Police Albrecht.\n  But we have been moving steadily on this program. Now we intend, \nhopefully, to go and take the next step and put a legislative proposal \nbefore the Senate; and then, hopefully, the House will act.\n  I will read from a CRS report, which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record, dated July 16, 1998.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Capitol Hill Security: Capabilities and Planning\n\n               (From the Congressional Research Service)\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The U.S. Capitol is simultaneously a national shrine, \n     tourist attraction, and working office building. Each of \n     these functions imposes different security requirements. The \n     Capitol Police Board, established by Congress to protect the \n     Capitol complex, has responsibility to reconcile the needs of \n     safety and openness. Acting under the direction of House and \n     Senate oversight and appropriations committees, the board has \n     recently instituted numerous enhancements to the Capitol \n     security system. To further enhance security, Congress in \n     April appropriated $20 million for a perimeter security plan \n     encompassing Capitol Square, Senate office buildings, and \n     adjacent grounds. Implementation of the plan is contingent \n     upon approval by the appropriate congressional oversight \n     committees. Still under consideration are proposals calling \n     for a visitors' center beneath the east front plaza that \n     would provide more effective remote screening of Capitol \n     visitors, and a perimeter security plan for the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Seven to 10 million tourists visit the Capitol complex \n     annually. In 1997, the Capitol hosted more than 2,000 \n     American and foreign dignitaries, and was the site for nearly \n     300 scheduled demonstrations. In addition to lawmakers and \n     their staff, a sizable number of journalists, lobbyists, and \n     service personnel also work within the Capitol complex.\n       The challenge of achieving a secure environment for the \n     Capitol complex, while still maintaining an atmosphere of \n     openness, has become increasingly difficult in this century. \n     Both the potential threats to the Capitol and the number of \n     people using the area every day have grown dramatically. \n     Incidents such as the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center \n     and the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building \n     in Oklahoma City, as well as international confrontations \n     like Desert Storm in 1991, have prompted increases in the \n     level of security afforded the Capitol complex.\n\n\n                      current security procedures\n\n                    Role of the U.S. Capitol Police\n\n       The U.S. Capitol Police force, under the direction of the \n     Capitol Police Board (which is composed of the Architect of \n     the Capitol and the Sergeants at Arms of the House and \n     Senate), is responsible for Capitol complex security. By law, \n     the Capitol Police are responsible for the procurement, \n     installation, and maintenance of security systems for the \n     Capitol, House and Senate office buildings, and adjacent \n     grounds, subject to the direction of the Committee on House \n     Oversight, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and \n     the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The \n     Architect of the Capitol must approve any alteration to \n     structural, mechanical, or architectural features of the \n     Capitol complex buildings that is required for a security \n     system. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees must \n     approve funding for these programs.\n       In FY 1997, Congress appropriated $75.4 million for the \n     Capitol Police Board, which included funding for the Capitol \n     Police, and $3.25 million for the design and installation of \n     new and expanded security systems. In addition, the Architect \n     of the Capitol received $250,000 for ``architectural and \n     engineering services related to the design and installation'' \n     of those systems. For FY 1998, Congress appropriated $74 \n     million for the Capitol Police Board, including funding for \n     1,255 Capitol Police positions.\n\n                      Regular Security Procedures\n\n       The Capitol Police force is prepared to deal with a wide \n     array of challenges, including armed intruders, bomb threats, \n     and chemical and biological warfare. Metal detectors, X-ray \n     machines, other state-of-the-art security and surveillance \n     systems, and uniformed officers are located at the entrances \n     of all 19 buildings comprising the Capitol Hill complex. \n     Inside the Capitol, security cameras and motion detectors \n     monitor the movement of people. Uniformed and plain-clothes \n     officers are stationed in the House and Senate chambers, and \n     throughout the building. All trucks making deliveries to the \n     Capitol must first go to a central delivery site where the \n     contents are unloaded and subjected to X-ray, weapons, and K-\n     9 inspections before being delivered. K-9 units also perform \n     random sweeps for explosives in adjacent streets and parking \n     garages.\n\n                           Specialized Units\n\n       The Capitol Police also have several specialized units to \n     deal with particular types of security threats. Each of these \n     units, except for the hazardous devices unit, works \n     with other units on other assignments, including street \n     patrols. The specialized units, which were created to \n     address organizational concerns and assure appropriate \n     responses to new kinds of perceived threats, include the: \n     first responder unit, the first to arrive when there is an \n     emergency; mountain bike unit, used for increased mobility \n     across the Capitol grounds when a situation requires quick \n     access to a site; containment and emergency response unit, \n     used for counter-terrorism, hostage rescues, dignitary \n     protection, and chemical/biological warfare situations; \n     hostage negotiations unit, with primary responsibility for \n     all hostage negotiations, frequently assisted by the \n     containment and emergency response unit; civil disturbance \n     unit, responsible for monitoring large demonstrations when \n     the potential for significant public disturbances exists; \n     and hazardous devices unit, acts as the bomb squad on \n     Capitol Hill, conducts off-site explosives security for \n     Members, maintains a K-9 explosives detection corps, and \n     is slated to take over chemical/biological warfare \n     response functions.\n\n           Enhanced Capabilities of the Capitol Police Force\n\n       In recent years, the Capitol Police force, with the \n     concurrence of Congress and the Capitol Police Board, has \n     enhanced its capabilities and professionalism by: increasing \n     the training opportunities available to members of the force; \n     creating a physical security division charged with the \n     development and implementation of an integrated security plan \n     for the entire Capitol complex; strengthening its ability to \n     deter, interdict, and respond to acts of violence through \n     partnership with other U.S. intelligence and security \n     agencies; and developing a chemical/biological incident \n     response capability. It has also created a working group to \n     refine, document, and implement an emergency evacuation plan \n     and critical-incident command operation.\n\n\n                        perimeter security plan\n\n       Subsequent to the developments already described, the \n     Senate Committee on Rules and Administration early in 1997 \n     directed the Capitol Police Board to develop a perimeter \n     security plan for the Capitol complex. For this purpose, the \n     board organized a task force that included key staff from the \n     offices of the Architect of the Capitol, the House and Senate \n     Sergeants at Arms, and the Capitol Police, as well as \n     nationally recognized architectural and security consultants. \n     ``The challenge,'' the Architect emphasized at subsequent \n     hearings, was ``to sensitively integrate a sophisticated \n     security program into the historic landscape of the Capitol \n     grounds and the fabric of the incomparable complex of \n     buildings that grace Capitol Hill.''\n       On September 25, 1997, the Architect unveiled the results \n     of the effort, which the Capitol Police Board endorsed, at a \n     Senate Rules Committee oversight hearing. The plan called for \n     ``improved security at all entrances to Capitol Square \n     through the use of a combination of high impact vehicle \n     barriers that are police activated at the most critical \n     locations, or card activated at parking related areas.'' The \n     primary elements of the plan were: (1) ``a continuous string \n     of security bollards similar to those designed for, and \n     installed at, the White House;'' (2) ``new\n\n[[Page S9118]]\n\n     impact stone planters consistent with the Frederick Law \n     Olmsted walls;'' and (3) an ``integration of electronic and \n     other security systems at each entrance.'' The continuous \n     security perimeter would be located largely within Olmsted's \n     original walls, as designed by the acclaimed 19th century \n     landscape architect.\n       A month later, the Rules Committee approved this plan, and \n     also authorized the Architect to move forward immediately in \n     developing perimeter security for the area immediately \n     adjacent to the three Senate office buildings. On April 30, \n     1998, Congress approved $20 million for ``the design, \n     installation and maintenance of the Capitol Square perimeter \n     security plan'' as part of a FY 1998 supplemental \n     appropriations bill, which was signed into law the following \n     day. These funds include $4 million ``for physical security \n     measures associated with'' the plan. Use of the remaining $16 \n     million was discussed in documents provided to the Senate \n     Rules Committee at the September 1997 hearings.\n       The Senate version, as initially reported, provided that \n     funds for perimeter security of Senate office buildings be \n     subject to review and approval by the Senate Appropriations \n     and Rules and Administration Committees. Funds provided for \n     perimeter security of the Capitol Square were subject to \n     review and approval by the House and Senate Appropriations \n     Committees, the Committee on House Oversight, the Speaker \n     of the House, and Senate Rules Committee.\n\n\n                    other current security proposals\n\n                   Proposed Capitol Visitors' Center\n\n       Still pending before Congress is a proposal to construct a \n     visitors' center beneath the east front plaza of the Capitol. \n     This proposal has implications for security enhancement \n     because the center would serve as the primary entrance and \n     exit for visitors, allowing the Capitol Police to screen them \n     more effectively. At the same time the center would create \n     space for several auditoriums, a cafeteria, educational \n     exhibit facilities, restrooms, and a first-aid station. \n     Planning for the visitors' center has been underway since \n     1991, when the Architect of the Capitol received approval to \n     use previously appropriated security enhancement funds for \n     the center's conceptual planning and design.\n       The design was completed in June 1991, and reviewed by the \n     House and Senate Appropriations Committees and the Senate \n     Committee on Rules and Administration. In December 1993, the \n     Capitol Preservation Commission allocated $2.5 million to \n     translate the concept into a formal design. The Architect \n     entered into a contract with RTKL Associates Inc. to develop \n     a design for the visitors' center, and in 1995, the Architect \n     published a report reflecting RTKL's work.\n       H.R. 20 and S. 1508, introduced in 1997, ``authorize the \n     Architect of the Capitol, under the direction of the Capitol \n     Preservation Commission, to plan, construct, equip, \n     administer, and maintain a Capitol Visitor Center,'' and \n     ``reconstruct the East Plaza . . . to enhance its \n     attractiveness, safety, and security.'' S. 1508 would \n     delegate responsibility for the design, installation, and \n     maintenance of the center's security systems to the Capitol \n     Police Board, which would be required to conduct a study \n     assessing ``security cost savings and other benefits \n     resulting from the construction and operation'' of the \n     center.\n       S. 1508 identifies a primary purpose of the center as the \n     enhancement of Capitol security. When it was introduced, \n     Senator John Warner, chairman of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, emphasized that the ``most compelling need \n     for the Capitol Visitor Center is to add a major element of \n     enhanced security for the entire Capitol building and \n     environs.'' During May 1997 hearings on H.R. 20, members of \n     the Police Board stressed that a visitors' center would \n     enable the Capitol Police to regulate the number of people \n     inside the building at a given time, allow them to be better \n     prepared for an orderly evacuation in the event of an \n     emergency, and strengthen the security of the Capitol while \n     preserving free public access.\n       Both bills call for the establishment of a separate account \n     in the Treasury to handle funds for the project. S. 1508 \n     directs the Capitol Preservation Commission to ``develop a \n     detailed plan for financing the project at the lowest net \n     cost to the Government.'' H.R. 20 directs the Architect of \n     the Capitol to develop and submit a plan to the commission \n     ``that would enable construction of the project to be \n     completed without the appropriation of funds to the \n     Legislative Branch.'' The estimated cost of the proposed \n     visitors' center is $125 million. Of this amount, the \n     Commission has already raised $23 million.\n\n               Proposed Supreme Court Perimeter Security\n\n       A related proposal calls for the development of a perimeter \n     security plan for the Supreme Court building and adjacent \n     grounds. In FY 1997, Congress appropriated $150,000 for a \n     preliminary study under the director of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, which was completed by private consultants. In June \n     1998, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist approved the \n     schematic plan presented by the Architect and security \n     consultants. The Court's FY 1999 budget request includes an \n     additional $500,000 for ``detailed design development and \n     preparation of construction drawings'' for this project that \n     are ``consistent with design schemes being implemented \n     through the Capitol complex perimeter security.'' It is \n     estimated that a Supreme Court perimeter security plan would \n     cost approximately $5.1 million.\n  Mr. WARNER. From that report:\n\n       Seven to 10 million tourists visit the Capitol complex \n     annually. In 1997, the Capitol hosted more than 2,000 \n     American and foreign dignitaries, and was the site for nearly \n     300 scheduled demonstrations. In addition to lawmakers and \n     their staff, a sizable number of journalists, lobbyists, and \n     service personnel also work within the Capitol complex.\n       The challenge of achieving a secure environment for the \n     Capitol complex, while still maintaining an atmosphere of \n     openness, has become increasingly difficult in this century. \n     Both the potential threats to the Capitol and the number of \n     people using the area every day have grown dramatically. \n     Incidents such as the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center \n     and the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building \n     in Oklahoma City, as well as international confrontations \n     like Desert Storm in 1991, have prompted increases in the \n     level of security afforded the Capitol complex.\n\n  This report talks about the legislative proposals. I refer to one of \nthe last paragraphs.\n\n       S. 1508 [a bill that I drafted and put in with the \n     distinguished majority and minority leaders several months \n     ago] identifies the primary purpose of the center as the \n     enhancement of Capitol security. When it was introduced, \n     Senator John Warner, chairman of the Committee on Rules \n     Administration, emphasized that the ``most compelling need \n     for the Capitol Visitors Center is to add a major element of \n     enhanced security for the entire Capitol building and \n     environs.''\n       ``During May of 1997 hearings on H.R. 20, members of the \n     Police Board stressed that a visitors' center would enable \n     the Capitol Police to regulate the number of people inside \n     the Capitol at a given time, allow them to be better prepared \n     for orderly evacuation in the event of an emergency, and \n     strengthen the security of the Capitol while preserving free \n     public access.''\n\n  We want to, in every way, maintain this, the people's building, and \nto provide for the greatest degree of access that we can possibly \nachieve, given the need for increased security measures. It is my \nfervent hope that in the years to come, not only 7 to 10 million, but \neven more Americans and visitors from abroad can come and see this \nstructure and the symbol of freedom for which it stands.\n  Mr. President, I am having a portion of the report that was \nassociated with the United States Capitol Square Perimeter Security \nReport be reworked by the Architect's office so it can be printed in \nthe Record. I also hope before the day's conclusion to introduce a \ndraft of a bill which would be taken up in markup tomorrow, but I am \nawaiting instructions from the majority and minority leader and, \nindeed, the Speaker's input, which I hope to get today.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the manager of the bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. It is my understanding that the Warner amendment of \ntechnical changes is supported by both sides of the aisle. I urge its \npassage.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I ask the manager, have we had a chance to compare \nthe two drafts, and is the draft at the desk to be amended at all?\n  It is the same? So the draft at the desk, then, is the same. I join \nwith the manager in moving the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3356) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay it on the table.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from \nColorado and his distinguished partner, the other manager of the bill, \nfor their cooperation in expediting this manner.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I now ask unanimous consent to return to the Hutchinson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                       Tax Code Sunset Amendment\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding \nthe Hutchinson amendment that is to be offered shortly regarding the \nTax Code sunset bill or Tax Code Elimination Act that he has been \nworking on. I have been working with him, along with a number of our \nother colleagues in the Senate, in considering this particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Arkansas on his work on pushing \nforward a sunsetting of the Tax Code and a sunsetting of the burden it \nplaces on the American families--not so much of\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\nthe rates, even though I think those are too high; not so much as the \nlevel of taxation, which I think are too high as well; but the burden \nsimply of such an oppressive, intrusive Tax Code.\n  I want to share a little bit with my Members here in the Senate about \nthe nature of this Tax Code and some of the things that are happening \nwithin this Tax Code. I have a chart here that I think says quite a bit \nabout where our Tax Code has evolved to. Look at the basic foundation. \nThe Declaration of Independence, 1,300 words; the Bible, 773,000 words; \nthe United States Tax Code, 2.8 million words and growing. And growing. \nThat is just too much, too much of a burden.\n  I also want to share with my colleagues, this debate has been going \non for a little bit of time, so we contacted the IRS and said could we \nhave all of the forms that you send to the average American in asking \nthem to fill out their taxes. We just want to see the forms that the \naverage American gets, and we would like to have all of them.\n  It was interesting that the first thing they responded from the IRS \nheadquarters is we don't have all of the forms. They said they couldn't \nget those, so they did send us about two-thirds of them. I would like \nto show Members, these are just the forms. This is not the law. These \nrepresent the regulations that explain what is taking place with the \nIRS code. These are just the forms that they send and the instructions \nthat go with those forms. There are a lot of other documents that go \nalong with these, as well. I hope I can get these stacked on the desk \nand the desk will hold it.\n  The burden on the back of this desk is the burden on the back of the \npublic. This is not even all the forms. It represents two-thirds of the \nforms shipped out by the IRS to the average taxpayer, to businesses, \nsaying these are the sort of things you have to fill out. Not only do \nyou have to fill them out, you have to fill them out correctly. If you \ndon't get them correct, you are subject to fines, penalties, possible \nimprisonment, from this horrendously complex Tax Code that many \npeople--even with some advising from the Government--don't get the \nanswer right.\n  If that doesn't define a burden, I don't know what does. What is even \nworse is that the Federal Government is not content merely in \ncollecting taxes or making complex taxes. It wants to control behavior, \nas well. Some of those things it would put in the Tax Code are not even \nvery good, either.\n  I want to give a great example of micromanagement by the Federal \nGovernment of people's daily lives in a negative fashion; that is, the \nmarriage tax penalty. Most people are familiar with the marriage tax \npenalty, and that is a tax on people to be married, two-wage-earner \nfamilies, to be married. They will pay more in taxes than two single \npeople. Two single people who choose to live together would pay less in \ntaxes than a married couple.\n  Now I think most people would say in this time of difficulty for \nfamilies that that is a bad signal to send. We are going to tax \nmarriage as a disincentive to marriage in the system. People say we \ndidn't put it there as a disincentive. Well, it is a disincentive to \nmarriage and it is built into the Tax Code and it is substantial. It is \nalso preposterous.\n  Our society is built on the foundation of solid families. Creating \ndisincentives to solid families is the wrong signal for us to send at \nthis point in time in our Republic. It is the wrong signal to send at \nany time. Because of the marriage penalty and other inconsistencies in \nour Tax Code, I am convinced that this is a Tax Code that history will \nreport as one of the most onerous burdens ever faced by the American \npublic. Our amendment aims to make this code history and to require \nCongress and the President to put in place a new code, a fair and a \nsimpler tax code, that has far less micromanagement from the Federal \nGovernment, and is far more oriented towards growth and toward the \nfamily.\n  Mr. President, I want another American century. I want it for my \nchildren. I want it for my children's children. And I want it for all \nAmericans. I am convinced that with this type of a system, with this \ntype of micromanagement out of Washington, we cannot have another \nAmerican century. This code must be scrapped. We put plenty of time in \nplace to come up with a new, better, simpler tax code that is more \nliberating to the families, that is more supportive to business, and is \nfar more intelligible by the public.\n  As a matter of fact, I simply ask my colleagues that don't support \nthis type of amendment, could we do any worse than the current Tax \nCode? Could we truly be any more complicated than the current taxation \nsystem? Could we be any more onerous and unintelligible than the \ncurrent tax system if we sunset this and go to another? I ask that \nquestion as I travel around the State of Kansas, and I don't get many \npeople that say it could get any worse. It has grown over the years and \nwe have added and added and amended and amended. Americans are \ndemanding tax reform and we have promised tax reform. It is now time to \ndeliver on that promise to the American people. Some will argue that we \nhave to be careful about any radical changes to our tax laws, and I \nagree. I believe that we must carefully weigh alternative plans, debate \nthe macro and micro effects of each, and then arrive at a thoughtful \nand reasoned solution that is equitable and just. That is why we are \nputting this off 4\\1/2\\ years until we actually go to and require a new \nTax Code. We are saying 4\\1/2\\ years of debate, but let's finally start \nthe debate. We haven't even gotten started on it. We are saying let's \nstart the debate, and let's set a time certain that we will have a new \nTax Code that is fairer and simpler, and let's have a great national \ndebate about it. The way we are going right now is, we are saying yes, \nit is a bad Tax Code, but we are not willing to do anything about it.\n\n  This amendment would simply say we are going to do something about \nthis over the next 4\\1/2\\ years. We are going to pass a new Tax Code. \nWe are sunsetting this one at a date certain, and let the great \nnational debate begin. I think that is a just and equitable way to go, \nand it is not a radical way to go.\n  The bottom line is that the Tax Code we now have in place punishes \ngood investment decisions and distorts the labor market, as well as our \nrates of national savings. It hurts the family and manipulates behavior \nby adding incentive to do one thing while punishing another, which \nfrequently goes in the wrong direction.\n  Here is another quick example of an inadequacy in our Tax Code that \nis a harmful public signal. I don't know if you recall this; some \npeople will. I mentioned this previously on the floor. If you are a \nchronic gambler, you can deduct your gambling losses. If you are a \nhomeowner who made an unlikely investment and the value of your home \ndeclined, you have no recourse in the Tax Code because you cannot claim \na deduction for capital loss. The question is, Why can somebody deduct \na loss associated with a bad game of blackjack but not a loss \nassociated with their primary residence in which they were the \nunfortunate victim rather than the willing participant? The code is \nfull of inconsistencies like the one I mentioned--perhaps unintended--\nthat people got into over a period of time.\n  I would like to think that what we could do now is start a reasoned \nand great debate about a simpler, fairer, better system that is far \nless about micromanagement and raising revenue for the Federal \nGovernment, and not about sending bad signals to the public. Some may \ndisagree about how we would go about going to a different Tax Code, but \nthis is precisely the issue upon which we must focus our debate. We \nmust decide where we want the tax to be imposed, and we must understand \nthe imposition of the tax on the health of the economy. However this \ndebate takes shape, we must have as our goal a tax system that doesn't \ndistort behavior and create deadweight loss. We must have as our goal a \npro-growth, pro-family tax system. We should have as our model some \nkind of simpler and fairer and far more understandable code.\n  As I travel across Kansas, I ask a lot of people about whether or not \nthey regularly, or even within the last month, have made a personal or \nbusiness decision based upon the Tax Code. Virtually two-thirds say \nthat, ``Over the last month, I have made a business or a family \ndecision based upon tax policy.'' That is not what we want to create. \nIt is a system where everybody has to consult with the Tax Code before \nthey make a business decision, where everybody has to consult the Tax \nCode before they make a family\n\n[[Page S9120]]\n\ndecision. Yet, that is the system that evolved to where we are today, \nto where it is micromanagement out of Washington.\n  I ask the public in Kansas, ``Imagine if you had a system that, \nregardless of the business decision you made or the family decision you \nmade, the tax results were the same. Would you like such a system?'' \nThey say, ``Absolutely.'' Furthermore, they would have more economic \ngrowth, as they would put the money into a better economic decision \ntaking place here, and they would not be penalized as a family member \ndoing things that are the best for their families.\n  Let's begin the great national debate. Let's sunset this Tax Code and \nmove to something new. Our bill will enable the debate to take place \noutside of the realm of some of the demagoguery because it does protect \nthe important funding mechanisms for Social Security and Medicare. We \nset aside those chapters in the IRS Code; we don't touch those. I \nbelieve we have a commitment to ensure that we have a full, honest, and \nopen debate. Our bill will give that opportunity to this Senate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as we look forward to the new millennium and, \nhopefully, another American century, we will provide the American \npeople with a renewed sense of the American dream, a renewed sense of \nwhat it means to be an American and what it means to live in America. \nWe can't achieve that with this taxation system. It is time to sunset \nit, start the debate, and get to a better one.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, throughout my career, I have been a strong \nproponent of tax reform. I have made no bones about the fact that the \ntax burden borne by Americans is onerous and counter-productive to real \neconomic growth, jobs, and opportunity. I have made it clear that we \nstand in need of tax reform--a tax code that is simple and fair, \nplacing the needs and growth of our families and communities before the \nneeds and growth of the Federal bureaucracy.\n  I am encouraged by the developing consensus for serious tax reform. \nAs chairman of the Finance Committee, this is among my highest \npriorities. And I look forward to working closely with my colleagues \ntoward building a promising new tax system that will open a world of \npossibilities as America moves into the 21st century.\n  At this time, however, I caution my colleagues to not let the \nmomentum we are gathering overtake our constructive endeavors.\n  To sunset the current tax code without first structuring a better \nsystem would be something like quitting your job before first \nestablishing where your new place of employment is going to be. While \nsuch a move may be satisfying and even exciting, when you have a \nmortgage, some personal debt, and a family depending on your income it \nis not only imprudent, but could result in devastating consequences.\n  Prudence, control, and careful planning--that's what our tax reform \nefforts require from us. Sunsetting the tax code without an alternative \nin place would create pandemonium in the marketplace.\n  What would it do to our credit rating? To our ability to meet current \nresponsibilities? How would it be perceived internationally, among our \neconomic partners, and in the global banking community? And how would \nit affect our families and business community? How do they plan? Where \ndo Americans put their money for retirement, for pensions, for \ninvestment, for housing? What will happen to the home mortgage \ndeduction? And how will that influence the real estate and homebuilding \nmarkets?\n  Today the Dow Jones industrial average is down because of recent \ncorporate earning reports and developments in the investigation into \nthe President. Can you imagine what will happen when news hits that the \ntax code is going to be sunset without a consensus or even a blueprint \nfor a replacement?\n  If Congress votes to sunset the tax code and does not enact a \nreplacement by December 31, 2002, what happens? We need a tax system--\ndespite how much I would prefer it to be otherwise.\n  If there is no replacement by December 31, 2002--if Congress has not \nyet reached a consensus, if the decision--the best Congress can do--is \nto extend the tax code we have voted to sunset then that extension \nwould, in effect, become the single largest tax increase in history!\n  I do no want to be party to that. I don't think any of my colleagues \ndo.\n  To tear down the tax code before Americans know what will replace it \nis dangerous. We must work to change the current system. Toward this \nend, I pledge my every effort.\n  We must eliminate the current code's complexity. We must bring relief \nto those who are bearing a back-breaking load. We don't need to fiddle \nat the edges of the current code. We can change the code altogether. We \ncan create an innovative and promising code for a new century. But we \nmust do it in an organized and orderly way. To vote for this amendment \nis to pass the buck to future Congresses. We can go home and declare \nvictory for taking a strong stand for tax reform, but then the issue \nwill still have to be addressed, a consensus will still have to be \ndeveloped, Americans will still need to be included in such an \nimportant effort.\n  I am sympathetic to this amendment. Emotionally, it appeals to me. \nBut it is not right. It is not right analytically. It is not good \npublic policy. And it, in fact, is not right Constitutionally. Only the \nHouse can originate a revenue measure. This vote would constitute a \nrevenue measure, and--as such--would be subject to a blue slip. For \nthese reasons, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this amendment \nand join me, and the many others who realize the importance of real tax \nreform, in working for a successful new code.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator Hutchinson's \namendment to terminate the tax code. I commend his leadership and his \npersistence in advocating what is real tax reform.\n  Mr. President, more than 200 years ago, our ancestors staged a tea \nparty and revolted against their mother country to protest the \nimposition of unfair taxes. Today, taxes imposed by our own government \nare unfair by any standard. Had our ancestors faced a tax system as \npunitive as ours has become, they might very well have jumped into the \nharbor along with the tea.\n  Americans today are working harder but taking home less of their pay. \nWhy? In excess of $1.7 trillion of their income is siphoned off to \nUncle Sam each year. In 1997, total taxes--federal, state, and local--\nclaiming a record 38.2 percent of a typical family's income.\n  Nearly 40 percent of everything the average family made went to \nsupport government.\n  Nearly 4 hours of every 8-hour working day are dedicated just to \npaying taxes. The total tax burden borne by the American taxpayer in \n1998 is the highest in U.S. history.\n  We are being taxed at a higher level today than at any time in \nhistory, including World War II and other conflicts.\n  The tax code must be terminated because the earnings, spending, and \nsavings of the American people are taxed over and over to squeeze more \nmoney out of their pockets to line the pockets of government. Income is \ntaxed when it's first earned. The after-tax income is then subject to \ncertain excise taxes when spent.\n  If this after-tax income is saved in a savings account or invested in \na business, the interest and profits will be taxed again. If the \ncorporation pays out its after-tax earnings as a dividend to the saver, \nor if the saver sells his investment, the savings is taxed a third time \nthrough a capital gains tax.\n  If the saver dies with some accumulated savings, these savings will \nbe taxed a fourth time through estate and gift taxes. Even after death, \none's tax liability lives on.\n  The tax code must be terminated because it has long been used as a \ntool for social engineering and income redistribution rather than sound \neconomic policy.\n  Clearly, a system of graduated marginal rates violates the principle \nof fairness. In addition, special interest groups are often unfairly \nrewarded by politicians with special tax privileges.\n\n[[Page S9121]]\n\n  We need to have a date certain when this Tax Code is going to end and \nthat we can begin with something new. No matter what we have done \nrecently to try to improve the IRS and the Tax Code, it is like putting \nlipstick on a pig. We can't make it pretty. We have to pull this code \nout by the roots, and we have to change it and replace it with \nsomething that is friendly and that is fair and taxpayer friendly.\n  We need something like this legislation to act as a stick of dynamite \nunder the chairs of Congress to make them act, rather than \nprocrastinating and saying, ``We will do it next year, or maybe the \nyear after, or the year after.'' The American taxpayers aren't going to \nwait that long.\n  The Tax Code must be terminated because it has become simply \ncomplicated. It is difficult for anyone to understand, as Senator \nBrownback showed us with this huge stack of just the forms that we are \nhaving every year. The Tax Code has grown, as he showed us, from 14 \npages when it was first enacted to more than 10,000 pages of Tax Code \ntoday, plus another 20 volumes of tax regulations, and then thousands \nof pages and instructions that go along with it. Even the IRS and tax \nprofessionals repeatedly make mistakes. IRS agents reportedly gave \nwrong answers to taxpayers at least half of the time. And the question \nis, How can anyone master all of the code? I don't blame the IRS or any \nof the good workers at the IRS. But it is Congress that has developed a \nTax Code that is so complicated that even the experts in the field of \nthe IRS can't guarantee that they are going to give the average \ntaxpayer an answer that is right when they call and ask.\n  So, again, the tax code must be terminated because it's too expensive \nfor the American people. The IRS employs over 102,000 agents to collect \ntaxes, more agents than the FBI and the CIA combined. The taxpayers \nmust pay more than $8 billion each year to operate the IRS.\n  Worse still, American families, small business owners, and \ncorporations will spend at least another $225 billion just trying to \ncomply with the Tax Code, money that could be better spent elsewhere. \nIf they fail to comply due to innocent mistakes, the IRS penalties \ncould actually ruin some lives.\n  The tax code must be terminated because the IRS has evolved into an \narrogant, inefficient, intrusive, and abusive bureaucracy. IRS agents \nroutinely use their enormous, coercive power to squeeze more money out \nof the taxpayers' pockets to meet the demands of ever-increasing \ngovernment spending.\n  Rooted deeply within the system rests the core flaw of the tax \nsystem: policymakers care little about spending other people's money \nbecause the money isn't their own. Now is the time to reverse that \nthinking.\n  If you are going out tonight for supper and spend your own money, you \nmight spend $50. But if you are going to go out for supper and you take \nmy credit card, you might spend $500 on a night out. In Washington, \nmuch of that is what is happening.\n  With millions of our citizens demanding real tax reform, Congress \nmust grasp this historic opportunity to deliver change--change that \nwill forever repair the system, honor our great American heritage of \nindividual choice and responsibility, and reflect true American values.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the current tax code is an unmerciful mess--\nbut it doesn't need to be. We can and must replace it with a new system \nthat is simpler, fairer, flatter, and friendlier--a better system that \nwill lead this great country into the 21st century.\n  We will not have a better incentive to reform than an actual date to \nterminate the code. I urge my colleagues to support Senator \nHutchinson's in this very, very important amendment.\n  Thank you, very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to say to the managers that I \ndon't think we should have a lengthy debate this afternoon on this \nsubject. It is one that I could see us spending hours or days on, \nbecause there is plenty to talk about. But we need to continue to make \nan effort to move our appropriations bills.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Treasury and \nPostal Service, the Senator from Colorado, would like to do that. He \nand the ranking member from Wisconsin are working hard. But I want to \ngive a few remarks briefly in support of this amendment. I have stayed \naway from doing that on amendments on appropriations bills because I \nhave been discouraging amendments all along the line. But this is one I \nfeel strongly about.\n  It is also very hard for me to rise in support of an amendment of \nthis nature when the chairman of the Finance Committee is expressing \nhis reservations. But it is totally understandable. He wants to make \nsure that when we do it, we do it right, and that we develop another \ntax system that we have thought about. He is doing what you would \nexpect a cautious chairman to do. He takes a back seat to none of us \nwhen it comes to finding ways to make the Tax Code fairer and giving \ntax relief to the American people.\n  Having said that, I think we ought to do it. There is plenty of time \nhere to think about what the alternative is going to be. Four and a \nhalf years--how long does it take? I will tell you how long it will \ntake--forever, unless we make up our minds on behalf of the American \npeople. With their support, we are going to make this happen. We are \ngoing to do it.\n  Others have pointed out what we are talking about. Here it is, Mr. \nPresident. This is the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The copy I have here is about 7,000 pages long in very small type. \nFrankly, that is absurd. This Tax Code contains the accumulation of 85 \nyears of special interest provisions--your special interest, my special \ninterest, somebody else's special interest, but it has become a \nhodgepodge. It is not understandable. It makes no sense. It is not \nsimple. It is not fair. It is hopeless. We ought to start over and try \nto get it right and make it fairer and simpler.\n  It has become, quite frankly, a three-headed monster, and we have to \ncut off all three heads. We are working on two of those. One, you cut \noff the head of unfairness and try to provide some of the tax relief \nthat really is needed by allowing families with children to keep more \nof their money, as we did last year; by moving to eliminate the death \ntax, as we started on last year; by hopefully getting started seriously \nphasing out as soon as possible the marriage penalty tax this year. We \nare doing some things that make it fairer and even a little simpler, \nand we will continue to do that. We should do some more of it this year \nand some more the next year. We should do some of it every year.\n  The second head is intimidation--the culture, the problems at IRS \nthat we saw that have developed over the years since the last time we \nreformed the IRS Code way back in 1952. Well, this year we got it done. \nIt took us almost a year, but we did get fundamental reform and \nrestructuring done. That was the second head that we were able to chop \noff and deal with.\n  But the third one is to terminate this Tax Code, do it in a \nresponsible way. It won't terminate until December 31, 2002. Plenty of \ntime to decide.\n  When I go to my own State and I ask people: What do you think about \nthe Tax Code? They react negatively. And I say: How many of you think \nwe should eliminate it? Every hand, every hand goes up. Then you start \nsaying, OK, what are we going to replace it with? We have got time to \ngo to the people in Wisconsin and Colorado and ask their opinion.\n  Let's think this thing through. Let's do it right. But let's make it \nclear, let's make it undeniably clear we are going to do it. This is \nthe way to do it.\n  Some people say, well, gee, unless you have a plan in place, you \nshouldn't do this. Well, in Michigan, the great State of Michigan, a \nbig State, they eliminated the property tax without a replacement \nbecause they knew that the deadline would force their legislature to \nact on a replacement. And they did. Wisconsin--Wisconsin--created a \ndeadline for abolishing its welfare system, and it drove the reforms \nthat have worked in that State probably better than any other State, at \nleast from what I understand.\n  This will guarantee that we get it done. I think we should pass the \ntermination date, and I think we should make ourselves live by that \ndate. We should move toward making decisions,\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\nand we should fundamentally reform our Tax Code. It is overdue. It is \nthe third head of this monster that must be removed so that the \nAmerican people can be free, free of the oppression that we have \ndeveloped over these 85 years in this Tax Code.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I rise in support of this proposal by Senators \nHutchinson and Brownback, the proposal so eloquently supported by the \nmajority leader, Trent Lott. He is exactly right, in my opinion.\n  I was at that first press conference when this proposal was \nannounced. I believed in it then and I believe in it now. The Internal \nRevenue Code with 7,500 pages and over 800,000 words, has grown each \nyear and continues to grow. We cannot ask the American people to read \nthousands of pages before they pay their taxes. We cannot ask them to \npay hundreds and hundreds of dollars to have accountants do their tax \nreturns, returns they used to be able to do themselves. It is simply \nnot fair, and it is not right.\n  As I recall what a good tax is supposed to be, if there is a good \ntax, according to the textbooks, it is a tax that is understandable. It \nis a tax that is predictable in terms of revenue. I would say that is \none thing our Tax Code does, it produces a very large but predictable \nsupply of revenue. But a ``good'' tax is also supposed to be easy to \ncollect and is supposed to be perceived as fair. I would say it is only \nin the predictability of revenue that our Tax Code acceptable. \nOtherwise, it is really on unacceptable terms that revenue is raised to \nfund this great Government.\n  A few months ago, last fall, Dick Armey and Billy Tauzin from the \nHouse of Representatives came to my hometown of Mobile, AL, to have a \ndebate about the Tax Code. Mr. Armey is in favor of a flat tax, and Mr. \nTauzin, a consumption tax. The place was packed, standing room only. \nThey announced it on the television and on Sunday night people came out \nfrom all over. They were fascinated and asked questions. They were \nenergized by this debate. I am told that everywhere Mr. Armey and Mr. \nTauzin go people are there in record numbers; they are interested in \nthis issue, and they care about it.\n  For days after the debate in Mobile, people came up to me, and this \nis the question they asked: Jeff, can we really do it? Is this \nsomething we can do? And my answer to them was: Absolutely, we can do \nit. There is no reason under this Sun that we cannot pass a simplified \nTax Code. We must be able to say to the American people, the people who \nelected us, that we can produce a Tax Code that is simple, fair, easy \nto understand, and produces a steady revenue. And whether it is a flat \ntax or a consumption tax or some combination of both, we need to focus \non this issue in Congress.\n  By passing a deadline, with 4 years to go, we will set a date that \nwill force us to confront this issue and respond to the wishes of the \nAmerican people. Having run for office just recently, in 1996, I know \nthe American people are confident the Government is going to have money \nto run itself. I also know they want tax reductions. With the recent \nsurpluses, they want more than they wanted just a few years ago. But \nwhat they really want is a Tax Code that is simple and fair, and we can \ngive that to them. We need to make a commitment to that end. And if we \ndo so, I believe that people in this country will appreciate it very \nmuch.\n  I favor this proposal. The American people are fed up. It will help \nmake this country competitive because we will not have wasted all this \ntime and effort collecting taxes. Instead, we will spend it developing \nnew and improved products in our businesses and industries in America \nso that they can continue to be competitive in the world.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to speak. I salute Senators Hutchinson \nand Brownback and all others who support this amendment, and I look \nforward to being a part of the reality of eliminating the Internal \nRevenue Code as we know it today.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition to the \nBrownback amendment.\n  Sunsetting the Tax Code may sound catchy and attractive, but in truth \nit is simply wishful thinking until we have some concrete idea about \nits replacement.\n  Now, we all agree that the current code is too complex and too \nburdensome for the average taxpayer, and everyone agrees that we need a \nsimpler and a fairer system. But we also know that some sort of tax \nstructure is necessary to maintain the vital functions of our \nGovernment. The current Tax Code, however imperfect, allows us to \nsustain our national defense, provide aid to struggling farmers, make \nsure that those Social Security checks are delivered on time, and much, \nmuch more. Down the road, we may envision and hope for a more direct \nroute to providing those resources than the current tax system, but \nuntil we find that alternate route, this debate should remain just \nthat, a debate, an open dialog as to what system would best serve the \nAmerican people. In addition, simply sunsetting the code would be a \ndisaster for American business. We hear so much about the need for \nAmerican corporations to make long-range business plans, and indeed \nthat is true, they must. But how will that be possible if they don't \nknow what Tax Code they will face after the current one sunsets? How \nmany resources would companies waste trying to plan for all the \npossible new tax codes that we might enact 4 years from now?\n\n  Finally, sunsetting the Tax Code without any notion of how we might \npay for it makes a mockery of the progress we have made in balancing \nthe Federal books. We are all encouraged by the budget surplus and the \nstrong economic forecasts, but we should not get ahead of ourselves and \nthink that the good news warrants a swift departure from the tough \ndecisions and fiscal discipline that brought us to this point.\n  So for these reasons I will support, when it is raised, a Budget Act \npoint of order against the Brownback amendment. I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this \namendment, which eliminates the Tax Code without an alternative.\n  Mr. President, I heard it said that we ought to ``pull it out by its \nroots,'' get rid of it now. Well, I would hate to go to a dentist with \na toothache and have the dentist say, ``You know what, we are going to \nlook at this tooth. First, we will pull it out by its roots, and then \nwe will look at it.''\n  That is what is being proposed here, Mr. President. This amendment \nwould get rid of the Tax Code, but without any indication of what would \nreplace it. Instead, we could be left without any revenues to operate \nthe government. We could be left with no revenue to support our \nmilitary and protect our country. With no revenue to buy the weapons \nsystems we need for the future to advance our country technologically.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will create tremendous uncertainty in \nthe business community. They're not going to know when they can make \ninvestments and when they cannot. For example, they will not know \nwhether the R tax credit will be available. That is an important part \nof the code. But businesses will not know whether it will remain \navailable if this amendment is enacted.\n  Mr. President, I ran a big company that now employs 31,000 people. I \nstarted this company with two other guys, poor people from New Jersey. \nWe built the company by planning ahead and making investments, often \nbecause we knew that there were tax benefits that we could count on. \nBut if this amendment is approved, other entrepreneurs will not be able \nto make similar plans.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Kansas is saying is, ``Wait, \nbefore you do any investing, let's get rid of the Tax Code. Wander \nwhere you want through the jungle for a couple of years, and that will \nmake the Congress respond.''\n  I don't understand it, I must tell you. Sometimes I think I work in a \ndifferent place from some of my colleagues, because the references are \nto ``them.''\n  ``They will never get it done unless we pull it out by its roots.''\n  ``They will never get it done unless we make the pain excruciating.''\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\n  ``Fear of shutting down Government, fear of being unable to operate, \nthat will make them move.''\n  Who is the ``them'' and who is the ``they''? Who is the ``we'' and \nwho is the ``us''? We are all in this together for the American people.\n  Look at the economy. I hear about this oppressive Tax Code and the \nnumber of pages, and ``Compare it to the Holy Bible.''\n  ``Holy cow,'' that is what I say, ``holy cow.'' What are we going to \ndo? Are we going to weigh these things? Do we want to buy a scale here \nand say if it weighs less than a certain number of grams, pounds, \nounces, it is OK? But if it weighs over that, overboard?\n  Go to the business community and ask them what they think about \nthrowing it all away. They will tell you that we would only be \npunishing ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I agree that the Tax Code is too complicated and too \ncumbersome. But the way to solve that is to offer something positive. \nIt is to offer a real alternative.\n  I also would point out, Mr. President, that eliminating the whole tax \ncode could undermine much of the progress we have made in recent years. \nWe have gone from a deficit of $290 billion six years ago, to a surplus \nthat is now projected to be $60 billion. And for the next decade, we \nwill have $1.5 trillion to pay down our debt.\n  But this amendment would reverse this progress. It says that we want \nto play political games. That is what this is about. This is almost \nbecoming a national sport here. It is not football, baseball or \nbasketball, it is politics.\n  We are going to take away the revenue code. Do you know what? You are \nnot going to feel it, Mr. Citizen. Everything is going to be hunky-\ndory. And do not worry if the FDA can no longer approve new drugs. And \ndo not worry if the National Cancer Institute can no longer do the \nresearch needed to help defeat breast cancer or prostate cancer or to \nhelp the newborn grow up healthy--no. No. We are going to fix the \nrevenue code. But you are not going to have to pay any price. You know, \nMr. and Mrs. America, you know there are free lunches all over this \nplace. You don't have to pay for anything.\n  Listen, no one here likes taxing people who work hard for their \nmoney. The President certainly doesn't. He says: Provide tax relief for \nfamilies who send their children to child care so that they can go out \nand work. Provide relief to support education, so that we can have the \nbest educated society on this Earth. That is where we want to give tax \nrelief--to ensure that our children can get a good education.\n  That is especially important in our age of technology in the new \nmillennium.\n  Mr. President, I come out of the technology business. I am, \nimmodestly, called, ``a member of the Hall of Fame of Information \nProcessing.'' My company was one of the earliest in the computer \nbusiness, and we learned that technology is the way to the future. We \nhelped start an industry called the computing industry. It is different \nthan the computer industry. The computer industry is the hardware. The \ncomputing industry is all else. It is programs. It is engineering. It \nis all those things. It is an industry that is dramatically improving \nefficiency in so many ways.\n  Mr. President, from my experience in the business community, I know \nthe problems that would be created if we simply rushed out and \neliminated the entire tax code without a replacement. It would be a \nserious mistake.\n  Yes, the Tax Code ought to be simpler. Yes, people ought to pay less. \nBut you don't get something for nothing in life. You don't get it in a \ncountry club, you don't get it in a schoolroom, and you don't get it in \nthe United States of America.\n  We have seen what happens with those countries where they have codes \nthat say you don't have to pay--communism. You don't have to pay. They \nproduced a society in Russia that is almost flat broke, dispirited, \nbroken down, can't produce a product. We say let the free market \noperate, and let the Tax Code reflect what the objectives are; to build \na society, to invest in this society, to give people a chance to get an \neducation, to know that when they are 65 years old that Social Security \nis going to be there and its purchasing power is protected.\n  What a remarkable thing we are witnessing today, and how in a few \nwords here we like to disparage it. ``It don't work. It ain't good. Get \nrid of it.''\n  Here we produced surpluses when deficits were the rule. And we want, \nnow, led by the President of the United States, to shore up Social \nSecurity so somewhere in the 2070s--it is pretty obvious I won't be \nrunning by then; I might, though--we want to make sure Social Security \nis there for our children, for our grandchildren.\n  That is what we are doing now, and it is all part of a fiscal plan. \nYou can't throw out the revenues without throwing out the expenses. I \nam sure the Senator from Kansas would say, ``Of course.''\n  Well, what expenses? The expenses for the military, the expenses for \nresearch, the expenses for development, the expenses for education, the \nexpenses for clean air, the expenses for operating our national parks, \nthe expenses for leaving a legacy for our children, that tell them \nthere are still fish in the oceans, fish in the streams, so that they \nhave something to look forward to.\n  No; the mission is destroy first and then decide what you are going \nto do next. I spent 3 years in the Army, and I never had that. We \nalways knew what the mission was before we started out on it.\n  Mr. President, I am a member of the Budget Committee. I am the senior \nDemocrat on the Budget Committee, and I expect that a point of order \nwill be raised against this amendment because it violates the budget \nrules. I hope that our colleagues respond appropriately.\n  I respect those who differ with me, but I will tell you this: If a \ncompany I was investing in decided that they couldn't figure out what \nthe revenues were going to be and they wanted to operate and just go \nahead and see what happens, make all kinds of investments, I would get \nout of there in a hurry. There is not a company in America who will \nmake big investments if they do not know what the tax treatment is \ngoing to be.\n  I am going to yield the floor, but I hope my colleagues are going to \njoin me in standing up for what is right for America and do things in \nan orderly fashion.\n  I have heard the plea made so many times: Why can't we operate like a \nbusiness? Why can't we operate like families do? We want to do just \nthat. We want to operate just like a business that plans its actions, \nlays it out on a piece of paper and says, ``This is going to be our \nrevenues, this is going to be our expenses, and this is where we want \nto be 5 and 10 years from now.''\n  Instead, we now have a proposal that says, ``What we can do, ladies \nand gentlemen, and the board of directors and the president of the \ncompany, is we are going to ask you to hold your breath, we are going \nto make the investment anyway and take the chance it is going to come \nout right.''\n  Fire that guy.\n  I yield the floor and hope that my colleagues will assess the threat \nthat this reckless proposal poses to our Government, our Nation, and \nour economy.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in accord with the majority leader's \nrequest that we move expeditiously, I will keep my remarks very brief. \nI want to read one statement from the American Conservative Union, a \nletter sent to all my colleagues, the last paragraph:\n\n       We are pleased to support your legislation, and will watch \n     closely for a clean up-or-down vote on the bill with a view \n     to including it in our upcoming annual rating of the \n     Congress.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              The American Conservative Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Tim Hutchinson,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: On behalf of the nearly one \n     million members and supporters of the American Conservative \n     Union, I commend you for your introduction of S. 1673, the \n     Tax Code Termination Act.\n       The purpose of the legislation is simple: by abolishing the \n     current tax code by a date\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\n     certain, the legislation would force a national debate on \n     what kind of tax structure best fits our nation's needs, \n     while meeting the reform criteria of being lower, flatter, \n     and fairer. If enacted, the bill would force just such a \n     debate into the center of the 2000 federal elections, at both \n     the presidential and congressional level.\n       Such a debate is a necessary prerequisite for thoughtful \n     action to revise the code appropriately. A president elected \n     after such a debate will be able to lay claim to a mandate; \n     the Congress chosen in those elections will have to respect \n     that.\n       Some critics have suggested that the time-frame mandated in \n     the bill is too restrictive--that it doesn't allow the 107th \n     Congress enough time to reasonably hold hearings, draft, \n     revise, markup, amend, and then pass on the floor a total \n     rewrite of our tax code.\n       We believe the contrary to be true. With a termination date \n     set for December 31, 2002, and a call for a new tax code to \n     be in place by July 1, 2002, we believe there will be plenty \n     enough time for the 107th Congress to consider and pass \n     appropriate legislation.\n       We are pleased to support your legislation, and will watch \n     closely for a clean up-or-down vote on the bill--with a view \n     to including it in our upcoming annual rating of the \n     Congress.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   David A. Keene,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, also, I have a letter from the \nNational Federation of Independent Business in which they ``strongly \nurge your support of the Hutchinson-Brownback amendment. It is time to \nstep forward and let the American people know that their elected \nleaders have the courage to change a system which is anti-work, anti-\nsaving and anti-family. Now is the time to take action.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the NFIB be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                                    July 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Tim Hutchinson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: On behalf of the 600,000 members \n     of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     urge you to support the ``Tax Code Termination'' amendment \n     that will be offered by Senators Hutchinson and Brownback to \n     S. 2312, the Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations bill.\n       The Hutchinson-Brownback amendment is a tremendous step \n     forward in the effort to abolish the current complex and \n     abusive tax code and replace it with a fairer, simpler code \n     for all Americans. The amendment would sunset the Tax Code \n     after December 31, 2002, but not until Congress acts prior to \n     that date by adopting a new, fairer system with a low rate by \n     July 4, 2002. Similar legislation recently passed the House \n     of Representatives on June 17, 1998. Passage of this \n     amendment would bring Congress one step closer to allowing \n     the American people, those who suffer the most at the hands \n     of an unjust tax system, to decide what system is fair and \n     simple.\n       The IRS Income Tax Code is beyond repair, imposing \n     excessive compliance costs on small businesses nationwide. \n     Yet, legislation to overhaul the Code has stalled in \n     Congress. The purpose of sunsetting the current code on a \n     date certain is to force Congress to get serious about fixing \n     our tax system. Small employers understand that a new plan \n     must be ready for implementation before the old code is put \n     to rest. But, as indicated by the 750,000 petitions they have \n     signed and presented to Congress, small business owners want \n     Congress to get started on scrapping the seven-million word \n     that causes them so much time, money and grief.\n       I strongly urge your support of the Hutchinson-Brownback \n     amendment. It is time to step forward and let the American \n     people know that their elected leaders have the courage to \n     change a system that is anti-work, anti-saving and anti-\n     family. Now is the time to take action.\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Federal Governmental Relations.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, like Senator Lott, our majority \nleader, I am most reluctant to offer this amendment in opposition to \nthe sentiments of the chairman of the Finance Committee. Likewise, I \nhave the utmost respect for my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. I want to respond to a couple of things they said, my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin and my colleague from New Jersey, who, to me, when they \ntalk about this proposal being something radical, what I hear in \nresponse is the politics of fear.\n  They say, ``Well, we're not going to have a code, we're not going to \nhave a Tax Code.'' And then, ``We are not going to have the FDA, we're \nnot going to have FAA, we're not going to have roads, we're not going \nto have Social Security.''\n  By the way, Social Security is omitted entirely from this bill. It is \nnot even a factor. But we hear the politics of fear--the sky is \nfalling.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, there is nothing as certain as the Sun \nrising in the morning but that this Senate will have a Tax Code come \n2002. I assure you that this Senate and this House will not allow this \nGovernment to go without revenue.\n  My goodness, if you love this Tax Code so much and you like the \nloopholes and you like the deductions and you like the exemptions and \nyou like the exclusions so much, then you can propose that we reenact \nthis Tax Code in total just like it is, and there you go. You go back \nand defend that before the American people because that, I say to my \ncolleagues, is exactly what this debate is all about: Do you defend the \nstatus quo, or do you want change?\n  Senator Roth--and I love this man. I respect him like my father, and \nI think he has done marvelous work in so many areas in the IRS. But I \npose only this question to him and to all others who disagree with this \namendment: How long? The fear that we are not going to have it \nenacted--here is the time line: 4\\1/2\\ years of national debate, and if \nwe can't get it done in 4\\1/2\\ years, then we can reenact this \nwonderful Tax Code that those on the other side or those who oppose \nthis would like to defend. Four and a half years of national debate. \nLong enough--long enough--to wait for tax reform.\n  July 1998, that is where we are now. Come November, we will have a \ncongressional election; November 2000, we will have a Presidential \nelection; July 4, 2002, we suggest in this amendment that we should \nhave a new code approved; November 2002, more congressional elections \nbefore we finally reach December 31, 2002, the sunset date.\n  I suggest that is long enough. Let's give the American people what \nthey are demanding, and that is a Tax Code that is fairer and simpler \nand friendlier.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3249\n\n       (Purpose: To terminate the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, with that, I call up an amendment I \nhave at the desk, No. 3249, the Tax Code sunset amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson], for himself, \n     Mr. Brownback, Mr. McCain, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n     Grams, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Helms, Mr. Murkowski, \n     Mr. Coats, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Coverdell, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3249.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. TERMINATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986; NEW \n                   FEDERAL TAX SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Termination.--\n       (1) In general.--No tax shall be imposed by the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986--\n       (A) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, \n     and\n       (B) in the case of any tax not imposed on the basis of a \n     taxable year, on any taxable event or for any period after \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to taxes \n     imposed by--\n       (A) chapter 2 of such Code (relating to tax on self-\n     employment income),\n       (B) chapter 21 of such Code (relating to Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act), and\n       (C) chapter 22 of such Code (relating to Railroad \n     Retirement Tax Act).\n       (b) New Federal Tax System.--\n       (1) Structure.--The Congress hereby declares that any new \n     Federal tax system should be a simple and fair system that--\n       (A) applies a low rate to all Americans,\n       (B) provides tax relief for working Americans,\n       (C) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses,\n       (D) eliminates the bias against savings and investment,\n       (E) promotes economic growth and job creation, and\n       (F) does not penalize marriage or families.\n       (2) Timing of implementation.--In order to ensure an easy \n     transition and effective implementation, the Congress hereby \n     declares that any new Federal tax system should be approved \n     by Congress in its final form not later than July 4, 2002.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a few comments about the \namendment that has just been offered to the Senate.\n  The sponsor of the amendment asked the question: How long? How long, \nhe asks, will it take to get rid of the current Tax Code?\n  The answer to that is simply a long, long time, if the Senator who \noffers this amendment, and others, suggest to us that we should, for \nexample, have a national sales tax of 30 percent or more. If the folks \nwho have gotten rid of this Tax Code have implemented a 30 percent \nnational sales tax--and, yes, that is what would be required to be \nimplemented to replace it--if you buy a house, they will say, ``Yes, \nthat house is $120,000, but then there is a 30 percent sales tax on top \nof that.'' A fellow named William Gale from the Brookings Institution \nwrote a policy brief on this: ``Don't Buy the Sales Tax.''\n  The reason I am discussing this is, the Senator does not tell us with \nwhat he would replace the Tax Code. He simply says, ``Let's get rid of \nthe current Tax Code.''\n  There is plenty wrong with the current Tax Code. Count me among those \nwho would like to change the things that are wrong, but count me among \nthose who ask the question of the Senator who offers this amendment, \nWhat do you propose to replace it with?\n  My understanding is, the Senator who offers this amendment at one \npoint was a cosponsor of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for a \nnational sales tax. My understanding is, he took his name off of that \nbill. Am I mistaken about that? Did the Senator add his name?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be pleased to yield, of course.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. No, I have never--I have never--endorsed or signed on \nto any measure, and to suggest that I favor a 30 percent national sales \ntax or any form of sales tax is absolutely a misrepresentation and a \nmischaracterization of my position.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time.\n  I appreciated the Senator's response. My understanding was--and we \ncan determine this--but my understanding was that early in this \nCongress, the Senator added his name as a cosponsor to a resolution \nhere in the Senate calling for a national sales tax. My understanding \nis he subsequently withdrew his name from that, but we can discuss \nthat, I guess, with respect to the people who have the records.\n  My point is this, Mr. Gale, who writes about the sales tax down at \nthe Brookings Institution, says that if you had a national sales tax \nand are going to include all of the things that you need to include to \nmake up the revenue, that you have to have a sales tax of 30 percent or \nmore.\n  The only reason I am raising this question is, What do you intend to \nreplace the current Tax Code with? A value-added tax? A national sales \ntax? Or any one of a half dozen other iterations? I do not know.\n  Then I ask the following question: With whatever you replace the \ncurrent tax with, do you intend to provide for a deduction for home \nmortgage interest paid by someone who has just purchased a home and is \nbanking in the coming years on being able to deduct that home mortgage \ninterest? Is that part of some future plan or not?\n  Does one intend, for example, to provide for a deduction for health \ninsurance costs? Our current tax program in this country largely \nprovides for that as a business deduction. I am told that if that \ndeduction is eliminated, studies show that anywhere from 6 to 14 \nmillion more Americans will no longer have health insurance coverage.\n  Or what about charitable giving? Would what is proposed to replace \nthis with--whatever that is; we don't know what that is--would it \nprovide for a deduction for charitable giving? Some 1.4 million tax-\nexempt organizations worry about that. At least one study suggests that \nperhaps charitable giving could be reduced by some $33 billion.\n  So I ask the question, What does one propose to replace this with? I \nsay to my friend from Arkansas, I certainly do not mean to misrepresent \nyour record. I had been told that the Senator had at one point added \nhis name to a sales tax resolution. It is not my intention to \nmisrepresent that. If that is not the case, then I do not intend to \nassert that.\n  But whatever the case is about the Senator from Arkansas and what he \nharbors to replace this tax with, whatever that is, at some point \nsomeone is going to have to say, ``By the way, here is what I feel this \nshould be replaced with. And here is how it is going to affect you.''\n  So I ask the Senator from Arkansas, since he is proposing that we \neliminate the current Tax Code by a certain date, could he tell us--and \nI would be glad to yield for an answer--could he tell us what he \nproposes to replace it with?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I respond to the Senator, the whole point in having \nthe sunset date is to force us into a national debate to decide the \nvery question he poses. If I might continue, to argue the debate on \nwhat the pros and cons are on a sales tax, flat tax, I would just say, \nyou can't do worse than what we have.\n  If you reach that point that you want to reenact this code, this \namendment allows you to do that. I suggest that we can and we must do \nmuch better. And it would be putting the cart before the horse to say, \n``This is what we must do.'' What we need to do is set the date forcing \nus to reach that consensus on what should replace the current code.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask a more specific question.\n  I think the Senator said: I don't know what we should replace this \nwith. I think that was the answer. Let me ask a more specific question. \nIf, in fact, one of the alternatives would be a national sales tax--and \ncertainly that is one of the alternatives--and if it would require \nabout a 30-percent tax rate, as it would according to studies, would \nthe Senator believe that that is an inappropriate replacement for the \ncurrent Tax Code?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I, first of all, do not know to which study the \nSenator is referring. There are many studies on the various rates of a \nflat and sales tax. But what I would suggest is that the principles \nlaid down in the bill that I introduced and in the amendment that we \nare debating would be violated by any type of a 30-percent aggressive \nsales tax. Obviously, that would be something that I think would be \ntotally unacceptable.\n  But to throw up these fears: ``We're going to lose a home mortgage \ndeduction'' and ``We're going to lose a charitable deduction,'' that is \nthe politics of fear. That is what prevents us from moving forward to \nreal and comprehensive tax reform, in my opinion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think what the Senator is saying, in response to my \nquestion, however, is he does not know what he would replace the Tax \nCode with. He does not know how it would affect the American people, \ndoes not know its impact on the economy. That represents a fear by a \nlot of people. For example, it represents a fear by the group of folks \nwho represent the largest corporations in this country who work on the \ntax policies for--I could read the list of corporations, but it is \nvirtually a who's who--Hewlett Packard, BellSouth, Alcan Aluminum, so \non and so forth. Here is what they say. Listen to what they say:\n\n       We're writing to express the institute's serious concern \n     about proposals to sunset the IRS Code on a designated date \n     without specifying a replacement tax system. In our view, \n     these proposals reflect either a misapprehension of the \n     importance of certainty and predictability to business \n     enterprises and individuals or a disregard for the \n     consequences of terminating the tax system. They illustrate \n     the folly of making tax policy by sound bite, and it ought to \n     be rejected.\n\n  I know these are the folks who run America's businesses who say we \nneed some certainty and predictability. They are not against reform. \nThat is not what they are saying. But they are saying that they need to \nunderstand what it is you want to do.\n  You want to sunset the Tax Code on the one hand, and then I ask the \nquestion, ``But what do you want to do on the other hand?'' You say \nthat just as the Sun sets in the evening, it is going to come up in the \nmorning. That is true. Just as you sunset the Tax Code now, you are \ngoing to replace it with something. That is true. The question is, With \nwhat? And you do not have an answer.\n  So is it reasonable for us to ask the question, Is part of the answer \na national sales tax or not? If it is not, let\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\nus decide it is not. Is part of it a value-added tax or not? If it is \nnot, let us say it is not. If it is, let us decide who it impacts and \nhow it impacts in the American economy.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think it would be very, very foolish of us to try \nto have a national debate on tax reform on the floor of the Senate \ntonight, for us to decide we are going to take a sales tax off the \ntable, we are going to take VAT off the table, we are going to take a \nflat tax off the table, and we are going to take a modified or hybrid \nof it, and we are going to decide this evening.\n  That is the whole point, I say to my colleague. The whole point that \nwe need a deadline is to move us to reach the consensus on what is the \nbest way. I suspect we will end up keeping a home mortgage deduction \nand the charitable deduction. But we need that national debate. The \nonly way we are going to force that national debate is to focus--most \nAmericans are exactly where I am. They are not sure what would be the \nbest replacement. But they sure know this: What we have needs to be \nreplaced.\n  So let us take one step at a time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, I do understand what the Senator is \nsaying. Let us force a solution. But he does not have a logical \nsolution. Let us tell the person on A Street or B Street or 10th Street \nor 12th Street that we want to get rid of the current Tax Code--but he \nhas no idea how he wants to replace it.\n  There is a very big difference between those who would tax someone's \nincome at 14 percent and those who would impose a national sales tax at \n30 percent and those who would impose a value-added tax at 17 percent. \nThere is a very big difference in how it impacts people.\n  The Senator wants to suggest, ``Gee, this is some innocent little \nproposal of mine. Let's just get rid of the entire Tax Code'' which, by \nthe way, violates the Budget Act. And he knows that. ``Let's get rid of \nthe entire Tax Code and leave for some future debate the ability to \ncogitate the kind of Tax Code we might consider for tomorrow.''\n  Count me as among those who want to make changes in our Tax Code. I \nmean, do not count me as part of the target that the Senator was aiming \nat when he was talking about all of these ``they, they, they'' and \n``fear, fear, fear.'' Just count me as part of the group who says, \n``Yes, let's make some changes in our Tax Code.''\n  But also count me as part of a group who believes that if you are \ngoing to propose something to force solutions, you ought to have some \nnotion in hand about what those solutions ought to be and how much is \nnecessary to be collected in our revenue system in this country to pay \nfor the needed social services?\n  We build roads to go to market because we do not want to each build a \nroad separately. That would not make much sense. We build schools \ntogether so we can send our kids to public schools. We do not need each \nof us to have a school in our own home. So we do things together. We \nprovide for common defense. We have a Pentagon. We pay the men and \nwomen of the military to provide for the common defense of this \ncountry. That costs money. We, therefore, must raise that money. And \nthe question is, How?\n  We have an income tax system that isn't a very good system. You will \nnot find disagreement here about that. But you will find profound \ndisagreement about a proposal that says, let us simply scrap the \ncurrent tax system with no notion in mind about what you might replace \nit with. Precisely for this reason, I have watched some people trot \naround this Capitol Building, and on a good day they even gallop and \ncanter, alive and interested in their notion about how the Tax Code \nought to be changed. Some of them very much want to go to a national \nsales tax and the Senator knows that.\n  They want to go to a national sales tax. That will have a substantial \nimpact on a lot of families; some good, some bad. Some of them want to \ngo to a value-added tax . Some of them want to go to other forms of \ntaxation. All of them will have significant consequences.\n  But the Senator from Arkansas says let's not debate the ideas, \nconsequences or the solutions. He says let's debate some mechanism to \nforce the problem, which also probably violates the Budget Act. I don't \nunderstand that. I guess we will have a vote up or down on a proposal \nthat sunsets the entire Tax Code, with the author telling me that he \ndoesn't know what it ought to be replaced with and that we ought to \njust figure out some way to get from here to there by some protracted \ndebate.\n  I don't think that is a particularly good way to legislate. I think \nthe Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, a man for whom the Senator from Arkansas has great \naffection, as he says, as do I, I think he has it exactly right. This \nis not a good way to make tax policy. There would be an opportunity for \nthe Senator from Arkansas to bring to the floor his best idea about \nexactly how the Tax Code ought to be changed. He can do that at 7 \no'clock tonight; the best idea he has or anybody has about how to \nchange the Tax Code in this country. And then let people gnaw on it, \nchew on it and see what they think, and have a vote on it. But that is \nnot what he and some others choose to do. They choose to bring some \nshapeless package to sunset the current Tax Code, and to replace it \nwith nothing except some hope in the future that someone will do \nsomething to provide the revenue in some undescribed way.\n  Again I don't believe that is a good way to legislate. Neither does \nthe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a Republican. Neither \ndoes the National Association of Manufacturers. Neither does the Tax \nExecutive Institute, and many others.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I heard you say if this code were eliminated and replaced \nwith a possible national sales tax, it could take up to 30 percent of a \nsales tax to replace what the Government has taken.\n  Now, does that mean hidden behind all the hidden taxes, that somehow \nthe Government now is taking from the average taxpayer, the average \nworker in this country, 30 percent of their income just to support the \nFederal Government?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator obviously misunderstood what I said. I was \nresponding to a policy brief prepared by William Gale at the Brookings \nInstitution that says ``Don't Buy the Sales Tax.''\n  I have yielded. Let me have the floor.\n  I was talking about comparing the income tax to the sales tax. As the \nSenator would know, I think there is a substantially different base. \nDr. Gale talked about this. I would like the opportunity to send it to \nthe Senator's office for his perusal.\n  On page 4 of the 10-page report documenting a study he had done, he \nsays a 30-percent tax rate would be needed on the more familiar tax-\nexclusive approach on a national sales tax. He is one of the preeminent \nauthorities on this issue in the country. I have met with him, talked \nto him, and enjoyed his work a great deal. I think he has done a lot of \ngood work on the question, What would a national sales tax have to be? \nWhat would it look like? Who would it impact?\n  One of the things I find most interesting, whether it is on the sales \ntax or the VAT tax, is that those in both the House and the Senate with \nspecific tax plans to replace the current Tax Code always come up a \ncouple hundred billion short in revenue.\n  What they say is, I want to sunset the current Tax Code, and here is \nmy substitute for it, and my substitute is a couple hundred billion \ndollars short. They won't say that, but that is the way they are \nevaluated when done fairly. Count me in on that. Gee, if you don't have \nto come up with something that responds to the same revenue base, we \nnow have to meet the needs we have, then, gosh, maybe we should come up \nwith something that raises only 50 percent of the revenue. Or how about \n10 percent of the revenue. That is a wonderful way to do business.\n  I see the people walking around with plans that would, A, increase \nthe Federal deficit substantially; and B, impose substantial \ndislocations on a lot of folks and raise questions about whether you \nwould have the opportunity to deduct your home mortgage interest or \ndeduct your gifts to charities. Some of them, incidentally, say\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\nto people, we have decided to have a new form of taxation.\n  I bet the Senator doesn't support another proposed new form of \ntaxation, though. We will divide Americans into two groups: One group \nthat works, and they get their money by going to work every day, and we \nwill tax them because we have decided to tax work just like the current \nincome tax does; and one who gets their money from investments, and we \nwill exempt them. Tax work; zero tax on investments.\n  I think that is the sort of thing that would be interesting to debate \non the floor of the Senate. The quicker we get to that debate the \nbetter. Those who offer this amendment say we don't want to have that \ndebate; we want to simply sunset the Tax Code, and we don't want to \ndebate the sweet by-and-by. We don't want to debate the prospect of \nwhat we might propose. Just asking the Senator from Arkansas what he \nproposes, it occurs to me at this point we don't have a proposal. All \nwe have is a suggestion, get rid of the current Tax Code and maybe \ntomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, we will come up with an idea so \nyou can then debate that on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have taken enough time. I hope when a point of order is made, as I \nexpect it will be made because this does violate the Budget Act, that a \ngood number of Members of the Senate will agree with the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, Tax Executive Institute, with the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and others who say if we are going to \nsunset the Tax Code, first propose exactly to the American people what \nwe would replace it with so they would have some knowledge and some \ncertainty about what this debate is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the issue that is up before \nthe Senate, and I have the deepest respect for the author of this \namendment, Senator Hutchinson.\n  I must say, however, that this is a very bad amendment. It is a \nprofoundly bad amendment. It is a sound bite amendment. It is a feel \ngood amendment, and if it were passed, I guarantee it would have \nprofound adverse consequences upon our Nation.\n  Why do I say that? I say it because there is a reason why the Tax \nCode is the way it is. We have to raise revenue somehow, obviously, to \npay our bills. But the reason the tax code has gotten so complicated is \nbecause the American people over the years have come to Congress--to \nMembers of the House and the Senate--and have said ``here are some tax \nprovisions we would like.'' Members of Congress, by and large, don't \nlead. That may be news to some of us, but by and large, Members of the \nSenate don't lead. We tend to follow the American people. I'm not \nsaying this is bad. We should follow our employers, the people we work \nfor--the people who elect us. And it is the American people who, by and \nlarge, ask us to do the various things we have in our Tax Code.\n  The home mortgage deduction has been mentioned many times because it \nis such a good example of what I mean. While it makes the code more \ncomplicated, there were very good reasons it was enacted and has \ncontinued over the years. There are a whole host of other reasons why \nthe code has the reputation it has. We are an extremely large, \nextremely complicated country. More so than I think any one of us here \nrealizes. There are so many different people in our country pursuing so \nmany different economic opportunities, so many different business \ncombinations. Our nation is even more complex as our economy becomes \nmore global, and we develop more opportunities overseas. And various \npeople in our country or its businesses have come to Congress and said \nthese are some of the things that we would like because we think they \nwill help the economy. That is why our code is the way it is.\n  There is no doubt about the fact that the code is complicated. It is \nexcessively complicated. We know that. We hear from our constituents \nall the time that it is much too complicated. But I think it is \nimportant to remind ourselves that there is a reason why, to date, we \ndon't have a flat tax, why we don't have a value-added tax, why we \ndon't have a national sales tax. It is because the American people have \nnot decided which, if any, of the alternatives they want.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would love to yield to my good friend from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator for yielding. A \nnumber of Senators are attempting to determine their schedules for the \nevening, and I would like to propound a unanimous consent request, if I \ncould.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Montana have 15 minutes \ncomplete, including the comments he has already made, and that the \nSenator from South Dakota have 5 minutes, and that the Senator from \nMaine have 5 minutes, and that following the allocation of that time, a \nvote be taken on this particular amendment and the motion to waive be \nmade at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the second problem with this amendment I \nwould like to mention is that it begs the question of what our current \nTax Code is going to be replaced with.\n  I must say there is something to the old adage that the grass is \nalways greener on the other side of the fence. It is part of human \nnature to think that something else is always necessarily better than \nwhat we have. That somehow a sales tax, or a value-added tax, or a flat \ntax is necessarily going to be better than the current code. We all \nknow, if we stop to reflect a little bit, that sometimes you get what \nyou ask for and you don't like it because it didn't turn out the way \nyou expected it to be. So all of us who, in my judgment--and I must say \nthis sounds a little harsh--are being pandered to with this amendment \nand are listening and are somewhat tempted to believe in this \namendment, should ask ourselves, realistically, how does life really \nwork? When people promise something great on down the road, is it \nusually nearly as great as it is promised to be? Or to make the same \npoint a little differently, if we are going to accomplish something \nthat is good, generally it is through hard work and through rolling up \nsleeves and dealing with the difficult details. Not demagoging, \npandering, or playing to the grandstand or to the crowd. That is \nbasically how we get something done that makes sense.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it is going to cause deep uncertainty \nin America. We are proud in our country of the economic growth of the \nlast 4 or 5 years--low inflation, low interest rates, generally low \nunemployment rates, high economic growth rates, and the stock market \nhas generally done well, although not so well in the last week or so. \nBut if this amendment passes, just think of all the people and all the \ninstitutions that are not going to be able to plan very well for the \nfuture and all of the uncertainty this is going to create. The list \ngoes on forever.\n  You can begin with business. Business has all kinds of tax \nprovisions. We can argue over the merits of these provisions, but they \nare part of current law and businesses include them in their planning. \nLet's take the business expense deduction that business now has. Are we \ngoing to keep the deduction for ordinary, necessary business expenses, \nor not? If you are a business person, you want to be able to deduct \nyour costs. Businesses aren't going to know if they are going to be \nable to deduct those costs anymore. They don't know what the next law \nis going to be. What about the farm provisions? They won't know what \nthe deductions are going to be for depreciation. They will have no \nidea. So what is a business to do?\n  Let's take an individual with a home mortgage interest deduction, \nwhich has been mentioned many times. What does this amendment do to the \nreal estate market, to home builders, carpenters, and electricians? \nWhat does it do to people who depend on homes or are building or buying \nnew homes? They don't know if the mortgage deduction is going to be \nthere in a new tax system. You say it might be. That is what the \nsponsors say, but they don't know that. Nobody could say with any \ncertainty whether any single tax provision will exist in a new system.\n  Then let's think a little bit about retirement. We have 401(k)s. What \nabout\n\n[[Page S9128]]\n\nthis new Roth IRA we passed last year? A lot of Americans are worried \nabout their retirement security. They are worried enough about Social \nSecurity. They want to be able to invest in IRAs and 401(k)s to save \nsome money so they can have a comfortable retirement. This amendment \nsays, no, we might not have those tax deferred savings plans anymore; \nthey might be gone. So what is a person today to do? Should he or she \ninvest in a Roth IRA or something else, independent of the code? Maybe \nreal estate. But we have already pointed out that real estate might be \nin jeopardy because of what we might be doing here. Maybe they can \ninvest in gold. But we also don't know what the commodity markets are \ngoing to be as a consequence of this amendment.\n  This amendment causes such uncertainty. Let's take the President's \nbudget--whoever the President is after the year 2000. He or she doesn't \nknow what kind of a budget to propose to Congress, doesn't know how \nmuch revenue is going to be raised. Not only do we not know the \nprovisions and how we will raise revenue, we have no idea how much \ntotal revenue we are going to raise--none, zero, nullity, no idea. How \nis a President to propose a budget to Congress under those \ncircumstances? How is Congress to pass a budget resolution under those \ncircumstances? How is the Appropriations Committee going to know how \nmuch money to spend? They won't know.\n  This is a kind of Russian roulette; it is a gun at your head. OK, \nimagine this amendment is law and we are getting close to the deadline \nin 2002. Yet we still don't have agreement on what to replace the \ncurrent code with. The proponents say this amendment will force the \nCongress to act. But there is an old saying that ``haste makes waste.'' \nAll too often we in Congress pass something very quickly that we \nhaven't thought about very much when we are under the gun, and we don't \nfully understand the consequences of what we have passed.\n  I see the Senator from Maine sitting over there. I ask the Senator \nfrom Maine, what is she going to be thinking when the years have gone \nby, and here it is 2002 and, despite our best efforts, we haven't \nenacted a replacement code yet? We have a choice--are we going to pass \nan amendment to extend the deadline another year, another 2 years, \nanother 3 years? Doesn't that cause even more uncertainty?\n  Or say we are not going to extend the deadline, instead we are going \nto push something through at the last moment. It ends up a hodge-podge \nof proposals. Something like a value-added tax, with a little bit of \nsales tax mixed in maybe. What will its impact be on the American \npeople? Nobody knows. I guarantee that the Senator from Maine is not \ngoing to know and the Senator from Montana is not going to know. That \nis probably what would happen.\n  There is something else we haven't talked about--Y2K, the computer \nbug problem. We are very nervous in this country, and around the world, \nabout what is going to happen on January 1, 2000. Are the computers \ngoing to work or not? I think it is a little foolhardy right now to \nstart to contemplate tax sunsetting in the year 2002 when we don't know \nwhat is going to happen in the year 2000.\n  I must say, Mr. President, this is a sound-bite amendment. This is a \nfeel-good amendment. I have bent over backwards to try to see the \nmerits of this amendment; believe me, I have. I tell you that I am \ndisappointed, frankly, that an amendment like this is on the floor of \nthe Senate and apparently is being taken seriously--because if this \nwere to pass, it would cause just tremendous uncertainty in this \ncountry. Americans' incomes would fall. America would be laughed at by \ncountries overseas. That might be a little strong, but they will \ncertainly wonder what the United States of America is doing; no country \nwould do something like this. Mr. President, I very strongly urge that \nthis amendment be defeated.\n  Let's talk about kids for a minute and HOPE scholarships. What is \ngoing to happen to them? I don't say this as a scare tactic at all. I \nam saying to the Senator from Arkansas that these are real concerns of \nreal people that I have mentioned. Say the Senator from Arkansas is a \nstudent, and there is no income in his family, and he really depends \nupon a HOPE scholarship to go to college. He wonders, gee, is it going \nto be there or not?\n  To take a more definite provision, say he is going to buy a home, but \nhe doesn't know whether to buy a home or not. That is a real question, \nSenator. It is not a scare tactic; it is a real question--if he or she \ndoesn't know if there is going to be a home mortgage interest deduction \nor not, it is hard to tell whether he can afford to buy a home at all. \nSay you are a homebuilder. Are you going to build homes? How many, and \nat what price ranges? Those are real concerns of real people.\n  Let's talk for a moment about what this does to American companies. \nLet's just look at fringe benefits, as one example. Employers generally \nare allowed a deduction for fringe benefits, whether it is health \nbenefits or retirement benefits. What is going to be in the labor \ncontract when a labor union wants to negotiate a labor contract? \nNegotiators won't know because they won't know what the Tax Code is \ngoing to be. They won't know what to negotiate. The better solution, \nobviously, is to address these real issues more calmly. I think that is \nwhat we need here--something that is rational, that is collective, that \nis out in the public spotlight, out of the hothouse of Washington, DC, \npolitics. And that is what is driving this right now--Washington, DC, \npolitics.\n\n  I am really mystified as to why this amendment came before us, and \nwhy it is being taken seriously.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we must replace this country's Byzantine \nand loophole-ridden Tax Code. How can anyone stand on the floor of this \nSenate and defend it? Just look at our current Tax Code. It has been \nestimated that it takes Americans 5.4 billion hours to do their taxes. \nOur Tax Code currently consists of nearly 3 million words backed up by \nnearly 10 million words of regulations. It is impossible to understand, \nwhich is why it cost taxpayers an astounding $150 billion a year to \ncomply with.\n  Our Tax Code is riddled with loopholes that benefit special interests \nat the expense of the general interest. Special interests have filled \nthe code with countless loopholes, poorly constructed tax writeoffs, \nand expensive subsidies that benefit a few at the expense of the many.\n  Mr. President, our Tax Code is not like a fine wine that gets better \nwith age. It is more like a woolen sweater in a closet full of moths. \nIt acquires more and more holes all of the time, and after a while, you \njust can't keep on mending it. You have to throw it out.\n  We want to write a new Tax Code that will provide all Americans with \na simpler, fairer Tax Code, a Tax Code that they deserve. And we want \nto do it by Independence Day 2002.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Senate about a year and a half now. \nIf there is one thing I have learned, it is that the Senate never takes \naction--that the Congress never acts unless there is a deadline. The \nSenator from Montana knows that better than most people. Does he really \nthink that we would have acted to reauthorize ISTEA, the transportation \nbill that he worked so hard on with the Senator from Rhode Island \nwithout a deadline, without the existing law expiring unless we act?\n  We are in a deadline situation right now as we rush to complete work \nbefore the August recess. We all know what happens towards the end of \nthe fiscal year as we rush to complete work on the funding business to \nkeep our Government open. The fact is, Mr. President, that this \nCongress will not act to do the necessary step of reforming our Tax \nCode without a deadline.\n  It is not irresponsible to allow 4\\1/2\\ years for this task to be \nundertaken. We are not prejudging the results. We are not saying that \nthe result has to be a national tax or some other possibility. What we \nare saying is that America deserves a Tax Code that we can be proud of. \nAnd the only way we are\n\n[[Page S9129]]\n\ngoing to accomplish that goal is if we set a deadline.\n  Mr. President, the Tax Code is not going to expire overnight. We are \nnot proposing sunsetting it tomorrow, or next month, or even next year. \nWhat we have laid out is over a 4-year period an adequate amount of \ntime to carefully and responsibly craft an alternative of which America \ncan be proud.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation.\n  No one--let me repeat that--no one is going to allow our current Tax \nCode to expire without a responsible alternative in place. But if we \nare going to restore public confidence in Government, we must start by \nending the current Tax Code as we know it, and by crafting a well-\nthought-out and responsible alternative.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this very worthwhile initiative. I commend the \nSenator from Arkansas and the Senator in the Chair for their work in \nthis area.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I share the sentiment of the Senator from \nMontana. This is a profoundly bad piece of public policy that should \nnever have appeared on the floor of this body in the first place.\n  The question is not whether we are for tax reform or not tax reform. \nThere is no such strawman to knock down.\n  The question is not only where will we go at the end of 4\\1/2\\ years, \nfor which the sponsors and supporters of this amendment seem to have \nutterly no answer, but what happens in the intervening years?\n  The answer has been clearly laid out by the business community of \nthis country, which is overwhelmingly opposed to this legislation, and \nby the thoughtful analysts, who also are overwhelmingly opposed to this \nlegislation. What happens during the intervening 4\\1/2\\ years of debate \nas we struggle with whatever might come next is that business cannot \nmake an investment in a knowing fashion--whether it is concern about \ncapital gains, or depreciation tables, investment deductions, whether \nit is individual citizens with their home mortgage, whether it is \nquestions about research and development tax credits, whether it is \nquestions about the future of pension law. The uncertainty will freeze \nthe American economy in a way that will assuredly slow down economic \ngrowth, lead to lost income, and lead to deficit spending once again.\n  Mr. President, there is a good reason why the business community and \nresponsible business groups all across this country have so vigorously \nopposed this legislation. They recognize this amendment for the bumper \nsticker sloganeering that, frankly, it is.\n  There was a time early on in this debate when supporters of this \nlegislation noted that they felt this is a absolute political winner, \nan opportunity to beat up on the Tax Code, which has no real \nsupporters, and on the IRS besides, without having to be accountable, \nat least in the course of this election, for the ultimate results of \nthis legislation.\n  An interesting thing happened in the meantime, however. Some poll \nwork was done by the Republican National Committee showing that a \nmajority of voters in America already recognize this as a reckless \nmove--reckless. That is the finding of the American public which \nalready understands the political nature of what we have here--a bumper \nsticker to abolish the Tax Code. It sounds good, if you are at the \ncoffee shop. We are not at the coffee shop. We are Members of the U.S. \nSenate. And it is our responsibility to chart the economic welfare of \nthis Nation into the next century in a responsible fashion that \ncontinues our economic growth in the coming years and which recognizes \nthat business needs certainty.\n  We can talk about tax reform, and we will do tax reform. I invite \nadditional debate on that issue. But to simply abolish a Tax Code with \nno utter idea of what comes next in the meantime, during which American \nbusiness is left to fend for itself figuring out how to invest billions \nand billions of dollars, is a sure recipe for disaster.\n  I have a sense that this amendment is not intended to pass. The \nreason we are here is not to make public policy. The reason, frankly, \nwe are here debating this issue is because there are some who want a \nslogan for the coming election in November.\n  I think that is regrettable. I think the American people deserve \nbetter than that. Our economy needs better than that.\n  I think this is irresponsible legislation.\n  I see a colleague of ours on the floor, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin. I \nsee others who have significant business success in their own careers. \nI have to wonder whether Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, who spoke \nagainst this amendment, who created a massively successful business \nenterprise in his home State of New Jersey, whether he could possibly \nhave gotten off the ground in his business with the kind of uncertainty \nthat would, in fact, be created by this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the question is not tax reform, or not tax reform. We \nall agree, I believe, that we need tax reform, and we need to push in \nthat direction. But this is sloganeering. This is pandering. This is \nsham reform. The American public deserves better than this.\n  It also violates the Budget Act. I need not remind my colleagues that \nit is the Budget Act that is responsible for bringing us 5 years in \nsuccession of declining budgets. Budget deficits, which were $292 \nbillion a year, are now a budget surplus because we abided by the \nBudget Act.\n  Now, to violate that and to set up a recipe for the destruction of \nour economy is utter irresponsibility. We deserve better than that. The \nAmerican public deserves better than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. It is not going to pass. It is going to produce 30-\nsecond television spots, no doubt, in November. But that is the reason \nthe American public has become so incredibly cynical about the American \npolitical process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. This deserves to die here in the Chamber tonight.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 202(b) of House Concurrent Resolution 67, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       Motion to Waive Budget Act\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I move to waive the Budget Act for consideration of \nthe Hutchinson-Brownback amendment and ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I rise to express my profound respect and \nappreciation for Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, two men whose \nlives were tragically cut short on Friday as they stood watch in the \nCapitol--a building that is, as we have constantly been reminded this \nweekend, ``the People's House.'' Officer Chestnut was 58--a loving \nhusband, a veteran of Vietnam, the father of five children, and the \ngrandfather of another five.\n  Officer Gibson was 42--a bright young man, full of energy and good \nworks, who had dedicated his life to protecting others. Like Officer \nChestnut, he, too, was a loving husband and the father of three.\n  Today, both men are gone. We mourn their loss and express our deepest \ncondolences to their families. We acknowledge that we will never fully \nunderstand what would motivate such a heinous act of violence against \nthe innocent in a building that is the icon of Democracy, but we know \nthat in stopping such brutality--in saving the lives of how many \ntourists, staff members and Congressmen we will never know--the names \nof John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut are etched forever in the pantheon of \nheroes.\n  All who are indebted to them--myself included--will from this day \nforward speak their names in reverence. Their courage will inspire \nthose who will hear told the tale of their sacrifices. While their \nchildren, their grandchildren and great grandchildren will stand tall--\nliving legacies of extraordinary men.\n  In expressing our gratitude to these brave officers, we also \nacknowledge the skill, professionalism and dedication of the other \n1,250 members of the United States Capitol Police force. They are among \nthe most highly trained and well-respected law enforcement officers in \nthe world.\n  Members of Congress, congressional staff, tourists, and all those who \ncome and go through these buildings are blessed to have these men and \nwomen on the ramparts. Our hearts are with them as well, as they mourn \nthe loss of their two distinguished colleagues and friends.\n  It is never easy, Mr. President, to weather a tragedy of this kind. \nThere is little, if anything, that can be done to console loved ones \nand to reassure the children of men whose lives were lost that the \nprinciples and sense of duty for which their fathers stood are the very \nvirtues which sustain life's goodness. But in time, they will be \nassured.\n  They will come to discover--as we all discover--that such principles \nare eternal: service, selflessness, sacrifice. Their meanings resonate \nbeyond mortality. And we come to acknowledge the simple truth written \nmore than 2,000 years ago: Greater love hath no man than that he lay \ndown his life for a friend.\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO OFFICER CHESTNUT, OFFICER GIBSON AND THE CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I guess what I will say on the floor of \nthe Senate, in part, is an effort to speak to the families of Officer \nChestnut and Officer Gibson, but I guess it is also an effort on my \npart not only to speak to their families, but also to speak to the \nCapitol Hill Police.\n  Early Monday morning, Sheila, my wife, and I were walking from our \napartment, which is near the Hart Senate Office Building, over to the \ndoctor's office. Usually that takes about 7 minutes. It took about 40 \nminutes because of all of the officers who we ran into and all of the \nembraces, the hugs and the tears, just the embrace of real pain that \npeople feel.\n  I want to say--I don't really have any words--this is a very, very \nsad day in Washington, DC, but I want to say to all of the Capitol Hill \nPolice that all of us in the Senate--but I am now speaking for myself \nas a Senator from Minnesota--want you to know of our love and our \nsupport. We want Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson's families to know \nthat their husbands and fathers, sons, brothers were so courageous. I \nwish personally that there is something I can do to change everything. \nI wish that none of this had happened. It is horrifying. It seems \nsenseless.\n  They were two wonderful men. I only knew them to say hello. I know \nthe Capitol Police much better on the Senate side. It never should have \nhappened, but these men deserve all of our praise. Their families \ndeserve all of our love and support.\n  Especially as a U.S. Senator, I say to the other police officers--I \nguess that is mainly the one thing I want to do today--I want them to \nknow how much\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\nI appreciate what they do. I want them to know how sorry I am that this \nhappened. I want them to know that I hope and pray it will never happen \nagain. And I want all of my colleagues to know, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, that I think today we are all together. Everybody \ncan feel this, everybody can understand this, and I think probably the \nbest thing we can do in memory of two very brave police officers is to \nunderstand how precious each day is, understand how precious people \nare, understand how important life is, appreciate the people who help \nus and go out of our way to make sure we live our lives in the most \nhonest way possible.\n  To the Capitol Hill Police, thank you for some of you being really \ngreat friends to Sheila and me. I know how much pain you are in, but \nplease know that you have our support.\n\n\n                       REMEMBER THE FALLEN HEROES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last week's deadly violence in the Halls \nof the United States Capitol touched the conscience of a nation. From \ncoast to coast, Americans gathered to talk about the shootings. The \ncoverage has dominated television, has dominated our newspapers, as \nwell it should. There has been much discussion about who the assailant \nwas, where he was born, where he lived, what might have caused him to \ndo this dreadful deed.\n  I must say, Mr. President, with deep regret, that this assailant \nspent a part of his life in my home State of Montana. We in Montana are \neven more grieved, even more touched, and find this tragedy even more \ntragic than others in the Nation--if that is possible.\n  This man was not from Montana. We pride ourselves that those of us \nfrom our State have a great sense of honor, pride, duty, sense of \nfamily, sense of community. This person, unfortunately, spent some time \nin our State before he perpetrated this dreadful, violent, evil act.\n  We are deeply grieved. We are very deeply sorry. I am speaking for \nthe people of my State of Montana.\n  Mr. President, there has been some conversation, too, about why \nthings like this happen. Did somehow the system allow a person like \nthis with some mental illness to fall between the cracks? The system we \nhave for treating mental illness, was it somehow not adequate?\n  Frankly, I believe that the system is inadequate. That is, there are \nmany people who are homeless. We are not properly treating people who \nare mentally disturbed, some of whom are paranoid schizophrenic. They \nare not receiving medication. They are not being properly treated, \nbecause our system is not paying enough attention to people who have \nthis illness. I think if we do not remedy the situation, we will have \ncontinued troubles on our hands. I hope we do remedy it very quickly.\n  Remember more than anything else the real heroes here. The real \nheroes are the officers who were shot performing their duty. Talking \nabout the assailant and talking about how we correct the system is \nmeaningless--because the real lesson here is the lesson of Jacob \nChestnut and John Gibson.\n  All of us here personally know many of the Capitol Police. We live \nwith them. We see them daily. We talk with them. They talk with us. We \nknow many by their first names. We know something about them \npersonally.\n  Tony, for example. Tony D'Ambrosio was a plainclothes detective, \nfirst a uniformed policeman, on Capitol Hill for many years. It wasn't \ntoo many years ago I received several death threats--regrettably, in my \nhome State of Montana. Tony came out to Montana with me and we ran a \nmarathon together. I got to know Tony quite well and have the highest \nregard for him.\n  There is Steven out there. Many know Steven. Steven stands by the \ndoor to the entrance of the Senate. We talk with him, we joke with him. \nHe is part of our family.\n  Then there is Henry. Henry Turner. Henry Turner is a policeman \noriginally from Alabama, who is also stationed out here at the front \ndoor. I often talk to Henry about legislation on the floor. ``This is a \ngood bill to vote for,'' or ``This is not a good amendment to vote \nfor.'' Henry would know more about the legislation before the Senate \nthan a lot of Senators, on occasion. A great man to talk to. Very wise. \nA very wise, very thoughtful man from Alabama.\n  The same is obviously true for John and for Jacob. I did not \npersonally know them nearly as well as I know other Capitol Police, but \nthey are men, they are fathers, they are parents. They have family just \nlike all of us do, all of us in the Senate, all of us in the country. \nWe are all bound together by the community of brotherhood, the \ncommunity of sisterhood, the community of family. We are all together.\n  Many people have said it in many, many ways, and I want to share my \ndeepest sympathy for them, John and Jacob, for their families, and I \nwant them to know that we all are with them. We are now and we will \nalways be.\n\n\n                   HEROISM IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DUTY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I rise this \nafternoon to speak of the tragic occurrence, where two fine officers \nwere gunned down here in the Capitol. The reason I say it is with \nreluctance is because, like many of us in this Chamber, I know from \npersonal experience that when a wife or husband or son or daughter is \ntaken from a family as a consequence of a totally unexpected violent \nevent, that there is little that anyone can say or do, no matter how \nwell intended we may be, that can in any way ease the pain of the \nfamily members who survive--the children, the spouses, parents.\n  So I debated with myself today whether or not to say anything at all. \nMuch has been said about the heroism displayed in the performance of \nduty, and much more will be said about the lives that these two men, in \ngiving theirs, probably saved. All that need be said, but none of that \nin any way is likely to produce any sense of relief on the part of the \nchildren of the officers, on the part of their spouses, on the part of \ntheir families. As a matter of fact, it is likely to produce, \ninitially, a sense of anger; a feeling of ``Why my father?'' a feeling \nof ``Why did it have to be my husband?''\n  So, in a few moments each of us in our own ways will, as we attend \nthe memorial service, demonstrate our high regard for and pay respects \nto the families as well as the deceased officers. But I also note one \nother thing from personal experience. Notwithstanding the fact nothing \nthat we say today can ease that horrible void that seems to occupy the \nchest of the family members who can't fathom why this occurred to their \nfather or to their husband--nothing we do will make them feel any \nbetter today--but, as time goes on, they will find a sense of comfort \nknowing that so many people held their father, their spouse, in such \nhigh regard. It will not occur for months, but it will occur. It will \noccur. And when it does, it will at that time help ease, ever so \nslightly, that sense of loss. The pain will never go away. The sense of \nloss will never be completely abated. But it will become easier to live \nwith. So, as I said, although a lot of us in this Chamber know from \nsimilar experiences the feeling, it is hard when you are going through \nit to know one other thing that occurs and that is that time, time will \nnot erase the pain, but time will make it livable.\n  At this moment, I expect, family members feel that nothing--nothing--\nnothing that will happen to them from this point on will make life as \nworth living as it has been for them. But, again from personal \nexperiences, all of us know, who have gone through similar things, that \nthe time will come when the memory of J.J. or John, the memory of their \nfather or husband, will bring a smile to their lips rather than a tear \nto their eyes. My only prayer, on behalf of my wife Jill and me--we \ntalked a lot about this morning before I came down--my prayer for the \nfamily members is that moment will come sooner than later. It will \ncome. It will come. But that it will come sooner than later.\n  We ask a lot of those who serve this Nation. But few of us, few of us \never have to give what these two officers gave. Even fewer family \nmembers have to live with the sacrifice they have made, the void that \nis created and the pain that will endure for some time, like the \nfamilies of the two fallen officers. So, again, I have no illusions \nthat my words, as inadequate as they are, or the words of any of us, \nwill at this moment give much comfort. But in time, in time I hope they \nwill find some refuge in what has been said, in the outpouring of \nrespect, the outpouring of\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\nemotion, the outpouring of just simple, plain gratitude on the part of \nthe staff, the Senators, and all Americans for what these two men did.\n  They did their duty. They did their duty. And, in doing so, they \nclearly saved the lives of other innocent people. That is no comfort \nnow, but it will, in time, be some comfort.\n  Let me close by saying, once again, in time the pain will ease. In \ntime, when they think of their father, when they think of their \nhusband, they will, in fact, smile rather than cry. All that we can \nhope is that time will come sooner than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO OFFICERS JOHN GIBSON AND JACOB CHESTNUT.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to add my tribute and \nhonor to our fallen comrades and colleagues, Officers Chestnut and \nGibson, whose bodies lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda just down the \nhall, where Members of the House and Senate paid tribute this morning.\n  I am not nearly eloquent enough to express the feelings, certainly, \nthat all of us have about what these two men did mean to us, what all \nof our officers, protectors, men and women who guard over us and our \npopulation that visits this great and magnificent Capitol, this Capitol \nthat represents free men and women, this Capitol that represents the \nbest hope for mankind, mean to us.\n  What I would like to offer is a saying that I have found comforting \nover the years and I believe applies very much to our fallen heroes. \nAnd that saying goes like this--that man is a success who has lived \nwell, laughed often, and loved much; who has gained the respect of men \nand the love of children, who leaves the world better than he found it, \nwhether through an improved poppy, a perfect poem or a rescued soul, \nwho never failed to appreciate the beauty of nature, and always gave \nthe best he had. Officers Chestnut and Gibson gave the best they had \nand the America they leave behind is a better place.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO SLAIN CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep regret over the \ndeaths of the two capitol police officers slain in the line of duty \nlast Friday. Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were family men; \neach was married with three children. They also were dedicated \nprofessionals and, as shown by their final acts, heroes.\n  Officer Chestnut confronted the lone gunman whose weapon set off the \nmetal detector at the ``document door'' entrance to the main Capitol \nbuilding. Officer Chestnut was fulfilling his duty to protect the \npeople's building and the thousands upon thousands of Americans who \nvisit their building, from violence. He paid for his dedication with \nhis life.\n  The gunman mortally wounded Officer Chestnut, then went into the \nbuilding, firing his weapon and finding his way to the office of the \ndistinguished Majority Whip, Congressman Tom DeLay. Congressman DeLay \nand his staff were in mortal danger from this gunman. I know that every \none of them thanks God for the acts of Officer Gibson, whose bravery \nand perseverance brought down the gunman at the office door, even as \nOfficer Gibson himself lay mortally wounded.\n  Each of us who serves in the United States Senate depends on the \nbravery and dedication of men and women like Officers Gibson and \nChestnut. Every day they put their lives on the line to protect the \nsafety and well-being of Members of Congress and the public. Many of us \nhave become friends with particular officers over the months and years \nwe have served in this body, and that is only right. But it certainly \ndoesn't make it any easier when we have to say goodbye to two such \ndedicated public servants and members of our Capitol Hill family.\n  My condolences go out to the families of these brave men. It is my \nhope that they will derive comfort from the knowledge that Officers \nGibson and Chestnut died protecting people from a mad gunman, \nsacrificing themselves for the greater good--a greater good to which \nthey had devoted their careers and their lives.\n\n\n             HONORING JACOB J. CHESTNUT AND JOHN M. GIBSON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to join the people across our Nation \npaying tribute to the heroic actions of Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and \nDetective John M. Gibson. These two men, who were killed during a \nsenseless act of violence last Friday, gave their lives in order to \nprotect the American people and their Capitol. They died fulfilling \ntheir sworn duty to protect the men and women who work in the Capitol \ncompound and the multitudes of visitors who tour each day. The loss of \nJ. J. Chestnut and John Gibson is like a death in the family. However, \ndespite the great loss that will feel, our thoughts and prayers are \nfirst with their families, who will bear the greatest burden of this \ntragic event. We hope that they may find some solace in knowing that \nthe Nation joins them in their grief.\n  These fallen protectors were true heroes. They faced gunfire and \ndeath in the line of duty. It is fitting that we are able to pay our \nfinal respects to them today in the very place where they worked and \ngave their lives. The Capitol Police serve with pride, efficiency and \ngood humor. They handle the enormous task of allowing the multitude of \npeople who visit our Capitol, the symbol of freedom and democracy the \nworld over, access to it without a feeling of having to cross a \nbarricade. This openness and accessibility have a heavy price, as we \nmourn the loss of these brave men.\n  Today, J. J. Chestnut and John Gibson are being given an \nextraordinary honor by the Congress when their caskets are placed in \nthe Capitol rotunda. It is an honor that has been bestowed upon very \nfew of our Nation's exemplary public servants and one which is entirely \nfitting for J. J. Chestnut and John Gibson. They were public servants \nin the most fundamental sense. Their sense of duty and service were \nunmatched, and as we mourn the deaths of these two outstanding men we \ncan also feel a sense of pride in the great sacrifice they made in the \ndefense of democracy, our Capitol, and its visitors.\n  Mr. President, I know my Senate colleagues and Americans everywhere \njoin in honoring these two fallen heroes: Jacob J. Chestnut and John M. \nGibson.\n\n\n            in memory of officer gibson and officer chestnut\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, in a place where President's have \nlaid, Officers J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson lay in state \nunder the Capitol Dome, the very symbol of freedom and democracy that \nthey died to protect.\n  On Friday, July 24th, Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chestnut laid down their \nlives for the people visiting their Capitol, for our staffs, and for \nus. These two brave men are true public servants. Their actions \nprotected American lives and our cradle of freedom, the Capitol.\n  Even though I never had the opportunity to meet Mr. Gibson and Mr. \nChestnut, I do know many like them. They are both husbands, fathers--\nMr. Gibson has 3 children, and Mr. Chestnut has 5, and J.J. Chestnut is \na grandfather. I also know them from the friendships that I and my wife \nJoan have formed with the committed and selfless Capitol Hill Police. I \nwant to thank them for their service to me, my family, my staff, and \nevery visitor that enters this Capitol.\n  Mine, my wife's, and my staff's hearts go out to the families of \nthese two loved family men and the Capitol Hill Police for their two \nfallen respected colleagues. They are heroes. While no words can ever \nexpress the sorrow felt, our prayers go out to their families, friends, \nand the Capitol Hill Police.\n  Thank you Officer John Gibson and Officer J.J. Chestnut for your \nservice to all of us and to this country. God bless their memory and \ntheir families.\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO FALLEN HEROES--J.J. CHESTNUT AND JOHN GIBSON\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two fallen heroes--\nU.S. Capitol Police Officer J.J. Chestnut and U.S. Capitol Police \nSpecial Agent John Gibson--who gave their lives to protect us. When I \nsay ``us,'' I do not refer only to members of Congress, to the tourists \nwho visited the Capitol last Friday, or to staff members working that \nafternoon, I refer to all Americans. J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson gave \ntheir lives to protect our house, the people's house, and our freedom.\n  J.J. Chestnut, 58, joined the Capitol Police force in 1980, following \n20 years of service in the United States Air\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\nForce. He earned numerous commendations and awards for both his \nmilitary and police service, including a Vietnam Service Medal, the \nBronze Star for Meritorious military service and countless letters of \nappreciation from citizens and staff for assistance provided and \nattention to duty. Officer Chestnut is survived by his wife, Wen Ling, \nand five children.\n  John Gibson, 42, also joined the Capitol Police force in 1980, and \nalso earned numerous commendations. In 1988, Gibson was commended for \ngoing to the aid of a citizen, and saving their life by administering \nCPR. Special Agent Gibson is survived by his wife, Evelyn, and three \nchildren.\n  It is horribly ironic to me that one of the fallen officers, J.J. \nChestnut, was a Vietnam Veteran who survived combat only to fall at the \nhand of a fellow American. As a veteran he served his country so that \nwe could all have our freedom, a freedom which the gunman who walked \ninto the United States Capitol last Friday and opened fire, did not \nunderstand, did not honor and certainly did not respect.\n  In 1862, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote: ``It is natural enough to suppose \nthat the center and heart of America is the Capitol.'' He stated that \nthe Capitol's combination of dignity, harmony, and utility made it a \nfit embodiment of the highest traits of our nation. A year later, \nSculptor Thomas Crawford's 19\\1/2\\ foot, 7\\1/2\\ ton Statue of Freedom \nwas lifted and placed atop the Capitol Dome.\n  Nearly every President since Andrew Jackson has been inaugurated on \nits steps. The Capitol has hosted a cast of American legends, as great \nSenators and great members of the House have presided and debated in \neach of two houses over the years, including John Calhoun, Daniel \nWebster, Henry Clay, Robert Lafollette, George Norris, Richard Russell, \nJohn F. Kennedy, Sam Rayburn, Carl Vinson, Robert Byrd.\n  The Capitol has also been home to so many milestones in American \nhistory. The Capitol was where the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, \nand where women were granted the right to vote. It was where war was \ndeclared after the invasion of Pearl Harbor following upon the famous \n``Day of Infamy'' speech. It was where the Social Security Act was \nenacted, and where legislation was passed to limit child labor.\n  More than anything, our Capitol has stood as a symbol of our \ndemocracy, of our liberty, and of our freedom since President George \nWashington laid the cornerstone for the building in 1793.\n  Let us not let the actions of the gunman last Friday threaten our \nfreedom, or our belief in our democracy. Instead, let us focus on the \nheroic actions of officers J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson, who last week \ngave the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  I am reminded of a passage from Thucydides' ``Funeral Oration of \nPericles'':\n\n       So they gave their bodies to the commonwealth and received, \n     each for his own memory, praise that will never die, and with \n     it the grandest of all sepulchers, not that in which their \n     mortal bones are laid, but a home in the minds of men, where \n     their glory remains fresh to stir to speech or action as the \n     occasion comes by. For the whole earth is the sepulcher of \n     famous men; and their story is not graven only on stone over \n     their native earth, but lives on far away, without visible \n     symbol, woven into the stuff of other men's lives. For you \n     now it remains to rival what they have done and, knowing the \n     secret of freedom a brave heart, not idly to stand aside from \n     the enemy's onset.\n\n  We have a lot to learn from the selfless bravery and public service \ndisplayed by these two men. Our thoughts and prayers are with their \nfamilies and friends at this difficult time. God bless.\n\n\n  THE MURDERS OF U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS JACOB CHESTNUT AND JOHN \n                                 GIBSON\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my heart goes out to the families of \nthe two officers slain in Friday's brutal shooting. These two men will \nbe forever known for their bravery, courage and heroism in laying down \ntheir lives to protect all of us who pass through the halls of the \nUnited States Capitol.\n  The Capitol police officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, made the \nultimate sacrifice that any person can give in laying down their lives \nso that others would be spared. Their actions demonstrated the highest \nform of bravery, selflessness, and professionalism.\n  We must all remember that the price of democracy is indeed, a high \none. At times, the openness of our government is sometimes challenged \nby events like those that took place this past Friday. But even though \nour democracy sometimes seems fragile when challenged by senseless \nviolence, we must all do our part to ensure that this type of violence \nnever happens again. I am confident we will take those steps as a \nnation.\n  I had just landed in Colorado when I learned what had happened in the \nCapitol building. When my plane arrived, I received an emergency call \nfrom my office informing me of the tragic events. In an instant, my \nmind fell back to November 28th, 1978 when in City Hall in San \nFrancisco the double assassination of Mayor George Moscone and \nSupervisor Harvey Milk took place. I knew the terrible anguish--even \nanger--that accompanies events like this one.\n  This event also shows the depth to which America's infatuation with \nweapons can lead to tragedy. Not only do we now see youngsters shooting \nother youngsters, but also the unthinkable slayings in what should be \none of the safest places in our nation, the United States Capitol. In \nthis very difficult time, I am proud to say that Officers Jacob \nChestnut and John Gibson will always be remembered as American heroes.\n\n\n   recognition of sacrifices of jacob j. chestnut and john m. gibson\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise humbly to pay tribute to Officers \nJacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson--and all of their fellow \nCapitol Police officers and law enforcement officers across the nation \nand world.\n  As I filed past the bodies of our slain officers in the rotunda this \nmorning, I was overwhelmed by the sacrifice they made to protect us, \nour families and fellow citizens. So many times, we take law \nenforcement for granted because we see them every day monitoring \nentrances, patrolling the Capitol, just being there. And, thankfully, \nwe don't often see events like the tragedy that occurred on Friday.\n  But events like those on Friday do happen. They happen every day \nacross this great nation. Law enforcement officers sacrifice their \nlives so we can live more safely and freely. Every time that happens, I \nremember the commitment they have made and I thank them.\n  When such madness strikes at our nation's symbol of democracy, it \nshould remind us even more that freedom comes at a price. Our citizens \nand people of all lands are welcome to visit our capitol and \nparticipate in the democracy that they help sustain. They can watch \nMembers of Congress undertake the people's business from the galleries \nabove the two house chambers. They can visit us in our offices. They \ncan visit sacred monuments and historic sites.\n  Just last Wednesday, at a coffee I held for visiting constituents \nfrom Washington State, one tourist exclaimed how impressed she was with \nthe accessibility of the Capitol, with the openness of the process and \nthe ability to meet and see her Senator and Representatives. I agreed \nthat we have a wonderful system and I praised her for taking advantage \nof that openness and participating in our great democracy.\n  But we have defenders of this democracy and openness. Those men and \nwomen are our police officers who try to find that perfect balance of \nan open society and a safe society. Sometimes that balance means lives \nare sacrificed to protect those noble goals.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the families of Officer Chestnut and \nSpecial Agent Gibson. This is such a tragedy. As I have read about \ntheir lives and families and commitment to their communities, their \nsacrifice was made even more real. They are true heroes.\n  So, I thank them and I thank the Capitol Police. I honor their \nservice. I will use this tragedy to make sure I remember the tremendous \ncommitment our law enforcement officers have made to us: To keep us as \nsafe and when we are in danger, to lay down their lives for us.\n\n\n             Tribute to Slain Officers Chestnut and Gibson\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and mourn the \npassing of two cherished members of our Capitol Hill community, Officer \nJ.J. Chestnut and Officer John Gibson, slain Friday in the line of \nduty.\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\n  As we mourn their deaths and pay tribute to them, perhaps we should \nrecall the particular, even paradoxical, quality of who they were and \nwhat they did: They stood among us, as members of this community, but \nthey also stood apart.\n  As many have noted since their deaths, both officers were familiar to \nthose of us who work in the Capitol. They stood guard in these halls--\nand so they stood, literally, among us. And their lives resembled many \nof our own lives; they were husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers. They \ntook pleasure from their families and pride in their work. If but for \nthe sad events on Friday, they might have continued to live as so many \nof us do: simply but decently, content to be known and loved mostly by \nthose closest to them.\n  But they stood guard in these halls--and so they also stood apart. \nThey belong to that small but remarkable group of people whose \nprofession requires the willing forfeiture not just of their time and \ntalent but, if necessary, of their very lives. Unlike most of us, their \ndaily work was to offer their life in the place of another's. More \ndramatically and compellingly than most of us, they embodied the \nqualities that sustain our democracy: selflessness and courage. In \nthis, they stood guard over our democratic tradition.\n  As individuals and citizens, we are defined not only by who we stand \nwith, but by when we choose to stand apart. I am honored that these men \nstood among us everyday and grateful that, when the critical moment \ncame, they also freely chose to stand apart. In tribute, in these halls \nthey guarded, we stand as one and grieve their deaths.\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS JACOB CHESTNUT AND JOHN GIBSON\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Capitol Police \nOfficers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson who sacrificed their lives last \nFriday safeguarding our nation's Capitol, Members of Congress, our \nstaffs and the thousands of Americans who were visiting the Capitol on \nthat tragic day.\n  We are privileged to work in these hallowed buildings that are \ncentral to the greatest democracy in the world. We are equally \nprivileged that Officers Chestnut and Gibson and their colleagues are \nwilling to risk their lives to defend us from harm and keep democracy \nalive.\n  Capitol Police Officers protect more than 7 million visitors who come \nto our Nation's Capitol every year. Often, they are the first to \nwelcome these visitors to our Capitol. I thank all the officers who \nsecure our grounds and dedicate their lives to our safety.\n  Officers Chestnut and Gibson and their families are in our thoughts \nand our prayers, but we also should remember to pray for the safety of \nhundreds of other men and women who protect us everyday as we do the \nbusiness of the American people. This tragedy should remind all of us \nthat our democracy and our nation's security are ultimately dependent \nupon the courage and commitment of individuals such as Jacob Chestnut \nand John Gibson.\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS JOHN GIBSON AND JACOB CHESTNUT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, honoring those who die in the service of \nothers is a practice as old as life itself. From ancient times to the \npresent day, those who survive pay tribute to those who have fallen \nwith songs and symbols, flowers and ceremonies.\n  And it is a good thing, for it is at times like these that words \noften fail us. Few memorial addresses have outlived those who uttered \nthem--not because of the inadequacy of the speakers, but because of the \ninadequacy of words themselves. To quote General James A. Garfield, who \nspoke at the first memorial at Arlington National Cemetery--where \nOfficers Gibson and Chestnut will be buried later this week--``If \nsilence is ever golden, it must be here beside the graves of men whose \nlives were more significant than speech, and whose death was a poem the \nmusic of which can never be sung.''\n  John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were such men, as their countless \nfriends and associates have testified, and so I add my small tribute to \nthe hundreds that have already been offered in the hope that it may, in \nsome small way, console the hearts of those they leave behind.\n  Mr. President, long after these men are laid to their final rest, the \nmemory of their warmth and their many kindnesses, their lives and their \nheroic sacrifice will live on in the hearts and minds of all of us--\nindeed, of all who visit the soaring symbol of freedom and democracy \nthey died to defend. From this day forward it will stand, like a silent \nsentry, guarding the memory of their valor and courage.\n  May the Almighty god who watches over all of us, comfort and \nstrengthen their wives and children in the days ahead, and may He \nprotect all who place themselves in harm's way so that we may enjoy the \nblessings and benefits of freedom.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9130-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE EMBERSONS ON THEIR 60TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nIndividuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era \nwhen nearly half of all couples married today will see their union \ndissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important \nto honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death us do \npart'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of \nlove, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country \nstrong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Glen and Vera \nEmberson, who on July 9, 1998, celebrated their 60th wedding \nanniversary. Many things have changed in the 60 years this couple has \nbeen married, but the values principles, and commitment this marriage \ndemonstrates are timeless. As Mr. and Mrs. Emberson celebrate their \n60th year together with family and friends, it will be apparent that \nthe lasting legacy of this marriage will be the time, energy, and \nresources invested in their children, community, and church, including \ntheir service as devoted missionaries. My wife, Janet, and I look \nforward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone.\n  The Emberson's exemplify the highest commitment to the relentless \ndedication and sacrifice. Their commitment to the principles and values \nof their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9134-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on July 27, 1998, during the adjournment \nof the Senate received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the following concurrent \nresolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to extend the temporary duty suspension on certain \ntextured rolled glass sheets; to the committee on finance.\n\n\n                      DUTY SUSPENSION LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with \nSenator\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\nHollings, a bill which will suspend the duty imposed on certain \ntextured rolled glass sheets. Currently, this glass is not manufactured \nin the United States nor is a substitute readily available. Therefore, \nsuspending the duty on this item would not adversely affect domestic \nindustries.\n  I hope the Senate will consider this measure expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TEXTURED ROLLED GLASS SHEETS.\n\n       Subheading 9902.70.03 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of \n     the United States is amended by striking ``12/31/98'' and \n     insert ``12/31/2001''.\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator \nThurmond, introduce duty suspension legislation designed to continue \nthe importation of certain rolled glass into the United States duty \nfree. This product is not manufactured in the United States. Upon \nimportation, the rolled glass will be further manufactured in a \nfacility at Fountain Inn, South Carolina.\n  I believe that this duty suspension will assist with employment in \nSouth Carolina. This facility manufactures glass-ceramic cooktops for \nthe North American appliance industry. Continuation of this duty \nsuspension will allow for the most efficient manufacture of this high \nend product in South Carolina.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2365. A bill to amend the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to \npromote competition and privatization in satellite communications, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n       international satellite communications reform act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998,'' a bill \nto update our nation's policies regarding the provision of \ninternational satellite services.\n  During the final days of the First Session of the 105th Congress, I \nannounced that I would engage in an effort to eliminate outdated \nregulations and foster competition in the global satellite market. \nSince that time, I have met with industry representatives and officials \nfrom the Administration, and my office has conducted a series of open \nbriefings intended to fully educate Members and their staff on the \ncompeting interests and opposing views surrounding this complicated \ndebate. The ``International Satellite Communications Reform Act of \n1998'' represents the culmination of a great deal of hard work, and I \nwould like to thank the Members and staff, industry representatives, \nand Administration officials who worked with me to develop a consensus \nbill for their efforts. It is my intention to hold a hearing on this \nlegislation when the Senate returns in early September.\n  Currently, the satellite policies of the United States are based upon \nthe Communications Satellite Act of 1962, a bill drafted in the midst \nof the Cold War, when the United States was engaged in the ``Space \nRace'' with the Soviet Union. At that time, America wanted to \ndemonstrate to the rest of the world its commitment to the peaceful \nuses of outer space and to bring the benefits of space technology to \nall the people of the world.\n  In that effort, we have succeeded magnificently. The 1962 Act led to \nthe formation of Comsat Corporation, and then later of INTELSAT, which \ntoday provides global connectivity from the United States to virtually \nevery point on the globe. The 1962 Act has paid the United States \nenormous dividends, to the point where the policy framework established \nby Congress in 1962 has been eclipsed by the success of these ventures, \nand by the development of healthy marketplace competition.\n  The ``International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998'' is \ndesigned to establish a new policy framework for international \nsatellite communications for the 21st Century. It is designed to build \non the success of the 1962 Act in a manner that preserves the benefits \nof that Act, while unleashing the power of private enterprise to \nprovide new and innovative services to the people of the world.\n  The ``International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998'' \nwill help to bring about the privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat, so \nthat market forces may shape the services and prices available to \nAmerican consumers. This bill is also designed to open foreign markets \nto competition--but to do so in a way that does not harm consumers nor \nreduce the number of competitors in the marketplace. It requires that \nall satellite service providers be subject to the same regulatory \nrequirements while preserving lifeline services to those countries that \ndo not generate enough revenues to entice the entrepreneurs to offer \nservice. This will ensure that universal service and global \nconnectivity will always be available to U.S. consumers.\n  Achieving the goal of drafting a thoughtful, balanced bill was not \neasy. I have worked with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to \ndraft a bill that is fair in its approach, consistent with our \ninternational obligations, and which maintains universal service. At \nthe same time the bill relies upon free enterprise, market forces, and \ncompetition.\n  In my view, the ``International Satellite Communications Reform Act \nof 1998'' builds upon the successes of the 1962 Act, while recognizing \nthat satellite technology has been successfully commercialized and that \nthe old policy framework is no longer appropriate.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation, in which I have tried to balance competing policy \nobjectives. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to \nenact this legislation, and update our international satellite policy \nfor the 21st Century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Bryan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bumpers, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2366. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat housing assistance provided under the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 shall be treated for \npurposes of the low-income housing credit in the same manner as \ncomparable assistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR INDIAN TRIBES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will correct an unintended oversight in the federal \nadministration of Native American housing programs, allowing Indian \ntribes to once again access Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for \nhousing development in some of this nation's most under-served \ncommunities. Joining me as original cosponsors of this bill are \nSenators Inhofe, Baucus, Conrad, Bryan, Kerry, Bumpers, Snowe, Boxer, \nDaschle, Burns and Inouye.\n  In the 104th Congress, the Native American Housing Assistance and \nSelf Determination Act (NAHASDA) was signed into law, separating Indian \nhousing from public housing and providing block grants to tribes and \ntheir tribally designated housing authorities. Prior to passage of \nNAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds were able to \nuse those funds to leverage the Low Income Housing Tax Credits \ndistributed by states on a competitive basis. Unfortunately, unlike \nHOME funds, block grants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are defined as \nfederal funds and cannot be used for accessing LIHTCs.\n  The fact that tribes cannot use their new block grant funds to access \na program (LIHTC) which they formerly could access is an unintended \nconsequence of taking Indian Housing out of Public Housing at HUD and \nsetting up the otherwise productive and much needed NAHASDA system. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is limited in scope and redefines \nNAHASDA funds, restoring tribal eligibility for the LIHTC by putting \nNAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds. With this technical \ncorrection, there would be no change to the LIHTC programs--tribes \nwould compete for LIHTCs with all other entities at the\n\n[[Page S9139]]\n\nstate level, just as they did prior to NAHASDA.\n  This technical corrections legislation is a minor but much needed fix \nto a valuable program that will restore equity to housing development \nacross the country. The South Dakota Housing Development Authority has \nenthusiastically endorsed this legislation out of concern for equitable \ntreatment of every resident of our state and to reinforce the proven \nsuccess of the LIHTC program for housing development in rural and lower \nincome communities.\n  I have joined many of my colleagues in past efforts to preserve and \nincrease the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program which benefits every \nstate, and I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of \nmaintaining fairness in access to this program emphasized through this \nlegislation and encourage my colleagues to support passage of this \nvital legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2366\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE \n                   DISREGARDED IN DETERMINING WHETHER BUILDING IS \n                   FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED FOR PURPOSES OF THE LOW-\n                   INCOME HOUSING CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (E) of section 42(i)(2) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to determination \n     of whether building is federally subsidized) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``or native american housing assistance'' \n     after ``home assistance'' in the subparagraph heading, and\n       (2) by inserting ``or the Native American Housing \n     Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (as in effect \n     on October 1, 1997)'' after ``this subparagraph)'' in clause \n     (i).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to periods after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2367. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Amici; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         certificate of documentation for the vessel ``amici''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to waive the \n1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly known as the Jones Act, to allow \nCoastal Cruisers, LLC to operate the 1983 Singapore-built vessel Amici.\n  Coastal Cruisers, LLC is a family-owned business in Branford, \nConnecticut that wishes to offer charters of Long Island Sound, Block \nIsland Sound, and the Thimble Islands, among other destinations in the \nUnited States. The Amici is equipped to carry only up to six people \nand, therefore, does not pose any threat to larger U.S. shipping \ninterests.\n  Prior to the Amici's purchase, the owners secured counsel to purchase \nthe vessel and to establish the corporation Coastal Cruisers, LLC. They \nwere aware that the vessel was foreign-built, although they had no \nknowledge of the Jones Act's restrictions on foreign-built vessels \nsailing between U.S. ports. Much to the owners' dismay, they were \ninformed by the Coast Guard that their services would be in violation \nof the Jones Act only after they had applied for a vessel \ndocumentation.\n  Coastal Cruisers, LLC clearly presented its intentions to use the \nboat for cruising purposes to several parties involved in its \nacquisition, including the insurance company from which it was \npurchased and the seller, who himself is a captain with an unrestricted \noperating license. These parties failed to inform Coastal Cruisers, LLC \nabout the Jones Act and the restrictions it would face in its endeavor. \nCoastal Cruisers, LLC never willfully intended to violate the Jones \nAct, a law about which it possessed no knowledge. Based upon these \nfacts, Mr. President, I believe a waiver should be granted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

App. 883), section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1886 \n     (24 Stat. 81, chapter 421; 46 U.S.C. App. 289), and sections \n     12106 and 12108 of title 46, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate of \n     documentation with appropriate endorsement for employment in \n     the coastwise trade for the vessel AMICI, United States \n     official number 658055.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S.

CHESTNUT-GIBSON MEMORIAL DOOR\n\n  Mr. CAMBPELL submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 113\n\n       Whereas on Friday, July 24, 1998, a lone gunman entered the \n     United States Capitol building through the door known as the \n     Document Door, located on the first floor of the East Front;\n       Whereas while the gunman's intentions are not yet fully \n     known, nor may ever be known, it is clear that he would have \n     killed many more innocent people if Officers Chestnut and \n     Gibson had not ended his violent rampage;\n       Whereas Officer Jacob Chestnut was the first Capitol Police \n     officer to confront the gunman just inside the Document Door \n     and lost his life as a result;\n       Whereas Detective John Gibson was the next officer to \n     confront the gunman and also lost his life in the ensuing \n     shootout;\n       Whereas the last shot fired by Detective Gibson, his final \n     act as an officer of the law, finally brought down the gunman \n     and ended his deadly rampage;\n       Whereas this was the first time members of the Capitol \n     Police have been killed in the line of duty in the 170-year \n     history of the police force;\n       Whereas the Capitol Police represent true dedication and \n     professionalism in their duties to keep the Capitol Building, \n     the Library of Congress, and the Senate and House of \n     Representatives office buildings safe for all who enter them;\n       Whereas the Capitol shines as a beacon of freedom and \n     democracy all around the world;\n       Whereas keeping the sacred halls of the Capitol, known as \n     the People's House, accessible for all the people of the \n     United States and the world is a true testament of Congress \n     and of our Nation's dedication to upholding the virtues of \n     freedom;\n       Whereas the door where this tragic incident took place is \n     known as the Document Door; and\n       Whereas it is fitting and appropriate that the Document \n     Door be renamed as the Chestnut-Gibson Memorial Door in honor \n     of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Document Door located on the first \n     floor of the East Front is renamed as the Chestnut-Gibson \n     Memorial Door in honor of Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut and \n     Detective John Michael Gibson.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a Senate concurrent \nresolution to rename the Document Door as the Chestnut-Gibson Memorial \nDoor. I feel that it is only fitting that this door be named in honor \nof the two brave Capitol Police Officers, Detective John Gibson and \nOfficer Jacob Chestnut, who just last Friday, gave their lives in the \nline of duty while serving their country.\n  Last Friday's shocking and senseless violence in the halls of the \nU.S. Capitol both saddened our nation and took the lives of two of our \nfinest.\n  Officer Jacob Chestnut was posted at the Document Door entrance on \nthe Capitol's East Front. Officers posted to this entrance are the \nfirst faces that many tourists see when they come to visit the Capitol. \nOfficer Chestnut's post, which involves achieving a delicate balance \nbetween the ensuring safety of those who visit the Capitol while \nkeeping the People's House as free and open as possible, requires a \nvery special combination of hospitality, humor, patience and \nprofessionalism. To his credit, Officer Chestnut excelled in this \nendeavor.\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\n  Detective John Gibson was the second Capitol Police Officer to engage \nthe gunman. I understand that it was Detective John Gibson's last shot, \nhis final act of a defender of the peace, that brought the gunman down \nand ended the violent rampage. The Detective's steadfast valor, while \nalready having been shot several times, was the difference that saved \nmany lives. We all owe him a deep debt of gratitude.\n  If it had not been for the heroic actions of these two brave \nofficers, this dangerous gunman would almost certainly have killed many \nmore innocent people. The two officer's ultimate sacrifice saved many \nlives.\n  This building, the U.S. Capitol, is far more than just a building, it \nis a living monument to freedom and democracy. It is perhaps the only \nbuilding on earth that simultaneously houses a healthy democracy at \nwork, while standing as a tribute to freedom that attracts millions of \nvisitors from all over the U.S. and the entire world each year. The \nchambers, galleries and halls of our Capitol are full of statues, \nbusts, paintings and displays that commemorate heroes and key events in \nour nation's history. The men and women honored under this magnificent \ndome have served their country in a wide variety of ways. Some have \nbeen great visionaries and statesmen. Some have been leaders in science \nor adventurers, like Colorado's son, astronaut Jack Swigert whose \nstatue stands in these halls. Each of these heroes has contributed and \nsacrificed in his or her own very real and personal way.\n\n  Some of these heroes have made the greatest sacrifice for their \nnation, giving their lives. Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob \nChestnut have joined this honored rank. They gave their lives for their \nnation while protecting our nation's Capitol, and it is fitting that \nthey will lie in honor today in the Capitol's Rotunda while a grateful \nnation pays its respects.\n  Not only is the Capitol the American people's house, it stands as a \nbright beacon of hope to all of the world's freedom loving people. \nWhile traveling this building's halls, I have been regularly awed by \nthe comments of visitors from other countries about how open and free \nthis building is. They state how they would never be allowed to walk so \nfreely through the halls of their own capital buildings back home in \ntheir respective countries. This is an important part of what makes \nAmerica great.\n  Whenever I have heard such sentiments, I am reminded of just how \nfortunate I am, and we all are, to be Americans. Our Capitol is the \nPeople's House, and it must remain open and accessible to all.\n  Thanks to the sacrifices of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob \nChestnut, and the dedication and professionalism of the entire U.S. \nCapitol Police force, our nation's Capitol building is freely \naccessible and continues to serve as a beacon of freedom.\n  For these reasons I feel that it is only fitting that the Document \nDoor be renamed in honor of the two brave Capitol Police Officers, \nDetective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, who gave their lives \nso that the Capitol building could remain the People's House and open \nto all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9140-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 258--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION OF A \n                            SENATE EMPLOYEE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrise today to recognize the Energy Express Americorps for their \ncontributions to local West Virginia communities. In 1994, several \nstudies demonstrated conclusively that many low-income children were \nnot receiving proper nourishment and we all understand how this hurts a \nchild's healthy development. Further research has suggested that not \nonly did low-income students lack proper nutrition, but they also faced \nacademic set backs while their more fortunate classmates made academic \ngains during summer recess. Inspired by such disturbing statistics, \nWest Virginia Americorps created Energy Express, a unique program, \nwhich offers\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\nsix-week summer program for low-income, elementary children to promote \nreading skills, to create strong partnerships with mentors, and to \nprovide nutritious meals. Energy Express is an innovative Americorps \nprogram that helps low-income children with a healthy, safe \nenvironment, and promotes reading skills in a community environment.\n  Energy Express formed an effective partnership with the existing \nSummer Feeding Program that provides nutritious meals and education to \npromote proper eating habits. The Energy Express summer camps go beyond \nthe call of duty to simply prepare and provide; they create a family-\nstyle atmosphere where the children learn how to make decisions, engage \nin conversation, assume responsibility, and cooperate with one another \nand others..\n  The mission of Energy Express also goes beyond just child nutrition \nto promote further education. Recognizing the need to increase reading \nskills and to encourage retention of lessons from school, Americorps \nprovides four hours of tutorial time that always remains fun. Weekly \nthemes of ``myself,'' ``family,'' ``friends,'' ``home place,'' \n``community,'' and ``ideal world'' guide the mentors and children in \ntheir work. The curriculum includes creating books, performing stories, \nreading both silently and out loud, and immersing the children in \ncreative art activities, all of which are pertinent to a designated \ntheme. At the end of each week, the child is able to take home a book \nrelevant to the theme to keep in his or her personal library.\n  The design of Energy Express organizes six to eight children per one \ncollege student mentor. These mentors serve as tremendous role models \nfor maturity, educational development and also as wonderful community \nvolunteers committed to West Virginia. Each mentor receives an \nextensive eight week training program led by on-site educators who \nteach them positive feedback, how to productively discipline and the \nbasic fundamentals of tutoring. Through preliminary visits and weekly \ncontact concerning their child's progress, the mentor reaches out to \nthe parents in ways which encourage involvement and support.\n  The program's growth in the past four years characterizes one of its \nsuccesses. In 1994, Energy Express reached two counties, 85 students \nand 13 college mentors. This summer the program reaches 38 counties, 68 \nsites, 2721 students, 425 Americorps college mentors and approximately \n25 Americorps VISTA Summer Associates. In 1997, Energy Express received \nnational recognition as it won the Joint Council of Extension \nProfessionals Award for Excellence in Teamwork and the Council of State \nGovernments Innovations Award. Energy Express also serves as a national \nmodel for many other states attempting to duplicate such programs.\n  Most important, however, is the success of the children. In 1997, \nstudies indicated that many of the students not only retained previous \nknowledge, but gained one month in word identification and three months \nin comprehension. 124,990 nutritious meals were served and the children \nreceived 12,930 books to add to their personal library. Many states as \nwell as other communities in West Virginia hope to duplicate these same \nresults. Their hands are somewhat tied by the lack of needed funds \navailable. Each site costs approximately $25,000, but the rewards \npassed on to the children, communities and mentors are immeasurable in \nreturn.\n  Energy Express demonstrates the incredible work and success of \nAmericorps. The commitment of its volunteers not only helps the \ncommunity, but also provides growth for the volunteers themselves. My \nexperience as a VISTA worker gave me a similar experience, and I \ncontinue my dedication to our Mountain State. I see that today's \nvolunteers show that same dedication, and I extend my sincere gratitude \nto all of them. These persons have committed themselves fully to public \nservice, both as volunteers and employees. It is through their hard \nwork that the people of West Virginia benefit from the world's myriad \nof opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9146-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE DEVONSHIRE MEMORIAL CHURCH OF HARRISBURG\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe youth group from Devonshire Memorial Church in Harrisburg, \nPennsylvania. On Sunday, July 26 ten students from the church traveled \nto Manning, South Carolina to assist in the rebuilding of the \nMacedonian Baptist Church which the Ku Klux Klan destroyed by fire in \n1996. The young people worked to renovate homes of church members that \nsuffered damage due to the fire.\n  The teenagers, who raised their own support for the trip through \nthings such as church-wide dinners and fundraising letters, joined \napproximately 250 other young people from across the nation to work on \npainting, hanging drywall, repairing roofs and caulking windows.\n  Church burnings are a violent act of hatred against the free exercise \nof religious faith. Arson, which has destroyed many southern African \nAmerican churches, has also destroyed our dignity and our humanity. By \ndedicating their time and effort to rebuilding the walls of a church \nburned by hatred and bigotry, these young men and women are tearing \ndown the walls of violence and racism and restoring faith to the \nChristian community.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the young \nmen and women of Devonshire Memorial Church for their dedication to \nrestoring a church and a community, as well as the ideals of freedom in \nthis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9147-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NEED FOR HMO REFORM\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our health care system is in a \nstate of crisis--a crisis of confidence. Many Americans no longer \nbelieve that their insurance companies can provide them with the access \nto care or quality of service they need.\n  Today I continue our series of stories describing how some managed \ncare plans seem to have put cost saving before life-saving. The \nexperience of Clara Davis is just one more example of the pressing need \nfor Congress to act now to protect the rights of patients.\n  Clara Davis is a retired grocer from Bolivar, Tennessee. In 1995, her \ndoctor placed her on the prescription drug Prilosec to control a \nbleeding ulcer. But her health provider changed from a traditional fee-\nfor-service plan to an HMO, and they told her she would no longer be \ncovered for that medication. The HMO would only cover cimetidine, the \ngeneric equivalent of Tagamet, a different prescription drug.\n  Clara's doctor fought vigorously to keep her on Prilosec, which had \ngreatly improved her condition, but to no avail. While on the generic \nalternative, Clara's ulcer worsened. At one point, her doctor removed \nher from that medication and began giving her office samples of \nPrilosec whenever possible. But it wasn't enough.\n  The ulcer would not go away and required surgery. Thirty-five percent \nof Clara's stomach was removed. During recovery, she suffered a stroke \nthat left her partially paralyzed on her left side.\n  What happened to Clara Davis should not happen in America. HMOs \nshould not dictate which medications a patient should receive when \ntheir doctors say otherwise. Patients should not have to face surgery \nwhen a simple switch in medication can remedy the situation.\n  Whatever we do will not alleviate the stress that Clara Davis has \nendured. But we can ensure that a doctor's decision will not be \noverruled by an HMO bent on saving money. All medications are not the \nsame, and health-care providers should be able to say what is most \neffective to treat their patients.\n  Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient \nprotections now. Experiences like Clara's can be prevented if we enact \nlegislation such as our Patients' Bill of Rights which protects the \ndoctor-patient relationship from interference by HMOs. Insurers should \nhave to make available to patients all information on which drugs the \ninsurer will be willing to cover, the possible interactions of those \ndrugs, and the procedures available for appealing an HMO's coverage \ndecisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9147-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9147-S9148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe ``Old Grange'' Restaurant, which has recently been placed on the \nNew Jersey Register of Historic Places. The Old Grange, which is part \nof Historic Cold Spring Village, has been honored by the New Jersey \nDepartment of Environmental Protection through inclusion in the \nRegister as one of New Jersey's Cultural treasures. It is a pleasure \nfor me to be able to note this historical designation and to celebrate \nthe Old Grange.\n  The Old Grange is located in the Cold Spring section of Lower \nTownship. Grange #132 was organized in the late 1800's with a charter \nmembership of thirty-two people. Also known as the Patrons of \nHusbandry, the Grange is America's oldest farm organization and the \nonly rural fraternity in the world. During the early 20th century, the \nOld Grange was the site of many Township of Lower activities, serving \nas a school, voting area, and meeting hall, in addition to supporting \nprojects and programs relating to the Grange Association. By 1970, Cold \nSpring Grange #132 was no longer able to maintain a membership base to \nsupport the organization. In 1973 it became the first building in the \ncomplex later known as Historic Cold Spring Village, the 19th century \nopen-air living museum located adjacent to the Grange. Since 1981, \nvisitors to the Village have enjoyed the grand meals offered by the Old \nGrange Restaurant, and the memory of Cold Spring Grange #132 has been \nkept alive.\n  The preservation of one's history is important to creating a sense of \npersonal responsibility for one's community. All those who have worked \nto preserve the Old Grange and the Historic Cold Spring Village should \nbe celebrated for embodying this concept and successfully instilling it \nin others. It is a pleasure to know that the rich and diverse cultural \nheritage of Cape May County is alive and well at the Village.\n  I am proud to recognize the Old Grange Restaurant as a historic site, \nand I am pleased that the State of New Jersey has made this \ndesignation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9148-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, this \nweek is the 8th anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. I would like to take a moment to remember this \npivotal moment in the history of our nation's disabled community.\n  As one of the principal sponsors of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (ADA), I am proud of the array of opportunities which have been \nopened by this law for millions of our citizens with disabilities, \nsetting a standard of inclusion for the world. In the eight years since \nthe ADA was enacted, our nation has become more accessible for people \nwith a broad array of disabilities, who now have greater opportunities \nthan ever before. This law has empowered millions of disabled Americans \nwith both the confidence and the tools necessary to live an independent \nand fulfilling life.\n  We must continue working together to ensure that the laudable goals \nof the ADA are achieved efficiently, equitably, and amicably. \nContinuing fair and reasonable implementation of this essential law \nwill ensure that all people with disabilities have the opportunity to \nachieve their full potential. I look forward to a day when all \nAmericans are rewarded for their abilities, not punished for their \ndisabilities, and when Americans with disabilities face no barriers to \nachieving their highest goals.\n  While some problems have occurred during the implementation of the \nADA, most Americans have responded positively and creatively to this \nimportant, but sometimes complicated law. I remain committed to working \nwith both public and private entities in their efforts to implement the \nADA as intended at its creation.\n  It is my firm belief that the ADA has helped demystify the world of \ndisabilities and break down many barriers which have traditionally \nexisted for the disabled. It has educated our nation and the world \nabout the capabilities of all disabled individuals and achieved major \ntransformations in society. I remain supportive of the achievements of \nthe ADA and all that it has done for our nation over the past eight \nyears, and I look forward to a future free of obstacles for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9148-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9148-S9149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NEWARK ACADEMY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of the \nfew schools operating in America today dating from the pre-\nRevolutionary war days. The Newark Academy in Livingston, New Jersey, \nis celebrating its 225th anniversary this year, and deserves great \nrecognition for its dedication to excellence in education since its \nformation in 1773.\n  For students who prove to have strong academic ability, the school \noffers a traditional college preparatory\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\nprogram and over 50 interscholastic athletic teams. With a commitment \nto diversity, the Newark Academy represents 15 countries, 85 \ncommunities, and since 1964 has been fully co-educational.\n  The Academy's motto, translated as ``toward enlightenment,'' is \napparent throughout the workings of the school. With 548 students \nbetween the 6th and 12th grades, this day school launches many \nyoungsters on a path towards enlightenment, adulthood and higher \neducation.\n  The Newark Academy's ability to grow and adapt to our changing \neducational needs, complexity of our society and the ever advancing \nworld of technology has contributed to the strength of the Academy and \nestablished it as an example for other educational institutions to \nfollow. I congratulate the administration, faculty and students of \nNewark Academy for the school's superior performance and wish them the \nbest in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9148-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            OPENING OF THE TOBACCO MARKETS IN SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nopening of the 1998 tobacco marketing season in my home state of South \nCarolina.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States is \none of the world's leading producers of tobacco. It is second only to \nChina in total tobacco production. Tobacco is the seventh largest U.S. \ncrop, with over 130,000 tobacco farms in the United States.\n  In South Carolina, tobacco is the top cash crop, worth about $200 \nmillion annually. It also generates over $1 billion in economic \nactivity for my state. Tobacco production is responsible for more than \n40,000 jobs on over 2,000 farms and continues to account for about one-\nfourth of all crops and around 13 percent of total crop and livestock \nagriculture in South Carolina.\n  It has been a hard year for tobacco farmers in my state. In June \n1997, farmers found out about a settlement between the State Attorneys \nGeneral and five tobacco companies. This settlement created insecurity \nin these farmers' lives, as well as in their communities, as they tried \nto prepare for the upcoming tobacco season. After learning of their \nexclusion from any type of compensation in this settlement, their \nquotas were cut by 16 percent from the previous year. This means the \nfarmers' income will decrease by 16 percent in the next marketing year.\n  While the Senate debated comprehensive tobacco legislation, the \ntobacco companies acknowledged to tobacco farmers that they had made a \nmistake in not including them in their original settlement \nnegotiations. These companies promised farmers they would be included \nin any future negotiations. Now we hear the State Attorneys General and \nthe companies are again negotiating a settlement, and once again the \nfarmers have been excluded.\n  In recent years, we have seen a rise in tobacco imports, as domestic \npurchases by companies have declined. This has had a direct effect on \nthe economy of my state. Many of the rural towns in South Carolina have \ngrown up around producing tobacco, and decreased demand for domestic \ntobacco has affected them greatly. I hope these companies see the need \nto purchase more domestic tobacco and decrease the amount of tobacco \nthey import. It is imperative for these rural communities' economic \nstability that domestic tobacco purchases rise.\n  I also want to take this time to recognize a man who will begin his \n50th season of auctioning tobacco. Kelly Ritter started auctioning \ntobacco in 1948, when times were a lot different. Back then tobacco was \nnot seen as it is now, but rather as a way of life in the developing \ncommunities of South Carolina. Technology may have advanced in tobacco \nproduction over the last fifty years, and markets may have gone up and \ndown, but it is a relief that there is still a constant in the \nproduction of tobacco--Kelly Ritter.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion I want to wish the tobacco farmers and \nwarehousemen in South Carolina the best of luck this year. I wish that \nI could be down in South Carolina for this festive occasion of opening \nday, but duty calls. Although I can't be there physically, they all \nknow that I'm there in spirit. And as hard as I have worked in the past \nfor them, they can expect me to work even harder to ensure farmers and \ntheir communities remain economically sound.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9149-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KIDS VOTING USA\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nrecognize an organization which began in 1988 with three Arizona \nbusinessmen on a fishing trip to Costa Rica. While there, they learned \nthat regular voter turnout in that country was routinely 90 percent. \nThey credit this to the Costa Rican tradition of having children \naccompany their parents to the polls. They observed first-hand the \nsuccess this small country had achieved by instilling in children at an \nearly age the importance of voting in a democracy.\n  The three Arizona businessmen took this idea back to the United \nStates with them and began ``Kids Voting USA''. Today, this nonprofit, \nnonpartisan, grassroots organization is active in 40 states plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, and includes 5 million students, 200,000 \nteachers, and 6,000 schools, and is growing fast.\n  With voter turnout declining each year, this organization recognizes \nthe need to educate our youth and instill in them respect for the right \nand the duty to vote. ``Kids Voting USA'' enables students to accompany \ntheir parent or guardian to local polling sites to cast a ballot \nsimilar to the official ballot. Although not a part of the official \nresults, the students' vote are registered at schools and by the media.\n  Mr. President, this year, Kids Voting Day is September 29th. I would \nlike to recognize ``Kids Voting USA'' and commend them for all they \nhave done to promote the future of democracy by educating and involving \nyouth in the American election process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9149-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9149-S9150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF MICHAEL QUEENAN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for nearly three years I have had \nthe privilege to know Michael Queenan, who has served in my office as a \nLegislative Correspondent, and is leaving the extended Kerry family \nthis month to attend law school. I like to say that Michael Queenan was \nthe best Christmas present my colleague from Massachusetts Rep. Ed \nMarkey ever sent to my office. Three years ago I was searching for a \nbright young person to bring new energy to our staff. We interviewed a \nlong list of prospective candidates and, although many were terrific, \nthe right staffer just did not turn up. One day, late in December, some \nof our staff members were struggling to fit the office Christmas tree \ninto its stand in the front office. Almost out of nowhere appeared a \nyoung man, an intern from Rep. Markey's office, dropping off a letter \nto be signed. After a minute or two, this intern had taken off his \ncoat, rolled up his sleeves, and was at work trimming our office \nChristmas tree. We quickly found out that this young man was a recent \ngraduate of Clark University and a native of Winchester, Massachusetts. \nHis name was Michael Queenan. In just a few days he was done with his \ninternship for Rep. Markey--and he was the newest member of our staff! \nFrom the first day he walked into our office in the Russell Building--\neven before he was hired--- Michael demonstrated a willingness to pitch \nin and contribute on any project, large or small. He brought a \ntremendous work ethic and energy to his duties, first as a Staff \nAssistant tirelessly working on the front phones and later as a \nLegislative Correspondent. After he joined our legislative staff, \nMichael Queenan also discovered a genuine passion for the most vital \nissues facing working families today. He spent hours researching \nlegislation, responding to constituent concerns, and pouring his \nenergies into the lengthy and at times tedious legislative process. \nMike was hard at work over the last two years, assisting our \nLegislative Assistants, on issues ranging from raising the minimum wage \nto making health care affordable, college opportunity accessible to \neradicating the A.I.D.S epidemic. In his own way--quietly, \npersistently--Michael contributed to the passage of legislation that \nmade life better for the people of Massachusetts and for working people \naround the country.\n  Michael Queenan, however, was always more than just a policy staffer.\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\nHe was a presence in our office. As the director of our intern program \nand the manager of our softball team, Michael Queenan established \nhimself as an enthusiastic leader on our staff. As a former intern, he \nmade it a personal goal for every one of our interns to have a positive \nexperience, to learn from their observations of the Senate at work, and \nto glean from their time in our office the value of hard work. Michael \nalso brought to our office his fierce competitiveness on the softball \nfield, earning the nickname ``Wheels'' for his speed and tenacity on \nthe base-paths. Michael might well have earned that title for the hours \nhe spent in my 1982 Dodge convertible, accompanying me to events around \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, I wish Michael well as he leaves my office to attend \nlaw school this summer. I will always be grateful for the hard work and \nlong hours he dedicated to his job in my office, and I will be equally \ngrateful for his friendship, one that will continue long after Michael \nmoves back to Massachusetts. I know that I join his parents, Fran \nHolland and Dick Queenan, in expressing my pride at what Michael has \naccomplished, and great hopes and warmest wishes for the bright future \nahead of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/28/senate-section/article/S9149-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9150-S9161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1999\n\n  (The text the bill (S. 2307), as passed by the Senate on Friday, July \n24, 1998, is as follows:)\n\n                                S. 2307\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n                        OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY\n\n                   Immediate Office of the Secretary\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Immediate Office of the \n     Secretary, $1,768,600: Provided, That notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, there may be credited to this \n     appropriation up to $1,000,000 in funds received from user \n     fees.\n\n                Immediate Office of the Deputy Secretary\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Immediate Office of the \n     Deputy Secretary, $554,700.\n\n                     Office of the General Counsel\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of the General \n     Counsel, $8,645,000.\n\n              Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of the Assistant \n     Secretary for Policy, $2,479,500.\n\n   Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International \n                                Affairs\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of the Assistant \n     Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, $6,686,300: \n     Provided further, That none of the funds appropriated in this \n     Act or otherwise made available may be used to maintain \n     custody of airline tariffs that are already available for \n     public and departmental access at no cost;
