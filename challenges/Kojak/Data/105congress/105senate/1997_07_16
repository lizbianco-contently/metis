Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage over an \nincident that occurred in my home State last May. Over the Memorial Day \nweekend, vandals on the Missouri River destroyed the Eye of the Needle \nArch, as well as several other stone pinnacles nearby.\n  Lewis and Clark, camping in the traditional homeland of the Blackfeet \nIndian Tribe, first noted these structures in their historic journal \nwhich, I might add, is replete with misspellings: ``Seens [sic] of \nvisionary inchantment [sic]'' and ``eligant [sic] ranges of lofty \nfreestone buildings,'' describing the Eye of the Needle Arch along the \nMissouri River.\n  Former Montana Senator Lee Metcalf had the foresight to designate \nthat stretch of the Missouri as ``wild and scenic,'' thus ensuring that \ngenerations of Montanans would marvel at these wonders.\n  But what took Mother Nature millions of years to painstakingly carve \nout was destroyed probably in a matter of hours. The actions of the \nvandals have been decried in both local and national newspapers, and \nthe people of Montana have been united in their condemnation of the \nacts. People have donated over $10,000 in reward money for information \nleading to the arrests of the individuals responsible. I rise today to \nadd my voice to those who cry out for the loss of a true Montana \ntreasure.\n  My motivations for speaking on this subject are personal. To me, the \nEye of\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nthe Needle was a symbol of what makes Montana the ``Last Best Place.'' \nIts improbable existence was a miracle of creation and a testimony to \nMontana's rugged spirit.\n  I plan to float the Missouri this weekend. I will see firsthand what \nhas become of this treasure. In many ways, I am not looking forward to \nthe experience.\n  To know that this landmark was destroyed by human hands gives me \npause to think on the absolute senselessness of the act. Tearing down a \nmarvel of nature is not a statement of defiance, not a statement of \ncourage, or even machismo. No, it is simply an act of raw brutality, an \nact of utter stupidity.\n  In every cloud, there is a silver lining, and though it is not easy \nto see in this case, there is a positive lesson to learn from this \nincident. In an ironic way, we have gained a deeper appreciation for \nthe wonders that surround us. They are precious; they are fragile. \nPerhaps this incident will remind us to protect the things that are \nnear and dear to our hearts. For all our sakes, I hope this is the \nlesson we learn.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address two of the \ncurrent investigations that are taking place within the Federal \nGovernment on this day. They are very different and they involve \ndifferent branches of the Government but are important to this country \nand many of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I will address first as a member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee what I think is potentially an important new \nbeginning in our investigation of the problems of the financing of the \n1996 elections.\n  Members of the committee have for some time had different perceptions \nabout the most serious allegations involved in that investigation. \nThis, of course, involves the question of whether or not there was an \nattempt by a foreign government, principally the Government of China, \nto influence our Federal elections in 1996.\n  I believe that there is now a common understanding that while all \nsides previously acknowledged that there was probably such an attempt \nand regarded it seriously, there were differences about certain aspects \nof the allegations.\n  I think the new common understanding is that while there was clearly \nsuch an attempt made by the Chinese Government, that it was bipartisan \nin its goals and primarily designed to influence the Congress of the \nUnited States and not exclusively the Presidential candidates in 1996, \nand that it also at this moment remains unclear whether or not to what \nextent it might have succeeded in either influencing the elections or \nmore importantly the policies of the United States Government. These \nhave been contentious issues that divided the committee until this day.\n  I am very pleased, based on statements made by both Democratic and \nRepublicans members of the committee, that I believe our investigation \nnow proceeds with a common perception of these facts. I believe that is \ncritical for the committee doing its work and in eventually uncovering \nwhether and to what extent this foreign involvement violated our laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7512-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7512-S7513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JUSTICE\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on a separate second issue I want to \naddress this morning the larger context of the continuing downward \nspiral in the national political dialogue, and specifically how it \naddresses the case of a single American. We have tragically in our time \nwitnessed this deterioration in the public dialogue. We are now \nwitnessing how its venom can influence the life of a single citizen. I \nam addressing, of course, the Whitewater investigation and the actions \nof independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr.\n  Mr. President, I claim no expertise in the question of the Whitewater \ninvestigation. Indeed, it is not the focus of my remarks this morning. \nAnd I hold no brief for either President Clinton or the First Lady as I \naddress this issue. Indeed, the injustice of which I speak does not \ninvolve anyone in the President's family, but rather a simple 42-year-\nold woman named Susan McDougal.\n  Since September 9, 1996, Susan McDougal has been imprisoned for \nrefusing to testify to an Arkansas grand jury convened by the \nindependent prosecutor Kenneth Starr. And indeed, under the law a \nwitness who refuses to cooperate and testify before a grand jury may be \nheld for a civil contempt of up to 18 months. In this instance \ntherefore the independent prosecutor initially acted within the law and \nprobably appropriately. But that is where the problem begins. Because \naccording to the legislative history of the statute, and indeed under \nthe case law, the purpose of civil contempt and imprisonment ``is to \nsecure testimony through a sanction, not to punish the witness by \nimprisonment.''\n  But according to briefings filed with the court, the prison \nconditions that Susan McDougal has endured up to this point sound more \nappropriate for a hardened violent criminal than a person jailed for \ncivil contempt.\n  In fact, while serving 3 months in the Faulkner County Detention \nCenter in Arkansas, Susan McDougal lived under the following \nconditions. She did not see the light of day for 3 months. She was \njailed in a unit that was constructed for 10 people but in reality \nusually held more than 20. As indicated by these photographs, she was \nusually shackled both by hands and feet whenever she went to court or \nto the doctor or to the dentist. This was not customary practice. \nIndeed, no other prisoner in that facility was shackled by hands and \nfeet in this manner virtually at any time, no less when receiving \nmedical treatment.\n  When in transport, marshals were under instructions not to remove her \nshackles at any time including when she required to urinate. She was \nallowed one visit per week, and only through glass. She was forbidden \nany family or friendly contact through visitation. She was denied \npotable water. She could only drink from a rusty shower or a sink \nattached to a toilet. She was allowed no reading materials except for \nthe Bible, of which I am sure she would have been grateful except she \nwas forbidden to have any reading glasses, even when she offered to buy \nthem with her own funds.\n  After a brief stint at the Carswell Federal Medical Center in Fort \nWorth, where she was placed in a work camp with other women, many of \nwhom were serving 30 and 40 years on narcotics charges, she was \ntransferred to California. There in Los Angeles at the Sybil Brand \nInstitute for Women, she was placed in isolation with one tiny slit in \na door, the windows covered with barbed wire, with a single peephole \nwhere she could see the light of day. She was denied any reading \nmaterial and was denied a chance to even meet with the prison chaplain.\n  She was later moved to complete isolation from all other prisoners \nand was allowed out of her cell for 2 hours per day. So for 22 hours a \nday she was in complete isolation, no contact with anyone, no ability \nto see the light of day, with a single window covered with barbed wire, \nnothing to read, no one to talk to, not even counseling from a \nminister.\n  During the evening hours, she is awakened every 20 minutes by a \nflashlight that is placed in her eyes. She is served breakfast at 4:30 \nin the morning where she eats alone in a 5-foot cell. If she should \nleave her cell, she is handcuffed behind her back and is forced to wear \nprison uniforms that are colored red, which is the color to indicate a \nmurderer or an informant. She is routinely body searched and forced to \nstrip naked for prison officials. She is escorted by a guard wherever \nshe goes, including to the infirmary or the library.\n  And finally, every time she uses the shower or on those occasions \nwhen she is allowed access to a telephone, every other prisoner is \nforced to be locked into their cells, which has heightened animosity \ntoward her personally and led to dangerous, unlivable circumstances.\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n  Mr. President, I do not know Susan McDougal, and I confess I do not \nknow a great deal about the Whitewater case. In many respects I rose \ntoday on the Senate floor to speak to neither, but to talk about \njustice. This is a barbaric set of circumstances that are indefensible \nand give rise to the question of whether or not Mr. Starr's \ninvestigation is being led by someone who seeks justice or is driven on \nthe personal destruction of individuals to vindicate himself and his \nown investigation.\n  Mrs. McDougal is not imprisoned for murder or robbery or any violent \noffense. She has faced no jury and is convicted of nothing. But for \nalmost a year, she has been held on civil contempt.\n  The Federal courts have ruled on a variety of circumstances, \nincluding in 1983 in the Sanchez case, and in 1984 in the Simkin v. \nUnited States case that a court is obligated to release an individual \nif it becomes clear that she will not testify after continued \nconfinement.\n  Indeed, in case after case throughout the history of this country \njudges have released individuals who have refused to testify after 6 or \n8 months of imprisonment.\n  Susan McDougal has now been imprisoned for 10 months. There is no \nindication that it will end soon. And it clearly is not going to result \nin her giving credible testimony.\n  Indeed, it was argued before a Federal judge 2 weeks ago that not \nonly is Susan McDougal's incarceration inhumane, it is \ncounterproductive.\n  If Susan McDougal were released from these extraordinary barbaric \ncircumstances tomorrow, her testimony in the Whitewater case would be \nof absolutely no value. Her testimony would have no credibility. It \nclearly would have been coerced. No grand jury, no judge, and no jury \nwould give it any validity.\n  Her testimony is now useless. Any individual held in solitary \nconfinement with no privacy, with no ability to consult with family or \nfriends, denied access to a chaplain, shackled hand and foot, subjected \nto body searches, awakened during the night every 20 minutes, in some \ncircumstances by a flashlight in her eyes, could not possibly at this \npoint be giving voluntary testimony that would be usable in a court of \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, Kenneth Starr should pursue the facts. If they produce \nfurther evidence that allows a case to proceed, it is his duty to do \nso. It is the obligation of every officer of this Government, in any of \nits branches, to first and foremost, however, pursue justice.\n  Former Senator William Cohen, then a Member of this institution, \nsaid, ``The appearance of justice is just as important as justice \nitself in terms of maintaining public confidence in our judicial \nsystem.''\n  Mr. President, there is no confidence in our judicial system that can \ncome from these facts. There is a cold tyranny on a single American \ncitizen. It is time for the Federal judiciary to intervene to bring \njustice and to change the circumstances of Susan McDougal's life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended to accommodate 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7512-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7513-S7515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WHO GETS THE BENEFIT OF A TAX CUT?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a debate that \nis going on in a conference committee on who gets what portion of the \ntax cut that is now proposed by the Congress. It is, I suppose, a \ndebate that one would expect if the Congress decides there shall be a \ntax cut, and the Congress has decided that taxes shall be reduced in \nsome measure for the American people.\n  The obvious question is, for whom and for how much? Who gets the \nbenefit of the tax cut?\n  We had a generous discussion on the floor of the Senate with an \nenormous amount of data and charts, with each side demonstrating that \nit is right and the other side is wrong, and each side using economists \nand all of the research groups that say this side is right, that side \nis wrong, or that side is right, this side is wrong. I suspect people \nwatching this do not have the foggiest understanding of how you \nmanufacture all these numbers. It is like making sausage, I assume--\nsomebody over there, huddled over a bowl, is throwing all kinds of \nthings in a bowl, and they grind it out and say, ``Here's our \nsausage.''\n  I come from a farm State, so I suppose I talk a lot about \nagriculture. I was thinking about an old story that a fellow in my \nhometown told me years ago about the chicken and the pig. It reminds me \na little of this debate about the tax issue, who gets what. A chicken \nand a pig were prancing around the farmyard and they were talking about \nthe upcoming birthday for the farmer and deciding what they would give \nthe farmer for his birthday. The chicken said, ``Why don't we give him \nham and eggs,'' and the pig thought about that for a long time, and \nsaid, ``Well, gee, for you, that's terrific, because for you that's \njust a contribution, but for me that requires real commitment.''\n  Well, commitment or contribution, this is the kind of chicken-and-pig \nissue on who gets what in the Tax Code, who contributes what taxes in \nthis country.\n  I want to talk just for a moment today about this commitment or \ncontribution issue, and when it comes time to providing tax relief, \nthen who gets some help. There is a discussion in this Congress that \noccurs almost every year around something called tax freedom day. The \nTax Foundation, in fact, puts out a little publication. This year it \nwas May 9, I believe, and it says tax freedom day is May 9. We have \nsomeone dutifully coming to the floor, and they hold it up and say, \n``Here is the day in which we are free. Up until this day, all of the \nthings we earn have to go to pay taxes, and beyond this day we are \nfree.''\n  It has always been curious to me that the amount of money I pay for \nmy children to go to school is somehow considered a burden. It is not \nto me. I consider it an opportunity to put my kids in a good public \nschool system, and the taxes I pay to help that public school system is \nnot a burden to me. But some people feel every dollar they pay is an \nenormous burden and a waste. They say, ``Here is tax freedom day, May \n9, this year.'' When they talk about tax freedom day, the same people \nthat come to the floor and do that say tax freedom day is the \naccumulation of taxes that people have to pay, including income taxes \nand payroll taxes. And, incidentally, payroll taxes are a big chunk of \nthe taxes people have to pay in this country. When they talk about tax \nfreedom day, they include payroll taxes.\n  When they talk about who gets what in terms of tax cuts, guess what \nhappens? The Congress then says we are only going to measure income \ntaxes. We are only going to measure the income taxes you pay, and that \nis the basis on which you get a tax cut. So you have a situation in \nthis country where over two-thirds of the American people now pay a \nhigher payroll tax than they pay in income tax. Two-thirds of the \nAmerican people pay higher payroll taxes than income taxes. Payroll \ntaxes have grown, and rather substantially.\n  So when it comes time to give a tax cut, we are told that the tax cut \nshall go to people based on the income taxes they pay, and if you don't \npay substantial enough income taxes, you do not get a tax cut.\n  Some of us feel that the working families toward the bottom of the \nladder, those working families somewhere between the 50th percentile \nand down who are paying more in payroll taxes than income taxes, they \nare working, they are paying taxes. It is a different kind of tax--\npayroll tax--they ought to get a tax cut, as well.\n  Here is the dilemma. We have a tax cut that is proposed in part of \nthis package that is a per child tax credit of $500, and we are told \nthat the per child\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\ntax credit will go to only those people who pay enough income taxes to \nearn the credit. What does that mean? It means 4 million to 6 million \nAmerican kids will not get a per child tax credit, despite the fact \ntheir folks are working and their folks are paying substantial \npayroll taxes, sufficient payroll taxes to earn this tax credit. But \nthey will be denied any tax benefit under this plan because they pay \npayroll taxes and not enough income tax.\n\n  Why is it their fault? Because they are not earning enough money, \nthey are at the bottom of the economic ladder. They are told in this \nplan, payroll taxes don't count. So, therefore, these 4 to 6 million \nchildren, the parents of those children, are not going to get a tax \ncut, because they only work and they only pay payroll taxes. That makes \nno sense at all. It does not make any sense.\n  Why would we prevent the parents of 4 to 6 million children, the \nparents of those 4 to 6 million children who are working, from getting \na tax credit of $500 per child, as all other Americans will get?\n  We were told last week by a Member of the majority who believes we \nshould not provide a child tax credit to those people who are working \nand paying payroll taxes, that if we did, it would be welfare. Why \nwelfare? These are people who are working, these are people who are \npaying taxes, and these are people who also deserve a tax cut.\n  It is always interesting to me that every time we talk about a tax \ncut in this Chamber, if you get way into the upper end of the income \nscale--an area, incidentally, where they have had enormous increases in \nincome--that somehow the most generous portions of the tax cut always \ngo to those folks.\n  I want to read some information that was in a piece yesterday in the \nWashington Post about what has happened to incomes in this country. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the Americans in the \nbottom one-fifth of the income distribution, the lowest 20 percent of \nincome earners in the work force, saw their after-tax incomes drop by \n16 percent between 1997 and 1994. When you adjust all that for \ninflation, they have 16 percent less purchasing power in a 20-year \nperiod. The next-to-the-bottom fifth lost 8 percent. The middle fifth \nstayed about even.\n  The members of the wealthiest 20 percent saw their incomes rise by 25 \npercent, and the top 1 percent of the income earners in this country in \nthe same 20-year period saw their income rise in real terms by 72 \npercent. So if you look at who has benefited substantially in the last \n20 years, you conclude that the top 20 percent of income earners, \nespecially the top 1 percent, have benefited enormously.\n  Why is it, then, when we talk about providing tax cuts, that we say \nto those who have not benefited at all, those who are in the work force \nwho have not received any substantial increase in income, in fact, who \nhave lost ground, we say to them, ``You are working, you are paying \ntaxes, but we're sorry, you don't get a tax cut.'' What kind of logic \nis that? This does not make any sense to me.\n  I will read a couple of other things that have been written recently. \nToday, in the Washington Post, with respect to this debate about who is \nproviding what benefit to which income group in this country, the \nWashington Post editorial says:\n\n       The Republicans have written a tax bill tilted heavily \n     toward the better-off * * *\n       The Republicans in turn have adopted a new technique. \n     Rather than argue as they might have done in the past about \n     the virtues of the bill, they engage in distortion.\n\n  They are talking now about the numbers that are bantered back and \nforth.\n\n       The people who wrote this bill aren't defending its \n     distributional consequences; they're denying them. The plain \n     facts are that the bill over time would not just mainly \n     benefit the better-off but would cost the government revenues \n     it can't afford.\n\n  I want to talk about this issue of better off, however, because if we \nhave a proposal passed by both the House and the Senate to reduce the \ntax burden in this country, it seems to me it ought to be targeted to \nthose families who have faced an increasing tax burden.\n  Which taxes have increased in recent years in this country? Does \nanybody know the answer to that? Which taxes have increased? I guess \nmost people would say the payroll taxes, and they would be right.\n  Payroll taxes in the last decade have increased, increased again, and \nincreased again. The income tax rates have come down, except for one \ncircumstance. But the payroll taxes have increased.\n  So the result is, when the discussion of the Congress is about giving \na tax cut, I think we ought to talk about providing tax relief to those \nwho are paying higher payroll taxes. But some say they want to prevent \nthose people who are paying higher payroll taxes from receiving any of \nthe significant benefits of the tax cut. Frankly, that is just wrong.\n  The piece in the Washington Post, written by E.J. Dionne, called \n``The Tax War,'' is an interesting piece that appeared a day or two \nago, and it says the following:\n\n       The Republicans are missing a chance to make their best \n     case for a tax cut. For years, they argued that government \n     should not tax people into poverty or make life tougher for \n     the pressed middle class. They were right about this, \n     especially since regressive payroll taxes take a much bigger \n     chunk from the incomes of the middle class and the working \n     poor than from the wealthy.\n       That's why it is incomprehensible that Republicans have so \n     fiercely resisted Clinton's proposal to give the $500-per-\n     child tax credit to families who owe no income taxes but pay \n     substantial payroll taxes. Most of these families earn \n     roughly $17,000 to $30,000 a year.\n       People at the middle and bottom of the income strata need \n     tax relief for another reason: For nearly two decades--until \n     the last 2 or 3 years of the current economic recovery--they \n     have lost ground or barely kept up.\n\n  Now, the point I come to the floor today to make is this. We are in \nconference between the House and the Senate on the question of what \nkind of tax cut and who receives the benefits of this tax cut. The \nchart I have here shows the percentage of working families in this \ncountry whose payroll taxes exceed their income taxes. You will see \nthis by quintile.\n  The bottom fifth, 99 percent of them, pay more payroll taxes than \nincome tax. These are people who work. They get up every day, go to \nwork, work hard, try to take care of their families. The second \nquintile, 97 percent, pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income \ntax, and right on down, until you get to the top fifth, and they pay 16 \npercent in payroll taxes. Sixteen percent have payroll taxes that \nexceed their income tax.\n  You can see the import of this chart. It shows the folks in the \nbottom 60 percent of the income strata in this country who are out \nworking, are paying higher payroll taxes than income taxes. Any \nproposal that says that does not count, that does not matter, the \npayroll taxes you pay are not part of our concern, is just plain wrong.\n  Now, we have an opportunity to fix it, and we can fix it in this \nconference committee. The House and the Senate conferees can decide to \nconsider payroll taxes paid as a measurement against who gets the $500 \nchild tax credit. They can do that. Some don't want to do it because it \nmeans they will not be able to get their special little deal in the Tax \nCode. They have lots of special trunks in cases that have been put in \nthis bill. Some want to have their special deal, so they don't want to \ndo this because it costs money.\n  If you want a fair tax cut and you want to be fair to working \nAmericans and working families, you must say to those out there in the \nwork force, ``We will give a tax cut based on a $500-per-child tax \ncredit and we will measure it against the taxes you pay--all taxes, \nincluding payroll taxes.'' The failure to do that means that this \nCongress is not doing right by middle-income families. This Congress is \nnot doing right by nearly 4 million to 6 million children and the \nparents of those children who will be denied a reduction in their taxes \nonly because the taxes they paid, the higher taxes they paid, were \npayroll taxes rather than income taxes.\n  So we have an opportunity to do this right. Most people look at the \nCongress and they think, if you cut taxes, guess what Congress will do? \nIt will cut tax and give people at the higher income levels, at the \nupper end, the biggest tax cut.\n  Congress has two ways of doing things. It deals with cakes and \ncrumbs. The folks at the bottom get the crumbs and the folks at the top \nget the cake with lighted candles on it. That is the way people think \nCongress behaves because too often that is the way they do behave. We \nhave an opportunity in constructing a tax bill in this conference\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nto do it the right way, which would be to say to all Americans we are \ngoing to give a $500-per-child tax credit, which the Republicans \nproposed and which the President proposed, which the Democrats and \nRepublicans voted for, but that tax credit will not be denied the \npeople just because they paid a payroll tax rather than an income tax.\n  This conference in the next couple of days can do this right or it \ncan do it wrong. I hope they will listen to the voices of some in this \ncountry who say, if you are going to give a tax cut, pay some attention \nto the needs of the middle-income earners in this country who deserve a \ntax cut, yes, based on income taxes paid, but also based on the higher \nsales tax they pay every day as they go to work and work hard to \nsupport their families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, I am pleased the managers of the bill will \naccept my amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill. My \namendment will apply the same standards for sanctions on countries that \nharbor Rwandan indicted war criminals as are applied to countries that \nprovide sanctuary for individuals indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes \ntribunal.\n  As the bill is currently written, with the exception of certain types \nof humanitarian assistance, no foreign aid can be given to any country \nthat provides sanctuary to individuals indicted by the Yugoslav war \ncrimes tribunal. But for those individuals indicted by the Rwandan war \ncrimes tribunal, the bill contains only a discretionary authority to \nwithhold aid.\n  Mr. President, the United States was a cosponsor of the U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution which authorized the establishment of the Rwandan \nwar crimes tribunal. Accountability for the 500,000 people killed in \nthe 1994 genocide is an integral part of any effort for reconciliation \nand reconstruction in Rwanda, much like the Truth Commission in South \nAfrica.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is not without precedent. The foreign \noperations bill 2 years ago restricted foreign assistance to countries \nthat harbored both Rwandan and Yugoslav indicted war criminals. I \nbelieve this was the right standard, and to do anything less sends the \nwrong message on war crimes. If we say we are against war crimes in \nYugoslavia, we should also equally say we are against war crimes in \nRwanda. I don't believe that there's one Senator who doesn't share this \nbelief--but it is important that we say so.\n  My amendment makes a strong statement of support for the Rwandan \ntribunal and for the cause of human rights in Africa.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that these have \nbeen approved by the Democrats.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, Senator Leahy \nis detained. On his behalf, I am here to say that the amendments have \nbeen approved, and he is either a sponsor or a cosponsor with Senator \nMcConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 876 through 883), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring the fiscal year \n1998 foreign operations, export promotion, and related programs \nappropriations bill to the Senate for consideration today. I might say \nat the outset that we anticipate finishing this bill tonight. There are \nvery few amendments of which I am aware and, hopefully, we can mirror \nthe speed with which the Department of Defense appropriations bill and \nthe energy and water appropriations bill were completed.\n  Senator Leahy and I have worked closely together to produce a bill \nwhich effectively serves vital international U.S. political and \neconomic priorities with the $13 billion allocated to our subcommittee.\n  Let me point out right up front that while the bill stands at $13 \nbillion, we are funding $13.2 billion on programs; the difference is \ndue to the Budget Committee's treatment of arrears at international \nfinancial institutions.\n  For the first time in more than a decade, the foreign operations \naccount actually experienced an increase. We can thank Senator Stevens \nfor understanding how important it is to have international options \nshort of sending in U.S. troops. I might just say, Mr. President, on \nthat point, there are a number of our colleagues who are particularly \nenthusiastic about the defense option, and I am among them. On the \nother hand, being able to engage overseas without the use of troops is \nfrequently, always, less dangerous and, many times, less expensive.\n  For the better part of the last 3 years, Senator Leahy and I have \nwarned that the United States would pay long-term consequences if we \ncontinued the pattern of shortsighted gains made by reducing foreign \nassistance.\n  Finally, the administration listened. I want to commend Secretary \nAlbright for making an increase in the 150 account her first and \nforemost priority. The nearly $1 billion increase arrested a \ndevastating decade-long decline.\n  I think it is important to put this increase in perspective. Measured \nagainst foreign aid's peak year of 1985, our resources have dropped \nnearly 60 percent. Since 1990, we have seen a 40-percent reduction. \nKeep in mind that those cuts have occurred in times when the United \nStates established assistance programs to help strengthen and stabilize \nmore than two dozen new, emerging democracies.\n  As we welcome Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, \nthereby expanding European stability and security arrangements, we \nshould all remember it was the United States economic and security \nassistance that helped make this possible.\n  Just taking a look, Mr. President, at the chart here behind me, my \ncolleagues will notice that in 1985, in billions, the foreign \noperations account was $28.2 billion. A mere 12 years later, it was \n$12.2. And what we are seeing this year, after a decline of $28.2 to \n$12 billion, is an increase back up to $13.4 billion.\n  I will argue, as I did a few moments ago, that given the new \nresponsibilities to the new emerging democracies, that this increase \nthis year in the 150 account is entirely appropriate.\n  The aspirations, ingenuity, and determination of the citizens of \nthese countries--particularly in Central Europe--combined with American \ngrants, loans, exchanges, training, and equipment to build democratic \ninstitutions, strong free markets, and responsible military partners \nmakes a lot of sense.\n  Obviously, this effort should be continued. The combination of an \nincrease in the foreign assistance allocation, along with progress made \nby emerging European democracies, have made this a key transition \nyear--one in which we have an opportunity to initiate support for new \npriorities while ending or establishing clear performance benchmarks in \ncountries where U.S. support is not fulfilling political or economic \nexpectations.\n  In this context, let me review some of the bill's highlights.\n  In title I, we have increased export promotion support over the \nadministration's request. We have fully funded the Trade and \nDevelopment Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and \nto compensate for dismal forecasting at the Eximbank, we\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\nhave increased the funding there as well.\n  No one is more pleased than I am that there is a new team directing \nthe Bank's important work. However, the new Chairman arrives in with \nthe news that the Bank expects to have to carry over into 1998 nearly \n$400 million in planned or possible 1997 projects because of a \nshortfall in available funding. At a time when everyone recognizes that \nexports are key to American economic growth, we need to support Exim's \nvital mission. While the administration asked for $632 million, we have \nprovided $700 million to support American business as they venture into \ntough emerging markets.\n  Title II provides funding for all bilateral programs, including \ndevelopment assistance activities, programs in the new independent \nstates and Central and Eastern Europe, disaster aid, the Peace Corps, \ninternational narcotics control, and a consolidated fund which covers \nnonproliferation, demining, antiterrorism, IAEA activities, and related \nprograms.\n  Within this title, there are a number of provisions which reflect the \ncommittee's new emphasis of building on success and objectively \nrecognizing and reversing failures.\n  Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East. I will not \nspend a great deal of time at this point on the issue of Egypt's record \nover the last 2 years. Let me simply say that funding for both Egypt \nand Israel has always been provided in the context of the Camp David \naccords and a national commitment to serving the interests of peace.\n  Leading a renewal of the Arab economic boycott of Israel, rejecting \nPresident Clinton's plea to participate in the peace summit, and \nactively opposing the Hebron agreement between Israel and the \nPalestinians are a few reasons why Egypt no longer seems to share our \ncommitment to regional stability and peace. To send a signal that \nimprovements are expected if aid is to continue to flow, the committee \ndid not earmark funds for Egypt.\n  In contrast, King Hussein has taken enormous risks to advance peace, \nand the committee reflected its support for this effort by \nsubstantially increasing economic and security assistance to Jordan. \nEgypt and Jordan define the basic tenet of this bill: Aid is not an \nentitlement program. It must be earned, and it must be deserved.\n  The NIS offers other examples of this approach. For several years the \nSenate has earmarked funds for Ukraine. Now I believe it is time to \nassess results. Although Ukraine has made remarkable progress in \npassing a constitution and introducing a new currency, I think it is \ntime to register our concerns that corruption and the slow pace of \nreforms may defeat the relevance and impact of our assistance.\n\n  As in the past, we have earmarked $225 million, making clear we still \nbelieve in Ukraine's strategic importance and support the \nconstitutional and economic changes which have been achieved. However, \nto leverage improvements and accelerate the pace of reforms, 35 percent \nof the aid package is withheld until the Secretary of State \ncertificates progress has been made combating corruption, and moving \nforward with key economic and political policy changes.\n  Russia offers another example of where aid must better serve United \nStates interests. For the past 2 years, the bill has included language \nlinking the provision of aid to the termination of Russia's nuclear \ncooperation with Iran--a provision always watered down by the \nadministration. With elections around the corner, the administration's \nargument last year was simple: If we cut off aid, they said, we \nundermine the election chances of the only people who are committed to \nending this lethal program.\n  Well, we all know the reformers won the election last year, and, \nunfortunately, the nuclear program is still around. Only now it is \nexpanded, and the Russians are not only collaborating with Iran on a \nnuclear powerplant. They are working together on a missile technology \nprogram. This year a waiver allowing aid to continue--no matter what \nthe Russians do with Iran--is simply out of the question.\n  Consistent with our effort to take aid off autopilot, the bill also \nincludes language addressing the crisis in Cambodia. In our opening \nhearing this year, the administrator of AID referred to Cambodia as a \ndemocratic success story, a view echoed by the Secretary of State in \nour closing hearing. Persistent allegations of close collaboration \nbetween Cambodia's leadership and major regional drug traffickers were \ndismissed in that hearing, as were alarming accounts of the two prime \nministers arming themselves for a resumption of civil war.\n  As we all know, a few short weeks ago the committee report called \nattention to this rapidly deteriorating situation and conditioned \nassistance of all further aid on progress in four key areas. The \nSecretary had to certify the government had taken steps to: First, end \npolitical violence and intimidation of opposition candidates; second, \nestablish an independent election commission; third, protect voters and \nelection participants by establishing laws and regulations guaranteeing \nfreedom of speech and assembly; and, fourth, eliminate corruption and \ncollaboration with narcotics dealers.\n  Mr. President, however elusive that goal now seems, each of these \nsteps remains important to the future of democracy in Cambodia. With \nthe coup engineered by Hun Sen last week, I intend to further modify \nthese conditions as we proceed forward with this bill today.\n  Turning to title III, the committee has provided over $3.3 billion in \nsecurity assistance, loans and grants and support for international \npeacekeeping. While this level reflects a slight reduction of the \nadministration's request, we were able to provide an increase in aid to \nJordan and an increase in support for Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\n  Let me speak for a moment to the case of the Baltic countries. I know \nI am joined by many of my colleagues who believe the Baltic nations \nshould be the next nations on the list of NATO entrants. Having never \nrecognized their domination by the Soviet Union during the cold war, I \nthink it is a serious mistake for the administration to now bow to \nRussian demands that the Baltic nations be excluded from NATO. In \neffect, the administration's policy relegates the Baltic States to the \nRussian sphere of influence, a perverse reversal of political fortune \nand a mistake of historic proportions.\n  These nations are ready, willing, and able to make a meaningful \nmilitary and political contribution to NATO's mission. The funding we \nhave provided will strengthen and deepen the Baltic ties to NATO by \nfacilitating the completion of a civilian military regional airspace \ncontrol system, an important step toward membership. This funding \nreflects a strong view that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia deserve to \nbe integrated into a stable European security structure and have earned \nour political commitment and continued support for NATO admission.\n  Finally, let me turn to title IV in the bill, which provides funding \nfor the international financial institutions. Although we have reduced \nthe administration's request, we have been able to meet virtually all \ncurrent-year obligations as well as make substantial progress on past \nobligations incurred by this administration.\n  I want all of my colleagues to know that we have once again withheld \nfunds for IDA until the Secretary of the Treasury certificates that the \ninterim trust fund has removed all procurement restrictions imposed \nwhich exclude American contractors.\n  I want the members of both the trust fund and IDA to be on notice \nthat these restrictions must be gone before this legislation is enacted \nor I cannot support full funding for IDA in conference.\n  The last section of the bill is devoted to general provisions. One in \nparticular is worth noting because it is in keeping with the principles \nwe have developed to end aid as an entitlement program.\n  When the Dayton agreement was signed, each party pledged to support \nthe International Tribunal's efforts to arrest and prosecute war \ncriminals. Today, 66 indicted fugitives remain at large--with \npotentially many more under sealed indictment.\n  These are not bandits in hiding living in fear of capture. These \noutlaws continue to work and wander the streets and, in some cases, \nsuch those of Radovan Karadic and Ratko Mladic, they continue to \nexercise real power.\n  Section 573 ends assistance to regional authorities refusing to \ncooperate in the international effort to bring\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nthese fugitives to justice. Peace in Bosnia cannot be sustained if the \nTribunal fails to complete its task. Stability and economic growth \ndepend on the repatriation of refugees consistent with the Dayton \nagreement--and those refugees will not return to communities which \ncontinue to be terrorized and intimidated by war criminals.\n  Section 573 bans aid to countries which have not cooperated in the \narrest of war criminals. Waiver authority is granted to the President \nfor a period of 6 months, if he certifies that a country has turned \nover a majority of war criminals. However, at the end of the 6 months, \naid can only continue if the President certifies that all war criminals \nhave been arrested.\n  The provision exempts democracy building, demining and humanitarian \nprograms in an effort to afford the administration some carrots as it \nattempts to encourage compliance.\n  But, this should not be seen as a door which will be opened wider \ncreating more exemptions and weaker standards. Let us be clear on a \nsingle point: after more than $400 million in U.S. aid, we need to \nimplement and enforce the moral reckoning which only the Tribunal can \noffer. Only justice can bridge the deep divides which continue to \nfracture the former Yugoslavia.\n  Let me conclude by once again emphasizing that the increase in the \n150 account represents both an opportunity and an obligation to more \neffectively serve American international interests. We can only \naccomplish this purpose if we end aid as an entitlement program. I \nbelieve this bill sets us on the right course and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 885, 886, and 887\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As an indication of how quickly we should be able to \nmove this bill, I see that my friend and colleague from Oregon is here \nready to offer an amendment, and before I yield the floor for that \npurpose, I will offer an amendment to earmark aid to Egypt for myself \nand Senator Leahy, Senator Stevens, and Senator Byrd.\n  I am also going to send to the desk two amendments on Cambodia.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sending to the desk three amendments at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section, and renumber the remaining sections accordingly:\n\n     SEC.   . TO PROHIBIT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF \n                   RUSSIA SHOULD IT ENACT LAWS WHICH WOULD \n                   DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MINORITY RELIGIOUS FAITHS \n                   IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated under this Act may be made \n     available for the Government of Russian Federation unless the \n     President determines and certifies in writing to the \n     Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate that the Government of the Russian \n     Federation has enacted no statute or promulgated no executive \n     order that would discriminate, or would have as its principal \n     effect discrimination, against religious minorities in the \n     Russian Federation in violation of accepted international \n     agreements on human rights and religious freedoms to which \n     the Russian Federation is a signatory, including the European \n     Convention and the 1989 Vienna Concluding Document of the \n     Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, on the Fourth of \nJuly, as Americans were celebrating their cherished freedoms upon which \nthis country was founded, the Russian Federation passed a bill which, \nif signed into law, would restrict freedom of religion in that country \nin a lamentable way.\n  This bill is ironically titled, ``On Freedom of Conscience and on \nReligious Associations.'' It first passed the lower house of the \nRussian Duma in late June.\n  The bill would, among other things, limit the activities of foreign \nmissionaries and grant unregistered religious groups significantly \nfewer rights than accredited Russian religious organizations such as \nthe Russian Orthodox Church, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.\n  Mr. President, this bill awaiting signature now on President \nYeltsin's desk would severely limit the very existence of what Russia \nterms ``new faiths.'' These ``new faiths'' include many Protestant \nfaiths--Evangelicals, fundamentalists, Pentecostals, SDA's, Jehovah's \nWitnesses, Mormons, and even the Catholic Church. These faiths will be \npersecuted as religious minorities under this proposed law.\n  Congress has already taken a number of steps to send signals to \nPresident\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\nYeltsin about this bill. Many Members of both Houses have signed \nletters to President Yeltsin and to President Clinton. From the Vatican \nto former President Jimmy Carter, the reaction to this law has been \nstrong and unwavering.\n  I rise today to send an even stronger signal. My amendment would \nwithhold funds appropriated in the foreign operations bill to Russia \nunless the President of the United States determines and verifies in \nwriting to the Congress that the Government of Russia has enacted no \nstatute that would discriminate against religious minorities in the \nRussian Federation.\n  Mr. President, I realize, as do all Senators, that Russia is a \nsovereign country. We cannot tell Russia what to do as a country. We \ncan, however, elect not to send foreign aid to a country that would \ndiscriminate against religious beliefs in so fundamental a way.\n  This will be the clearest and strongest message that can be sent to \nPresident Yeltsin. Should he decide to enact into law this \ndiscrimination, we then will send no American funds, none of our \ntaxpayers' hard-earned moneys, to that country in the fiscal year of \n1998.\n  In the modern world, for most religions, the kind of deprivation of \nstatus that the Russian bill would enact, should it become law, is a \nmajor encroachment upon religious freedom.\n  Many international agreements have already been signed that require \nsignatories to guarantee religious freedom. For example, sections of \nthe Vienna Concluding Document of the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe commits participating States in the Helsinki \nprocess to grant religious freedom as part of their Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the Russian Federation is a signatory to that Vienna \ndocument. Furthermore, the bill on President Yeltsin's desk would not \nonly violate this and other international agreements; it would also \nviolate Russia's own Constitution which guarantees religious freedoms \nwe as Americans have come to hold as so dear and so fundamental. I know \nsome might argue, Mr. President, that we should not take these kinds of \nactions; that we are trying to help Russia build democracy, and we are \nand want to do those things, but I would say to them that religious \nfreedom is the cornerstone of democracy. Indeed, a democratic \nfoundation without that cornerstone of religious freedom is a democracy \nthat is built upon sand.\n  I hope that all Senators will join me in sending a strong signal to \nPresident Yeltsin that American dollars will not find their way to \nsupport any country that treats religious freedom in such a manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just walked back in the Chamber. I am \nnot quite sure----\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that we will get a \nsufficient second for a vote on this amendment. I am told by the \nDemocratic Cloakroom that it would be permissible to have a couple of \nvotes around 12:30, and it is my plan to have a vote on the Smith \namendment at about 12:30.\n  I also understand under the previous agreement we are to vote on \nfinal passage on energy and water in juxtaposition to that vote.\n  Mr. President, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote on final passage will follow the \nfirst vote on this bill. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So, Mr. President, why don't I ask unanimous consent \nthat we have a vote on the Smith amendment at 12:30.\n  Mr. President, I withhold.\n  Mr. President, we may have the ability to get the yeas and nays now. \nI ask for the yeas and nays on the Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say again we are not going to \nset the time for the Smith amendment now until we have had further \nconsultation with the Democratic Cloakroom, but in all likelihood there \nwould be two votes at 12:30, one on the Smith amendment and the other \non final passage of energy and water.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 889 to Amendment No. 888\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the pending business now is the second-\ndegree amendment of the Senator from Oregon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself and Mr. \n     Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 889 to amendment No. \n     888.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. .

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for \nthe Smith amendment prohibiting foreign assistance to the Government of \nRussia, should it enact laws that would discriminate against religious \nminorities and religious faiths in the Russian federation. As you \neloquently pointed out, on July 4, and ironically on July 4, as we \ncelebrated our precious freedoms in the United States the Russian \nFederal Assembly gave final approval to a bill which would seriously \nundermine religious freedom in Russia.\n  I was in Poland just 1 week ago, representing the Senate at an \ninternational conference, the Sixth Annual Session of the Parliamentary \nAssembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. At \nthis conference, I had the opportunity to chair a bilateral meeting \nwith the Speaker of the Russian Duma and we discussed this bill at \nlength.\n  In that bilateral meeting were a number of deputies from the Russian \nDuma. I found that their concept of rights and freedoms were strikingly \nin contrast to our concept of freedoms, as embodied in our Constitution \nand in our American tradition. Repeatedly, as we discussed the proposed \nlaw that the Russian Duma at that point had already voted on--the upper \nbody had\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nnot yet at that point voted on it--it was clear that they viewed \nreligious freedom, and in fact all rights, as being that which could be \ngranted by the Government as opposed to our concept, embodied in our \nConstitution and our founding documents, that those rights and those \nfreedoms are unalienable and endowed by our Creator--given by God. \nTherefore, as viewing rights as being something given by the \nGovernment, they saw no problem in removing the unlimited, unfettered \nright to freedom of religion.\n  I was alarmed at the attitude and the intransigence that we found, \nnot only from the Speaker of the Duma but the deputies who were \npresent, and their concept. They said, and I paraphrase but very close \nto what was said in this bilateral meeting, that we must protect naive \nRussians from cults--cults being a broad definition to include all of \nthe so-called new faiths. Of course, Russia today is experiencing a \ntremendous renewal of religious faith. In, I think, a misguided effort \nto protect the Orthodox Russian Church, this law has been proposed. I \nsaid very frankly and very bluntly--and may I say Congressman Clement \nfrom Tennessee, Congressman Dingell from Michigan, and a number of \nother Members of the U.S. Congress were present during this bilateral \nmeeting and echoed my sentiments--that this law proposed, passed by the \nDuma, now pending before President Yeltsin, is antithetical to and \nirreconcilable with a true concept of liberty and religious freedom.\n  Among the provisions in this bill that are most alarming is the \nrequirement that religious groups list all of their numbers, their \nnames, their addresses, a requirement that a commission be \nestablished--a commission of state experts--to review the doctrines and \npractices of groups applying for registration. It is unimaginable in \nthis country, in which we have so enshrined the concept of religious \nfreedom. There is a requirement under this bill that a religious group \nbe in existence for 50 years in order to receive ``all Russian'' \nstatus, creating a division between religious associations and groups \nwhich could create a multitier religious hierarchy of different \ndenominations. And then in this bill is a requirement that would deny \nfor a 15-year period legal status to new religious groups, which could \ninclude those groups that refused to register under the Communist \nregime. Without legal status, these religious groups could not rent \npublic space for services, they would find it difficult to conduct any \nfinancial activity, invite foreigners to Russia, or set up a church \nschool for children.\n  There is no justifiable reason to divide religious organizations into \ntwo categories, one with full rights and privileges and the others with \nlimited rights, limited privileges. This new Russian law discriminates \nagainst religious faiths by establishing a hierarchy of religious \ngroups under the law and denying legal status to communities of \nbelievers.\n  When similar legislation threatened religious freedom in Russia only \n4 years ago, Members of the House, Members of this body, the Senate, \njoined together in an urgent appeal to Boris Yeltsin to veto that \nlegislation. Courageously, President Yeltsin stood firm. He refused to \nsign that bill into law.\n  Now we have an opportunity, thanks to the amendment of Senator Smith \nof Oregon, to send a strong message to Russia that we will take \nconcerted action to preserve this essential human right. This is \npotentially the greatest retreat on religious freedom and human rights \nsince the fall of the Soviet Union, and it is an ominous sign about the \nfuture of that Republic. We must forcefully signal our grave concern by \npassing the Smith amendment. I hope my colleagues in the U.S. Senate \nwill join with Senator Smith of Oregon in sending that signal to the \nGovernment of Russia, and add encouragement and solidarity with the \npeople of the Russian Republic.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to rise and join my colleagues in \nsupporting the Smith amendment to the fiscal year 1998 foreign \noperations bill that would cut assistance to the Government of the \nRussian Federation if it enacts the onerous bill passed by the Duma \nlast month entitled ``On Freedom of Conscience and Religious \nAssociation.''\n  Mr. President, this bill passed by the Duma is about restricting \nfreedom of conscience and prohibiting the freedom of conscience. It is \na major step backward for democracy and human rights in Russia. It \ntakes Russia away from the West and the institutions that protect an \nindividual's freedom of religion.\n  The bill passed by the Duma--promoted by an unholy alliance of \nCommunists and Populists whose responsibility to the country appears to \nfocus on restricting its citizens' ability to practice any faith they \nchoose.\n  The measures in the bill are deeply objectionable. A few points are \nworth mentioning:\n  Religious groups must register with the government by 1998. In a \nblatant act of discrimination, the bill assigns different religions to \ndifferent categories that will afford them different sets of rights.\n  For a religion to be deemed a religious organization, it will have to \ndemonstrate that they have officially existed in Russia for at least 15 \nyears. This means that the religion would have had to register under \nCommunist dictator Leonid Brezhnev, at a time when the Soviet Union was \nofficially atheistic and officially repressive to the pursuit of faith.\n  Religious groups not deemed in the official, first category of \n``religious organizations'' would have greatly restricted rights. They \nwould have no legal status. Members would have to be individually and \nofficially registered. They groups could not rent public space for \nservices, own property, conduct financial activity, invite foreigners \nto Russia, or set up church schools.\n  To register as a ``religious organization,'' a religious group would \nhave to (a) be sponsored by a Russian religious organization, (b) \nundergo a 15-year registration period, and (c) have ``authenticity'' \ndetermined by a commission of state experts, who would review a faith's \ndoctrine for admissibility. This state bureaucracy could deny \nregistration to faiths on a wide range of practices, such as advocating \nnonmedical forms of healing, monasticism, conscientious objection, and \nproselytizing to minors.\n  Mr. President, the Duma bill on restricting religious rights is \ncontrary to international conventions signed by Russia, including the \nHelsinki Treaty of 1989, which states:\n\n       [Participating states] will take effective measures to \n     prevent and eliminate discrimination against individuals of \n     communities on grounds of religion or belief in the \n     recognitions, exercise and enjoyment of human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil, political, \n     economic, social and cultural life; and\n       [participating states] will grant upon their request to \n     communities of believers, practicing or prepared to practice \n     their faith within the constitutional framework of the \n     States, recognition of the status provided for them in their \n     respective countries.\n\n  But if the Russian Government wishes to ignore its treaty \nobligations--which, from our record of arms control agreements, we must \nrecognize is not a unique development--it is still shocking that the \nDuma egregiously ignores the Russian Constitution, which states:\n\n       The state guarantees the equality of rights and freedoms \n     regardless of sex, race, nationality, language, origin, \n     property and official position, place of residence, attitude \n     to religion, convictions, membership in public associations, \n     as well as other circumstances. Banned are all forms of \n     limitations of human rights on social, racial, national, \n     language or religious grounds. (Art. 19)\n\n  It is indeed of great concern to me, Mr. President, that the Duma \nsees fit to legislate restrictions on individual rights at a time when \nRussian society is greatly suffering. Michael Specter of the New York \nTimes recently wrote about the alarming downward spiral in the health \nof the Russian population. In that article, Specter notes that per \ncapita alcohol consumption is the highest in the world; that Russia has \na wider gap in life expectancy between men and women than in any other \ncountry; that of the nations of Asia, America, and Europe, Russia's \nmortality rate is ahead of only Afghanistan and Cambodia; and that the \ndeath rate among working Russians today is higher than a century ago. \nAnd the indicators are getting worse: the mortality rate for Russian \nmen between 40 and 49 years of age increased by over 50 percent between \n1990 and 1995. The reporter concluded: ``An astonishing drop in life \nexpectancy for Russian men over the past decade, combined with one of \nthe lowest birthrates on earth, has turned Russia into a demographic \nfreak show.''\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\n  Mr. President, we can expect yelping from the supporters of this bill \nin the Duma. Delighted to frustrate President Yeltsin's every move, \nthey will claim that international opprobrium against this bill is \ninfringing on Russia's sovereignty. This is not a question of Russia's \nsovereignty, Mr. President. The calls and letters President Yeltsin has \nreceived from political and religious leaders around the world declare \nour concerns about the freedom of individual conscience in Russia, \nconcerns their elected body should share, not patronize.\n  U.S. assistance is not an entitlement. It is a demonstration of our \nsupport for the emergence of democracy in a land cursed by communism \nfor most of this decade. If Russia turns back to the night of \nauthoritarianism, we should not squander our resources, Mr. President.\n  In the past 2 weeks, we have seen the announcement of the historic \nenlargement of NATO. The Russian Government opposed this, somewhat \ndisingenuously, I believe, because its concerns where not reflecting \nthe concerns of the Russian people, who are much more concerned with \npoverty, disease, and rampant crime and their Duma's incessant \npolitical posturing, than they are of an alliance that has no historic \nrecord of aggression.\n  Among those in the West, there were several groups of thinkers who \nsupported this move. Perhaps they could be referred to as idealists and \nrealists. The idealists hold a sense of optimism that believes that the \nenlargement of NATO is an expansion of democratic societies, which, \nhistory has shown, have a lesser tendency to go to war with each other. \nCertainly the history of NATO is clearly that of a defensive collective \norganization committed solely to its own defense.\n  The realists focused on an unpredictable future and a geopolitical \nvacuum. This temporal and spatial approach, traditional geopolitics, \nwarns that we do not know the ultimate evolution of the Russian state. \nIt argues that there is little historical experience of democracy in \nRussia.\n  The idealists focus on the internal aspects of NATO and the expansion \nof democracies. To idealists, the solution to Russia's concerns about \nNATO would occur when Russia is seen to have fully demonstrated its \nevolution to rule by democratic institutions. Because would NATO need \nto defend against such a Russia?\n  I would like to think of myself as an idealist, Mr. President. And I \nsupport the enlargement of NATO because I welcome Hungary, the Czech \nRepublic, and Poland to the family of democratic nations. Their \nmembership in NATO will work to preserve their democratic \naccomplishments.\n  But the developments in Russia--in particular this bill against \nreligious freedom by the Duma--cloud my optimism. If Russia turns away \nfrom democracy in favor of an ill-considered exercise in demagogic \npolitics, the realists, who fear a future authoritarian Russia and seek \nto prepare for it, will have their views confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I have long supported Boris Yeltsin. In fact, when he \nfirst came to the United States in the late 1980's, I was among the few \nwho said, to the Republican administration at the time: ``You're \nfocusing on the wrong guy, Gorbachev. This is the man to watch, and \nthis is the man to back.'' Since then, I have strongly approved every \ntime President Yeltsin stood bravely for democracy in Russia. When he \nstood on that tank in defense of Russia's nascent democracy, my prayers \nwere with him.\n  I expect that President Yeltsin will veto this bill. That will make \nthis legislation that we will pass today merely a demonstration that \nthis body will stand for religious freedom in Russia. I will stand and \napplaud him when he vetoes this bill.\n  But if this bill becomes law in Russia, Mr. President. Our support \nfor democracy in Russia has been dealt perhaps a fatal blow. We should \nnot waste our funds promoting democratic development on a government \nthat turns away from democracy. And if President Yeltsin signs the the \nbill against religious rights, Mr. President, I will pray for Russia.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I cannot \nsupport Senator Smith's amendment to the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, S. 955, which we are debating here today.\n  I believe that Senator Smith and others in this Chamber who vote in \nfavor of this amendment have good intentions, but this amendment is not \nstructured in a manner that I can support. This amendment would \nprohibit the United States from issuing foreign aid to the Government \nof Russia should it enact laws which would discriminate against \nminority religious faiths in the Russian federation. On the surface, \nthis is a very well intentioned effort.\n  I understand and completely support the fundamental importance and \nright of religious freedom, a constitutionally protected right in our \nNation, as I also appreciate the importance of other freedoms that we \nhold dear in the United States such as the freedom of speech and \nfreedom to assemble.\n  However, Russia and many other nations have not organized their \nnations to provide the same degree of freedoms that our Nation \nprovides. This is not an excuse for other countries; it is just simple \nfact. To tie our Nation's foreign aid decisions too closely to \nlegislative outcomes in other countries--even absolutely egregious ones \nlike the Russian law which recently passed the Duma restricting \nrecognized faiths to those recognized by the former Soviet Union before \n1984, including Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism--\ncan have serious unintended consequences and disrupt national security \nobjectives of our Nation. Through legislative actions such as this one \nwhich we are considering today, we can actually trigger the enactment \nof outrageous laws in other nations which could seriously damage the \nexisting freedoms that citizens in other nations have.\n  We should realize that many other nations--including Israel, Egypt, \nTurkey, and other recipients of United States aid--would lose that aid \nif held to the same standard that we are proposing for Russia. Perhaps \nthis is something that we should discuss here. But my sense is that we \ndon't want a single measuring stick--and that today, we are focusing on \nRussia in a rather knee-jerk fashion. Russia needs to hear our concerns \nabout religious freedoms, and I feel that we should pursue this matter \nand communicate United States objections to this Russian law in the \nmany different arenas available to us in our engagement with Russia. \nHowever, this vehicle--as it is constructed--is not appropriate and \ncould send matters in a negative rather than positive direction.\n  I think that the most important item left out of the drafting of this \namendment is a national security waiver, which would permit the \nPresident to waive the provisions of this bill in cases where American \nnational security were at stake. If this provision had been included, I \nmay have viewed this amendment more positively.\n  Again, I believe firmly in the innate human right to worship as each \nindividual sees fit. However, in my opinion, not only is this \nparticular foreign aid provision an inappropriate vehicle to send that \nmessage abroad but it also ties the hands of the President in the \nexecution of foreign policy and fails to allow for waivers which may \nvery well be in the national security interests of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished occupant of \nthe Chair, the Senator from Oregon, for an excellent amendment. I was \nin the Senate when we started the Russian aid program. I would say to \nSenator Smith and Senator Hutchinson, who spoke so eloquently in behalf \nof this amendment, the whole Russian aid program was predicated on the \nnotion that we were going to have a Russia based on the principles of \ndemocracy, free speech and freedom of religion--the fundamental \nunderpinnings of our Western society, led by the United States many \nyears ago when we were largely alone in establishing these principles; \nthat the new Russia, at least in those very basic respects, was going \nto be not dissimilar to the United States on these fundamental \nfreedoms. And, as an enthusiastic supporter of Russian assistance, both \nin the beginning and since, I can tell you that is not assistance \nwithout stipulation. It is not assistance no matter how you act.\n  As I said in my opening statement, this foreign aid bill this year, \nif it\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nstands for anything, it stands for the notion that foreign assistance \nis not an entitlement. It is not something you get automatically this \nyear because you got it last year. Foreign assistance is designed to \npromote American interests abroad. Foreign assistance is the only way \nthat the Government directly impacts overseas, other than sending in \nthe troops, which is expensive and dangerous. But, with the less than 1 \npercent of our budget that we devote to this activity, we must use it \nin a way that promotes American values as well as American interests.\n  So, the distinguished Senator from Oregon and Senator Hutchinson, who \nhas spoken in his behalf in support of this amendment, have it exactly \nright. You have it exactly right. This is the sort of action that ought \nto jeopardize the Russian aid program. We ought not to be giving \nassistance to a country that, as a result of direct government \ninitiative in what purports to be a democracy, is seeking to grant \nreligious favoritism to certain kinds of religions at the expense of \nthe others.\n  So, I commend the Senator from Oregon, Senator Smith, for this \noutstanding amendment. I intend to support it. Again, I might say, we \nare hopeful that a vote on this amendment will occur around 12:30. That \nis not something I can announce yet, but we are hopeful it will occur \naround 12:30.\n  I would say to my colleague from Oregon, does he wish additional time \nto discuss the amendment?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is the status of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are several amendments pending to S. \n955.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 893\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the eligibility \n         for NATO membership of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     893.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND \n                   LITHUANIA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania--\n       (1) are to be commended for their progress toward political \n     and economic reform and meeting the guidelines for \n     prospective NATO members;\n       (2) would make an outstanding contribution to furthering \n     the goals of NATO and enhancing stability, freedom, and peace \n     in Europe should they become NATO members; and\n       (3) upon complete satisfaction of all relevant criteria \n     should be invited to become full NATO members at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last week the United States joined with \nour European allies to invite three nations to join the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization [NATO]. Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic are \ndeserving of this invitation. I congratulate them on their achievements \nand look forward to a strong and lasting relationship with the people \nof these nations.\n  Today I offer an amendment with my colleague, Senator Durbin, and the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator McConnell, to \nensure that NATO expansion does not stop here. The Madrid summit was \nonly the first step in our efforts to see to it that the nations of \nEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are brought firmly into \ndemocracy's camp. Further expansion of NATO is essential if democratic \nand economic reforms are to continue and if communism is to be \neliminated entirely from the European Continent.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Estonia, Latvia, \nand Lithuania should be invited to join NATO at the earliest possible \ndate. These three tiny nations, perched between the Baltic Sea and the \nnorthwestern border of Russia, have made remarkable strides since they \ngained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania have all made significant progress toward the NATO \nrequirements of irreversible democracy, free market economies, and \ncivilian-controlled militaries. They have even participated in NATO's \nPartnership for Peace initiative by supplying troops to NATO \npeacekeeping efforts. The Baltic nations have requested and deserve \nconsideration for full NATO membership.\n  From a history wrought with foreign interventions that tore them from \ntheir rightful place in the European mainstream and subjected them to \nthe heavy hand of communism, the Baltics have emerged from the economic \nand political darkness to embrace democracy and the free market with \nunsurpassed vigor. If these nations are ever to continue on the road to \ndemocracy and economic reform, they must feel secure from the \npossibility of future foreign domination. The United States and NATO \nhave an important role to play in providing that necessary security.\n  Having traveled to Estonia twice in the past 5 years, I have a very \npersonal interest in its entry into NATO. The people of Estonia, much \nlike their Baltic neighbors, have been under foreign rule throughout \nhistory. They were ruled by Germans in the 13th century, Swedes in the \n16th and 17th centuries, Tsarist Russia in the 19th century, and the \nSoviet Union after World War II. With the end of Soviet domination, \nEstonians and their neighbors in Latvia and Lithuania are looking to \nthe West for confirmation of their right to independence.\n  Unfortunately, the subject of NATO expansion to Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania has become highly controversial. Many in the United States \nnational security community believe the Baltics, lying so close to \nRussia and within the area Yeltsin considers to be Russia's sphere of \ninfluence, should not be considered for NATO membership. Out of fear of \nisolating Russia, the United States and our European allies may forsake \nthe three tiny nations that did so much to promote the collapse of the \nSoviet Union and the eradication of communism throughout Eastern \nEurope. Now is the time for the United States take decisive action to \nrectify the past and protect the Baltics from any future foreign \nirredentism.\n  Future NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is \nessential to their safety and prosperity. Security concerns will take \nprecedence over continued democratic and economic reforms if the \nBaltics continue to exist, unprotected, in the shadow of an \nincreasingly nationalistic Russia.\n  We must be vigilant, Mr. President, in our efforts to extend NATO's \nreach to all democratic nations in Europe who cannot protect \nthemselves. If we leave these nations exposed to the risk of foreign \ninvasion and influence, the gains we made in expanding democracy and \nfreedom across the globe will be vulnerable to erosion.\n  The United States must continue to set an example for the world as a \npromoter and protector of democratic freedom. As victors in the cold \nwar, we have never had a greater opportunity than this to show \ndemocracy's enemies that we have the courage and the will to stand firm \nagainst them. We should embrace this historic opportunity and bring \nevery nation deserving of NATO membership into democracy's fold, even \nthose nations closest to the heart of Russia.\n  The people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been out in the \ncold long enough. They should be commended for the great strides they \nhave made already toward the requirements for NATO membership and would \nmake an outstanding contribution to stability, freedom, and peace in \nEurope as NATO members. It is time the West welcome them into NATO with \nopen arms.\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\n  I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Durbin for cosponsoring this \nimportant amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on \ninclusion of the Baltics in NATO.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, this amendment was proposed by myself \nand by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Durbin], as an \nadd-on a week or so ago to the defense authorization bill and was \naccepted by the Senate unanimously at that point.\n  The Senator from Illinois and I, and I believe, with the happy assent \nof the manager of the bill, Senator McConnell, are presenting it, once \nagain, in the glorious aftermath of last week's meeting of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization in Madrid.\n  At that meeting, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary were \nadmitted to NATO. Several other nations who are applicants to NATO were \nnot admitted but were put at least on the road toward meeting the \nqualifications for entrance into the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization. Slovenia and Romania were put more or less at the front \nof that parade. But in Madrid, there were also represented the three \nsmall Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, small nations \nthat have been independent for only a relatively short period during \ntheir long history.\n  Unlike the other applicants for the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, these three nations were, in fact, occupied by and \nincorporated into the Soviet Union from 1940, with a pause for German \noccupation, until just a very few years ago when they, once again, \nobtained their independence. None of those countries has any goal \ngreater than being recognized as a part of the West, as being free \ncountries, both politically and economically. No set of nations has \nbeen more oppressed by their neighbors than these three nations. None, \nI think, has a greater dedication to freedom, to liberty, to democracy, \nand to free markets.\n  This amendment simply states that we hope that these countries will \nbe carefully considered for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at \nsuch time as they have met all of its qualifications. The North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization, of course, was formed originally simply \nfor the defense of the West, a task which was overwhelmingly \nsuccessful. But as we note the response in the three countries about to \nbe admitted, we find that the goals are psychic every bit as much as \nthey relate to any kind of military defense. It ratifies the choices \nthat these three new applicants made to be democracies, to be a part of \nthe West, to care to attempt to catch up, to join what we consider to \nbe the free and democratic world.\n  Exactly those same feelings are found in the other applicant \ncountries, exactly those feelings are found in the Baltics.\n  This amendment is a modest way to encourage those three small nations \nto continue to move in the right direction by stating to them that when \nthey are fully qualified, they will become members of NATO. On behalf \nof my cosponsors and myself, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, for this amendment. As the Senator knows \nfrom previous discussions, I share his view that if we were \nestablishing the parade, the next countries at the front of the parade \nclearly ought to be the Baltic countries. As a matter of fact, as my \nfriend from Washington knows, we included in the bill $20 million in \ngrants and loans to the three Baltic countries, just as we provided \nfinancial assistance last year to Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic in order to help them upgrade their militaries in order to \nseek to achieve a level of acceptance for admission to NATO.\n  So I think the amendment of the Senator from Washington, of which I \nam a cosponsor, is an excellent addition to this debate, and I \ncompletely share his views. The countries are most worthy for admission \nto NATO. We have recognized their independence throughout the cold war. \nThey are doing an awful lot of things correctly. These countries are \nmaking enormous progress, and some have argued that they have done \nevery bit as well as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, if not \neven better.\n  So I commend my friend from Washington for his amendment. I think it \nis an excellent amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his kind remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, does the Senator from Washington hope \nto get a recorded vote on this?\n  Mr. GORTON. No, a voice vote will be sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further discussion or debate on \nthe amendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment proposed by \nthe Senator from Washington.\n  The amendment (No. 893) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to permit \nLesley Carson, a fellow working with the minority side of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, to have floor privileges during the pendency \nof this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 885\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the managers' amendments we will \nbe voting on--actually approving on a voice vote at some point during \nthe debate--relates to our friends in Egypt. I want to make a few \nobservations about the current relationship between the United States \nand Egypt.\n  Since the Camp David accords were signed in 1979, United States \nforeign assistance to Egypt has topped $42 billion. While some progress \nhas been made in the last 16 years, I think it is important to point \nout the obvious, which is Egypt's role has changed and changed \nsignificantly.\n  Let me review the record so there is a better sense of why the bill \nreported from the committee did not include the longstanding earmark \nfor Egypt.\n  First and foremost, Senator Leahy and I tried this year to get our \naid program off autopilot. Our domestic agencies and programs have been \nput through the budget ringer to determine where we could reduce \nspending. Foreign aid obviously should not be exempted from this \ncritical appraisal. As we conducted this review, we established very \nsimple tests for evaluating performance. Does the program serve U.S. \ninterests in stability, democracy, and market economies? Are U.S. \nresources well invested and well spent?\n  The basic principle which has guided the provision of support in the \nMiddle East has been a shared commitment to the Camp David accords and \nthe promotion of peace. Unfortunately, Egypt's record over the last 2 \nyears indicates a shift away from that commitment.\n  Let me begin by referring to a letter sent by 25 Senators to \nPresident Mubarak last July following an Arab summit convened in Cairo.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and the communique issued at \nthe summit be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just quote from the letter. The \nSenators said in that letter:\n\n       We are concerned that the communique issued at the end of \n     the summit compromises prospects to advance negotiations with \n     the new, democratically elected government of Israel. We \n     believe that limiting or conditioning options for peace \n     discussions with the newly elected government of Israel \n     before its policies have been officially formulated damages \n     prospects for peace. Threats from countries of the Arab \n     League to ``reconsider steps taken in the context of the \n     peace process, in relation to Israel'' do little to enhance \n     successful negotiations. . .\n\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\n\n  The letter went on:.\n\n       We are especially troubled that a leader of your stature \n     created a forum, including Libya and Sudan, which question \n     Israel's right to exist.\n\n  Inviting Libya and Sudan to Cairo to condemn Israel is not the kind \nof initiative which serves peace or, for that matter, should be \nrewarded with another $3 billion.\n  The July Cairo summit was followed in late September 1996 by an \nescalation in tension between Israelis and Palestinians over the so-\ncalled tunnel crisis. When violence erupted in the streets, President \nClinton called upon Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman Arafat, King \nHussein, and President Mubarak to come to Washington to negotiate a \nsolution. Every leader came except Mubarak. Every leader had as much to \ngain and certainly a great deal to lose if the discussions failed. \nEvery leader knew there were costs associated with a high-profile \nsummit which might not relieve tensions.\n  Only President Mubarak decided it was not worth his time or effort to \ncontinue a crucial dialogue with the simple objective of salvaging the \npeace process. After refusing to participate in this summit, President \nMubarak decided to convene another Arab round-table. In March of this \nyear, he called together the Arab League in Cairo where the foreign \nministers passed a resolution which is worth taking a look at. The text \nread:\n\n       The Council recommends as follows: (1) stopping all \n     normalization steps which have been taken with Israel in the \n     framework of the current peace process, and halting all \n     dealings with it, including closing offices and missions. . \n     .and (2) Suspending Arab participation in the multilateral \n     talks and continuing to maintain the primary Arab boycott and \n     reactivating it against Israel.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a resolution of peace. We should see this \njust for what it was as described by the Arab League's Secretary \nGeneral, ``binding'' and an open declaration of hostility.\n  This summit was followed by a crisis in negotiations over the \nredeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron. There is no question that the \nEgyptian leadership consistently and actively worked against a \nresolution of each contentious issue. From hot pursuit to the use of \nthe Shuhada Road, the message from Cairo was provocative and \ncounterproductive.\n  Finally, and of most alarm, is Egypt's relationship with Libya. I \nmentioned the invitation to the Cairo summit. That is just the tip of \nthe iceberg. President Mubarak ended a recent visit to Tripoli \nannouncing the goal of establishing $1 billion in annual trade and a \nfree trade zone, a goal made all the more interesting when contrasted \nwith the current level of $82 million in annual trade with Israel. $1 \nbillion in trade with Libya, $82 million in trade with Israel.\n  Let us remember that Libya is the target of tough U.N. sanctions \nwhich imposed an air, arms, and diplomatic embargo in 1992 when Qadhafi \nfailed to extradite two terrorists linked to the Pan Am bombing which \nkilled 270 people. The sanctions were extended when Libya failed to \ncooperate in the investigation into the bombing of a French airliner \nwhich killed 171 passengers.\n  Sanctions against Libya are not the peculiar position of the United \nStates; they are a matter of international consensus--international \nconsensus--that is, with the exception of Egypt.\n  In May, President Mubarak denounced the embargo because, in his \nwords, it has ``gone on for too long.'' He also challenged \ninternational charges that Libya has a chemical weapons capability. Not \nso, says Mubarak.\n  As recently as January, when I joined Senator Stevens and a number of \nother Members on a trip to the Middle East, we heard the Defense \nMinister describe Libya as a country undergoing economic reforms and \npolitical liberalization and a key security ally. This was the Egyptian \nDefense Minister discussing Libya.\n  This Egypt-Libya relationship is probably why families of Pan Am 103 \nvictims have called my office to express their support for removing \nEgypt's $3 billion earmark.\n  Mr. President, I have chronicled the collapse of Egypt's role in the \npeace process not to incite but to invite change. We have had a \nsuccessful partnership with Egypt which has certainly endured \ndifficulties and setbacks, but they have been on the whole temporary \nand intermittent.\n  For 18 months we have seen a significant shift in the wrong direction \nin Egyptian policies. We have moved from a road of periodic bumps into \na long, deep policy ditch, which we must find our way out of.\n  Eliminating the earmark was intended to send the signal that our \nsupport will not continue no matter what choices Egypt makes. We will \nnot sustain an ally, and advocate of Libya. It makes no sense to offer \nassistance to opponents of the peace process.\n  I am convinced the message has been heard. Coincidental with the \nSenate action, we have seen senior Egyptian officials resume \nconstructive and active efforts to advance the peace process. I am \nsatisfied, as I am sure the Israeli leadership is, that Cairo has \nresumed the crucial role we know it has, and can play to stabilize the \nregion and secure a durable peace.\n  Because I believe good faith is being restored, and the goals of the \nCamp David agreement are once again being served, I will be supporting \nan amendment, which in fact I have already offered, which will earmark \nthe requested level of funds for Egypt.\n  But let me just repeat, Mr. President, our assistance to the \ncountries abroad is not an entitlement. This is not something you get \nevery year based upon having gotten it last year. American assistance \nis geared to behavior. It is my hope that the Egyptians are back on \ntrack and willing to resume being a constructive partner in the Middle \nEast peace process. Clearly, Mr. President, that is the key to \ncontinued U.S. assistance to Egypt.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.\n     His Excellency, Mohammad Hosni Mubarak,\n     President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n       Dear President Mubarak: We are writing to express our deep \n     dismay about the communique issued at the Cairo summit.\n       It had been our hope that heads of state and \n     representatives of Arab countries attending the June 21, 1996 \n     Cairo summit would refrain from statements directed against \n     the new Israeli government that might create an atmosphere in \n     the region unfavorable to a continuation of the peace \n     process.\n       We are concerned that the communique issued at the end of \n     the summit compromises prospects to advance negotiations with \n     the new, democratically elected government of Israel. We \n     believe that limiting or conditioning options for peace \n     discussions with the newly elected government of Israel \n     before its policies have ever been officially formulated \n     damages the prospects for peace. Threats from countries of \n     the Arab League to ``reconsider steps taken in the context of \n     the peace process, in relation to Israel'' do little to \n     enhance successful negotiations, and instead may undermine \n     efforts to reach a comprehensive peace in the region.\n       We are especially troubled that a leader of your stature \n     created a forum for Arab League countries, including Libya \n     and the Sudan, which question Israel's right to exist. In \n     light of the past leadership role the Egyptian government has \n     played, we had hoped that Egypt would reach out to the new, \n     democratically elected government in a way that would advance \n     the peace process.\n       Peace in the Middle East Peace can only be expanded if the \n     Arab countries remain engaged with Israel in the pursuit. We \n     urge the government of Egypt and other members of the Arab \n     League to work toward that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mitch McConnell, Barbara A.

The Arab leaders also \n     demanded complete Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan to \n     the line of June 4, 1967, and complete and unconditional \n     Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon and the western Bekaa \n     to the internationally recognized borders, in implementation \n     of Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and the \n     principle of land for peace. On this basis they call for the \n     resumption of negotiations on all the tracks.\n       ``The commitment of the Arab states to pursue the peace \n     process to achieve just and comprehensive peace is a goal and \n     strategic choice to the achieved under the umbrella of \n     international legitimacy and it requires a reciprocal \n     commitment, confirmed by Israel seriously and without \n     ambiguity, and action to complete the course of peace, \n     restoring rights and occupied land and guaranteeing balanced \n     and equal security for all the states in the region, in \n     accordance with the principles agreed at the Madrid \n     conference, especially the principle of land for peace and \n     the assurances submitted to the parties. The Arab leaders \n     assert that any violation on Israel's part of these \n     principles and the fundamentals on which the peace process \n     started, or backtracking on commitments, undertakings and \n     agreements which have been reached in the framework of this \n     process, or procrastination in implementing them would lead \n     to a setback in the peace process, with all the dangers and \n     repercussions that this implies, taking the region back to \n     the cycle of tension, which would force all the Arab states \n     to reconsider the steps that have been taken towards Israel \n     in the framework of the peace process, full responsibility \n     for which Israel alone would bear.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In order to make the peace process succeed on the Syrian, \n     Lebanese and Palestinian tracks, the Arab leaders call on the \n     sponsors of the peace process, the European Union, Japan, the \n     non-aligned states, other interested states, the United \n     Nations and international organisations and institutions to \n     work to ensure that Israel does not violate the fundamentals \n     of the peace process, fulfills the undertakings to which it \n     has given a commitment, whether related to the agreements on \n     the transitional stage or to the final status negotiations * \n     * * and to continue to provide the necessary political and \n     economic support to the Palestinian people and their National \n     Authority. In this context the Arab leaders said the Israeli \n     blockade imposed on the Palestinian people must be ended.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Arab leaders affirm their support for Lebanon as it \n     faces constant Israeli attacks on its territory, peace and \n     sovereignty and asked the international community to ensure \n     an immediate and unconditional cessation of these attacks.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Arab leaders affirm that Israel must join the Nuclear \n     non-proliferation Treaty and submit all its nuclear \n     installations to the system of international inspection.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Arab leaders express their solidarity with the sisterly \n     state of Bahrain and their complete support for the measures \n     it has taken to strengthen security and stability. They \n     expressed their strong condemnation of interference in the \n     internal affairs of the state of Bahrain, affirmed that they \n     stand with it against any threatening attempts from any party \n     whatsoever and call on Iran to respect the sovereignty of \n     the state of Bahrain, in the framework of mutual respect \n     and good neighbourly relations, by preventing any acts of \n     sabotage which target the state of Bahrain, in the \n     interests of security and stability in the region.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Arab leaders expressed their hope that the traditional \n     Arab-Turkish relations and joint interests will continue, and \n     in this context they expressed their concern at the Turkish-\n     Israeli military agreement and call on Turkey to reconsider \n     this agreement to avoid anything that would affect the \n     security of Arab states.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Arab leaders reaffirm their commitment to the need to \n     preserve the unity of Iraq and their opposition to any \n     policies or measures which affect its territorial integrity \n     and threaten its borders and national unity. They demand that \n     the Iraqi government commit itself not to adopt any \n     aggressive policies designed to provoke its Arab neighbors \n     and to finish implementing all the relevant Security Council \n     resolutions * * *\n       All this is the right way to bring an end to the sanctions \n     imposed on Iraq and create the right atmosphere for it to \n     regain its role in the Arab regional system.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Arab leaders believe that the Arab League's proposal to \n     hold an impartial and just trial of the two (Lockberbie) \n     suspects by Scottish judges under Scottish law in The Hague, \n     with the necessary guarantees for them * * * represents an \n     appropriate practical solution leading to an end to the \n     crisis. They call on the three Western states to take a \n     positive attitude towards this proposal * * *\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       At the same time as the Arab leaders condemn attempts to \n     pin the charge of terrorism on legitimate national \n     resistance, they condemn all forms of acts of terrorism, \n     sabotage and anarchy of which a number of states are victim.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It was agreed that:\n       His Excellency President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak, President \n     of the Arab Republic of Egypt, as chairman of the present \n     summit, will carry out the necessary contacts and \n     consultations with the Arab leaders and the Secretary General \n     of the League of Arab States to follow up and agree on \n     holding the next summit.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAbraham be added as a cosponsor to the Egypt amendment which I was just \ndiscussing, which is No. 885.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me begin today by thanking the \nmanagers of this bill, Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Leahy, for \ntheir leadership in bringing this bill to the floor so quickly. They \nhave had a very tough job managing the foreign assistance programs that \nare undertaken by our country. In this bill what they have produced \nmerits the support of every Member of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, at the committee meeting, several Members, including \nmyself and Senator Byrd, were not comfortable with the deletion of the \nearmark for assistance to Egypt. We certainly do understand Senator \nMcConnell's position. We were together in Cairo at the meetings that he \nmentioned. But after consulting with the subcommittee chairman, Mr. \nMcConnell, we decided the best way to proceed was to come to the floor \nand have a discussion.\n  I want to now call up the amendment No. 885 that is before the \nSenate, at the desk, as I understand it. I ask unanimous consent it be \nin order to consider that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to call up amendment \nNo. 885 for consideration. That is now the pending question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to thank those who have cosponsored this \namendment, in particular Senator McConnell. It is a managers' amendment \nand will restore the balance in the allocation of funds for our \npartners in the Middle East process.\n  Egypt has had problems. We all know that. And yet it stands out as \none of our Nation's most important global allies. It really is the \nbedrock of our engagement with the Arab world. Simply put, Mr. \nPresident, there would have been no Middle East peace process without \ncommitment of Egypt and the personal leadership that was displayed by \nPresident Sadat, and then by President Mubarak.\n  I say this not just as an advocate of the peace process but as a \nSenator who has traveled many times to the Middle East. I have \nwitnessed Egypt's evolving role. During the gulf war, Senator Inouye \nand I made two trips to that region, one at the request of the \nPresident of the United States, to assess what was happening with \nregard to our military plans, and to meet with our key allies. We \nfound, then, in President Mubarak, a friend and a leader who aligned \nhis great nation with the alliance, and when he did, he brought the \nrest of the Arab world along. In the years since the gulf war, Egypt \nhas remained at the center of our Nation's efforts to maintain calm in \nthe gulf area and to advance the peace process.\n  As Senator McConnell said, earlier this year, we had a delegation \nthat went to Israel, Jordan, Gaza, Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Mr. \nPresident, at each stop I became more aware of and convinced of trying \nto do everything we can to assure the continuation of our 20-year \npartnership with Egypt in the peace process.\n  Now, the things that Senator McConnell mentioned did happen. But late \nthis spring President Mubarak came to Washington and met with our \nPresident and congressional leaders. In those talks he again showed his \npersonal enthusiasm and dedication to the peace process. It was very \nevident, as was his determination to keep Egypt engaged in that \nprocess.\n  Based upon the continuum of the track record of Egypt's support for \nthe peace process, and my personal experience working with Egypt on so \nmany vital national security interests, and we do have others, Mr. \nPresident, beyond the peace process itself, I believe\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\nit is imperative that we show the equity in the identification of funds \nfor foreign assistance once again this year. Maintaining a strong and \neconomically developing Egypt is an essential piece of this Nation's \ntotal Middle East strategy.\n  I believe President Clinton summarized the current state of relations \nof Egypt very well during President Mubarak's visit early this year. \nPresident Clinton said:\n\n       Since the Camp David Accords in 1979, Egypt has been a \n     powerful force for peace in the Middle East. That has \n     continued to be true through the last 3\\1/2\\ years--a time of \n     extraordinary progress towards peace and repeated challenges. \n     Now, as Israel and the Palestinians embark on the difficult \n     task of permanent status negotiations, as we look to revive \n     negotiations between Israel and Syria, and then bring Lebanon \n     into the process to complete the circle of peace, we know \n     that Egypt's leadership will be vital to finish the job.\n\n  That is President Clinton's statement earlier this year about Egypt.\n  After 20 years of commitment and investment in this effort, this is \njust not the time to put at risk all that we have achieved. I welcome \nthe support of the other cosponsors of this amendment and I am sure \nthere are other Members who share our concern that our ties to Egypt \nremain strong and we continue to foster and support this alliance.\n  This is not to say that Egypt should not listen to the words that \nSenator McConnell has delivered here this morning and to the statements \nhe made in the committee. I believe we are all grateful to Senator \nMcConnell for his willingness to work with us in this matter. If there \nis to be any change in our status with regard to Egypt in this process, \nI believe it must be done on a bipartisan basis with the President \ninvolved. At this time I am hopeful that will never have to happen but, \nas a matter of fact, the modification of this bill before the Senate, I \nthink, that shows our willingness to go back to the process that has \nbeen followed in the past, I hope, will make a significant contribution \nto the Middle East peace process and will help us advance the interests \nof the United States there and in other regions with Egypt's support \nand collaboration.\n  I do, however, believe there are reasons for us to make sure everyone \nunderstands, as Senator McConnell said, that the provisions of support \nfrom this bill are not an entitlement. These are funds that are dealt \nwith on an annual basis by our Government, the Senate and the House, \nthe full Congress, as part of that process. It is my judgment that it \nhas been a bipartisan process that has included both the executive and \ncongressional leaders and leadership in the past and I think it should \ncontinue that way again this year.\n  I do hope that our friends in Egypt--and I don't have to hope, Mr. \nPresident, I know they have heard Senator McConnell's statement, and I \nknow they are aware that there have been questions raised, but based \nupon this continuum that has taken place, the friendship and \ncooperation and the important contributions that Egypt has made to the \nattainment of our goals in the Middle East, I have offered this \namendment with my friends. It is a managers' amendment. I do ask that \nthe Senate consider this amendment now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 885) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me again thank Senator McConnell and \nSenator Leahy and their very capable staff for all the work they have \ndone, and to once again urge the Senate cooperate with these managers \nof this bill the way it has with those who managed the defense bill and \nenergy and water bill.\n  We are working and striving hard to get the bills to conference \nbefore we go to August recess. I would like all of them to go to \nconference, if possible, before August.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I just say to my friend and colleague before he \nleaves, we are optimistic we can finish this bill today. We are \nspeeding in that direction.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am here to assist.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 889\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the amendment \nof Senator Smith of Oregon, which would try to protect religious \nliberty in Russia. I want to compliment my colleague from Oregon for \nthis amendment. In my opinion, it is probably one of the most important \namendments we will debate, certainly on this bill--maybe this Congress.\n  Unfortunately, and I guess most of my colleagues are aware of this \nfact, the Russian Duma overwhelmingly voted to place restrictions on \nreligious freedom in Russia, freedoms that were both won after the \ncollapse of communism and guaranteed by the 1993 Russian Constitution. \nThe overwhelming vote by the Duma is a tremendous step backward for \nRussia and for its people.\n  The legislation approved by the Duma would place severe restrictions \non religions not recognized by the government in 1982, a time when the \nSoviet Government was in power, a time characterized by religious \npersecution and official atheism. In 1982, as I understand it, the only \nfour religions recognized by the Russian Government were the Russian \nOrthodox church, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism.\n  As I understand this legislation, it would deny religions that \nentered Russia after 1982 the right to rent or own property, the right \nto employ religious workers, the right to produce religious literature, \nmaintain a bank account, or conduct charitable and educational \nactivities. According to an article that appeared in the June 24 \nedition of the Washington Post, it would sharply restrict the \nactivities of foreign missionaries in Russia.\n  I hope my colleagues are aware of this. I was not aware of it until \nmy colleague from Oregon mentioned it to me. I cannot believe that the \nDuma would pass something by such an overwhelming vote that would deny \nreligious opportunities to the Russian people. Maybe one of the most \nimportant of all liberties is the right to worship as one would choose. \nIt is guaranteed by the 1993 Russian Constitution. Yet they would pass \nlegislation basically grandfathering four established religions, but \noutlawing other religions, such as the Mormon church, the Roman \nCatholic Church, and untold other numbers of minority religions in \nRussia.\n  The Reverend Gleb Yakunin, an orthodox priest, said in a news report \ncarried by the June 24 edition of the London Times, that the bill was \n``openly discriminatory'' and ``The bill is effectively aimed at \nreinstating Soviet religious policy.''\n  I believe the reverend's statement is true. I believe putting \nrestrictions on the religions that have recently entered Russia will \nhave the same effect of not allowing many people to practice their \nreligions. If religions are unable to carry out charitable activities, \nhow can members of various churches practice their religion?\n  Christian missionaries who are following the admonition of Christ \nwould not be allowed to do so in Russia. Many remember when Billy \nGraham went to Russia several years ago. He had an overwhelming \nreception. Would foreign missionaries not be allowed? Would people that \ngather be allowed to reproduce materials? I think the reproduction of \nmaterials would be banned under the bill that was passed by the Duma. \nHopefully, Mr. Yeltsin will not sign this bill. I think it is extremely \nimportant he not sign this bill.\n  According to Lawrence Uzzell, Moscow representative of the Keston \nInstitute, which studies religious life in Russia and Eastern Europe, \nof the 102 Catholic priests and 112 nuns serving in Russia, all but a \nhandful are foreigners. In fact, Mr. Uzzell reports that a Catholic \npriest in Belgorod was recently told he could not celebrate mass there \nbecause his parish is a foreign religious organization.\n  I think this report confirms what I suspected, that this bill passed \nby the Duma would not only put restrictions on these religions, but \nhave the effect of denying the opportunity to many to practice their \nreligion.\n  So I want to thank my colleague from Oregon for his amendment. Again, \nit may be one of the most important amendments.\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\n  What is the effect? It says no money under this bill, the foreign \noperations bill, will go to Russia if President Yeltsin signs this bill \ninto law or if it becomes law, or if he issues an executive order that \nwill ban religious freedom as guaranteed under the Russian \nConstitution.\n  I think it is a very appropriate amendment. Some people will argue \nthis is too heavy of a hammer. I think we need to get their attention. \nWhat they are doing by outlawing many religions, basically most \nChristian religions and organizations, banning those, outlawing those \nfrom Russia, I think, would be a terrible, terrible thing to happen to \nthe Russian people. They should not be forced into any religion. We \nshould certainly encourage religious choice and opportunity for all the \nRussian people.\n  Some will say, what is the effect of this amendment? This amendment \nsays no economic assistance will be going to Russia if the President \nsigns this bill or if he issues an executive order which will ban \nreligious freedom in Russia. How much economic assistance does Russia \nreceive? I think last year it was $90-some million, and the President \nrequested $195 million in this bill. It is not earmarked, so we don't \nhave the specific amount. Would this tie the President's hands? This \nwould give real leverage to the administration to tell Russia, this \nshould not become law.\n  We need to respect individual religious liberty in Russia and not \nallow--and certainly not encourage--religious liberty to be trampled. I \nbelieve we should use what economic forces we have to ensure this \ndoesn't happen. We don't have to give this economic assistance to \nRussia. We haven't done it for years. We just started a couple of years \nago. Many of the programs that we are funding in the foreign ops bill \nare worthy programs, where we encourage democracy, encourage free \nenterprise. That is very positive. But we don't have to do it.\n  Maybe we should tell them if they are going to pass this kind of \nbill, we are not going to do it. If they are going to pass a bill in \nRussia to deny Baptists the opportunity to distribute materials or to \nhave employees in Russia, then maybe we should not be giving them \neconomic assistance. Maybe we need to use a heavy hammer to get their \nattention that this is very serious.\n  One of the most important freedoms we have, protected by our first \namendment, is religious freedom. It is also protected in the Russian \nConstitution. We should encourage the Russian Government to protect \nreligious freedom, not take it away. So, yes, this is an amendment that \nhas a heavy hammer. It says we are not going to give economic \nassistance.\n  I noticed a memo from the administration in opposition to this \namendment, which says our assistance money is used to reduce the number \nof nuclear weapons and improve security over nuclear materials in \nRussia. We are not touching that. That is covered by the DOD bill. I \nencouraged the Senator from Oregon to consider putting it on that bill \nbecause I wanted to get their attention early. President Yeltsin hasn't \nsigned this bill--our friend, President Clinton's friend, George Bush's \nfriend. He hasn't signed the bill yet. We want to get his attention \nbefore it is too late. This is the proper bill. So it doesn't have \nanything to do with Nunn-Lugar money, or national defense. It does have \nsome money in there for economic assistance.\n  As I mentioned, the President's request is about $190 million. We \nprobably won't fully fund it. But we don't have to fund it at all if \nthey are going to pass a bill denying religious freedom and opportunity \nfor the Russian people.\n  So I compliment my colleague from Oregon for an outstanding \namendment. I hope we will have an overwhelming vote, maybe 100 to 0, in \nspite of what the memo says. Let us have a 100 to 0 vote to show that \nwe believe very strongly that religious freedom is very important and \nwe are willing to put it on the line that we will fight to help protect \nreligious freedom throughout the world and certainly in Russia.\n  So, Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Oregon. I hope all \nmy colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 894\n\n       (Purpose: To provide conditions for funding North Korea's \n           implementation of the nuclear framework agreement)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 894.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in Title II, insert the following \n     ``Provided further, That funds appropriated under this \n     heading to the Korean Peninsula Economic Development \n     Organation (KEDO) may only be obligated if the Secretary of \n     State certifies and reports to the Congress that during the \n     fiscal year the military armistice agreement of 1953 has not \n     been violated by North Korea.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. At 10:40 a.m. Tuesday morning along the \ndemilitarized zone between North and South Korea, North Korean soldiers \nexchanged heavy gunfire with South Korean troops. This is accurately \ndescribed as the most serious clash on the Korean Peninsula since a \nNorth Korean submarine full of special forces went aground off South \nKorea's coast last September.\n  According to news reports, 14 North Korean soldiers crossed the \nmilitary demarcation line and traveled 70 meters into the DMZ. South \nKorean border guards used a loudspeaker to order the North Koreans \nback. When the North Koreans failed to respond, South Korean soldiers \nfired some 200 warning shots in the air.\n  The North Koreans responded by firing their rifles at the South \nKorean soldiers, who then directed fire at the North Koreans using \nrifles and machine guns. North Korean soldiers returned fire. And \nalthough reports are in dispute, it appears there was at least one \nmortar round fired by the North Koreans.\n  The firefight lasted for over 1 hour before the North Koreans stopped \nfiring and withdrew.\n  Mr. President. Why do I come to the floor and talk about an artillery \nexchange thousands of miles away? There are several good reasons why \nAmericans should pay attention to what is going on on the Korean \nPeninsula.\n  First, I don't need to remind my colleagues that I am talking about \nthe DMZ where 37,000 American troops stand guard across from a 1.1 \nmillion man North Korean army.\n  Second, according to a GAO report that I requested last year, the \nUnited States has sent over 115 million taxpayer dollars in combined \nfood aid and to support the Korean Economic Development Organization \n[KEDO], which is tasked with sending heavy fuel oil to North Korea and \ncarrying out other activities under the agreed framework signed in \nOctober 1994.\n  Just yesterday, the administration announced that the United States \nwill donate an additional $27 million worth of surplus grain to North \nKorea.\n  And today, in the foreign operations appropriations bill, there is an \nadditional $44 million appropriated for KEDO, subject to certain \nconditions that Senator McCain and I added to last year's appropriation \nbill.\n  Now $200 million may be a small price to pay to achieve peace on the \nKorean Peninsula, and I am not arguing about the money per se. But if \nthere was ever a case of a recipient biting the hand that feeds it--it \nis North Korea.\n  Incident after incident--from the submarine incursion to this latest \nround of gunfire--is dismissed as ``not intentional'' or not \n``serious'' enough to derail U.S. assistance under the agreed \nframework. After the North Korean submarine landed on South Korean \nshores, our administration asked for ``both sides to show restraint.'' \nI was outraged that we asked our South\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\nKorean allies to ``show restraint'' when it was their country that had \nbeen invaded by commandos.\n  I understand that right now the administration is preparing a \nresponse to this latest violation of the Military Armistice Agreement. \nAnd true to form, the administration is asking once again that this \nissue not be ``blown out of proportion''. Not blown out of proportion?\n  I think we should be outraged at North Korea's continued belligerent \nactions that are clearly designed to intimidate. The South Koreans did \nnothing wrong today, unless you think defending one's borders and \nshooting in self-defense is wrong. I hope the administration's \nstatement recognizes that reality and does not even implicitly agree \nwith the North Korean foreign ministry propaganda claiming that their \nsoldiers were acting in self-defense.\n  That is why in offering this amendment, Mr. President, I would \ncondition further funding--this is the important part of the \namendment--on a certification from the President that North Korea has \nnot violated the Military Armistice Agreement of 1953.\n  Although I have very strong reservations about the agreed framework, \nwhich I have expressed on this floor from time to time, and \nparticularly because North Korea does not have to submit to inspections \nthat were required 5 years ago, for several more years--and this is in \nassociation with the construction of the light water reactors that \nJapan, the United States, and South Korea are assisting in--I have \nsupported continued funding for KEDO, subject to specific conditions \nthat are spelled out in the bill. But I now believe that these \nconditions should be expanded to ensure that North Korea belligerency \ncomes to an end.\n  If the North Koreans want economic assistance from the United States, \nthey are going to have to learn that their troops and munitions ought \nto stay on their side of the border. Their people, unfortunately, don't \nhave enough to eat. Many of them are starving. We continue to help them \nwith food assistance and humanitarian assistance. Yet, they continue to \nuse their military to provoke those who would help them.\n  I think it is time for the administration to stop appeasing this \ntyrannical and barbaric government that has brutalized the people of \nNorth Korea for more than 45 years. We, in effect, are supporting a \ngovernment that would probably fall by its own weight. I am not \nsuggesting that it is not a very dangerous situation with the 1.1 \nmillion men in arms. I am not suggesting that the regime isn't \ndangerous, in the sense of being very unpredictable. But they have to \nget the message that they can't bite the hand that feeds them. We \ncontinue to assist North Korea even while that Government continues a \nvery aggressive posture.\n  If the administration cannot certify North Korean compliance with \nthis amendment, I think financial assistance must come to an end. If \nthe President can make the necessary certification that the North \nKoreans have not violated the Military Armistice Agreement of 1953, I \ncertainly would not stand in the way of meeting our commitments to \nKEDO. But I think the North Koreans should certainly get the message \nthat they simply cannot continue to operate under the theory that \nanything goes with regard to its commitment to KEDO.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, if I could just \npropound a unanimous-consent request, then I will yield the floor.\n  It is my understanding it has been cleared on the other side of the \naisle for there to be a vote on the Smith amendment at 2 o'clock. It is \nmy understanding, based upon a previous agreement, that would also \ntrigger a vote on final passage on the energy and water appropriations \nbill.\n  Therefore, if I am correct about that, I ask unanimous consent that a \nvote on the Smith amendment occur at 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I remind my colleagues there will be two votes, back \nto back, at 2 o'clock, one on the Smith amendment and one on final \npassage of energy and water.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intention to ask for the yeas \nand nays on my amendment that is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays on my \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am working and my staff is working with \nthe Senator from Alaska right now so that I can cosponsor this \nimportant amendment regarding Korea. We have some details we would like \nto iron out as to the language of the amendment that I am confident we \ncan agree on.\n  Mr. President, we all know that there has been another North Korean-\ninitiated altercation in the demilitarized zone that separates it from \nthe South.\n  According to preliminary reports, a small number of North Korean \nsoldiers entered South Korea and refused an order from the South to \nwithdraw. When the North Korean soldiers ignored the verbal warning, \nthe South Korean soldiers fired warning shots, to which the North \nresponded with a mortar and artillery barrage.\n  My reason for bringing this up is to ensure this latest event \ninvolving North Korea is placed squarely in its proper context. On \nMonday, the Clinton administration announced that it is doubling the \namount of food assistance it intends to supply to Pyongyang to \nalleviate some of the suffering from the famine resulting primarily \nfrom 50 years of totalitarian rule and exacerbated by intense flooding. \nI am not here to argue against providing food to starving people; I am \nhere to reiterate the futility of expecting humanitarian gestures to \nthe most belligerent regime in the world to beneficially affect its \nbehavior.\n  Nobody knows what is going on inside the minds of North Korea's \nleaders, especially the presumed head of government, Kim Jong Il. So \nthoroughly closed off to the outside world as the North Korean \nGovernment has been since its post-World War II inception, that details \non its inner workings have been more elusive than for the Soviet Union \nduring its most closed and totalitarian period. One incontrovertible \nfact remains, however: North Korea has an extraordinarily consistent \npattern of alternating minor and manipulative gestures of goodwill with \nacts of terror and provocation toward its South Korean neighbor unseen \nanywhere else in the world.\n  To illustrate this pattern of provocation and terror, I ask unanimous \nconsent to submit for the Record this list of such individual acts \nspanning the period 1958 to March of this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                          The Library of Congress,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1997.\n     To:\n     From: Rinn S. Shinn, Analyst in Asian Affairs, Foreign \n       Affairs and National Defense Division.\n     Subject: History of North Korean Terrorist Activities.\n       The following chronology is in response to your request for \n     historical information on terrorist activities carried out by \n     the North Korean government in the past decades. For the \n     purpose of this chronology, we have agreed that the scope of \n     ``terrorist activities'' should be expanded to cover broadly \n     defined other provocative acts and beyond ``the last 20 \n     years'' you indicated in your request.\n       I should add that the chronology is selective. From 1954 to \n     1992, North Korea infiltrated a total of 3,693 armed agents \n     into South Korea. According to data compiled by a South \n     Korean government agency, 2,345 infiltrators were captured; \n     1,130 killed; and 218 surrendered. The peak years of North \n     Korean infiltration were 1967 and 1968, accounting for a \n     total of 743 agents (167 captured; 553 shot to death; and 23 \n     surrendered). Incidence of infiltration has decreased sharply \n     since 1987 but has not stopped completely (Vantage Point, \n     November 1995, p. 17). If you need further assistance or have \n     questions, please call me.\n\n\n          Chronology of Major Provocative Acts by North Korea\n\n       Date, activities.\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\n       02/1958--North Korean agents hijacked to Pyongyang a South \n     Korean airliner flying from Pusan to Seoul; 2 American pilots \n     and 24 passengers were released in early March but 8 other \n     passengers remained in the North.\n       01/1968--a 31-number commando team, disguised as South \n     Korean soldiers and civilians, reached within 500 yards of \n     President Park Chung Hee's office/residence complex (The Blue \n     House) before they were intercepted by South Korean police; \n     29 commandos were killed and one committed suicide; one who \n     was captured revealed that their mission was to kill \n     President Park and other senior government officials.\n       01/1968--Two days after the commando attempt on President \n     Park, North Korea seized the U.S. intelligence ship Pueblo \n     with a crew of 83 officers and men off Wonsan in \n     international waters outside the 12-mile limit claimed by \n     North Korea; the crew was finally released in 12/1968, but \n     not the ship.\n       10/1968--130 sea-borne commandos infiltrated the Ulchin and \n     Samchok areas on the eastern coast of South Korea; 110 were \n     killed, 7 were captured, and 13 fled.\n       04/1969--North Korea shot down an unarmed U.S. EC-121 \n     reconnaissance plane over international waters, resulting in \n     the loss of 31 lives.\n       06/1969--North Korea agents infiltrated Huksan Island off \n     the west coast; 15 were shot to death.\n       12/1969--North Korea hijacked a South Korean airliner with \n     50 persons aboard to Pyongyang; in February 1970, it released \n     all but 11 of the crew and passengers but detained 7 \n     passengers, 1 pilot, and 2 stewardesses and seized the \n     aircraft. The 11 are reportedly still detained in North \n     Korea, along with some 450 other South Koreans abducted by \n     North Korea in the past decades.\n       03/1970--From 1970 to 1995, North Korea provided sanctuary \n     to 9 members of a Japanese radical leftwing ``Red Army'' \n     group who had hijacked a Japanese Boeing 707 airliner to \n     Pyongyang.\n       04/1970--Three North Korean infiltrators were shot to death \n     at Kumchon, Kyonggido, south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) \n     separating the two Koreas.\n       06/1970--A powerful bomb exploded, demolishing the main \n     gate to National Cemetery (South Korea's equivalent of \n     Arlington Cemetery), before President Park's scheduled visit \n     to the place. The incident was linked to North Korean \n     elements.\n       01/1971--A North Korean attempt to hijack a South Korean \n     Airline F-20 passenger plane flying from Seoul to Sokcho on \n     the east coast was foiled.\n       08/1974--President Park Chung Hee's wife was killed during \n     another attempt on his life. A member of a pro-North Korean \n     group in Japan who entered Seoul as a tourist fired several \n     shots at Park at a major public function; Park escaped \n     unhurt, but the First Lady was hit by stray bullets and died \n     several hours later.\n       09/1975--Two North Korean infiltrators were intercepted at \n     Kochang, Cholla Pukdo; one was shot to death.\n       06/1976--Three North Korean infiltrators were shot to death \n     in the eastern sector south of the DMZ.\n       08/1976--A group of North Korean soldiers, wielding axes \n     and metal pikes, attacked a U.S.-South Korean tree-trimming \n     team in a neutral area inside the DMZ at Panmunjom, killing 2 \n     U.S. army officers and wounding 4 American enlisted men and 5 \n     South Korean soldiers. In a message to UN Commander General \n     Richard G. Stillwell, North Korea's Kim Il Sung described the \n     incident as ``regrettable'' without admitting North Korean \n     responsibility for what the U.S. government condemned as a \n     ``vicious and unprovoked murder'' of the officers.\n       07/1977--A North Korean attempt to abduct a South Korean \n     couple (Yoon Jong-hee and wife) failed in Paris.\n       02/1978--Actress Choi Eun-hee and her film-director husband \n     Shin Sang-ok were kidnapped in Hong Kong and taken to \n     Pyongyang.

Among the killed were; presidential chief-\n     of-staff and another senior presidential assistant; deputy \n     prime minister/minister of economic planning; three cabinet \n     members including foreign minister; 3 deputy ministers; and \n     South Korean ambassador to Burma. The bomb was intended for \n     President Chun. Based on initial findings, Seoul accused \n     Pyongyang of masterminding the mass assassination, an \n     accusation North Korean leader Kim Il Sung dismissed as a \n     ``preposterous slander.'' President Chun termed the mass \n     assassination as ``a grave provocation not unlike a \n     declaration of war,'' and warned the North that ``should such \n     a provocation recur, there would be a corresponding \n     retailiation in kind.'' Two suspects arrested and tried in \n     the Rangoon Divisional Court turned out to be a North Korean \n     army major and captain. On November 4, Burma broke off \n     diplomatic relations with North Korea. In 02/84, the Burmese \n     Supreme Court sustained the death penalty handed down by the \n     lower court.\n       09/1984--A North Korean agent killed 3 residents of Taegu, \n     South Korea, and committed suicide.\n       10/1984--A North Korean spy ship was chased off the coast \n     of Pusan, South Korea, but eluded capture.\n       01/1998--A North Korean attempt to abduct a South Korean \n     citizen (Yoon Taek-shik) failed in Hong Kong.\n       08/1997--Lee Chae-hwan, a South Korean student enrolled in \n     an American school, was abducted by North Koreans while on a \n     visit to a European country.\n       11/1987--A bomb planted by two North Korean terrorists on a \n     Korean Airline Boeing 707 exploded in midair over the Andaman \n     Sea off the coast of Burma. 115 passengers were aboard the \n     flight from Baghdad to Seoul. One of the terrorists, who was \n     taken into custody in Bahrain, confessed to the crime, was \n     tried, and convicted in a Seoul court.\n       03/1990--Another North Korean tunnel dug under the DMZ was \n     discovered; this was the fourth one uncovered since the mid-\n     1970s.\n       05/1992--Three North Koreans, wearing South Korean \n     uniforms, were shot to death at Cholwon, Kangwondo, south of \n     the DMZ.\n       10/1992--A North Korean 400-member spy ring in South Korea, \n     directed by Lee Son-sil (a Political Bureau candidate member \n     of the Central Committee of Pyongyang's ruling Korean Workers \n     (Communist) Party), was uncovered by South Korea's Agency for \n     National Security Planning. The Agency announced that the \n     agents had infiltrated through South Korea's coastlines.\n       03/1993--North Korea announced its intention to withdraw \n     from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty rather than yield \n     to the International Atomic Energy Agency's demands for a \n     ``special inspection'' of two suspected nuclear waste storage \n     sites at Yongbyon, North Korea.\n       12/1993--Vice Marshal Choe Kwang, Chief of the General \n     Staff of the North Korean military (and defense minister, \n     1995-96), declared at a major state function that the \n     military ``has the heavy and honorable task of reunifying the \n     fatherland with guns [emphasis added] in the nineties without \n     fail,'' thereby revealing not so subtly North Korea's \n     alternative to its oft-proclaimed policy of ``peaceful \n     reunification.''\n       03/1994--For the first time in more than two decades, North \n     Korea issue a threat of war in an inter-Korean meeting in \n     Panmunjom. In response to Seoul's chief delegate mentioning \n     the possibility of UN sanctions against the North for its \n     refusal to accept full international nuclear inspections, \n     Pyongyang's chief delegate reportedly shot back: ``Seoul is \n     not far away from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will turn \n     into a sea of fire.'' The ``sea of fire'' threat rattled \n     South Koreans, already concerned about Pyongyang's perceived \n     attempt to cultivate a `madman' image as ``a new \n     psychological negotiating tactic'' designed ``to blackmail \n     the US into granting concessions, including diplomatic \n     recognition, the lifting of trade sanctions and the supply of \n     aid for its tottering economy.''\n       06/1994--A North Korean attempt to abduct a South Korean \n     professor, Lee Jin-sang, from an Ethiopian university in \n     Addis Ababa was foiled.\n       08/1994--North Korea's foreign ministry declared: ``We will \n     never allow the [special] inspection of the military sites at \n     the expense of our sovereignty in order to receive light-\n     water reactors. Another conflict cannot be avoided, if they \n     [South Korean and Japanese authorities] continue trying to \n     complicate matters, citing the `special inspection' that we \n     have never allowed and cannot allow in the future either.'' \n     (The North Korean-U.S. ``agreed framework'' of October 1994 \n     to the contrary, North Korea continues to maintain that the \n     special inspection is out of question--a portent of what \n     might be called ``a special inspection crisis'' several years \n     down the road or around 2003).\n       05/1995--North Korean patrol boat fired on a South Korean \n     fishing vessel, killing three South Korean fishermen; North \n     Korea released 5 other fishermen in December 1995 through \n     Panmunjom.\n       06/1995--North Korean soldiers threatened the captain of a \n     South Korean vessel with harm in a North Korean port unless \n     he hoisted the North Korean flag while the vessel was there \n     to deliver a South Korean humanitarian rice shipment to the \n     North.\n       07/1995--A team of three North Korean agents abducted a \n     South Korean missionary,\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\n     the Reverend An Sung-un, in southern Manchuria and \n     transported him to North Korea. Reverend An currently remains \n     in the North.\n       08/1995--North Korea seized a South Korean rice delivery \n     vessel and arrested its crew in a North Korean port after a \n     South Korean crewman took photographs from the ship. The ship \n     was released in 12 days after the South Korean government \n     sent a message to the North, expressing ``regret'' over the \n     photographing incident.\n       10/1995--Two armed North Koreans were intercepted at the \n     Imjin River just south of the DMZ; one was shot to death and \n     the other escaped (This incident happened at a time when \n     South Korea was sending humanitarian rice aid to North \n     Korea).\n       10/1995--Two North Korean agents were intercepted at Puyo, \n     about 100 miles south of Seoul; one was shot to death and the \n     other was taken alive. The captured agent disclosed that he \n     had infiltrated into South Korea two months earlier, with a \n     mission to contact anti-government dissidents and politicians \n     and the organization of underground cells.\n       04/1996--A total of four hundred North Korean troops \n     crossed the military demarcation line of the DMZ at Panmunjom \n     and elsewhere in violation of the Korean armistice agreement, \n     after Pyongyang's unilateral announcement that it no longer \n     would abide by the terms of the armistice.\n       05/1996--Seven North Korean soldiers crossed the military \n     demarcation line into the southern half of the DMZ, facing \n     South Korean defensive positions just south of the DMZ, but \n     withdrew when South Korean troops fired warning shots.\n       05/1996--Five North Korean naval patrol craft crossed into \n     South Korean territorial waters off the east coast in an area \n     designated as South Korean waters under the armistice accord \n     but withdrew after four hours of a standoff with South Korean \n     naval vessels. A similar three-hour incursion by three North \n     Korean craft in the same area occurred on June 14, 1996.\n       07/1996--A North Korean spy was captured in Seoul after \n     posing as a Filipino professor for 12 years. Chung Su Il \n     (alias: Mohammed Kansu), 62, told police that ``scores, \n     perhaps hundreds'' of North Korean spies were operating in \n     the South.\n       09/1996--A disabled North Korean submarine was spotted \n     bobbing off the shore near the city of Kangnung. Twenty six \n     North Korean military personnel landed on the east coast from \n     the submarine that was found to be on an espionage/\n     reconnaissance mission. Eleven of the infiltrators were shot \n     to death by North Koreans; 13 others refused to surrender and \n     were killed; one was captured and one escaped. During the \n     South Korean hunt for the infiltrators, North Koreans killed \n     11 South Korean military personnel and civilians and wounded \n     five others.\n       10/1996--Choi Duk Keun, a South Korean diplomat, was \n     murdered in Vladivostok, Russia, following a North Korean \n     threat to ``retaliate'' for the submarine incident. \n     Circumstantial evidence initially pointed to North Korean \n     complicity in the murder, and later autopsy results showed \n     that poison found in Choi's body was the same type of poison \n     carried by North Korean infiltrators from the grounded \n     submarine in September.\n       02/1997--In Seoul, South Korea, Lee Han-yong was \n     assassinated by two hit men believed to be North Korean \n     agents. Nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's former \n     wife, Song Hye-rim, Lee had defected to the South in 1982. \n     The shooting took place three days after Hwang Jan-yop, a \n     high ranking North Korean party official, walked into the \n     South Korean consulate in Beijing to defect to the South--a \n     possible warning to Hwang and other would-be defectors to the \n     South. After being in coma, Lee died a week later in a Seoul \n     hospital.\n       03/1997--Japan's daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun, based on \n     an interview with a former South Korean agent An Myong-chin \n     (who defected to South Korea in September 1993), reported \n     that in 1977, Megumi Yokota, a 13-year-old Japanese school \n     girl was abducted in Niigata City to North Korea for use as a \n     teaching aide at a North Korean school for spy training. \n     Japanese authorities disclosed that An's description of the \n     girl matched the profile of a girl reported missing in \n     Niigata, Japan.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is a list worthy of Stalin, the butcher \nof millions of his own people and the Soviet leader who installed Kim \nJong-Il's father, Kim Il Sung, in power following the end of the Second \nWorld War. This list includes numerous instances of North Korean agents \ninfiltrating the South to conduct assassinations, with the most recent \noccurring last February; causes of agents kidnapping ordinary Japanese \ncitizens off of the beaches of their own country as well as South \nKoreans, who are smuggled to North Korea for imprisonment and \ninterrogation; armed soldiers crossing the border between the two \ncountries to provoke fire fights, such as apparently occurred this \nmorning; special forces infiltrating the South through tunnels dug \nbeneath the DMZ; and the naval incursions, most recently the September \n1996 submarine that was grounded off the South Korean coast with the \nensuing loss of considerable life due to the will of the North Korean \ncommandoes who debarked from the sub not to be taken alive.\n  I highly recommend my colleagues take a few minutes to review this \nlist. It is the ultimate commentary on the nature of the North Korean \nregime. It is a window into the soul of that country's rulers. It is a \nwarning against misjudging the North's periodic gestures of goodwill \nthat are inevitably, at most, tactical responses to their own self-\ninduced social calamities or continued efforts at undermining the \nrelationship between South Korea and the United States.\n  Mr. President, I now want to discuss the bill very briefly itself.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate on \nthe subject of the fiscal year 1988 foreign operations appropriations \nbill. As has been noted numerous times by Members of this body, the end \nof the cold war had the unwelcome effect of creating a vacuum into \nwhich all manner of ethnic, religious, and territorial conflict has \nbeen permitted to emerge. In addition, the continuous problems of \ncombating famine, disease, and other problems afflicting many nations \nof the world ensures that the global responsibilities of the executive \nand legislative branches of the Government remain substantial, \nparticularly relative to the resources available with which to address \nthem.\n  It is for these reasons that we owe it to the American public and to \nthose less fortunate than ourselves around the world that we act as \nresponsibly as possible when allocating these scarce resources. That is \nwhy I continue to oppose the practices of adding to the bill funds for \nprograms of questionable merit and of earmarking for specific \ninstitutions without regard for broader U.S. national security \ninterests.\n  As an elected representative from a State with considerable \nagricultural interests, I am fully aware of the importance of properly \nadministered agricultural programs. Do we honestly expect, however, the \nAmerican public to adopt a less confrontational posture vis-a-vis their \nelected representatives when we continue to earmark funds for the \nInternational Fertilizer Development Center in Alabama. Not only does \nthe bill before us earmark $3 million for the center, this amount \nrepresents a 50-percent increase over fiscal year 1996. Is the chemical \nmakeup or molecular structure of fertilizer changing so much that we \nneed to actually increase appropriations for the Fertilizer Development \nCenter?\n  As usual, although admittedly to a lesser extent than in years past, \nthe bill recommends or directs funding for specific universities, \nincluding the University of Hawaii for the training of health and human \nservice professionals; the University of Northern Iowa for teacher \neducation in Slovakia; and George Mason University, also for health \ncare. Montana State University continues to fare well in foreign \noperations appropriations bills. In the past, it has received funding \nfor pest control. This year, it is supposed to receive funds for crop \neradication, specifically opium poppy, coca, and marijuana. Laudable \ngoals, but why the earmark? I do not question the value of some of \nthese programs; I do question whether they require or deserve funding \nfrom the U.S. Treasury or cannot be competed among contending \ninstitutions and organizations.\n  Other recommendations and earmarks of questionable merit included in \nthis bill are $15 million for the Office of Women in Development, which \nis hardly necessary with simple instructions to our own Agency for \nInternational Development; $500,000 for the U.S. Telecommunications \nTraining Institute for communications and broadcast training; and $15 \nmillion over 5 years for the International Foundation for Education and \nSelf-Help, which trains teachers and bankers. I was also interested to \nsee in the report accompanying this bill a recommendation to AID that \nit work with Science and Technology International to further \ndevelopment of the advanced airborne hyperspectral imaging system, \nwhich is intended to facilitate the monitoring of environmental \ndegradation and disaster mitigation and aid in the protection of \nwetlands and management of littoral regions. Does any of this overlap \nwith the $60 million the bill earmarked for the Global Environment \nFacility.\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\n  Once again, I applaud the goal, but question whether we should be \nspecifying programs, directly or indirectly, without the benefit of a \ncompetitive process or adequate knowledge of whether similar \ncapabilities are already or imminently available in the private sector. \nI further note that this is the second bill this week to include \nfunding for this program: The Defense appropriations bill included $2 \nmillion for the advanced airborne hyperspectral imaging system.\n  I have already referred to funding for agricultural programs in the \nbill that warrants skepticism. With funding also directed toward the \nFarmer-to-Farmer Program and the Soils Management Collaborative \nResearch Support Program, I wonder whether it isn't time to take a \ncloser look at the proliferation of programs to determine whether they \nare all necessary or overlap in function.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to briefly address the Buy-\nAmerica provisions of the bill. The American public understandably \nabhors active participation by its Government in encouraging U.S. \ncompanies to relocate to foreign countries where labor and materials \nare cheaper. Section 538 of the bill addresses this concern. Paragraph \n(b) of this provision may go too far, however, with the ultimate impact \nof impeding economic growth where it is seriously needed while \ndegrading the benefits that accrue to the American economy through free \ntrade. Specifically, the paragraph in question prohibits the use of \nfunds for the purpose of,\n\n     . . . establishing or developing in a foreign country any \n     export processing zone or designated area in which the tax, \n     tariff, labor, environment, and safety law of that country do \n     not apply, in part or in whole, to activities carried out \n     with that zone or area, unless the President determines and \n     certifies that such assistance is not likely to cause a loss \n     of jobs within the United States.\n\n  The Presidential certification process established by this provision \nwill create, I suspect, the same problems as do other certifications \nprocesses. As countries evolve over decades and centuries and economies \nreflect that evolution through industrialization and service-oriented \ndominance, and as free trade policies account for substantial \nproportions of economic growth, inevitably jobs are lost in certain \nareas. It has never been any different. We have also seen the benefits \nto the very people we purport to help of free market economic zones in \ncountries with otherwise centrally controlled economies. It is such \nzones that facilitate the greatest economic growth and that are more \nprone to exhibit liberal social and political transformations \nconsistent with our own national values. To adopt a provision designed \nto impede such progress is not in our national interest.\n  There is room for improvement in this bill that I hope will occur \nwhen the Appropriations Committees of the respective Houses of Congress \nmeet in conference. It is discouraging to see the practice of \nearmarking continue. At least, though, the long-term trend has been in \nthe right direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of programs in the \nbill that I find objectionable be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nObjectionable Programs in the Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill for \n             1998: Title II--Bilateral Economic Assistance\n\n\n                     programs with funds earmarked\n\n                                                            In millions\nAmerican Schools and Hospitals: American University in Beirut, Lebanese \n  American University, Hadassah Medical Organization, Feinberg Graduate \n  School in Israel, and Johns Hopkins University (Bologna, Italy, \n  China)..........................................................$15.0\nU.S. Telecommunications Training Institute..........................0.5\nUniversity Development Assistance Programs: University of Hawaii, \n  University of Northern Iowa, and George Mason University..........2.0\nInternational Fertilizer Development Center.........................3.0\nInternational Foundation for Education and Self-Help: Human resource \n  development in sub-Saharan Africa................................15.0\n\n\n          programs for which the committee recommends funding\n\n       Advanced Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging System: Monitors \n     Wetlands and Littoral Zones.\n       Farmer-to-Farmer: Overseas Cooperative Assistance Program, \n     specifically in former Soviet Union.\n       Pushchino Project: Promotes economic development in South \n     Central Russia.\n       Mongolia: Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, PA, \n     to provide technical advice on infrastructure development.\n       Biological Control of Illicit Drug Crops: Research at \n     Montana State University in the development of plant \n     pathogens.\n       Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis: Supports joint funding for \n     this technology.\n\n\n                           commerce and trade\n\n       Sec.  513. Restricts funds for testing in connection with \n     the growth or production in a foreign country of an \n     agricultural commodity which would compete with commodities \n     grown in the United States.\n       Sec.  514. Restricts funds for foreign production or \n     extraction of any commodity or mineral for export if its \n     surplus on the world market will cause substantial injury to \n     United States producers of the same, or similar commodity.\n       Sec.  538. Restricts funds that would provide any financial \n     incentive to a business in the United States considering \n     relocating outside of the United States if it is likely to \n     reduce the number of employees in the United States.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend, Senator Murkowski, from Alaska for \nproposing an amendment that has to do with the very serious situation \nin Korea, and frankly the part of America's foreign policy that I think \nis deserving of significant criticism. I think history will show that \nthis entire issue of North Korea has been mishandled by this \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent on behalf of \nthe leader.\n  Before I make that unanimous consent request, I would like to thank \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Alaska in reference to \nthe amendment concerning our policy with North Korea. Senator McCain \nhas pointed out the situation that now exists with another flare-up of \nhostilities on the DMZ between South Korea and North Korea.\n  Some time ago--about 4 months--I was privileged to take part in a \ndelegation with Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Cochran, and myself were the first American \ncongressional delegation allowed into North Korea.\n  We went to North Korea with a specific purpose. We know that country \nis hard hit by a famine, and that the situation is very real. We wanted \nto encourage the North Koreans, in cooperation with Ambassador \nRichardson, the State Department and the administration, to participate \nin the four-party peace talks.\n  Since I have had the privilege of being the former chairman of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee and serve on the Agriculture Committee here \nin this body, I wanted to encourage the North Koreans to explore every \nopportunity for normal trading relations--that is, to explore the \npossibility of commercial trade and third-party agreements that would \nalleviate their situation.\n  I think we made some progress. I think we tried to make our point \nthat these kind of negotiations, these kind of contacts, would \ncertainly open up new doors of cooperation only to find out, however, \nthat now just at the time the administration is announcing a doubling \nof the humanitarian food assistance to North Korea we see another \nrepeat of these hostilities.\n  I remember well in meeting with the South Korean Government officials \nwhen South Korea sent a ship full of grain and other food shipments to \nthe North. The North simply confiscated the ship, took down the South \nKorean flag, raised the North Korean flag, took all of the personnel \ninvolved, and had them incarcerated for about 10 days, and then finally \nlet those folks go back to South Korea. That to me is not a very \nwilling partner in an effort to relieve any kind of famine.\n  Quite frankly, when we were in North Korea they were conducting a \nmilitary exercise at the time that we were there, and wasting, as far \nas I am concerned and any other observer, valuable dollars that could \nhave been provided to their own people who are suffering. This is a \nrepressive regime--a theocracy, if you will--that is punishing their \nsenior citizens and their very young--putting them through a famine at \nthe same time that they are asking us for this kind of assistance.\n  Question: Will these funds go to the purpose that it should go to, or \nwill they go to simply reinforce a very repressive military?\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\n  These are questions that should be answered. And I think with the \nlatest flare-up on the DMZ Senator Murkowski and Senator McCain have \nmade an excellent amendment, and I hope we would consider it and I hope \nit will be improved.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Agreement--s. 1004\n\n  In behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. \n1004, be considered read a third time, that the vote on passage occur \nas under the original consent, and additionally the bill not be \nengrossed, that it remain at the desk pending the receipt of the House \ncompanion measure; I further ask unanimous consent that when the House \ncompanion measure is passed pursuant to the previous order, the passage \nof S. 1004 be vitiated and that S. 1004 be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Matthew \nGoldenberg, Danette Lince, Joshua Spellman, and Katherine Ruth be given \nfloor privileges today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment pending, and I had \nasked for the yeas and nays some time ago. There was a question, and I \nwould like to again ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment on North \nKorea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, because of a meeting with the President and \nthe Vice President, I was unable to be here for the opening of this \nbill, and I did want to make note of a couple items.\n  First, I do commend my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who \nhas put together a bill which I believe both parties, both Republicans \nand Democrats, can and should support. I should note that last year the \nforeign operations bill passed the Senate by a vote of 93 to 7, which \nis pretty darned good for such a piece of legislation. This year's bill \nI think will pass by an even higher margin.\n  I thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, and the \nsenior Democrat on the committee, Senator Byrd, for providing us with \nan allocation that has made it possible to fund many of the \nadministration's foreign policy priorities, in fact, most of the \npriorities of Members of the Senate, and that is extremely important as \nwe go into conference with the other body.\n  For the past 3 years, Senator McConnell and I and Senator Lugar and \nothers have argued that U.S. leadership costs money. Senator McConnell \nhas fought efforts in the House to cut funding for programs that are \nvital to U.S. foreign policy and national security. I think all of us \nowe him a debt of gratitude for that. I take the attitude, which is the \nattitude of all Vermonters ahead of me, that in foreign policy matters \nespecially we should try to develop bipartisanship. The distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia and the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Alaska did that in developing the allocation in this bill. While I \nam the only Member of my party ever to be elected from the State of \nVermont, I look back to distinguished predecessors as Senators from \nVermont who always tried to develop that bipartisanship in foreign \npolicy. This bill appropriates additional funds for development \nassistance in microenterprise, health and education, agriculture, and \nmany other activities supported strongly on both sides of the aisle--a \nspecial fund for combating infectious diseases. I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee for that.\n  This is an area that I was particularly concerned about. We have seen \nan alarming increase in TB and other diseases that were once thought to \nbe under control, new viruses like Ebola. These pose a threat to \nAmerica. You might ask what American interest is there in that in a \nforeign aid bill. It is very simple. These funds will help monitor and \ncombat these diseases. A microbe does not stop at a border and get a \nvisa before it moves on to the next country. Microbes and viruses, \ndiseases, some of the most horrendous diseases known in our lifetime, \ntraveled freely across borders.\n  In an era where a Member of Congress does much traveling, we see how \npeople can be, for example, in Kenya and be back in Washington in a \nmatter of long hours, but it is possible to travel that way, sometimes \nperhaps arriving even a few minutes later than they might have liked, \nbut being able to arrive.\n  I should note for the Record that this reflects sort of a private \njoke between the distinguished Presiding Officer, my good friend, and \nmyself. But the point is people do travel and, unlike the old days when \nyou looked at a different continent one would never visit, now we go \nback and forth, and diseases do, too.\n  My wife, who works as a registered nurse, sees far, far more patients \nwith TB today than she had seen a decade ago. We see far more diseases \nthat we thought had disappeared popping up again. What we want to do is \nhave money in here to help us monitor countries where these diseases \nare coming up, help the world organizations most involved in this to \nisolate and quarantine and help eradicate diseases before they travel \ninto our country or other countries.\n  I also appreciate what has been done to fund IDA. Even though it is \n$950 million, it is close to and goes a long way toward meeting our \npast commitments. The same goes for UNICEF, a favorite organization of \nmine, and other U.N. agencies. We were able to provide $60 million for \nthe global environment facility. The GEF plays a central role in \nprotecting international waters and biodiversity, replacing ozone \ndepletion. It is a step in the right direction. I would like to see a \nUnited States contribution to the African Development Fund. I would \nlike to see more funds for voluntary peacekeeping, disaster relief \nprograms.\n  There were some hard choices. I point out to people that most \nprograms that did not receive full funding, and they are relatively \nfew, were distributed fairly evenly across the various accounts here.\n  I have other areas of concern, and I will speak to those when the \ntime comes.\n  I say only this in closing, Mr. President. We have a tremendous \nopportunity to influence economic and political events around the \nworld, but diplomacy costs money. It is money to support programs that \nwill in a very real way determine what kind of world our children's \ngrandchildren live in. We are the most powerful nation in the world, \nthe greatest democracy history has ever known, and we have a \nresponsibility to the rest of the world because of that. We do not live \nin isolation, and this bill helps us say that.\n  Mr. President, I do not see others seeking the floor, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the legislation now \npending before the Senate on three topics that are much different in \nnature, but I think reflect the diversity of the subject matter of this \nimportant legislation.\n\n\n                      NATO Enlargement Assistance\n\n  At the outset, let me join with my colleague, Senator Gorton of \nWashington, who has offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment in his name \nand mine, asking that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia be invited to \nbecome full NATO members at the earliest possible date. I have \naddressed this issue before on the State Department authorization, and \nit was adopted by the Senate in similar form.\n  The amendment states the sense of the Senate that Lithuania, Latvia, \nand Estonia are to be commended for their progress toward political and \neconomic reform and meeting the guidelines for prospective NATO \nmembers; that these three countries would make an outstanding \ncontribution to furthering the goals of NATO and enhancing stability, \nfreedom, and peace in Europe should they become NATO members; and they \nshould be invited to become full NATO\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nmembers at the earliest possible date. The recent NATO summit in Madrid \nresulted in the member nations inviting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic to join NATO. This was a dramatic breakthrough. I think it \nsignaled the end of the cold war and a new era in the world, with those \nwho had been our adversaries for literally decades now to become our \nallies. We are seeking, with this amendment, Senator Gorton and myself, \nto increase that number of new NATO members by at least three, by \nincluding the Baltic nations.\n  I can tell you from recent visits to Lithuania that they feel this is \nthe single most important foreign policy challenge which they face. \nThey want to make it clear that they look to the West; they share our \nvalues. They are interested in this type of NATO arrangement, which is \nnot offensive in strategy but, rather, seeks peaceful resolutions, and \nthey are hopeful that this will create a new era of opportunity for \nthem.\n  This amendment is consistent with current laws and programs, and I \nbelieve that it is one the administration can embrace. It is clearly \nnot only in our best interests in the United States, but certainly in \nthe best interests of the Baltic States, which are still in a very \nprecarious position.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Gorton for offering this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on our mutual behalf, and I am also grateful to the \nmanagers of the bill for having adopted it.\n\n\n                     International Family Planning\n\n  Mr. President, I might go on to say there is another aspect of this \nbill which is critically important for the future, not only of the \nUnited States, but of the world. I rise in support of the funding in \nthis legislation for international family planning. I can't think of a \nsingle issue more threatening to the future and stability of our world \nthan the present trends of population increase. The world's population \nincreases by about a quarter of a million people every single day, and \n95 percent of the world's population growth is in less developed \ncountries. In 1950, the world's population was 2.5 billion; today it is \n5.8 billion. In 1950, the average life expectancy worldwide was 46 \nyears; today, it is 65 years.\n  By the year 2040, if current trends continue, the world's population \nwill double. The danger of overpopulation, the problems that come with \nit--poverty, hunger and disease--will not go away if we simply ignore \nthem. We can and we must address these problems by providing family \nplanning assistance to the poorest people in the world.\n  And family planning works. Mr. President, 30 years ago the average \ncouple in the world had six children. Today, the average couple in the \nworld has four. International family planning is about giving people \naround the world, especially in the world's poorest countries, the \nability to decide the size of their own families. International family \nplanning is about eradicating poverty, hunger and disease. It is not \nabout abortion. It is about preventing abortion. It is estimated that \nunwanted pregnancies lead to 50 million abortions every year--abortions \nthat might have been prevented by family planning.\n  International family planning literally saves the lives of children \nand their mothers by increasing the time between births and helping \nwomen to avoid high-risk pregnancies. It is estimated that preventing \nclosely spaced births and pregnancies to very young mothers can save \nthe lives of 3 million babies a year. That would be a 25 percent \nreduction in worldwide child mortality.\n  International family planning makes it possible for poor nations to \nprovide better nutrition, health care and education.\n  About 6 years ago, I joined my House colleague, the late Congressman \nMike Synar of Oklahoma, on a trip to Bangladesh. It was an amazing \neducational experience. One of the poorest countries in the world, \nBangladesh seems to be living under a dark cloud. If there is a natural \ndisaster to occur, it is usually occurring in Bangladesh. And these \npoor people who eke out a living are often victimized by these \ndisasters.\n  Congressman Synar and I went into the back country where the roads \nend and we had to get out of the 4-wheel-drive and start hiking to a \nlittle village where we literally met with 50 women and their children \nwho were part of a project known as the Grameen Bank, a fascinating \nexperiment in credit for poor people which has now caught on worldwide.\n  After this meeting, one of the women came up to me and, through an \ninterpreter, spoke to me. She was holding a small baby in her arms, and \nshe said to me that she wanted to tell me something. I asked what it \nwas, through the interpreter. She wanted to tell me that, because of \nfamily planning and also because of the UNICEF and United Nations \neffort to save the lives of small children in developing countries, she \nand her husband had decided to have no more than three children. It was \na dramatic admission on her part to a pale-skinned stranger from a \ncountry she had literally never heard of.\n  Those of us who think the money that is invested in this legislation \ndoesn't do any good should take the time to visit those parts of the \nworld where it literally means life or death. For her, it meant the \nbaby in her arms would survive. In these countries, with their poor \nhealth conditions, many times unsanitary water would result in children \nwith dysentery and other intestinal problems who literally died for \nlack of hydration. The rehydration therapy, as simple and cheap as it \nis, saves these lives and gives these mothers the hope that they don't \nneed to have six children to have three survivors. And that, many \ntimes, is the driving force behind large families in poor countries.\n  So I hope those who are supporting this legislation, as I am, \nunderstand that its investment and commitment to international family \nplanning and also the children's program is money well spent, not just \nfor the humanitarian purposes which I have outlined but for very \nselfish reasons, for the future of the United States. If we start to \nstabilize world population, we can also help to stabilize political \nsituations and hope as well that we will bring that kind of quality of \nlife around the world that we enjoy in most parts of the United States \ntoday.\n\n\n                         School of the Americas\n\n  Mr. President, the final issue which I will address in this moment on \nthe floor is in relation to an amendment which I am prepared to offer \ntoday but will not. It is an amendment which has been considered time \nand again in the House but has not been considered in the Senate. I had \nthought that it was time to call up this amendment, but after \ndiscussions with my colleagues we have decided to wait until next \nyear's appropriations bill to address it.\n  What I am speaking to is a project known as the School of the \nAmericas. The School of the Americas was established over 50 years ago \nto provide military education and training to military personnel of \nCentral America, South America, and the Caribbean countries. Given the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union, the training provided at this school is no \nlonger appropriate to the long-term goals of the United States or Latin \nAmerica. This school at Fort Benning, GA, has been a training ground \nfor thousands of individuals who have been brought in from the \nmilitaries of Central and South America and the Caribbean and trained \nto become more proficient in their military ways.\n  We acknowledge the Army has tried to make changes at the School of \nthe Americas by updating curricula and improving the selection process \nfor students and the quality of teachers. Despite these efforts, it is \nmy belief that the School of the Americas should be closed. It is an \nelement in this bill which I do not support. It serves no strategic \npurpose.\n  In the post-cold-war era, we need to strengthen civilian institutions \nin Latin America, not the militaries. And the school cannot overcome \nits horrendous history and its past links to numerous military \npersonnel who have committed human rights atrocities. These admissions \nare an embarrassment to the United States and to our reputation as a \nleader in promoting human rights throughout the world.\n  The training manuals at this school as late as 1991 contained \ninstruction in torture and extortion. Imagine, U.S. taxpayers' dollars \nspent at this facility in Georgia, at a U.S. military base, to train \nforeign military leaders in torture and extortion. It is \nincomprehensible.\n  No one has been held accountable for the fact that the U.S. Army was \nteaching training techniques which clearly\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nviolated U.S. Army policy. The School of the Americas has trained \nleaders in tactics to violate human rights and has done so knowingly \nand deliberately. It is well documented that this school's graduates \nhave planned and participated in severe cases of human rights abuses \nduring the history of this institution.\n  Listen to this roster of graduates from the School of the Americas, \nfunded by taxpayers' dollars: Panamanian dictator and drug dealer \nManuel Noriega; 19 Salvadoran soldiers linked to the 1989 murder of 6 \nJesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter; El Salvador death \nsquad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson; Argentinian dictator Leopoldo \nGaltieri; 3 of the 5 officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of 4 \nUnited States churchwomen in El Salvador; and 10 of the 12 officers \nresponsible for the murder of 900 civilians in the El Salvadoran \nvillage, El Mozote.\n  Victims of these abuses often are the most vulnerable of the country, \nthe poor and Roman Catholic religious who spoke out in defense of peace \nand social justice. Given that the training manuals used at the school \nadvocated torture, blackmail and other forms of coercion, the \natrocities committed by these graduates are predictable results. The \nUnited States needs, in this post-cold war era, to find a better way to \nmoderate the abuses of Latin American militaries. Clearly, the School \nof the Americas is not the answer.\n  I think it is clear that this school needs to be closed. If an \nalternative needs to be opened, let us restructure it consistent with \nour own human rights values. I will not be offering the amendment today \nwhich would close this institution, but I want to make it clear to my \ncolleagues in the Senate and those who are listening to this debate, \nthat we will continue to monitor the School of the Americas, that we \nwill continue to make certain that they know we are watching what they \ndo and the graduates they send to lead the militaries of foreign \nnations. And we will insist, at every step of the way, that this School \nof the Americas pursue policies that are consistent with the best \ninterests and policies of the United States.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 895\n\n(Purpose: To restore to United States citizens and residents the right \n                           of travel to Cuba)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 895.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC. . TRAVEL TO CUBA.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--The President shall not restrict travel \n     to Cuba by United States citizens or other persons subject to \n     the jurisdiction of the United States, except in the case in \n     which the United States is at war, where armed hostilities \n     are in progress in or around Cuba, or where there is imminent \n     danger to the public health or the physical safety of the \n     United States travelers to Cuba.\n       (b) Supersedes Existing Law.--This section supersedes any \n     other provision of law.\n       (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section the term \n     ``United States'' includes the several States of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the \n     United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any \n     other territory or possession of the United States.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have just sent to the \ndesk is a very simple amendment that would provide that the President \nshall not restrict travel to Cuba by United States citizens and other \npeople who are lawfully subject to the jurisdiction of the United \nStates, except in circumstances where we are at war or where there are \narmed hostilities in or around Cuba, or where there is imminent danger \nto public health or physical safety of United States travelers in Cuba.\n  My own view is that our policy today, toward Cuba, is a holdover from \nthe cold war. It is an anachronism. It is out of step with the \nsentiments of the American people. And it is certainly out of step with \nthe best interests of our own country.\n  We have gotten into a situation where the only attention that is \ngiven to our relations with Cuba is that every 6 months the President \ncomes forward and once again waives certain extraterritorial provisions \nthat were part of the Helms-Burton Act that was passed last year; and \nat the same time that it waives those provisions, it assures Members of \nCongress and the Cuban-American community that it plans to maintain a \nposture of tough sanctions against Cuba. So any efforts that might be \nundertaken to promote a constructive and humanitarian engagement with \nCuba, or at least some level of humanitarian assistance to those in \nneed in Cuba, all of that has been put aside and lost, unfortunately, \nin our discussion of Cuban-American relations.\n  When the Helms-Burton Act passed the Congress, Walter Russell Mead \nwrote an article in the New Yorker that I think sums things up pretty \nwell. He said:\n\n       Fidel Castro has survived the enmity of nine American \n     Presidents. In concert with his enemies in South Florida, he \n     retains a hypnotic ability to induce stupidity in Yankee \n     policymakers. That seems unlikely to change until the U.S. \n     Government gets around to taking control of its Cuba policy \n     away from a small, self-interested lobby group.\n\n  Mr. President, I share Mr. Mead's views on this anachronistic stance \nthat we continue to take toward Cuba.\n  In my opinion, the one reason that Castro has remained entrenched and \nhas survived nine American Presidents is that he continues to be able \nto point to the United States as a menacing foreign presence and to \ncall upon the Cuban people to withstand the hardships that they have to \nwithstand because of bad intentions and actions by America, as he would \nhave it.\n  If people, including so many of my distinguished colleagues across \nthe aisle and on the Democratic side, believe in the value of Radio \nMarti and TV Marti, our broadcasting operations in Florida, which are \nintended to inform Cubans about the way of life in the United States \nand our freedoms and our liberties, then certainly increasing contact \nby allowing travel by Americans to Cuba would do even more. I think it \nis important that the administration and others realize that the Helms-\nBurton Act and this 6-month clock on issuing a waiver on the worst \nprovisions of that act not be allowed to serve as the be all and the \nend all of our Cuban policy.\n  On June 19 of this year, I joined Senator Dodd and a great many other \nSenators in writing to the President urging that direct flights to Cuba \nfor the purpose of humanitarian assistance be permitted. The subject of \nthat letter is not the subject of my amendment today. I cite that as \none example of an effort to improve constructive relations between \nourselves and Cuba and to assist in humanitarian needs that are real.\n  I do believe that one of the least justifiable aspects of our policy \ntoward Cuba today is the restrictions that we place on travel by U.S. \ncitizens and U.S. residents to that country. The right to travel is a \nconstitutional right. It is one that the courts have recognized. It is \none that we, as a country, have recognized and that we only interfere \nwith where there is a national security reason or some overriding \nnational interest that requires that we interfere with that free right \nof travel.\n  I attended a conference, Asia Pacific Forum, 2 weeks ago at the \nKennedy School in Boston. There were some Chinese leaders there and \nsome Korean leaders and some Japanese leaders, and I was struck by the \nstory that I heard from one of the Chinese leaders, the head of the \nChinese delegation. He had been one of those singled out for abuse \nduring the cultural revolution when that occurred in China a couple of \ndecades ago.\n  He was taken from his hometown, from Beijing, at that time where he \nwas a prominent leader in the university, and he was sent to a very \nremote part of China and forced to work there. He worked in a factory \nfor 10 years during the cultural revolution in a very\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nlowly position. At the end of the cultural revolution, he was allowed \nto take a more responsible position and, once again, begin to \ndemonstrate and use his talents, but he stayed in that factory for an \nadditional 5 years after the 10 years that was required during the \ncultural revolution.\n  I asked, ``Why did you stay in that part of China? Why didn't you \ncome back to Beijing?\"\n  He said, ``I didn't have a permit. I wasn't permitted to travel.'' \nYou couldn't just travel. You weren't permitted, at that time at least, \nto travel in China without a permit.\n  Mr. President, that refusal to allow people to travel is \ncharacteristic of Communist, authoritarian regimes. It is not \ncharacteristic of the United States. It should not be our policy to \nkeep American citizens and American residents from traveling, except \nwhere national security requires it. Clearly, there is no national \nsecurity justification for us continuing to prevent travel to Cuba by \nAmericans today.\n  Let me also just point out this restriction against travel is an \ninvitation to abuse. We have a lot of people in business in this \ncountry, in Canada, in Mexico and in various nearby countries who make \nit their business to facilitate travel to Cuba by United States \ncitizens.\n  We made a little search of the Web. You are supposed to search the \nWeb whenever you want to find out anything these days. So we got on the \nInternet. Here is a provision, Intra Kensington Travel. It says: ``Cuba \ntravel for U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens holding valid passports are \nwelcomed as visitors to Cuba for purposes of tourism. Many U.S. \ncitizens visit Cuba each year for this purpose.''\n  This is what the advertisement on the Web said: ``When you arrive in \nCuba, ensure that your passport is not stamped. Instead, have the Cuban \nimmigration officials stamp a separate sheet of paper and be sure to \nbring this with you, so your passport won't be stamped. To avoid \ndifficulty with U.S. Immigration and Customs authorities, do not return \nto the United States with any evidence that you have ever visited Cuba. \nThis would include cigars, rum, souvenir T-shirts, postcards, tourist \ninformation and other items.''\n  Mr. President, this restriction is not enforceable. It is being \nabused. It is an embarrassment to a great nation like ours that we have \nthis restriction in our law. I believe strongly that we should \neliminate it. The amendment I sent to the desk would do that.\n  Let me also say, though, for purposes of reality in the Senate, that \nwe have had a vote on this amendment before, essentially this same \namendment. Former Senator Simon from Illinois offered this same \namendment in the last Congress. I supported his efforts. I am sad to \nreport that we only received 25 votes for the effort to eliminate these \nrestrictions.\n  So this year, Mr. President, I would like to offer a different \namendment and see if we can't get more support. Let me, at this point, \nMr. President, withdraw my amendment and send another amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to withdraw his \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 895) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 896\n\n(Purpose: To provide for Cuban-American family humanitarian support and \n                         compassionate travel)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk and \nask that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 896.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTION OF HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,\n       (1) no person subject to U.S. law as it pertains to \n     expenditures of money in Cuba shall be prohibited from \n     sending to his or her parent, sibling, spouse, or child \n     currently residing in Cuba small amounts of money (not to \n     exceed $200 per month) to be used for the purchase of basic \n     necessities, including food, clothing, household supplies, \n     rent, medicines, and medical care;\n       (2) each person subject to U.S. law as it pertains to \n     expenditures of money in Cuba in relation to travel to Cuba \n     shall be free to travel without limitation for periods not to \n     exceed 30 days per any one trip to attend to a medical \n     emergency involving, or to attend the funeral of, such \n     person's parent, sibling, spouse, or child; and\n       (3) the United States government shall not be prohibited \n     from participating in humanitarian relief efforts of \n     multilateral organizations of which the United States is a \n     member, where such humanitarian relief efforts are made in \n     the aftermath of a natural disaster on the island of Cuba.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me describe the second of these \namendments. It says, and I will just read it. It is very short. It \nsays:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,\n       (1) no person subject to U.S. law as it pertains to \n     expenditures of money in Cuba shall be prohibited from \n     sending to his or her parent, sibling, spouse or child \n     currently residing in Cuba small amounts of money (not to \n     exceed $200 per month) to be used for the purchase of basic \n     necessities, including food, clothing, household supplies, \n     rent, medicines and medical care;\n\n  That is the first part.\n  The second part:\n\n       (2) each person subject to U.S. law as pertains to \n     expenditures of money in Cuba in relation to travel to Cuba \n     shall be free to travel without limitation for periods not to \n     exceed 30 days per any one trip to attend to a medical \n     emergency involving, or to attend the funeral of, such \n     person's parent, sibling, spouse or child . . .\n\n  Mr. President, the third part of this amendment says that:\n\n       (3) the United States Government shall not be prohibited \n     from participating in humanitarian relief efforts of \n     multilateral organizations of which the United States is a \n     member, where such humanitarian relief efforts are made in \n     the aftermath of a natural disaster on the island of Cuba.\n\n  So this amendment that is now pending before the Senate would do \nthese three things: It would allow a modest amount of funds to be sent \nby a U.S. citizen or resident to their family, for purposes of basic \nnecessities--food, clothing, supplies, rent, medicines, and medical \ncare--not to exceed $200 per month.\n  Second, it would provide this opportunity to return to Cuba for up to \n30 days, again, by someone who has a relative, a parent or a sibling or \na spouse or a child still in Cuba. And third, it would allow the United \nStates Government to participate in humanitarian relief efforts if \nthere is a natural disaster on the island of Cuba, and participate in \nthose relief efforts through multilateral organizations, not \nunilaterally, but through multilateral organizations.\n  None of these provisions threaten the national security of the United \nStates. These are extremely modest ways that we can enhance the person-\nto-person contact and humanitarian assistance which can begin to take \nUnited States-Cuban relations in a positive direction.\n  None of these provisions violate the spirit of the economic embargo \nthat we have had in place these 35 years, although I must acknowledge \nthat I think that economic embargo at this stage in our history is a \nmistake. None of what I am proposing here interferes with that economic \nembargo. None of these provisions help Castro to galvanize his public \nagainst the United States. They may very well help erode the support \nthat he has been able to maintain during this last 35 years because of \nthe failed policy that we have pursued during that entire period.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I believe it is a \nworthwhile amendment and one that would move us in a positive \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, we are coming on the end of this entire century and \nmillennium, and sooner or later we need to become realistic about the \nfact that this other nation, Cuba, is 90 miles from our border, and we \nneed to try to develop a more constructive relationship.\n  This provision would help Cuban-American citizens in particular, but \nwould begin to move us toward a constructive relationship. I urge its \nsupport, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there a vote scheduled at 2?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish to speak on this amendment?\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Not on this amendment. I have a separate amendment I \nwant to propose that the managers have agreed to. It is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to speak for a couple of minutes--I know \nthe Senator is seeking recognition--on the Smith of Oregon amendment \nbefore the vote at 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 889\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I support the Smith amendment, and I \nremind the Senate that at the time of the great upheaval in the Soviet \nUnion, when the tanks rolled into Red Square, there was a group of \npeople that was prodemocracy from throughout the world which carried \nBibles into that square and literally handed them out to the drivers of \nthe tanks which were coming into Red Square, supposedly to dislodge the \nnew government.\n  While I was chairman of the Presidential prayer group one year, I \nasked our former great symphony director, Rostropovich, to come and \ntell about his experience there. He told us of these people coming into \nthe square and handing out those Bibles.\n  What is happening now in Russia is a direct reversal of the open-door \npolicy for those people who believe that freedom of religion is an \ninternational freedom. I do believe that the Senate should go on record \nin support of the Smith amendment today. That is why I urge its \nadoption at this time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 892\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the targeting of \n assistance to support the economic and political independence of the \n           countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside so I can call up amendment No. 892.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 892.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR COUNTRIES \n                   OF THE SOUTH CAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The ancient Silk Road, once the economic lifeline of \n     Central Asia and the South Caucasus, traversed much of the \n     territory now within the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, \n     Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \n     Uzbekistan.\n       (2) Economic interdependence spurred mutual cooperation \n     among the peoples along the Silk Road and restoration of the \n     historic relationships and economic ties between those \n     peoples is an important element of ensuring their sovereignty \n     as well as the success of democratic and market reforms.\n       (3) The development of strong political and economic ties \n     between countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia and \n     the West will foster stability in the region.\n       (4) The development of open market economies and open \n     democratic systems in the countries of the South Caucasus and \n     Central Asia will provide positive incentives of \n     international private investment, increased trade, and other \n     forms of commercial interactions with the rest of the world.\n       (5) The Caspian Sea Basin, overlapping the territory of the \n     countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, contains \n     proven oil and gas reserves that may exceed \n     $4,000,000,000,000 in value.\n       (6) The region of the South Caucasus and Central Asia will \n     produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the \n     dependence of the United States on energy from the volatile \n     Persian Gulf region.\n       (7) United States foreign policy and international \n     assistance should be narrowly targeted to support the \n     economic and political independence of the countries of the \n     South Caucasus and Central Asia.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the policy of the United States in the countries of the \n     South Caucasus and Central Asia should be--\n       (1) to promote sovereignty and independence with democratic \n     government;\n       (2) to assist actively in the resolution of regional \n     conflicts;\n       (3) to promote friendly relations and economic cooperation; \n     and\n       (4) to help promote market-oriented principles and \n     practices;\n       (5) to assist in the development of infrastructure \n     necessary for communications, transportation, and energy and \n     trade on an East-West axis in order to build strong \n     international relations and commerce between those countries \n     and the stable, democratic, and market-oriented countries of \n     the Euro-Atlantic Community; and\n       (6) to support United States business interests and \n     investments in the region.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``countries of \n     the South Caucasus and Central Asia'' means Armenia, \n     Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, \n     Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this will just take a minute or two, \nbecause the managers have agreed to this particular amendment.\n  I know Senator Smith has a very important amendment that we are going \nto be voting on, which I support. I think he is in an absolute right \nposition to be stating in this amendment what our aid should be based \non.\n  I rise today to bring to the Senate's attention in a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution another strategic important region of the world that \nis also being impacted by where it sits locationwise.\n  And these are countries that are transversed by the Old Silk Road.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 889\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair states that under the previous order \nthe vote now occurs on amendment No. 889 offered by the Senator from \nOregon. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nKansas is only asking for a few minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kansas \nbe given 5 minutes, and then the votes commence then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if \nwe are going to do that, the distinguished Senator from Virginia wanted \nan equal amount of time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 889. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Is the Smith underlying amendment now the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on final passage of the energy \nand water appropriations bill, under a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I had hoped to speak briefly before this \nlast vote to explain my reasons for voting against the amendment. This \nis a politically sensitive vote, and I did not have the opportunity to \nexplain in advance.\n  I am sympathetic to the concerns of Senator Smith with regard to \nreligious minorities in Russia or anywhere else. The effect of the law \nrecently passed by the Russian Duma is to discriminate against any \nreligious group not recognized by the Soviet Government in 1982, which \nhas the effect of recognizing the rights only of Orthodox Christianity, \nIslam, Judaism, and Buddhism. This represents an onerous act of \ndiscrimination against religious minorities within the Russian \nFederation.\n  I note that if the same standard included in the Smith amendment was \napplied to all other nations, we would be forced to terminate our \nforeign aid to other key United States allies, including Israel, Egypt, \nand Turkey. These nations, along with others, could not pass the test \nincluded in the Smith amendment. This amendment, therefore, \ndiscriminates against one nation, even while it claims that \ndiscrimination is its concern. Just as Russia should apply one standard \nin the case of all religions, so should the United States apply one \nstandard in the distribution of foreign aid with all other nations.\n  Finally, I would note that there are other diplomatic methods that \ncan be used to deal with this problem. When the United States was \nconcerned about Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, we were able \nto greatly increase such emigration by using quiet diplomacy. As soon \nas the Congress enacted laws publicly attacking the Soviets on this \nmatter, emigration was sharply reduced. The Smith amendment could well \nhave the same effect, and would only make matters worse for religious \nminorities in Russia, as Nationalist elements in the Duma may react in \nanger to this action.\n  I am not a strong advocate of foreign aid. I don't carry a brief for \nRussia, and as far as believing that religion should not be \ndiscriminated against, I don't think anyone in this Chamber would feel \nmore strongly than I. But let me read to Members what the annual State \nDepartment report on human rights states in its report concerning \nIsrael.\n\n       Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, \n     Disability, Language, or Social Status.\n       Under the complex mixture of laws and regulations that \n     apply to the territories, Palestinians are disadvantaged \n     under Israeli law and practices compared with the treatment \n     received by Israeli settlers. This includes discrimination in \n     residency, land and water use, and access to health and \n     social services.\n\n  Reading from the same United States State Department report, \nconcerning religious minorities in Israel:\n\n       In civic areas where religion is a determining criterion, \n     such as the religious courts and centers of education, non-\n     Jewish institutions routinely receive less state support than \n     their Jewish counterparts. The status of a number of \n     Christian organizations with representation in Israel has \n     heretofore been defined by a collection of ad hoc \n     arrangements with various government agencies. Several of \n     these organizations are negotiating with the Government in an \n     attempt to formalize their status.\n       Attempts to establish meaningful negotiations are ongoing.\n\n  Another paragraph, under the subject of--this is very fine print, and \nI have some difficulty reading it--``National/Racial/Ethnic \nMinorities.'' The State Department report says:\n\n       The government--\n\n  Meaning the Israeli government--\n\n     does not provide Israeli Arabs, who constitute 18 percent of \n     the population, with the same quality of education, housing, \n     employment, and social services as Jews. Government efforts \n     to close the gaps between Israel's Jewish and Arab citizens \n     have resulted in an estimated 180 percent increase in \n     resources devoted to Arab communities between 1992 and 1996. \n     Nevertheless, significant differences remain.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I felt that Senators ought to know my reason, and \nI certainly want my constituents to know my reason, for voting against \nthis amendment. I wanted to call to the attention of the Senate the \nproblem here in rushing to vote on matters that we don't clearly \nunderstand when we come to the well to vote. And I have that problem as \nmuch as anybody. But it seems to me there is some inconsistency here in \nhanding out foreign aid--the American taxpayers' money.\n  If foreign aid is going to be used as an enforcer of human rights, \nthen we ought to be consistent. That is all I am saying. If we are \ngoing to be consistent, my colleagues, remember that you may be asked \none day to cut off aid to Israel, or to cut off aid to Turkey. Senators \nknow that I have fought battles on this floor here in support of \nTurkey, and so I am not saying this with any animus whatsoever toward \nthe recipient countries; that is not it. I am just calling attention to \nthe fact that we voted, in this amendment, to apply an ``enforcer,'' if \nI may use that term, concerning human rights, and it is not an enforcer \ntool that we apply consistently across the board against our friends. I \ndon't know how we can defend votes like this to the American people.\n  I feel as strongly as anyone about religion. I am not of the \nreligious right and I am not of the religious left. I don't claim even \nto be a good man. My Scripture tells me that no man is good--but this \nis another matter. And I hope that Senators know that we don't even \nhave a waiver provision in this amendment. I should think that there \nought to be a waiver--a national security waiver. The President should \nhave an opportunity to waive this provision under certain conditions. \nThat is not in this amendment. What I am saying, I certainly don't say \ncritically of the author of the amendment. My sentiments, I am sure, \nare much like his in the overall. But I think we make the mistake when \nwe vote without really understanding what we are voting on in a matter \nof this kind. This is a very politically sensitive matter. It is pretty \ndifficult to explain your vote against this kind of an amendment --\npretty difficult.\n  Finally, I note that there are other diplomatic methods that can be \nused to deal with this problem. When the United States was concerned \nabout Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union, we were able to greatly \nincrease such immigration by using quiet diplomacy. As soon as the \nCongress enacted laws publicly attacking the Soviets on that matter, \nimmigration was sharply reduced.\n  The Smith amendment could well have the same effect, and would only \nmake matters worse for religious minorities in Russia, as nationalist \nelements in the Duma may react in anger to this action.\n  Mr. President, that is the explanation of my vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n            Vitiation of Yeas and Nays on Amendment No. 888\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas \nand nays be vitiated on amendment No. 888, as now amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee regarding \nan issue that has been underscored in the House report and deserves \nsimilar recognition within this distinguished body. The issue concerns \nthe Department of Energy's program for disposition of excess weapons \nusable plutonium. This program, managed by the Department's Office of \nFissile Materials Disposition, is an important cornerstone of \ninternational efforts related to arms reduction, nonproliferation, and \nworld peace. It is a relatively new program within the Department, and \none that deserves special recognition by this body and our \nunconditional support.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the gentleman from \nWashington State and to add my request that this body go on record in \nclear support of the Department's Plutonium Disposition Program. In \nparticular, the Department should be commended for all its fine work \nleading to the January Record of Decision, which chose two options for \nthe disposition of the excess weapons plutonium. These two options--\nimmobilization and use of mixed oxide [MOx] fuel in existing \nreactors--will set the pace for parallel activities in the former \nSoviet Union. We should encourage the Department now to implement this \ndecision in an expeditious manner, for the sake of world peace and \nstability. In particular, we understand that the Department intends to \nbegin the process of selecting the suite of industrial partners that \nwill carry out the MOx Program. I look forward to the fruits \nof that labor, and strongly encourage the Department to move out \nexpeditiously. Accomplishments in this program can do a lot toward \nworld security, not to mention what it can do for DOE's image and \nreputation at home and abroad.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues for highlighting this important \nprogram before the Senate as a whole, and I add my concurrence to the \nsentiments expressed.\n  Mr. REID. I, too, appreciate the thoughtful remarks of my colleagues \nand add my support.\n\n\n                   ADVANCED HYDROPOWER TURBINE DESIGN\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yesterday the managers accepted my \namendment No. 870. The amendment will continue funding for an ongoing \nshared-cost research program for hydropower turbine design--commonly \nreferred to as the ``fish-friendly hydropower program.''\n  In the Snake and Columbia Rivers, dams and turbines generate energy \nthat fuel the Northwest economy. But while these facilities are used by \nthis Nation for a tremendous good they also are, in part, responsible \nfor the death and injury of critically endangered salmon. Some young \nsalmon on their way to the ocean pass through the slowly moving turbine \nblades. The turbulence caused by the blades can and does injure some of \nthese fish. This Nation has spent well over a billion dollars to save \nsalmon as a result of the Endangered Species Act. Stocks of salmon \ncontinue to decline causing some to suggest removing the dams \naltogether. In light of this it seems amazing that we are in the \nprocess of removing funding from a promising technology that will save \nsalmon and improve the efficiency of this renewable energy resource.\n  Phase I of the project--the conceptual/engineering designs--has been \ncompleted. Phase II needs to be funded for us to realize the benefits \nof the money already spent, and to provide the Nation with modern, \nenvironmentally sound technology.\n  We simply can no longer afford to use 50-year-old hydropower \ntechnology in a 21st century energy environment. We must learn to \nbalance our environmental concerns with safe and clean energy \ndevelopment.\n  Preliminary work indicates that a well-focused R program can \nachieve major innovations in the design of environmentally sound \nhydropower turbines. For the last several years we have been pursuing a \nprogram funded by the hydropower industry with a modest contribution \nfrom energy and water development appropriations. This amendment will \ncontinue that program into the development of a biological design.\n  The U.S. hydropower industry raised $500,000 of its own funds to \ninvest in phase I of this program. They can be expected to continue to \ncontribute to this program in phase II.\n  Hydropower is the Nation's leading renewable energy source, producing \n85 percent of the U.S. renewable energy capacity and 13 percent of all \nU.S. electric generation. In the Pacific Northwest States of Montana, \nIdaho, Oregon, and Washington 60 percent of electrical usage depends on \nhydropower. In the South and Northeast, hydropower remains an integral \npart of electrical energy supplies. The Clinton administration's \nclimate change action plan identified a continued and expanding role \nfor emission free hydropower in sustainable development. With proper \nsiting and sound technology, the Department of Energy estimates \nhydropower can increase U.S. energy independence and opportunities for \nsustainable development in the United States and worldwide. With over \n100 hydro facilities being relicensed over the next decade, the \ndevelopment of an alternative technology will be essential to \nmaintaining electric generating capacity.\n  This is not the time to end a promising, environmentally sound and \ntechnologically efficient tool in our Nation's energy arsenal. We \ncannot in good conscience end funding for this program while the \nnumbers of salmon stocks remain at their critically low levels.\n\n\n                       TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Tennessee Valley Authority was \ncreated as part of the New Deal to bring economic development and \nelectricity to the Tennessee Valley. Much has changed since the 1930's. \nFortunately, rural Americans now enjoy electricity, and the economy of \nthe Tennessee Valley has improved significantly. That region's economy, \nin fact, is doing quite well and now is home to industry and businesses \nlike Saturn Automotive and Gateway Computer. It's time for TVA to \nchange, too.\n  Over the past six decades, TVA has become, by its own measure, the \nNation's largest electric utility company, providing some of the \ncheapest electricity in the Nation. TVA's current managers are trying \naggressively to prepare this giant government-owned utility for the \ncompetition that may result from deregulation. Earlier this year, in \ntestimony before the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee, TVA's Chairman argued that, in order to help prepare for \nthis competition, the direct Federal appropriation to TVA should end. \nIn fact, he stated, ``With your help, we can end taxpayer funding of \nTVA appropriated programs and begin a new era for TVA.'' It is my \nunderstanding that the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee has voted to codify that request.\n  Reforming TVA should no longer be a controversial activity. More and \nmore lawmakers have introduced bills to re-think the giant agency as we \nlook toward a deregulated electricity industry and a balanced Federal \nbudget. Even TVA's Chair, as mentioned before, has stated that the \nagency should forego its $106 million annual appropriation. TVA's \nformer chief financial officer has gone further, arguing that the \nFederal Government should sell TVA. Sale, he argues, would generate big \nsavings for taxpayers; reduce the Federal debt; provide a model for \nprivatization; and move one of the largest electric companies out from \nunder the burden of Federal bureaucracy into the private sector, where \nit would pay taxes.\n  Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues who will sit on the \nconference committee to take a first step toward reforming TVA by \neliminating the agency's entire appropriation. I also urge my \ncolleagues to consider more substantial changes to TVA in the context \nof reducing taxpayer subsidies and opening the electricity market to \ntrue competition.\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope all Senators will support the work \nof Senator Domenici and Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, ``Shall the bill pass?'' The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nthere was a mistake in the remarks. There was going to be 15 minutes on \neach side, and the request was for 15 minutes equally divided. I wanted \nto clarify.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \namendment has been agreed to on both sides. It provides that the \nadditional $14 million appropriated to relieve the KEDO debt not be \navailable until the Secretary of State certificates that North Korea \nhas not violated the military armistice agreement of 1953 during the \npreceding 9 months.\n  Basically, the amendment puts North Korea on notice that additional \nfunds will not be available if North Korea commits another violation \nlike the incident this morning at the DMZ.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 892\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 892.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nto S. 955.\n  This amendment deals with the United States policy for the south \nCaucasus and Central Asia, an area of the world that was once \ncrisscrossed by the ancient Silk Road, which includes the countries--I \nhave a map here for Senators to be able to look at--of Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \nand Uzbekistan. This amendment deals with these countries.\n  These countries are very vital and important countries at a \ncrossroads in their development. They are, as I mentioned, along the \nancient Silk Road, if people can imagine and conjure up those images of \nthat area of the world and the importance it has had in the past and \nthe importance it now has and will continue to have for U.S. policy. We \nhave vital political, social and economic interests there, and they \nneed to be acted on before it is too late.\n  They are independent for the first time in almost a century. They are \nlocated at the juncture of many of today's major world forces, and they \nare all rich in natural resources. And they are looking west for the \nfirst time. They are emerging after nearly a century of being plundered \nby a Communist regime. While actively taking out their resources, the \nSoviets put little back. These countries now find themselves free to \ngovern themselves.\n  Again, as I stated earlier, they are looking west. The very fact that \nthey have had little experience with independence, and that their \neconomies are essentially starting from scratch, leaves them in a \nprecarious situation, which is all the more precarious because of their \ngeographic location.\n  Consider this: They are placed between the empire from which they \nrecently declared independence and an extremist Islamic regime to the\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nsouth--both of which have a strong interest in exerting economic and \npolitical pressure upon them.\n  All of the Silk Road countries are currently seeking U.S. investment \nand encouragement, and are looking to us to participate actively in \nworking out regional political, economic and strategic cooperation.\n  Mr. President, we should be actively responding to their appeals. We \nhave now the opportunity to spread freedom and democratic ideals in a \nregion historically dominated by Russia and Iran. The doors are open to \npromote institutions of democratic government and create the conditions \nfor the growth of pluralistic societies and religious tolerance. These \ncountries are a major force in containing the spread northward of anti-\nWestern Islamic extremism. So far, these nations remain largely open to \nus.\n  I would also like to point out something else that is important about \nthis region: that is the Caspian Sea overlapping the territory of the \nSouth Caucasus and Central Asia that is rich in natural resources as I \nmentioned earlier.\n  I have another chart here I would like to show you to illustrate the \nenergy resources which exist in the Caspian Sea area right here. If \npeople would look at this chart, this is ``Worldwide Undiscovered \nResource Potential of Oil and Gas''. You have the Middle East and \nRussia, the two leaders, and then the Caspian Sea area is potentially \nthe third largest in the world, some say up to $4 trillion worth of oil \nand gas in this region, creating significant interest for economic ties \nand investments as well. The United States should do everything \npossible to promote the sovereignty and independence as well as \nencourage solid diplomatic and economic cooperation between these \nnations.\n  In order to do that, we need to take a number of positive steps. No. \n1, we should be strong and active in helping resolve local conflicts. \nNo. 2, we should be providing economic assistance to provide positive \nincentives for international private investment and increased trade. \nNo. 3, we should be assisting in the development of the infrastructure \nnecessary for communication, transportation, energy and trade on an \nEast-West access. No. 4, we should be providing assistance to help \nfight the scourge of narcotics trafficking, weapons of mass \ndestruction, organized crime and No. 5, perhaps the most important of \nall, we should be supplying all the assistance possible to strengthen \ndemocracy and tolerance and the development of civil society.\n  These are the best ways to remain sure that these countries will grow \nin independence and move strongly toward open and free government. Our \ntime to focus on this region is now, to keep them from spreading into \nan area or being infiltrated by the spread of the anti-Western \nfundamentalism that is in this region of the world. That is why I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I believe it has been worked out with both the majority and the \nminority staff to agree to this amendment. I ask that the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 884, as modified\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment 884 \nand send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 884, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROMOTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Reports.--Not later than March 30, 1998, and each \n     subsequent year thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the International Relations Committee of the House \n     of Representatives and the Foreign Relations Committee of the \n     Senate an annual report on religious persecution on a \n     country-by-country basis. Reports shall include a list of \n     individuals who have been materially involved in the \n     commission of acts of persecution that are motivated by a \n     person's religion.\n       (b) Prisoner Information Registry.--The Secretary of State \n     shall establish a Prisoner Information Registry which shall \n     provide information on all political prisoners, prisoners of \n     conscience, and prisoners of faith on a country-by-country \n     basis. Such information shall include the charges, judicial \n     processes, administrative actions, use of forced labor, \n     incidences of torture, length of imprisonment, physical and \n     health conditions, and other matters related to the \n     incarceration of such prisoners. The Secretary of State is \n     authorized to make funds available to nongovernmental \n     organizations presently engage in monitoring activities \n     regarding such prisoners to assist in the creation and \n     maintenance of the registry.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Concerning Establishment of a \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia.--It is the \n     sense of the Congress that Congress, the President, and the \n     Secretary of State should work with the governments of the \n     People's Republic of China and other countries to establish a \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia which would be \n     modeled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe.\n\n     SEC.   . UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO \n                   MONITORING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND RELIGIOUS \n                   PERSECUTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall devote additional \n     personnel and resources to gathering intelligence information \n     regarding human rights abuses and acts of religious \n     persecution.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than March 30, 1998, the President \n     shall submit to the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate a report on the \n     number of personnel and resources that are being devoted to \n     gathering intelligence information regarding human rights \n     abuses and acts of religious persecution.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthis bill that would require the Clinton administration to improve the \nmanner in which the State Department and our intelligence agencies \nmonitor and publicize cases of religious persecution and human rights \nabuses.\n  Persecution of people of faith has been on the rise around the world. \nGovernments throughout the world have been denying people the \nfundamental right of freedom of religion, a fundamental right upon \nwhich this country was built.\n  As a matter of policy, the United States should be doing all it can \nto bring religious persecution and other human rights violations to an \nend. One problem we face, however, is that we do not have an accurate \naccounting of the extent to which many governments persecute people of \nfaith. We do not know the number of prisoners nor do we even have all \nthe names of those prisoners. What we need is an accurate accounting of \nreligious persecution. We need the administration to devote greater \nresources to monitoring religious persecution and to informing the \nCongress, as well as the American people, about such instances.\n  We also need to encourage a formal dialog with countries throughout \nthe world to bring religious persecution to an end. Specifically, my \namendment would do the following: Require a religious persecution \nreport modeled on the State Department human rights report; require the \nestablishment of a prison information registry; require the President \nto devote greater intelligence resources to gathering information \nregarding human rights abuses and acts of religious persecution; and \nencourage the administration to work with other nations to establish a \nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled \nafter the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Government has a responsibility to provide \nthe public a better understanding of the extent to which nations \nviolate this basic right of their citizens. My amendment would move us \nin this direction. I ask that my amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 884), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is in the Chamber. I understand she has an amendment that \nmay not take a good deal of time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 897\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be very brief. The work has been done on this \namendment. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Allard, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n     Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered 897.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n\n                         wildlife conservation\n\n       Sec.   . Of the funds appropriated by this Act, not more \n     than $2,900,000 may be made available for the Communal Areas \n     Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) in \n     Zimbabwe: Provided, That none of the funds appropriated by \n     this Act may be used to directly finance the trophy hunting \n     of elephants or other endangered species as defined in the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Flora and Fauna (CITES) or the Endangered Species Act: \n     Provided further, That the funds appropriated by this Act \n     that are provided under the CAMPFIRE program may not be used \n     for activities with the express intent to lobby or otherwise \n     influence international conventions or treaties, or United \n     States government decision makers: Provided further, That \n     funds appropriated by this Act that are made available for \n     the CAMPFIRE program may be used only in Zimbabwe for the \n     purpose of maximizing benefits to rural people while \n     strengthening natural resources management institutions: \n     Provided further, That not later than March 1, 1998, the \n     Administrator of the Agency for International Development \n     shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional \n     committees describing the steps taken to implement the \n     CAMPFIRE program, the impact of the program on the people and \n     wildlife of CAMPFIRE districts, alternatives to trophy \n     hunting as a means of generating income for CAMPFIRE \n     districts, and a description of how funds made available for \n     CAMPFIRE in fiscal year 1998 are to be used.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The amendment that I have sent to the desk is a \nbipartisan amendment cosponsored by Senators Allard, Smith, Leahy, and \nTorricelli, and it concerns the CAMPFIRE Program in Zimbabwe. I \nparticularly want to pay tribute to my colleagues, Senators Allard and \nSmith, for being so strong on this subject. I thank my staff and the \nstaffs of the chairman and ranking member for working on a good \namendment that we can all agree on. I am particularly grateful to \nSenators Leahy and McConnell for their assistance and cooperation on \nthis amendment.\n  Briefly, our amendment would maintain the positive aspects of the \nCAMPFIRE Program while restricting U.S. taxpayer funds being used for \nactivities which are inconsistent with the goals of sustainable \ndevelopment for people and management of natural resources.\n  My amendment would assure that no taxpayer money is used to finance \nthe trophy hunting of elephants and other endangered species or no \ntaxpayer money could be used for any lobbying activities to weaken \nelephant protection standards. So we really basically do two things: \nTaxpayer dollars from America cannot be used to foster trophy hunting \nin Zimbabwe and taxpayer money cannot be used to lobby Senators or \nHouse Members or administration people to weaken elephant protection \nstandards such as the ban on ivory.\n  Mr. President, these magnificent animals should be protected, not \nexploited. Our amendment requires USAID to submit a report to Congress \non alternatives to trophy hunting and the impact of the CAMPFIRE \nProgram on people and wildlife of Zimbabwe. I think these are very \nimportant steps in addressing the criticism about the way the program \nworks. Some of us would have liked to have gone further than this, but \nwe think that this amendment, the way it is drawn, will receive \nunanimous support, and we think is an important step to be taken.\n  The CAMPFIRE Program is beneficial to many rural impoverished people \nin Zimbabwe. It helps to provide the skills and tools necessary to \nenable local communities to make local decisions about how to manage \ntheir natural resources and generate revenue.\n  However, there are certain aspects of the program which do not \npromote sustainable development for rural people or improve natural \nresource management. My amendment restricts United States taxpayer \ndollars from being spent on those needless activities and directs all \nfunds to be used to maximize benefits to rural people while \nstrengthening natural resources management institutions in Zimbabwe.\n  I am aware that there have been many concerns raised about the trophy \nhunting aspects of the program. I do not support trophy hunting and I \ndo not believe that one penny of taxpayer money should be used to \nfinance trophy hunting. My amendment will ensure that no U.S. taxpayer \ndollars are directly spent on trophy hunting activities.\n  However, I do recognize that trophy hunting will continue in \nZimbabwe. I believe that we need to provide countries like Zimbabwe \nwith viable alternatives to trophy hunting which continue to generate \nincome and promote sustainable development without involving the \nconsumptive use of wildlife. My amendment requires USAID to submit a \nreport to Congress providing alternatives to trophy hunting, and the \nimpact of the program on the people and wildlife of CAMPFIRE districts.\n  People in Zimbabwe are living under very different conditions than we \nin the United States. We must recognize these differences in our \napproach to development while maintaining our high values and ideals. \nThe CAMPFIRE Program in Zimbabwe will end in 1999, but USAID-funded \ndevelopment programs will continue for years to come. I am hopeful that \nthe report which USAID will submit to Congress, will provide the United \nStates with ideas for income diversification for future programs so \nthat we can move away from the consumptive use of wildlife as a \nmanagement regime.\n  USAID has proposed several improvements to the CAMPFIRE Program in \nrecent months. These improvements are the result of the concerns raised \nby many concerned citizens and organizations such as the Humane Society \nof the United States. I commend the Humane Society for their efforts to \nmake the United States more responsible for the use of taxpayer \ndollars. I also applaud USAID for taking steps to address these \nconcerns. I believe that this process has been beneficial for all of \nthose involved--especially the people and wildlife of Zimbabwe.\n  I want to thank Senators Leahy, Smith, Allard, and Torricelli for \nhelping to make this a bipartisan effort toward improving development \naid, maximizing benefits to local people, promoting a healthy elephant \npopulation, and ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money is used wisely.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating \nChairman McConnell and Senator Leahy for their hard work in crafting \nthis legislation and working to include language on the CAMPFIRE \nProgram in the bill.\n  Mr. President, as I have made very clear in the past, I am a strong \nsupporter of fiscal responsibility on the part of the Federal \nGovernment. It is our responsibility to use taxpayer's dollars in the \nmost effective, and efficient way possible. This responsibility at \ntimes mandates that we review and question just where our tax dollars \nare going.\n  When USAID's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous \nResources or CAMPFIRE Program was first brought to my attention, I had \nto ask myself, just why are United States taxpayer's dollars being \nspent to fund big game hunting of elephants in Zimbabwe? If a program \ncould spend dollars to hunt elephants how else are they spending our \nmoney? Asking myself these questions was not enough, so I began a \ncomprehensive review of the CAMPFIRE Program.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to announce, that as a result of \ncongressional review a little more fiscal responsibility has been \nrestored to the\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nU.S. Government. Our review of CAMPFIRE has produced three highly \nbeneficial results.\n  First of all, fiscal year 1998 will be the last year that the \nCAMPFIRE project will receive funding. This will end the cycle of \nappropriations that has already lead to $28 million being spent on this \nprogram. This amount, though small in respect to the overall budget, is \na good start to tightening up Government spending, especially U.S. \nfunding for international projects.\n  Second, the appropriations language states that no U.S. tax dollars \nwill go to directly fund the big game trophy hunting of Zimbabwe's \nelephants. I think we can agree that an endangered species such as the \nelephant should not be hunted with the tacit consent of the U.S. \ntaxpayer through governmental funding.\n  Finally, for the remaining time CAMPFIRE is funded, USAID must submit \nto Congress the steps they have taken to implement the CAMPFIRE \nProgram. This will allow us to watch their use of our dollars. For far \ntoo long the U.S. has funded international programs with little or no \noversight--this will serve as an example of how Congress should police \ninternational funding measures.\n  Mr. President, I support the Foreign Operations Subcommittee's \nappropriations for fiscal year 1998 of the CAMPFIRE Program, with the \nunderstanding that this is the last year of the program, USAID submit \ninformation on how they implement the program, and no U.S. tax dollars \nwill be spent to kill elephants. Now that we have ended the CAMPFIRE \nProgram, it is my hope that we will not have to revisit this issue \nagain in the future.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Boxer and \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire for their help in drafting this \nlanguage.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that the Communal Areas Management \nProgram for Indigenous Resources [CAMPFIRE] Program in Zimbabwe is \ncurrently meeting all of the conditions placed on it by the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my further understanding that Zimbabwe has a very \nsuccessful elephant conservation program has had led to a population \nincrease of 43,000 elephants in 1987 to 67,000 elephants in 1996 and \nthat much of this success is due to the CAMPFIRE Program.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my further understanding that the language in this \namendment dealing with trophy hunting is only a prohibition on a direct \nUSAID subsidy of hunting in the CAMPFIRE Program and should not be \ninterpreted as a negative statement about the indispensable role \nhunting plays as a management tool for elephants and other foreign \nspecies.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Finally, it is my understanding that nothing in this \namendment should be interpreted as having any effect on any other U.S. \nlaw or regulation regarding wildlife conservation and hunting.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I rescind that request. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 897) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n    (Purpose: To decrease the amount of funds available to OPIC for \nadministrative expenses to carry out the credit and insurance programs)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, now under the informal order that we \nhave here going from side to side, the Senator from Colorado is here.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 891.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, the Senator is going to \ndescribe what the amendment is, I assume.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We shared a copy of that amendment. I think you have it. \nI will explain it in my remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do not have any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 22, strike ``$32,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$21,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  Before I begin, I commend my friends, the subcommittee chairman, \nMitch McConnell, and Senator Patrick Leahy and chairman Ted Stevens and \nSenator Robert Byrd, for a very good bill. I support the bill. I \nbelieve its overall funding levels are very appropriate, and I plan on \nsupporting it.\n  However, I have one concern. My amendment is very simple. It strikes \nthe $32 million for administrative expenses for the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation and scales it back to its 1994 level of $21 \nmillion.\n  Now, why was the year 1994 selected? In 1994, with Public Law 103-\n392, OPIC's congressional authorized lending authority was last raised. \nThis increased the maximum contingent liability or lending authority \ncap for insurance from $9 billion to $13.5 billion and increased the \ncontingent liability cap for financing from $2.5 billion to $9.5 \nmillion. However, since 1994, there have been no increases in the \nauthorized lending cap for OPIC. As a matter of fact, I have recently \nlearned that while at the end of 1996 OPIC's liability exposure has \nincreased, their total number of issuances has decreased.\n  Now, in 1995, 1996 and 1997, OPIC's administrative expense \nappropriations have increased. In 1994, their administrative expense \nwas $20.2 million; in 1995, their administrative expense was $25.8 \nmillion; in 1996, their administrative cost was $21.8 million, and in \n1997 their administrative costs again increased to $32 million, while \ntheir cap was not increased one dime. In fact, there is a zero percent \nincrease since 1994.\n  Now, their administrative appropriation over the same period has \nincreased $12 million--over the last 3 years--resulting in a 50-percent \nincrease.\n  Now, why should OPIC's administrative appropriation increase while \ntheir lending authority cap has stayed frozen? As I stated earlier, in \nreality their issuances have declined. While the $32 million in this \nbill is a freeze as of 1996--and I commend the committee for doing \nthis, by the way--I believe it would be very appropriate to scale them \nback to the 1994 level.\n  All this is occurring while the future of OPIC is very much \nuncertain. On September 30, 1997, OPIC's authorization ends. As of \ntoday, I do not believe the Senate has a reauthorization bill for OPIC. \nFrom my understanding, the House of Representatives is just beginning \nthe process of reauthorization and, in the report for the companion \nforeign operations appropriations bill, it states they are reluctant in \nthe absence of an authorization bill to fund OPIC. I believe this \nnumber is enough to administer their outstanding liabilities, but there \nis still great uncertainly as to what the future holds for OPIC. If \nreauthorization does occur, then we can come back to this issue at a \nlater date.\n  This amendment is not the place, nor do I plan to argue the specific \npros and cons of OPIC, for that will come at a future date if we have a \nreauthorization bill. I plan to be involved in the debate at that time \nif that comes up. But this amendment is a matter of whether an agency, \na Government entity, that depends on the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States, with Federal employees, should have their administrative \nexpenses increased by 50 percent over the last 3 years while their \nauthorized lending cap is not increased by one dime, zero percent.\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n  Make no mistake, OPIC is a Federal agency. It needs the United States \nto fund its operation. This Congress should always be concerned when an \nagency staff grows faster than its authority. I know of very few \nagencies that have no growth in authority which get a 50-percent \nincrease in administrative expenses. It seems, if we are at all serious \nabout reducing the size and scope of Government and take our oversight \nrole seriously, then all agencies should play by the same rules, and we \nas a Congress should apply these rules evenly to all agencies. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and keep the growth of OPIC at a \nminimum, especially when their authorized cap has been frozen since \n1994 and with their authorization expiring in September 1997.\n  Mr. President, I reserve my right to address the Senate and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to reflect a little on what my \nfriend and neighbor--literally my neighbor--from Colorado has talked \nabout here in the last few minutes regarding OPIC. First, I rise to \noppose my friend, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, regarding \nhis amendment. I will explain why.\n  Before I came to this body, I was a businessman, a small businessman. \nOver the last 15 years, my partners and I founded a number of \ncompanies. A number of those companies were international companies. I \nhave dealt with OPIC directly. I understand a little bit about, I \nthink, the real world, how jobs are created, how you must market in the \ninternational community, what kind of competition is out there against \na little company like mine that has to go toe to toe with foreign \ncompetitors all over the globe.\n  One of the things I learned very quickly was when you go toe to toe \nwith international competitors, whether it is telecommunications--which \nI know a little something about--or any other industry, the support \nthat comes with your competitor, from his government, his country, is \nrather significant. I think that is important in this debate. As my \nfriend, Senator Allard, said, we will have an opportunity to truly \ndebate this issue over the next few months. But I would like to make a \ncouple of points that I think are very relevant to OPIC, what OPIC \ndoes, what it represents. Again, I come at this, not as a U.S. Senator; \nI come at this as someone who understands a little bit about how this \nworks and who has been out in the real world in over 60 countries and \ndone business in about 20 of them.\n  First, I am concerned that an amendment like that of my friend, to \nslash administrative expenses, could lead to the very point that he is \nconcerned with. It is a good point. If you slash administrative \nexpenses for OPIC, the likelihood is the quality of the portfolio of \nOPIC, the quality of investments that OPIC has made and will continue \nto make, will suffer. I think it would cut directly to eliminating the \nability to monitor those loan portfolios. I do not think that is in the \nbest interests of the American taxpayer or anyone associated with OPIC. \nIt endangers the creditworthiness of OPIC if you slash their \nadministrative budget.\n  Let me hit just a few very specific points as to what OPIC does. \nThere is an awful lot of sound and fury and smoke and mirrors when it \ncomes to OPIC. First, OPIC, in fact, does level the playing field in \nglobal competition. I spoke to that earlier. All of America's major \ntrade competitors have OPIC-like agencies to help them. It covers the \ngaps in the markets all over this world.\n  OPIC creates American jobs. I have a document here--I am sure Senator \nAllard has seen it--of the kind of jobs created in Colorado, his home \nState, and in my home State of Nebraska; the kind of revenues that flow \ninto Colorado because of countries that buy from companies that have \neither OPIC insurance that they pay for, or OPIC loans that they pay \nfor. This is a job creator. This is a growth creator. To give some of \nthe specific numbers on this, since 1971 OPIC has supported $108 \nbillion worth of U.S. projects resulting in over 250,000 new American \njobs and $53 billion in new American exports. OPIC is prohibited under \nlaw from supporting any project that would result in the loss of one \nsingle American job.\n  Two, OPIC does not cost the taxpayers money. In fact, every year OPIC \nreturns to the U.S. Treasury--last year $209 million. OPIC requires no \nappropriation of funds. Its operations are entirely funded by the \nmarket-rate fees it charges businesses. There is some myth about this. \nIf you want an OPIC loan or guarantee or insurance, you pay for it. \nThis isn't a free deal. OPIC is not corporate welfare. I am always \namused, and I am a conservative Republican--let me tell you, I am for \nless Government and cutting Government and cutting taxes. But I am \nalways amused when I ask my colleagues, what do you mean corporate \nwelfare? What is corporate welfare?\n\n  No American business receives any subsidy or free benefit from OPIC. \nAll OPIC loans must be paid in full. OPIC charges full market rates \nand, where applicable, high-risk-based interest rates and insurance \npremiums for all of its services. Remember, OPIC returns money to the \nTreasury through the fees it charges firms that use its services.\n  OPIC has a strong record. Let's not overlook this. It has \nextraordinarily low default rates, less than 1 percent since 1971. OPIC \nmaintains a well-diversified portfolio by region, by sector, by \nindustry, and maintains $2.7 billion in reserves. We have talked about \nthe possibility of privatizing OPIC. Last year J.P. Morgan looked at \nit, made a study. It won't work that way. Let me tell you, when you are \na small company, a small business like I had, to try to compete with \nthe big guys from France and Germany and Britain--all over the globe--\nto be able to have some base of your country behind you, and you pay \nfor that, is significant.\n  The last point I will make, OPIC supports small business. There is a \nlot of myth about that as well, that this is a big-business boondoggle. \nIt is not. I am living proof of that. In 1996, OPIC supported record \nnumbers of small business projects worth $1.8 billion in 17 countries. \nMany small American businesses are suppliers to the larger exporters \nthat indirectly come through OPIC. More than half of all suppliers to \nOPIC-based projects are small businesses. This is a ripple effect. When \nwe get projects and deals internationally, you have to sponsor those. \nYou buy products to support those. And those come from States like that \nof my friend from Colorado and Nebraska and every State in the Union. \nSo this is a ripple-effect operation.\n  Mr. President, again, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I think \nit is shortsighted and I think the wisest thing to do is to continue \nwith our funding, with our authorization, and as I said earlier, we \nwill have ample opportunity to address this issue in debate. But I \ndon't think a hit-and-run way to approach this with an amendment is the \ncorrect way to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nebraska \nfor his comments about OPIC. With all due respect to our colleague from \nColorado, I, too, oppose the amendment. OPIC does not cost a single \ntaxpayer dollar. OPIC is required by law to operate on a self-\nsustaining basis. Since 1971, it has reimbursed the U.S. Government for \nevery dollar it has received and has reported positive net income every \nyear since its inception. As the Senator from Nebraska pointed out, \nlast year it returned $209 million to the Treasury. OPIC creates \nAmerican jobs and exports. All major U.S. economic competitors have \nsimilar export promotion agencies. Scuttling OPIC would put our \ncompanies at an even further disadvantage than they already are.\n  Today, for example, at least 36 percent of Japan's exports enjoy \nGovernment subsidies compared with just 2 percent of American exports. \nIn addition, Japan and France provide 77 percent of the total amount of \nexport subsidies made available around the world.\n  As Senator Hagel pointed out, that is what American businesses \ntypically are up against in the international market. OPIC is not \ncorporate welfare. OPIC charges market and risk-based interest rates \nand fees for all of its services, and all loans must be paid in full. \nAll clients must pass industry standard and OPIC policy reviews. This \nis an agency that has functioned very\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\nwell in behalf of American interests and is actually returning money to \nthe American Treasury. OPIC strongly supports small business, which is \nthe heart of America's economic engine. The source of 6 out of every 10 \njobs in this country is directly attributable to small business.\n  We have had this amendment every year and so far have been able to \ndefeat it. I certainly hope we will be able to again, because OPIC is \nan important part of what makes American business competitive overseas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska in opposing this \namendment. I, too, would note that OPIC does return money to the \nTreasury--the figure $209 million last year was used here. More \nimportant, it creates jobs in America.\n  I represent, in population, the second smallest State in the Union. \nOPIC is used in my State. It creates jobs, it creates exports, it helps \nour balance of payments. When you go to the larger States, of course, \nthe dollar amount is just that much greater.\n  I do not know a business in my State that has turned to OPIC that has \nnot received enormous help. I remember when the former Director of OPIC \ncame to Vermont. She held a meeting there. We had lines going out the \ndoor; business people wanting to work with OPIC. It is one of those \nsuccess stories.\n  It is also an area where we have to have the kind of tools that all \nour competitors have. We are in worldwide markets. We can no longer \njust rely on New Hampshire selling to Vermont, Vermont selling to New \nHampshire, as an example. I say that seeing my good friend from New \nHampshire is the distinguished Presiding Officer. We export way beyond \nour States, way beyond the borders of our Nation. But, every other \nFirst World--and a lot that go beyond the First World--country does the \nsame. If they are a major exporter, as we are, there are boards like \nOPIC that help them.\n  Are there things that can be done better or different than OPIC? \nPossibly. But I ask the authorizing committee to look at that.\n  There will be an authorizing bill on OPIC. I am perfectly willing to \nlisten to the recommendations of my friends on both sides of the aisle.\n  We felt, the Senator from Kentucky and myself--he as chairman and I \nas ranking member--in looking at these figures for OPIC that the \namounts made sense. There certainly was unanimous concurrence of \nRepublicans and Democrats on our subcommittee and in the full committee \nfor the same reason.\n  If an authorizing bill comes through and changes that, it can change \nit. This money doesn't have to be spent and an authorizing bill can \nmake a difference. I suspect with such an authorizing bill, you are \ngoing to hear success story after success story from States all over \nthe Nation helped by OPIC.\n  So I hope my good friend from Colorado will withhold this amendment \nand let it be a matter to be discussed with the authorizing committee, \nbut not on this appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to have an opportunity to \nmake some summarizing comments and then, if there are not any other \nstatements, I will make a closing statement.\n  I would like to respond by saying it is true that there is some extra \nrevenue that has come into OPIC, but the fact is that that is interest \nthat they have earned, and OPIC itself, in saying how much more income \nit could generate, said if we could get away from having to buy \nTreasury bonds and invest in the stock market, we could generate more \nincome.\n  To me, that sends a signal that we would be better off in the private \nsector. A lot of these businessmen have an opportunity to go to the \nprivate sector, go to the stock market to fund these projects overseas. \nAnd I am a small businessman, too, by the way. I started my business \nfrom scratch, but I think as business people, sometimes it is all too \neasy to turn to the agencies for help. We need to encourage business \npeople to turn to the market and to focus on what they can do to meet \nthe needs of the market. After all, this is an agency. It is a \nGovernment-run agency that is picking winners and losers. I would feel \nmuch more comfortable having a competitive market system picking \nwinners and losers.\n  Many States, like the State of Colorado which I am from, have done a \nlot to promote foreign competition, but they have done it on their own. \nMost of the jobs and the new growth that has happened in Colorado has \nnot been the result of OPIC. So I think we have to be careful and not \ngive too much credit to this particular Federal agency.\n  Let me end by just stating, again, a few historical facts. In 1971, \nOPIC's administrative budget was $3.2 million. In 1981, it was $7.5 \nmillion. In 1988, it was $12 million. And in 1992, it was $16.4 \nmillion.\n  In 1996, their administrative appropriation was $28.1 million, and in \n1997, it was $32 million. Also, according to OPIC, in 1988, their \nFTE's, or full-time equivalent employment ceiling, was 125. In 1992, it \nwas 155, and in 1996, it was 182. As these historical numbers from OPIC \npoint out, this is not some sleeping agency, but one whose \nadministrative costs and employment have increased substantially.\n  If we take the 1996 number of employees and divide it into the 1996 \nadministrative costs, it comes to $154,000 per employee. Now, I realize \nthat not all this goes to employees' salaries, but also to normal \noffice supplies and other office expenses that go to support each one \nof those FTE positions.\n  But here is the problem. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for \ncontinuing increase in the administrative budget when their liability \ncap is frozen. Also, as I and my staff have searched their records, I \nhave yet to find a clear delineation of where their administration \nbudget goes.\n  All I do know is that in this $32 million, and I quote from the bill, \n``any project-specific transaction costs, including direct and indirect \ncosts incurred in claims settlements, and other direct costs associated \nwith service provided to specific investors or potential investors \npursuant to section 234 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, shall \nnot,'' again, ``shall not be considered administrative expenses for the \npurpose of this heading.''\n  I question what these expenses are and where they go. I cannot find \nthem listed in their reports or from any correspondence. Oversight is a \nproper function of Congress, and we should pursue it vigorously.\n  While I may have some problems with OPIC, Mr. President, I do want to \ncommend them for being prompt and professional in their manner of \ndealing with my inquiries, and I take my hat off to them for this.\n  Again, I reiterate, this amendment is not about OPIC and whether they \nshould continue, because we will get to that later. But this is an \nargument of whether a U.S. Government agency should have a 50-percent \nincrease in administrative expenses since 1994 when their \ncongressionally mandated lending authority has been frozen during that \nsame period. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask for \nlimited growth in all agencies.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with the concurrence of the Senator \nfrom Colorado, I would like to lay the amendment aside in the hope that \nwe can stack votes for later.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily lay aside \nthe Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield the \nfloor?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 899\n\n    (Purpose: To promote democracy-building activities in Pakistan.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report:\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Johnson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 899.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . DEMOCRACY-BUILDING ACTIVITY IN PAKISTAN.\n\n       (a) OPIC.--Section 239(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2199(f)) is amended by inserting ``, or \n     Pakistan'' after ``China''.\n       (b) Training Activity.--Section 638(b) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2398(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``or any activity to promote the \n     development of democratic institutions'' after ``activity''; \n     and\n       (2) by inserting ``, Pakistan,'' after ``Brazil''.\n       (c) Trade and Development.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that the Director of the Trade and Development Agency should \n     use funds made available to carry out the provisions of \n     section 661 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2421) to promote United States exports to Pakistan.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Warner, Senator Torricelli, Senator Santorum, and \nSenator Johnson.\n  Put simply, this amendment will allow the resumption of the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, OPIC, International Military and \nEducation Training, IMET, Trade and Development Assistance, TDA, and \ndemocracy-building programs in Pakistan, such as the National Endowment \nfor Democracy.\n  This measure, I will say at the outset, is not anti-India and it is \nnot pro-Pakistan, it is pro-American interests. This will not be a vote \nfor or against India or Pakistan. India is, of course, a friend of \nlongstanding and an ally to the United States and is the largest and \noldest democracy in the region. It already receives the benefit of OPIC \nand IMET, and it has for some time over 35 years. Therefore, I am \nconfident that we can restore these programs to Pakistan without \nupsetting any balance at all to the region.\n  Trade between India and Pakistan is growing. OPIC assistance to \nPakistan could actually help India because they are working with \nPakistan in the energy sector. OPIC assistance would promote American \ninvestment in this sector.\n  Mr. President, it is now clear that continuing the policy of \nrestricting OPIC and IMET to Pakistan will do nothing to direct further \nU.S. nonproliferation efforts in South Asia. At the same time, these \nrestrictions seriously hinder our ability to advance United States \ninterests in trade and investment in Pakistan. Our influence in the \nPakistani military leadership and our ability to strengthen democracy \nand economic institutions in Pakistan is also adversely affected by \nthese restrictions.\n  I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues in regard to \nPakistan, and I share some of those concerns. The issue of \nnonproliferation in South Asia is, indeed, an extremely important \nissue, but U.S. interests in South Asia are important and increasing.\n  The region contains one-fifth of the world's population and occupies \na critical geostrategic position--surrounded by China, the surging \neconomies of East Asia, the Indian Ocean, the huge oil and gas reserves \nin the Persian Gulf and the Caspian basin.\n  Mr. President, I visited Pakistan and India earlier this year. I met \nin Pakistan with Prime Minister Sharif and other members of his \ngovernment. I believe that Mr. Sharif has learned from past mistakes \nand is moving Pakistan in the right direction. He has a strong mandate \nin parliament and has already taken bold steps toward rooting out \ncorruption, privatizing the economy and normalizing relations with \nIndia. These are positive steps, and the United States must send a \nstrong signal of support and encouragement for Prime Minister Sharif's \ninitiatives.\n  I strongly believe that it has come to the point where our uneven \npolicy toward Pakistan is hampering our interests in the region. \nImproved human rights, nonproliferation and greater trade and \ninvestment are being held hostage by this shortsighted policy.\n  I am pleased that my amendment has the strong support of the \nadministration in an effort to engage Pakistan on these important \nissues. Secretary Albright and Secretary Cohen both feel strongly about \nthe need for these changes.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter dated the 16th of July from Secretary \nof Defense Cohen. He said:\n\n       I am writing to express my strong support for your \n     legislation to restore IMET, OPIC, TDA and democracy-building \n     programs in Pakistan . . .\n       We believe it essential to pursue these programs--not as a \n     reward to Pakistan--but as a means of furthering important \n     U.S. interests. Pakistan is now, and long has been, a \n     friendly, moderate Islamic democracy in a very difficult \n     region. We believe that by enabling it to participate in \n     IMET, OPIC, TDA and democracy-building programs we will \n     strengthen democracy in Pakistan as an institution, \n     strengthen Pakistan's troubled economy, and strengthen our \n     relationship with the Pakistani military--all of which serve \n     important U.S. interests in South Asia.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nCohen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Secretary of Defense\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: I am writing to express my strong support for \n     your legislation to restore the International Military \n     Education and Training (IMET), Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation (OPIC), Trade and Development Agency (TDA), and \n     democracy-building programs in Pakistan. These programs are \n     currently precluded by sanctions that have been imposed on \n     Pakistan under the Symington Amendment.\n       We believe it essential to pursue these programs--not as a \n     reward to Pakistan--but as a means of furthering important \n     U.S. interests. Pakistan is now, and long has been, a \n     friendly, moderate Islamic democracy in a very difficult \n     region. We believe that by enabling it to participate in \n     IMET, OPIC, TDA, and democracy-building programs we will \n     strengthen democracy in Pakistan as an institution, \n     strengthen Pakistan's troubled economy, and strengthen our \n     relationship with the Pakistani military--all of which serve \n     important U.S. interests in South Asia.\n       DoD is particularly supportive of legislation that would \n     restore Pakistan's IMET program. We believe that the positive \n     impact of IMET on the Pakistani military will serve to \n     enhance our overall relationship with Pakistan and, by \n     extension, will facilitate our engagement with Pakistan in a \n     number of important areas including proliferation. Moreover, \n     given Pakistan's leading role in UN peacekeeping--Pakistan \n     currently leads the world as a contributor of troops to UN \n     peacekeeping operations--closer cooperation between our two \n     armed forces is increasingly necessary for operational \n     reasons. Senior Pakistani officers have told us that one of \n     the consequences of our suspension of the IMET program has \n     been that a generation of Pakistani officers has not had the \n     positive exposure to U.S. and western values that is made \n     possible through IMET. Without IMET to provide a \n     countervailing argument, these officers may find the often \n     anti-American message of Iran and Iraq more appealing.\n       Opponents of your legislation will claim that Pakistan's \n     performance with regard to proliferation should not be \n     ``rewarded'' by making it eligible for these assistance \n     programs. We would respond that our denying any of these \n     programs will not cause the Pakistanis to forego strategic \n     programs which they believe are essential for their national \n     security. However, by making these assistance programs \n     available, we will not only serve U.S. interests directly but \n     will improve the climate of our overall relationship thus \n     encouraging Pakistan to be more receptive to our point of \n     view in other areas.\n       I wholeheartedly support your efforts to enact this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                             Bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me read further from Secretary Cohen's letter. I want \nto get this last paragraph in. Secretary Cohen said:\n\n       Opponents of your legislation will claim that Pakistan's \n     performance with regard to proliferation should not be \n     ``rewarded'' by making it eligible for these assistance \n     programs. We would respond that our denying any of these \n     programs will not cause the Pakistanis to forego strategic \n     programs which they believe are essential for their national \n     security. However, by making these assistance programs \n     available, we will not only serve U.S. interests directly but \n     will improve the climate of our overall relationship thus \n     encouraging Pakistan to be more receptive to our point of \n     view in other areas.\n\n  Mr. President, I am also in receipt of a letter signed by Under \nSecretary\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\nThomas Pickering. Again, I will just read a couple parts of that:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Secretary has asked me to convey \n     her strong support for your proposed amendment to restore \n     OPIC, IMET, TDA and democracy-building programs for Pakistan. \n     We firmly believe that allowing these programs to operate in \n     Pakistan is in the U.S. interest, and that once restored they \n     will be a key factor in strengthening our relationship with \n     an important and friendly country in a vital part of the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. Pickering goes on:\n\n       In the wake of the election of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, \n     Pakistan has adopted important political and constitutional \n     reforms, which promise to strengthen both the quality and \n     continuity of democratic rule. We want to bolster that effort \n     by implementing programs to train Pakistan's elected \n     representatives in democratic structures and legislative \n     procedures. Your amendment would give us the requisite \n     flexibility to proceed.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Pickering's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Department of State, Under Secretary of State for \n           Political Affairs,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Secretary has asked me to convey \n     her strong support for your proposed amendment to restore \n     OPIC, IMET, TDA and democracy building programs for Pakistan. \n     We firmly believe that allowing these programs to operate in \n     Pakistan is in the U.S. interest, and that once restored they \n     will be a key factor in strengthening our relationship with \n     an important and friendly country in a vital part of the \n     world.\n       In the wake of the election of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, \n     Pakistan has adopted important political and constitutional \n     reforms, which promise to strengthen both the quality and \n     continuity of democratic rule. We want to bolster that effort \n     by implementing programs to train Pakistan's elected \n     representatives in democratic structures and legislative \n     procedures. Your amendment will give us the requisite \n     flexibility to proceed.\n       At the same time, the Government of Pakistan is undertaking \n     an ambitious reform program to stabilize Pakistan's troubled \n     economy. The United States, as Pakistan's leading trading \n     partner and largest source of foreign investment, is in a \n     favorable position to influence and benefit from a stable \n     economic situation in Pakistan. Extending Trade and \n     Development Assistance and OPIC support to U.S. firms in \n     Pakistan will increase our engagement with the Pakistani \n     government on reform issues, while ensuring that our firms \n     are well positioned to compete for investment and trade \n     opportunities.\n       Finally, we believe that restoring IMET programs will have \n     an appreciable impact on our relationship with the Pakistani \n     military. For seven years, the United States has lacked \n     contact with junior and mid-level Pakistani officers, from \n     whose ranks will emerge the next generation of Pakistani \n     military leaders. We would serve our interests well by giving \n     them exposure to U.S. practices, institutions, and values.\n       We, like you, continue to have concerns regarding \n     Pakistan's record on non-proliferation issues. We consider \n     non-proliferation to be one of the most complex and troubling \n     issues in the South Asia region, and it will continue to be \n     one of our highest priorities to work with the Pakistani \n     government to restrain its nuclear and missile programs. That \n     said, we need to consider carefully how to pursue our non-\n     proliferation objectives in conformity with the entire range \n     of U.S. interests in Pakistan. We believe that an initiative \n     such as yours--which will help to develop Pakistan's \n     democracy, increase bilateral trade and investment, and \n     enhance our access to and influence with Pakistan's emerging \n     military leadership--will advance our interests without \n     undermining our non-proliferation agenda.\n       We appreciate and are pleased to support your effort.\n                                              Thomas R. Pickering.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a number of prominent United States \nbusiness leaders have asked the State Department to resume OPIC support \nfor investment in Pakistan so that American business interests are \npromoted in that region. In no other country in South Asia is OPIC \nprohibited from providing support and assistance. I have examples, a \nnumber of letters of United States businesses urging the administration \nto resume OPIC's support of Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, I have letters from several different companies that I \nhave here that have written letters asking that OPIC be allowed to \nresume in Pakistan so that they can begin to invest in Pakistan--a \nletter from Occidental Oil and Gas; a letter from MCI Communications; a \nletter from Solar Turbines, a Caterpillar Company; a letter from Alpha-\nGamma Technologies, Inc., in Raleigh, NC; a letter from Boston \nTechnology, Inc., in Wakefield, MA; a letter from Hawkins Oil & Gas, \nInc., in Oklahoma; a letter from Tenaska International, Omaha, NE; and \nseveral other letters. I will not read them all. But Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that several of these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Occidental Oil and Gas Corp.,\n\n                                  Bakersfield, CA, April 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing at this time concerning an \n     important matter impacting on U.S. commercial relations with \n     the Republic of Pakistan. I understand that the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) is still not permitted \n     to offer its programs in Pakistan. I urge you to review this \n     matter and to do what you can to expedite the implementation \n     of OPIC programs in Pakistan.\n       Occidental Petroleum Corporation has had successful oil and \n     gas producing operations in Pakistan for twelve years. \n     Pakistan presents unique business opportunities and offers a \n     stable environment for American companies and for companies \n     from a host of other countries around the world. U.S. trade \n     and commercial ties with Pakistan serve to enhance the \n     overall relationship between our two countries. However, in \n     order for U.S. companies to compete more aggressively in \n     Pakistan, they must have access to OPIC programs.\n       While I appreciate that there are other important and \n     serious issues impacting on our bilateral relationship, I \n     respectfully ask that you consider the vital commercial link \n     that exists between the U.S. and Pakistan and move quickly to \n     permit OPIC guarantees in Pakistan. The U.S. is the largest \n     foreign investor in Pakistan and its largest trading partner. \n     I am convinced that U.S. commercial interests in Pakistan \n     would increase even more if OPIC programs were available. \n     Furthermore, I am sure you will agree, that permitting OPIC \n     to operate in Pakistan would contribute in a meaningful way \n     to improving our overall bilateral relationship.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     James B. Taylor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               MCI Communications Corporation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 1996.\n     Mr. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: For many years, MCI has successfully \n     conducted business in Pakistan with Pakistan PTT, the \n     government-owned telephone company. Pakistan has proven to be \n     a reliable business partner. We understand that the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) is finalizing an \n     agreement with the government of Pakistan to provide \n     political risk insurance covering foreign investments in \n     Pakistan. This agreement should provide the added security \n     necessary for MCI and other American companies interested in \n     increasing their investments in Pakistan. Any action taken to \n     expedite completion of this agreement would be helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark Esherick,\n     Senior Policy Advisor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Solar Turbines,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: This letter is a request for you to look \n     favorably upon making the resources of the Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation available to U.S. exporters when doing \n     business in the Country of Pakistan. Such action would be \n     consistent with the availability of Export-Import Bank \n     financing and insurance and the apparent desire on the part \n     of the U.S. Government to work closely with the Government of \n     Pakistan after the prime minister's visit of last year.\n       Pakistan represents an important market to U.S. exporters \n     and the resources of OPIC will be of considerable value in \n     generating additional export revenue and jobs within the \n     United States. At the same time, the U.S. businesses will, by \n     working more closely with Pakistan, further the cause of \n     democracy and environmental awareness.\n       Your leadership in this matter will be greatly appreciated. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n           Most sincerely,\n     Peter Carroll.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               Alpha-Gamma Technologies, Inc.,\n\n                                      Raleigh, NC, March 18, 1996.\n     Mr. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbot: Alpha-Gamma Technologies, Inc. is actively \n     pursuing a private power development project in Pakistan. \n     Along with two other U.S. based companies, we have plans to \n     make a significant investment in the power generation sector \n     in that country. However, we are placed at a significant \n     disadvantage against foreign competition due to non-\n     availability of OPIC coverage.\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n       I believe that recent legislation passed by the U.S. \n     Congress makes OPIC coverage available in Pakistan. However, \n     implementation of this legislation seems to be taking some \n     time. Any assistance you can provide in expediting the \n     availability of OPIC coverage in Pakistan would greatly help \n     U.S. firms in their efforts to compete in the Pakistan \n     market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Reese H.

Boston Technology \n     is a telecommunications firm employing more than 500 people \n     in the Boston Area, with offices worldwide.\n       We have already done some business in Pakistan with Paktel, \n     and are currently negotiating for additional business with \n     PTC, the Pakistan Telephone Company.\n       It would be of great assistance if the Senate would approve \n     the Opic Insurance provision currently under consideration.\n       Thank you for your interest in Boston Technology.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Todd Hasselbeck,\n     Vice President International Sales.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Hawkins Oil & Gas, Inc.,\n\n                                        Tulsa, OK, March 14, 1996.\n     Mr. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Ref: OPIC Restoration for Pakistan.\n\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: This letter is a request that the process \n     to restore OPIC insurance coverage for Pakistan be completed \n     at the earliest possible date. Our company has been working \n     since 1989 to construct and operate a 586 MW power plant--the \n     Uch Power Project--in Pakistan. We have been pleased by the \n     policy behind the Brown Amendment, and now are hopeful that \n     its expected benefits can be realized. U.S. companies own \n     over 50 percent of the Uch project equity, and most of the \n     $625 million plant budget is for purchase of U.S. sourced \n     goods and services.\n       We are on the verge of financial closing of this project, \n     and hope to receive clearance for filing our application for \n     OPIC insurance thereafter.\n       Please accept my thanks and appreciation in advance for \n     your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     John B. Hawkins.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        Tenaska International,\n\n                                         Omaha, NE, April 8, 1996.\n     Mr. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: On behalf of the Uch Power project \n     sponsors, I am writing to request your support for making \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) funding \n     available for Pakistani projects.\n       As you know, Tenaska International and four other companies \n     are developing the Uch Power Limited independent energy \n     project in Pakistan. The other U.S. sponsors are GE Capital \n     Corp. and Hawkins Oil and Gas. Additionally, Midlands \n     Electricity of the UK and Hasan and Associates of Pakistan \n     are project sponsors.\n       The $630 million project is nearing financial close, and \n     limited construction already has begun. Having access to OPIC \n     insurance is very desirable for the Uch project. Due to the \n     project's advanced stage of development, we hope that OPIC \n     insurance becomes available for Pakistan as soon as possible.\n       Speaking for Tenaska, we are most interested in future \n     project development in Pakistan as well. Availability of OPIC \n     insurance will be of great benefit to us for future projects.\n       We urgently request your support in making OPIC insurance \n     available for projects in Pakistan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul G.

Union Texas is a United States \n     public company that has operated oil and gas concessions in \n     Pakistan since 1977. During 1995, our operations produced \n     approximately 37% of Pakistan's domestic oil production and \n     10% of its natural gas production. Over the years, we have \n     had a productive and mutually beneficial relationship with \n     the peoples and Government of Pakistan. We strongly believe \n     that the United States should work to further strengthen its \n     relations with Pakistan.\n       During 1995, Union Texas and the Government of Pakistan \n     signed a new petroleum concession agreement and we began \n     discussions regarding downstream projects, including \n     electrical power generation and liquefied petroleum gas \n     opportunities. The availability of OPIC programs could be a \n     critical factor in our ability to commit to certain of these \n     projects in the future.\n       We hope that the Administration will give its full support \n     to reactivating OPIC's ability to offer its programs in \n     Pakistan, thus encouraging U.S. investment and fostering a \n     positive and supportive environment for relations between our \n     two nations.\n           Very truly yours,\n     W. M. Krips.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Southern Electric International,\n\n                                      Atlanta, GA, March 19, 1996.\n     Mr. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: You may be aware that the Government of \n     Pakistan (GOP) is pursuing a comprehensive program of \n     privatizing some of its major state-owned companies. As part \n     of this program, the GOP is privatizing the Kot Addu Power \n     Station (KAPS) which is the largest (1600 MW) thermal \n     electric power generating station in Pakistan. Southern \n     Electric International is seriously pursuing this opportunity \n     in competition with three other major international \n     companies, two of which are non-U.S. This project will be bid \n     this month with financial closing expected in September.\n       As a U.S. company, Southern Electric International's \n     commercial objectives in Pakistan are constrained by the \n     delays in the signing of the relevant protocol that will \n     allow OPIC to provide the needed insurance risk coverages. \n     The availability of OPIC insurance coverage for Pakistan \n     would enhance the competitiveness and investment options \n     available to Southern Electric and all U.S. companies \n     interested in investing in Pakistan. Therefore, I would \n     appreciate very much if your office would facilitate and \n     support an expeditious signing of the relevant protocol.\n       Southern Electric is a wholly owned subsidiary of The \n     Southern Company, one of the largest electric utility holding \n     companies in the U.S., and is based in Atlanta, Georgia. \n     Southern Electric finances, builds, owns and operates \n     electricity generation, transmission and distribution assets \n     in the U.S. and around the world. Currently, Southern \n     Electric has international assets in Argentina, Bahamas, \n     Chile, Trinidad and the United Kingdom.\n       Again, I appreciate your consideration and support with \n     respect to OPIC insurance for Pakistan. If you have any \n     questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free \n     to contact me.\n           Regards,\n     Thomas G. Boren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                Hycarbex, Inc.\n\n                                       Irving, TX, March 20, 1996.\n     Mr. Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: This letter is a request that the process \n     to restore OPIC insurance coverage for Pakistan be completed \n     at the earliest date. Our company has obtained a petroleum \n     concession in Pakistan and is soon mobilizing our resources \n     for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources \n     in Pakistan. I am confident that an agreement between the \n     Governments of the United States and Pakistan regarding \n     OPIC's coverage will assist not only in our business but also \n     others who are interested in doing business in Pakistan.\n       Please accept my thanks and appreciation in advance for \n     your assistance.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                     David L.

Strobe Talbott,\n     Deputy Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Talbott: The AES Corporation is an American \n     company in the business of building, owning and operating \n     private electric power generating facilities in the United \n     States and abroad. We have seven plants in the U.S., three in \n     the U.K., three in Argentina, and four in China. More \n     recently, we have completed the financings for and begun \n     construction of two power plants in Pakistan. It is because \n     of this activity that we write to you.\n       We have been working in Pakistan for two and one half \n     years, and have committed substantial amounts of time and--\n     more recently--equity capital to this country. Our dealings \n     with the Government of Pakistan have been uniformly \n     characterized by both fairness and remarkable expedition. \n     We're pleased with our success there, and with the positive \n     impact on American jobs that this success will have, \n     indirectly and directly.\n       What has been lacking in Pakistan is our ability to access \n     the insurance and financing programs of the Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation (OPIC). As you know, until recently \n     OPIC was congressionally prohibited from offering its \n     services to U.S. companies operating in Pakistan.\n       These restrictions have now been lifted, and we urge you to \n     act quickly to allow OPIC to offer insurance coverage there. \n     It will help our efforts and the efforts of many American \n     companies to do business in Pakistan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Robert F. Hemphill, Jr.,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Government of Pakistan is pursuing \ndramatic economic reforms, including liberalization, privatization, and \nderegulation in order to transition its economy into a fully market-\noriented system. Once OPIC support is reinstated, the United States \nwill be able to institute trade and development assistance programs as \nwell. U.S. companies will be able to pursue business opportunities in a \nwide variety of sectors, such as power generation, telecommunications, \nhighway construction, port development and operations, oil and gas, and \nbanking and finance.\n  I also point out, Mr. President, that the Government of Pakistan is \nin the process of privatizing its banking system. OPIC can be of great \nhelp and support in doing that.\n  Further, the prohibition of IMET has meant an emerging generation of \nPakistani military officers has not had access to training in the \nUnited States. Let me be clear that IMET does not mean the transfer or \nsale of any weapons. It only means valuable education assistance to \nother militaries which help foster valuable military-to-military \ncontacts with the United States and the host country and allows the \nUnited States to impart its values to other militaries.\n  Mr. President, according to the Department of Defense, the Chinese \nare currently the single largest provider of military training to \nPakistani Forces. Cutting off Pakistan from IMET assistance over the \nlast 7 years has therefore reduced our contacts among the military \nleadership in Pakistan and reduced their exposure to United States \ninstitutions and values. This 7-year vacuum has been filled by China--\nnot in our best interests. In addition to providing American-style \nmilitary training, IMET can be used to provide training in human \nrights, military justice, and civilian-military relations.\n  The chief of the Army staff, General Karamat, for Pakistan, who \nattended the United States Army Command and General Staff College in \nFort Leavenworth, KS, has stated that he would rather send his officers \nto the United States to study rather than to China. I think we ought to \ntake him up on that.\n  The United States has an IMET Program with every country in South \nAsia except for Pakistan, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, \nIndia, even the Maldives. This policy does not make sense. IMET should \nbe restored not as a favor to Pakistan but because it is clearly in the \nUnited States interests to do so.\n  That is what this amendment is really all about, helping the Unites \nStates. It is pro-American. Pakistan is not getting military training \nfrom the United States; it is getting it from China. Is that serving \nU.S. interests? I do not think so.\n  This amendment is not for anyone else but the United States because \nit will be our interests that are best served by it. Mr. President, let \nme briefly outline the long history of friendship between Pakistan and \nthe United States.\n  I believe it is important that this appear in the Record.\n  Since 1947--50 years ago--the founding of the nation of Pakistan, the \npeople of Pakistan have been helping to serve United States interests \nin South Asia and around the world. When the first Prime Minister of \nPakistan, Liaqat Ali Khan, chose to undertake his first overseas visit, \nit was to the United States instead of to the Soviet Union, despite \nefforts by Moscow to entice him there and despite their proximity to \nboth the Soviet Union and China. Since the late 1940's, Pakistan has \nhelped the United States on numerous occasions in promoting and \nprotecting American interests.\n  In a speech to this Congress, Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan \nproclaimed--and I quote--\n\n       No threat or persuasion, no material peril, or ideological \n     allurement could deflect Pakistan from its chosen path of \n     free democracy.\n\n  Pakistan lived up to its commitments later on in June 1950, when it \ndeclared its unqualified support for the United States in our war in \nKorea and backed us in that war.\n  In 1954, they joined the Central Treaty Organization.\n  In 1955, they joined SEATO, the South East Asian Treaty Organization. \nThese two American-backed alliances were aimed at the containment of \ncommunism and were very successful.\n  In 1959, our two countries signed a mutual defense treaty which is \nstill operational today.\n  So this is a long history.\n  Again, some will say, well, Pakistan has had military dictatorships \nand violations of human rights. That is true. I understand that. But I \nbelieve that the freedom advocates, the freedom fighters, those who \nstruggle continually in Pakistan for democracy and freedom have been at \nit continually. They have been assassinated and tortured and put in \njail, but they continue to struggle for democratic freedoms in that \ncountry.\n  Those are the ones about whom I speak, not the military \ndictatorships, but the brave people in Pakistan that continue to \nstruggle and fight and to maintain an adherence to democracy.\n  Mr. President, from that time on, Pakistan has been on our side and \nby our side whether it is in Korea or whether it is in Somalia, whether \nit is in Haiti, or in Bosnia. Yes, Pakistan right now has troops in \nBosnia. And they have faced dangers time and time again, but they have \nstuck by our side.\n  I spoke, not the military dictators, not the repressive forces in \nPakistan, but to those brave people of Pakistan who, through all of \nthis, continue to struggle and to fight against corruption and to \nmaintain an adherence to democracy.\n  In 1960, Pakistan's commitment, its friendship to the United States \nwas put to a very severe test. Again, in accordance with the Mutual \nDefense Treaty, Pakistan allowed us to set up some bases. One of them \nwas a base from which we flew our U-2 flights over the Soviet Union. \nOne of those flights, as we all sadly remember, was shot down by the \nSoviets. Francis Gary Powers was the pilot, and we all know how the \nSoviets paraded him as one of their trophies.\n  Soviet leader Nikita Khruschchev turned his ire on Pakistan because \nhe knew that was where the plane was based. He threatened to use \nnuclear arms and weapons against Pakistan. He boasted that the city of \nPeshawar would be wiped off the face of the Earth. The Foreign Minister \nof Pakistan, in his recently published account of the incident, \ndescribes the cool and confident reaction of the then-President of \nPakistan, who dismissed the Soviet threat by saying, ``So what?''\n  Again, put yourself in that context. Korean war, Mutual Defense \nTreaty, allowing us to base our U-2 spy planes there. They are \nbordering right on the Soviet Union, and yet they stood by us.\n  Pakistan again came to the assistance of the United States by helping \nto facilitate the crucial opening of American relations with China. In \n1970, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger undertook a secret visit \nto China from Pakistan. Thus, again, Pakistan served as that vital \nbridge between the United States and China. Again, it was critical in \nthe cold war to restrain the Soviet Union.\n  From 1979 to 1989, the United States went to Pakistan and asked them \nto cooperate with us in and help us fight the Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan through infiltration of military equipment and other \ndevices. Once again, Pakistan said yes to the United States even though \nthey faced great danger. Not only did the Soviet Union, again, threaten \nPakistan with dire consequences, but launched a campaign of subversion \nand terror against Pakistan. The country experienced numerous \nviolations of its ground and air space, terrorist bombings, and \nsubversion.\n  Since 1992, Pakistan has been at the forefront of peacekeeping \noperations. We went to them and asked them to supply troops for \nSomalia, and they said yes. And we went to them and asked them to \nsupply troops for the Haiti operation, and they said yes. And, Pakistan \nmade significant contributions to the multinational force during the \nGulf War to help liberate Kuwait. Pakistani troops are currently in \nBosnia.\n  In 1995, we asked Pakistan to return a suspected terrorist, Ramzi \nYousaf, for his alleged involvement in the World Trade Center bombing. \nAnd they did.\n  And, recently, the CIA was able to return to the United States, Mir \nAimal Kansi, a Pakistani who is charged with killing two CIA employees \noutside CIA headquarters.\n  As a moderate democratic Islamic ally, Pakistan is our most tried and\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\ntrusted friend we have in the Islamic world. They have stood by our \nside against the Soviet Union's aggression. And they have stood by our \nside in the fight against terrorism.\n  So I say to my colleagues, let us treat our friend and ally Pakistan \nas they deserve to be treated due to their longstanding support for the \nUnited States, but most importantly it is in our best interests to do \nso. Granting OPIC and IMET will help U.S. business interests and U.S. \nnational security interests. It will help exports, foster military-to-\nmilitary contacts and give the United States better intelligence in the \nregion. It is fair, it is right, and makes good sense for the United \nStates to change its shortsighted policy and pursue long-term interests \nin the region.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that my distinguished \nfriend and colleague approached me to form a partnership for the \npurpose of this amendment. In different ways and at different times \nboth of us have worked closely with Pakistan. As a member of the \nIntelligence Committee for 8 years, and then as vice chairman, I worked \nvery closely during the war in Afghanistan, and through the years have \ncome to know many of the distinguished persons from that nation who \nhave come to the United States either in an official capacity or indeed \nmany, many who have a heritage in Pakistan who have come to reside and \ntake up their responsibilities in America.\n  And that is why I agreed to be the principal cosponsor with my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  Specifically, the amendment would allow the United States to provide \nOPIC financing for United States companies operating in Pakistan; would \nallow the resumption of the IMET program to train Pakistani military \nofficers in the United States; and would allow assistance for \nactivities to promote the development of democratic institutions.\n  This limited economic and training assistance to Pakistan will ensure \nthat the United States will remain constructively engaged with a nation \nthat has a long history as a friend and ally of the United States.\n  Almost from its creation as a nation in 1947, Pakistan has assisted \nthe United States in containing Soviet expansion in this critical part \nof the world. In 1954, the United States and Pakistan signed a mutual \ndefense assistance agreement which, over the following 10 years \nresulted in the United States providing Pakistan over $700 million in \nmilitary grant aid. United States economic aid to Pakistan was even \nmore generous--this Nation provided over $5 billion to Pakistan from \n1951-82.\n  This close relationship was of great benefit to the United States \nfollowing the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistani \ncooperation was critical to the success of United States operations \nrelated to Afghanistan.\n  The amendment before the Senate today does not call for a full \nresumption of United States assistance to Pakistan. Most importantly, \nthe existing prohibitions on providing military equipment would be \nretained. The programs we are talking about--particularly OPIC and \nIMET--are of great benefit to the United States, as well as Pakistan. \nOPIC financing will allow United States businesses to successfully \ncompete for business opportunities in Pakistan; and IMET will allow the \nnext generation of Pakistani military leaders to be exposed to our \nvalues.\n  During today's debate on this amendment, we will likely hear \ndiscussion about Pakistan's nuclear activities. While I share the \nconcerns of my colleagues with the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction in South Asia, this amendment does not undermine our \nnonproliferation goals. To the contrary, I believe that we may be \nbetter able to influence developments in Pakistan if we remain engaged \nwith that nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I compliment Senator Harkin for his hard work on this amendment. We \nhave talked with a number of our colleagues. We have talked with the \nadministration. Former Ambassador Pickering, now a senior official at \nthe Department of State, of course had written us. Those letters are \nnow in the Record, to my understanding.\n  I rank him among the most knowledgeable of our present-day persons in \nthe Department of State, indeed throughout the administration, and \nvalue his judgment greatly. I have worked with him for some 15 to 18 \nyears now. And therefore, Mr. President, I strongly urge the adoption \nof this amendment.\n  At this time I yield the floor in recognition of my colleagues.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to thank my colleague for his aid, his \nassistance, and strong support of this amendment, and for talking to \ncolleagues here on the Senate floor about the importance to the U.S. \ninterests of making sure we reinstate OPIC, IMET, TDA, the democracy \ninitiative, and thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his \nstrong support and his help in this effort.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague, and particularly for \nhis reference to IMET. It is a program I have dealt with throughout my \ncareer both in the Department of Defense and here in the Senate. And it \nreturns great dividends to the United States. I am delighted that this \nwill be a part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the amendment offered \nby my colleagues, Messrs. Harkin and Warner, which would authorize the \nresumption of certain forms of economic assistance and military \ntraining activities with Pakistan.\n  The amendment would allow the provision of assistance by the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation [OPIC], the resumption of military \ntraining activities, and certain other trade and democratic assistance \nto Pakistan. This aid had been terminated due to Pakistan's continued \ninability to keep its many promises and assurances to the United States \nconcerning the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. The amendment \nwould resume this specific assistance and do so unconditionally.\n  I used the word, ``unconditionally.'' That means, the assistance \ncould continue in the future to flow even if Pakistan acquired new \nuranium enrichment assistance from China or transferred its own \ntechnology to some other country.\n  The aid could flow if Pakistan detonated a nuclear device or \ntransferred nuclear weapons designs or components to some other \ncountry.\n  The aid could flow if Pakistan once again attempts to violate United \nStates nuclear export control laws by acquiring nuclear equipment or \nmaterials for its bomb program.\n  The aid could flow if Pakistan starts the unsafeguarded production of \nplutonium, an activity that may soon commence with the completion of \nits production reactor at Khushab.\n  The aid could flow, in short, with no expectation whatsoever that \nsuch aid would be accompanied by further progress in restraining \nPakistan's bomb program. And in so flowing, the aid could help \nPakistan--albeit in a restricted way--to alleviate the burdens of \nUnited States nuclear sanctions. In other words, America could be \nhelping Pakistan to cope with United States nuclear sanctions, rather \nthan signaling our fundamental national conviction in policy and in law \nthat proliferation must have a price. Instead of making proliferators \npay, we could be issuing special rewards for proliferation.\n  The key here is obviously the word, ``could''. The President would be \nleft, under this legislation, with the delegated responsibility of \ndetermining whether the continuation of U.S. assistance in the face of \nany of the activities above would truly serve the U.S. national \ninterest. And I for one surely cannot imagine any circumstance where \nsuch a determination could be made.\n  Yet I hope that this amendment will not send the entire world exactly \nthe wrong message about America's commitment to nonproliferation.\n  The amendment must not suggest that America has lost the political \nwill to keep nonproliferation as a key national security policy in our \ndealings with other countries.\n  It must not signal that our country is more concerned with promoting \nits opportunities for trade and investment\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\nthan it is about curtailing the global spread of nuclear weapons.\n  It must not indicate that countries can make--and then systematically \nbreak--solemn promises to the United States concerning matters of \nprofound importance to regional and international security, and do so \nwithout jeopardizing the flow of much-desired U.S. foreign assistance.\n  Now all of us here today are familiar with the notion that America \nshould engage Pakistan by providing increased United States assistance \nas a means of restraining its nuclear program. It would not be the \nfirst time that members of the Senate or the Executive had argued that \nadditional military or economic aid would serve as a valuable \ninstrument of nonproliferation. But I do not believe that the sponsors \nof this amendment today would sincerely make such an argument. We \nsimply cannot turn a blind eye to history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert at the end of my \nremarks a list of statements concerning the alleged value of United \nStates foreign assistance as a tool of nuclear restraint in Pakistan. I \nurge my colleagues to read a few of such assurances that United States \nofficials provided to Congress throughout the decade of the 1980's, the \nvery decade, lest we forget, that Pakistan crossed its most significant \nmilestones on its march to the bomb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. I would like to remind my colleagues that most United \nStates economic and military aid to Pakistan was cut off in October \n1990 by President George Bush, when he was no longer able to certify \nthat Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons or that the provision of \nfurther United States aid would reduce the risk that Pakistan would \ncome to possess such weapons. That language, found in the Pressler \namendment, sec. 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act, has been \nsubstantially relaxed in recent years, in part by the actions of \nCongress, and in part by actions taken unilaterally by the Executive. \nLet me review briefly just how far America has gone already to relax \nthese sanctions.\n  The Brown amendment, which was enacted in February 1996, amended the \nPressler amendment to allow the provision of all types of economic \nassistance, notwithstanding Pakistan's continuing non-compliance with \nthe Pressler criteria. In addition to allowing the transfer of over a \nthird-of-a-billion dollars of embargoed military gear to Pakistan--\nincluding spare parts and upgrades for Pakistan's probable nuclear-\nweapons delivery vehicle, the F-16--the Brown amendment also \nunconditionally authorized the resumption of the following aid: \ninternational narcotics controls; military-to-military contacts, \nincluding IMET; humanitarian and civic assistance projects; \npeacekeeping and other multilateral operations; antiterrorism \nassistance; an exemption from storage costs for embargoed military \nequipment; and delivery of military items sent to the United States for \nrepair before the 1990 sanctions.\n  For its sponsors, the Brown amendment suffered from one rather \nserious problem, however. That amendment failed to recognize that \nPakistan was still in violation of the Symington amendment, sec. 101 of \nthe Arms Export Control Act, and the likelihood of presidential waiver \nof the latter was extremely remote, in light of Pakistan's continued \nviolations of that law. In short, because the Brown amendment neither \nrepealed nor amended the Symington amendment, the Symington amendment \ncontinues to outlaw the provision of aid under the Arms Export Control \nAct or the Foreign Assistance Act to Pakistan. That is why the present \namendment is being offered--it is being offered to liberalize the \nsanctions under the Symington amendment.\n  I note that the International Financial Institutions Act only \nrequires U.S. executive officers at those institutions merely ``to \nconsider'' the nonproliferation credentials of the potential recipient \ncountry, and hence this does not prohibit continued aid via such \ninstitutions. Pakistan has received hundreds of millions of dollars in \nassistance from such institutions since October 1990.\n  The Export-Import Bank Act only requires the denial of credits in the \nevent of violations of safeguards or a US nuclear cooperation \nagreement; nuclear detonations; or persons or countries that willfully \naid and abet non-nuclear-weapon states to get the bomb.\n  A host of other legislative amendments have authorized the provision \nof the following forms of assistance to Pakistan, notwithstanding \nexisting nuclear sanctions, via nongovernmental organizations: \nagricultural, rural development, and nutrition; population and health; \neducation and human resources development; energy; appropriate \ntechnology; use of cooperatives in development; integrating women into \nnational economies; human rights; environment and natural resources; \nendangered species; and private and voluntary organizations.\n\n  So America has not been heartless to the lot of Pakistan's vast \nmajority, its poor people. We have over the years provided billions of \ndollars of assistance intended to improve the living conditions of the \npeople of Pakistan.\n  Our grievance today is not with the people of Pakistan but with their \nGovernment. It arises in particular from the awesome and growing \ncredibility gap between the peaceful words of Pakistan's leaders about \ntheir country's nuclear program, and the certain fact that Pakistan is \ncontinuing to develop nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.\n  Now some might argue that we should simply be grateful that Pakistan \nis not detonating nuclear weapons right now. We should rejoice that \nPakistan is not transferring its bombs, bomb designs, or bomb \ncomponents--right now anyway--to other countries. We should be happy \nthat Pakistan has not yet imported a complete nuclear reprocessing \nplant or uranium enrichment plant from China, and be grateful that it \nis only technical assistance and components that Pakistan has received \nfor its bomb program from China. By golly, we should celebrate the fact \nthat Pakistan does not yet have an ICBM, or that it has not yet \nattacked Indian civilian or military positions with nuclear weapons \nhung under the wings of United States-supplied F-16 aircraft. Yes, we \ncan surely be grateful for all the above restraint.\n  But maybe, just maybe, all of this heroic nuclear restraint that \nPakistan has exercised is due in good measure to the real and palpable \ncosts that Pakistan would pay if it engaged in any of those flagrant \nactivities--costs that include, but are no means limited to, the costs \nthat are found in existing United States sanctions legislation.\n  We must examine, however, not just at what Pakistan has not done, but \nalso recall what Pakistan has done. Here is what Pakistan has done \nrecently:\n  Pakistan has acquired thousands of specially-designed ring magnets \nfor its unsafeguarded uranium enrichment project, and reportedly \nacquired them just about the time the United States Congress was \ndebating the Brown amendment in 1995. Pakistan's actions make a mockery \nnot just of the Brown amendment, but also of America's nuclear \nnonproliferation policy as a whole.\n  Pakistan is nearing completion of an unsafeguarded plutonium \nproduction capability with its production reactor at Khushab and, by \nsome reports, a related nuclear reprocessing plant.\n  Pakistan has in the eyes of most of the world, but evidently not yet \nthose in our own State Department, acquired nuclear-capable M-11 \nmissiles from China, and recently test-fired its HATF missile.\n  On March 20, 1997, the trade publication, Nucleonics Week, reported \nthat ``Pakistan has completed its tests of its atomic bomb capability \nsuccessfully through computer simulation.'' This claim was made by one \nwho should know, Pakistan's former Army Chief of Staff, Mirza Aslam \nBeg, and comes as a particularly bitter reminder of the Senate's \nunfortunate decision last week to vote down a proposal by my \ncolleagues, Messrs. Cochran and Durbin, to tighten up export controls \nover high-powered computers going to Pakistan and other risky \ncountries.\n  In June 1997, the CIA Director sent to Congress an unclassified \nreport on global weapons proliferation in the last 6 months of 1996--\nReport entitled: ``The Acquisition of Technology Related to Weapons of \nMass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions: July-\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\nDecember 1996''. Here is what the report had to say about Pakistan:\n\n       Pakistan was very aggressive in seeking out equipment, \n     material, and technology for its nuclear weapons program, \n     with China as its principal supplier. Pakistan also sought a \n     wide variety of nuclear-related goods from many Western \n     nations, including the United States. China also was a major \n     supplier to Pakistan's ballistic missile program, providing \n     technology and assistance. Of note, Pakistan has made strong \n     efforts to acquire an indigenous capability in missile \n     production technologies.\n\n  The report also said that,\n\n       The Chinese provided a tremendous variety of assistance to \n     both Iran's and Pakistan's ballistic missile programs.\n\n  Needless to say, these are some of the key findings from just one \nrecent unclassified U.S. government report, perhaps the tip of the \nproverbial iceberg.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record at \nthe end of my remarks copies of some of these relevant reports.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. How are we to interpret such activities? Should we just \nwrite them off as due to India's own irresponsible nuclear and missile \nprograms? Is it due to the so-called inevitability of proliferation? \nNo, indeed, we need to redouble our efforts to roll back both \ncountries' programs. Above all, we should not be engaging in acts that \ncan reasonably be interpreted as rewards for proliferation.\n  I do not myself see this legislation as a reward for proliferation \nand do not believe that its sponsors, including its supporters in the \nAdministration, so view it. But I worry more about how others will \nperceive it, particularly those in Pakistan and in the various \nministries of other countries that may be working on clandestine \nprojects to develop weapons of mass destruction. How far can Uncle Sam \nbe pushed when it comes to avoiding sanctions against the bomb? If past \nis prologue, it appears that the unfortunate answer is, pretty far \nindeed.\n  Through this legislation, America has now made a gesture--based more \non hope than on experience--that the Government and people of Pakistan \nwill interpret as they wish. I hope they will recognize that America is \nsincere about its global commitments to nuclear and missile \nnonproliferation. I hope they recognize that America remains determined \nto pursue vigorously these commitments not only in Pakistan, but also \nin India, and indeed, wherever such illicit programs may exist.\n  I also hope--as the profound direct and indirect costs mount of \nmaintaining these dangerous nuclear and missile programs--that the \nGovernment and people of Pakistan will come in due course to realize \nthat there is a more rational course to follow and a new day will dawn. \nIt is a course charted by the governments and people of South Africa, \nBrazil, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Japan, and \nnumerous other countries that individually reached their own decisions \nthat their latent nuclear weapons options are just not worth the \nsubstantial national security and economic costs of exercising those \noptions. Make no mistake about it: cost assessments have been and will \ncontinue to be crucial to national leaders around the world in making \nsuch decisions.\n  We will not come any closer to witnessing the dawn of that new day, \nhowever, if we continue on our current course of incrementally \nweakening the costs we impose for proliferation where it occurs. I \nremain concerned that while today's step is quite modest and \nincremental, the overall tendency is one that is suggestive of a \nweakening of America's resolve to pursue vigorously its key \nnonproliferation goals. Last week we gave the Senate's blessing to the \ndisposal of licensing requirements for computers that were used in \nmaking hydrogen bombs. Today we loosen sanctions on Pakistan despite \nits ongoing nuclear and missile programs. Where will this process lead \ntomorrow?\n  That is the question that remains unanswered by today's legislation. \nIt is a question that I surely hope is on the minds of each Member of \nCongress and the relevant offices in the Executive. Indeed, this is a \nquestion that should be on the minds of all Americans.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     U.S. Aid Policies and Pakistan's Bomb: What Were We Trying to \n                              Accomplish?\n\n       Letters to Congress from Presidents Reagan & Bush, 1985-\n     1989, required under sec. 620(e) of Foreign Assistance Act \n     (Pressler Amendment)--``The proposed United States assistance \n     program for Pakistan remains extremely important in reducing \n     the risk that Pakistan will develop and ultimately possess \n     such a device. I am convinced that our security relationship \n     and assistance program are the most effective means available \n     for us to dissuade Pakistan from acquiring nuclear explosive \n     devices. Our assistance program is designed to help Pakistan \n     address its substantial and legitimate security needs, \n     thereby both reducing incentives and creating disincentives \n     for Pakistani acquisition of nuclear explosives.''--President \n     George Bush, 10/5/89; President Ronald Reagan, 11/18/88; 12/\n     17/87; 10/27/86; & 11/25/85.\n       President George Bush, letter to Congress (addressed to J. \n     Danforth Quayle as President of the Senate), 12 April 1991, \n     urging abandonment of Pressler certification requirement: ``. \n     . . my intention is to send the strongest possible message to \n     Pakistan and other potential proliferators that \n     nonproliferation is among the highest priorities of my \n     Administration's foreign policy, irrespective of whether such \n     a policy is required by law.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Teresita Schaffer, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 2 August 1989: ``None of \n     the F-16's Pakistan already owns or is about to purchase is \n     configured for nuclear delivery . . . a Pakistan with a \n     credible conventional deterrent will be less motivated to \n     purchase a nuclear weapons capability.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 2 August 1989: \n     ``Finally, we believe that past and continued American \n     support for Pakistan's conventional defense reduces the \n     likelihood that Pakistan will feel compelled to cross the \n     nuclear threshold.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Peck, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 17 February 1988: ``We \n     believe that the improvements in Pakistan's conventional \n     military forces made possible by U.S. assistance and the U.S. \n     security commitment our aid program symbolizes have had a \n     significant influence on Pakistan's decision to forego the \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons.''\n       Special Ambassador at Large Richard Kennedy, testimony \n     before two House subcommittees, 22 October 1987: ``We have \n     made it clear that Pakistan must show restraint in its \n     nuclear program if it expects us to continue providing \n     security assistance.''\n       Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy, testimony \n     before Senate subcommittee, 18 March 1987: ``Our assistance \n     relationship is designed to advance both our non-\n     proliferation and our strategic objectives relating to \n     Afghanistan. Development of a close and reliable security \n     partnership with Pakistan gives Pakistan an alternative to \n     nuclear weapons to meet its legitimata security needs and \n     strengthens our influence on Pakistan's nuclear decision \n     making. Shifting to a policy of threats and public \n     ultimata would in our view decrease, not increase our \n     ability to continue to make a contribution to preventing a \n     nuclear arms race in South Asia. Undermining the \n     credibility of the security relationship with the U.S. \n     would itself create incentives for Pakistan to ignore our \n     concerns and push forward in the direction of nuclear \n     weapons acquisition.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Howard Schaffer, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 6 February 1984: ``The \n     assistance program also contributes to U.S. nuclear non-\n     proliferation goals. We believe strongly that a program of \n     support which enhances Pakistan's sense of security helps \n     remove the principal underlying incentive for the acquisition \n     of a nuclear weapons capability. The Government of Pakistan \n     understands our deep concern over this issue. We have made \n     clear that the relationship between our two countries, and \n     the program of military and economic assistance on which it \n     rests, are ultimately inconsistent with Pakistan's \n     development of a nuclear explosives device. President Zia has \n     stated publicly that Pakistan will not manufacture a nuclear \n     explosives device.''\n       Special Ambassador at Large Richard Kennedy, testimony \n     before two House subcommittees, 1 November 1983: ``By helping \n     friendly nations to address legitimate security concerns, we \n     seek to reduce incentives for the acquisition of nuclear \n     weapons. The provision of security assistance and the sale of \n     military equipment can be major components of efforts along \n     these lines. Development of security ties to the U.S. can \n     strengthen a country's confidence in its ability to defend \n     itself without nuclear weapons. At the same time, the \n     existence of such a relationship enhances our credibility \n     when we seek to persuade that country to forego [sic] nuclear \n     arms . . . We believe that strengthening Pakistan's \n     conventional military capability serves a number of important \n     U.S. interests, including non-proliferation. At the same \n     time, we have made clear to the government of Pakistan that \n     efforts to acquire nuclear explosives would jeopardize our \n     security assistance program.''\n       Statement by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Harry \n     Marshall, 12 September 1983, before International Nuclear Law \n     Association, San Francisco: ``U.S. assistance has permitted \n     Pakistan to strengthen its conventional defensive capability. \n     This serves to\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\n     bolster its stability and thus reduce its motivation for \n     acquiring nuclear explosives.''\n       President Ronald Reagan, report to Congress pursuant to \n     sec. 601 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (``601 \n     Report''), for calendar year 1982--``Steps were taken to \n     strengthen the U.S. security relationship with Pakistan with \n     the objective of addressing that country's security needs and \n     thereby reducing any motivation for acquiring nuclear \n     explosives.''\n       President Ronald Reagan, report to Congress pursuant to \n     sec. 601 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (``601 \n     Report''), for calendar year 1981--``Military assistance by \n     the United States and the establishment of a new security \n     relationship with Pakistan should help to counteract its \n     possible motivations toward acquiring nuclear weapons . . . \n     Moreover, help from the United States in \n     strengthening Pakistan's conventional military \n     capabilities would offer the best available means for \n     counteracting possible motivations toward acquiring \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       Assistant Secretary of State James Malone, address before \n     Atomic Industrial Forum, San Francisco, 1 December 1981: ``We \n     believe that this assistance--which is in the strategic \n     interest of the United States--will make a significant \n     contribution to the well-being and security of Pakistan and \n     that it will be recognized as such by that government. We \n     also believe that, for this reason, it offers the best \n     prospect of deterring the Pakistanis from proceeding with the \n     testing or acquisition of nuclear explosives.''\n       Undersecretary of State James Buckley, testimony before \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 12 November 1981: ``We \n     believe that a program of support which provides Pakistan \n     with a continuing relationship with a significant security \n     partner and enhances its sense of security may help remove \n     the principal underlying incentive for the acquisition of a \n     nuclear weapons capability. With such a relationship in place \n     we are hopeful that over time we will be able to persuade \n     Pakistan that the pursuit of a weapons capability is neither \n     necessary to its security nor in its broader interest as an \n     important member of the world community.''\n       Testimony of Undersecretary of State, James Buckley, in \n     response to question from Sen. Glenn, Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, 12 November 1981, on effects of a \n     nuclear detonation on continuation of cash sales of F-16's: \n     ``[Sen. Glenn] . . . so if Pakistan detonates a nuclear \n     device before completion of the F-16 sale, will the \n     administration cut off future deliveries?\n       ``[Buckley] Again, Senator, we have underscored the fact \n     that this would dramatically affect the relationship. The \n     cash sales are part of that relationship. I cannot see \n     drawing lines between the impact in the case of a direct cash \n     sale versus a guaranteed or U.S.-financed sale.''\n       Undersecretary of State James Buckley, letter to NY Times, \n     25 July 1981: ``In place of the ineffective sanctions on \n     Pakistan's nuclear program imposed by the past \n     Administration, we hope to address through conventional means \n     the sources of insecurity that prompt a nation like Pakistan \n     to seek a nuclear capability in the first place.''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                 [From Nucleonics Week, April 24, 1997]\n\n  PAEC Official Says China Will Make Key Parts, Finish Chashma by 1999\n\n                            (By Mark Hibbs)\n\n       Tokyo.--Pakistan's first imported PWR will be finished by \n     the end of 1998, and contain equipment which China imported \n     for its prototype PWR at Qinshan but which Chinese firms have \n     since learned to make, according to Parvez Butt, a member of \n     the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).\n       Butt described the 300-MW PWR at Chashma as 70% complete in \n     terms of both cost and equipment installed. Still to be \n     installed are reactor internals.\n       For Qinshan-1, the reactor vessel and internals and steam \n     generator tubing were manufactured in Japan, Germany, France, \n     Sweden, and Britain. At that time, Western industry firms \n     involved in making the equipment claimed that China did not \n     have the metallurgical know-how needed to make all the \n     equipment needed to replicate the plant in Pakistan (NW, 6 \n     Feb. '92, 2). South Korean officials said in 1995 that Korea \n     Heavy Industry & Construction Co. Ltd. (KHIC) had been \n     approached to make the vessel, since it is already \n     manufacturing vessels for China's larger indigenous PWRs at \n     Qinshan, but the idea was dropped when Seoul applied to join \n     the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NW, 28 Sept. '95, 1).\n       Butt said that the pressure vessel for Chashma-1 was made \n     at a factory in northern China and has been undergoing \n     testing since October. Butt said the vessel would be ``ready \n     soon'' and would conform to international quality standards. \n     According to French industry sources, China sought to make \n     larger pressure vessels for the next French-supplied PWRs to \n     be build in Guangdong Province, but experts at Framatome \n     refused, citing quality concerns.\n       The steam generators for Chashma-1 will be made by Shanghai \n     Boiler Works, and Shanghai Turbine Works will make the \n     turbine generator. The unit's two main circulation pumps will \n     also be provided by Chinese firms. Instrumentation and \n     control (I) equipment is of Chinese design, Butt said, and \n     will be manufactured by Chinese firms in Shanghai and \n     Beijing.\n       Butt said China will also provide the first core and three \n     reloads, using Chinese uranium enriched and fabricated into \n     fuel in China.

One official monitoring \n     nuclear developments in Pakistan told Nucleonics Week instead \n     that ``all the data at hand indicates that the reactor is \n     still cold.''\n       Two weeks ago, the Pakistani English-language newspaper \n     Dawn asserted that the reactor is finished and has started \n     up, but cannot produce electricity or reach full power \n     because of a shortage of heavy water (NW, 19 June, 15).\n       Western officials conjectured that the Pakistani claim may \n     have been triggered by a construction milestone at the \n     reactor site or planted in response to recent reports that \n     India has deployed the Prithvi ballistic missile.\n       In 1994, Western officials told Nucleonics Week that \n     Pakistan was building a plutonium production reactor, rated \n     at between 50 and 70 megawatts thermal, at a site near \n     Khushab. These sources later added that intelligence pointed \n     to construction of a fuel fabrication or reprocessing center \n     near the reactor (NW, 22 Feb. '96, 6). As late as this April, \n     however, a member of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission \n     denied flatly that the reactor existed.\n       According to one U.S. official this week, however, the \n     Khushab reactor ``is definitely out there'' but not scheduled \n     to be finished ``until later this year or sometime in 1998.'' \n     Another official said that, under the most optimistic \n     schedule, completion of the reactor ``is several months \n     away.'' Sources indicated that the reactor had not yet \n     undergone cold testing, let alone become critical.\n       The Pakistani report suggested that the reactor would be \n     used for electricity production as well as for isotope \n     production. Recent surveillance photographs of the site, \n     however, do not indicate that Pakistan is building power grid \n     infrastructure, such as turbine generator equipment, for \n     electricity generation. Moreover, Western officials said, it \n     is not believed the reactor's chief purpose is isotope or \n     silica production, as stated in the Pakistani account. \n     Pakistan has a technical cooperation program with the IAEA \n     for these activities, ``but none of this has got anything to \n     do with Khushab,'' one Vienna official said, and the IAEA \n     ``has not been informed'' by Pakistan that the reactor is \n     under construction or that Pakistan plans to incorporate the \n     unit into its existing technical cooperation program.\n       Sources said that, because Pakistan is facing a massive \n     financial crisis, the U.S. and other creditor countries \n     supporting the International Monetary Fund are trying to \n     leverage Islamabad to keep the reactor from operating outside \n     of IAEA safeguards. Zia Mian, a research fellow at the Union \n     of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass., observed, ``If \n     Pakistan were to start operating the reactor now, it would be \n     taking a very major foreign policy step,'' demonstrating to \n     the world that its unsafeguarded program is going forward \n     regardless of U.S. opposition, and escalating military \n     nuclear activities to include significant plutonium \n     production.\n\n\n                     indian report also unconfirmed\n\n       U.S. officials last week confirmed the assertion by Dawn \n     that a critical factor which may indefinitely delay full-\n     power operation of Khushab is shortage of heavy water. But \n     they did not confirm recurring Indian reports that China, \n     which the U.S. believes to have supported construction of \n     Khushab, also provided heavy water for it. According to \n     Western intelligence sources, a full inventory of heavy water \n     for the unit would be about 15-20 metric tons (MT), though it \n     could go critical with a smaller amount.\n       Indian sources said that, in 1996, China sold Pakistan 40 \n     MT for Khushab, U.S. officials said the Indian government had \n     told Washington this recently, but U.S. government agencies \n     ``could not confirm'' the Indian assertion. A U.S. official \n     said last week that, when New Delhi made the allegations to \n     Washington, the U.S. ``went back to the Chinese on this'' and \n     received assurances from Beijing that Chinese entities did to \n     sell heavy water to Pakistan for Khushab.\n       U.S. officials said Indian allegations of Chinese heavy \n     water trading with Pakistan were first made during the 1970s, \n     and the most recent claims were initially taken seriously \n     because there is evidence of past Chinese heavy water sales \n     to both India and Pakistan.\n       Last year, the Department of State, now negotiating a \n     resumption of nuclear commerce with China, asserted to the \n     U.S. Congress that as of May 1996, China was not assisting \n     any unsafeguarded foreign nuclear programs. Despite the \n     Indian claims, U.S. officials last week continued to back \n     China's nonproliferation credentials. ``That means nothing \n     has gone to Khushab,'' since mid-1996, ``and no heavy \n     water,'' one U.S. official involved said June 26.\n       According to the Pakistani report, administrative \n     difficulties in Pakistan had prevented heavy water from being \n     allocated for the Khushab reactor. Sources told Nucleonics \n     Week that, in fact, most of Pakistan's scarce heavy water \n     resources have, over the last two years, been allocated for \n     the Kanupp PHWR, which generates electricity under IAEA \n     safeguards. That allocation, sources said, reflected a \n     general policy by Pakistan under former prime minister \n     Benazir Bhutto not to take any steps, such as producing high-\n     enriched uranium (HEU) at the Kahuta centrifuge enrichment \n     plant, which would be seen by Washington as provocative and \n     escalating regional nuclear tension. One source said, \n     ``Keeping heavy water at Kanupp and away from Khushab should \n     be seen by Washington as going hand-in-hand with not \n     enriching uranium to HEU.''\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nHarkin amendment which restores OPIC, IMET, Trade and Development \nAssistance [TDA], and democracy-building institutions in Pakistan.\n  This amendment provides us with a unique opportunity to strengthen \nand solidify our relationship with Pakistan. Pakistan is a friendly \ncountry and vitally important to the United States. By restoring these \nprograms, we can influence the course that Pakistan's economic and \npolitical reforms take and improve the continuity of its democratic \ngovernment.\n  Pakistan has made great strides in these areas, and Prime Minister \nSharif's election signals a turning point in Pakistani politics. As he \nmoves to improve the quality of his country's government, the United \nStates should provide the support necessary. Prime Minister Sharif has \nsponsored changes in the Pakistani constitution to end the President's \npower to dismiss the elected government. In the economic sphere, his \ngovernment has embarked on an ambitious reform program intended to \nstabilize the economy. These are positive developments, but we need to \nencourage Pakistan to go even further. Our own Secretary of State has \nmet with the Pakistani Foreign Minister to discuss options for more \nextensive reforms.\n  It is in the United States' best interests to train Pakistani \nofficials in how to conduct legislative procedure and build lasting \ndemocratic institutions. It is also in our best economic interests to \nresume OPIC support for investment in Pakistan. Prominent U.S. business \nleaders have expressed their support for such an initiative, and I \nbelieve this option can benefit U.S. industry. The United States will \nbe in a prime position to support economic reform in Pakistan, as well \nas compete for investment and trade opportunities there. We cannot, and \nshould not, penalize U.S. companies looking to expand into this area of \nthe world.\n  Neither should we jeopardize our stated goal of promoting nuclear \nnonproliferation. We have worked to prevent the nuclear arms race in \nSouth Asia, and future cooperation with Pakistan is now at stake. \nRestoring IMET in Pakistan is perhaps the best means we have of \nensuring that nonproliferation becomes a reality. The Pakistani \nmilitary controls the country's nuclear programs, but an entire \ngeneration of military officers has been denied access to training in \nthe United States. By prohibiting IMET, we have succeeded in reducing \nour contacts within the leadership and limiting their exposure to U.S. \nvalues and institutions. If we allow IMET to resume, we will strengthen \nour position on nonproliferation by encouraging a Pakistani military \nthat is as pro-United States as possible. Improved relations with \nPakistan can only help our future nonproliferation efforts.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this amendment, and \nI look forward to a close relationship with Pakistan in the future.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not aware of any opposition to the amendment on \nour side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. None here.\n  We are ready to move forward, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 890.\n\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that the nondiscriminatory \n     treatment extended to the People's Republic of China on May \n     29, 1997, pursuant to section 402(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     should be withdrawn.''\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I offer amendment No. 890 to the \nforeign operations appropriations bill. This amendment which is a sense \nof the Senate, would disapprove the MFN status, most-favored-nation \nstatus, to the nation of China. I have opposed the renewal of MFN to \nChina. On June 3 of this year I became an original cosponsor of Senate \nJoint Resolution 31, the legislation disapproving the extension of MFN.\n  Unfortunately, because of the joint resolution of disapproval in the \nHouse, which failed to pass the House of Representatives on June 24, as \nin past years or at least recent years, the Senate has not considered \nand has not had the opportunity to weigh in on and to voice its concern \nabout the conditions in China, and particularly to cast a vote on the \nMFN status for China.\n  Today we will have that opportunity with this sense of the Senate. It \nhas been almost 4 years, Mr. President, since the United States \nformally delinked the issues of trade and human rights with regard to \nChina. Four years ago when we delinked, when we embarked upon our \npolicy of constructive engagement, the logic was that greater trade, \ngreater economic expansion within China itself, would result in \npolitical freedom, greater political freedom, less repression, more \nopportunity for the people of China.\n  The fact is, by every measure, the record of the Chinese Government \non human rights has worsened since the time that we embarked upon this \npolicy delinking trade and human rights. Whether you look at the \ncrackdown on people of faith within China, whether you look at the \npractice of forced abortions, forced sterilization of the mentally \nhandicapped, the near extinction of the expression of any opinion that \nwould be contrary to the established line of the Communist Government \nin Beijing, by any measure, conditions are worse, freedoms are less, \noppression is greater than it was 4 years ago when we started this \npolicy of constructive engagement.\n  In fact, according to the 1996 country report issued by our own State \nDepartment, the U.S. State Department said that the Chinese Communist \nleaders have succeeded in silencing every known political dissident. \nMr. President, that is every dissident, every free voice, every voice \nof dissent, every contrary opinion to the party line has now been \nextinguished in Communist China either through exile, through death, or \nthrough imprisonment.\n  So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that our current policy of \ncontinuing normal trade relations without regard to human rights \nconditions has been ineffective in stemming this very alarming trend in \nChina by turning a blind eye to the atrocities or abdicating our \nresponsibility as a great and a free nation.\n\n  As we have continued to extend China's MFN status, insufficient \nprogress has been made in opening the vast Chinese market to the \nAmerican companies. The argument has been free trade, increased \neconomic expansion. While our imports from China have increased \ndramatically during the last 4 years, the amount of goods we export to \nChina has grown at a much, much smaller rate.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, China utilizes a vast prison system manned \nwith slave labor to produce many products which are exported to the \nWest. It is unfair to ask American laborers, American workers, to \ncompete with the slave labor of Communist China. I believe in free \ntrade. This is not free trade that we have currently. Soldiers of the \nPeople's Liberation Army stand guard atop the towers of the slave labor \ncamps, known as Laogai. The PLA controls, either directly or \nindirectly, a significant portion of the Chinese industry. In fact, \naccording to our CIA, thousands of industries that we are trading with \non a routine basis are controlled by the People's Liberation Army. That \nis not free trade. It is not fair trade. It is not right.\n  Mr. President, it is believed that many of these industries are \ninvolved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms \nsmuggling, economic espionage, use of forced labor, piracy of \nintellectual property, and misinformation of sensitive military \ntechnology.\n  Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues, perhaps many of my \ncolleagues, feel that this amendment is something they would rather not \nvote on. This sense of the Senate is something they would rather not \nhave to go on the record on. I think that we are dealing with foreign \noperations. Section 524 of this bill bars indirect assistance to many \ncountries, including China. So it is relevant. It is germane. It is \nimportant that the U.S. Senate have an opportunity to voice our \nconcerns. It is a sense of Senate. It is not binding. It is important \nwe send that signal.\n  We may not be able this year--we cannot, obviously, because of the \nHouse action--we may not be able to deny MFN status, but we can send a \nsignal, and we should.\n  To my colleagues I say there are people watching. The Chinese \nGovernment is watching what this Chamber does. The Chinese people are \nwatching. We can send a message that we do not condone the practices, \nthe oppressive totalitarian practices of this government. We can, at \nthe same time, to the tens of thousands, yes, the tens of millions of \nChinese who are facing that oppression today, we can say to them there \nare those in America who stand with them and who will support them in \ntheir fight for freedom.\n  I know, Mr. President, that there are many bills that have been \nintroduced to deal with China, and I hope that we will deal with that. \nI hope we will take those bills, whether Senator Brownback's, Senator \nAbraham's, or whoever may have introduced legislation to address the \nChina question, and we will put that into some kind of omnibus bill in \nfuture weeks to send an even stronger message. Until then, this is our \nopportunity. This is our chance to, once again, give a voice to \nAmerican foreign policy. This is our opportunity to say to the world \nand to say to the Chinese Government, America still stands for \nsomething, that we do not have a foreign policy void of value, that \nthose values we espouse, which are embodied in our founding documents \nand in our very Constitution, live on, today, in the policy that we \nadvocate toward China.\n  I know there were many who breathed a sigh of relief in the U.S. \nSenate when MFN went down in the House of Representatives. There was a \nsense of ``we're off the hook.'' I say to all of those of my colleagues \nwho have decried the conditions in China today, I say to all of my \ncolleagues who in one form or another have said it is wrong what they \nare doing over there, to remember that while we may have been off the \nhook, there are tens of thousands of Chinese people in prison camps \ntoday who are still on the hook, this is our chance to give them the \nvoice that their government has denied them.\n  I ask my colleagues to look deep within their soul, to look at their \nconscience, and I ask them to vote in favor of this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution disapproving of most-favored-nation status for China.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say in response to the amendment \nof my colleague from Arkansas, I and a number of other Members of the \nSenate were in Hong Kong a couple of weeks ago. I raise Hong Kong--even \nthough I know the sense-of-the-Senate amendment deals with China--I \nraise Hong Kong because I think Hong Kong is the best hope for China. \nHong Kong is going to lead the way to a new China, and a new China is \nalready developing, which is not to say that any of us are entirely \nhappy about everything going on in the People's Republic of China, but \na lot of good things are happening, particularly on the economic side. \nNo one in Hong Kong, not even Martin Lee and all of the democratic \nreformers that many of us know, is in favor of terminating MFN for \nChina. You cannot find anybody in Hong Kong who thinks terminating MFN \nfor China is a way to promote a better, more democratic, more open \nChina.\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\n  So with all due respect to my friend and colleague from Arkansas, I \nthink we have worked our way through this MFN debate. The President of \nthe United States, as we all know, in 1992, when he ran, thought that \nMFN for China ought to be linked to human rights and democracy evolving \nin China, and as soon as the election was over, he took a closer look \nat it and he changed his mind. I must say I give him credit for \nchanging his mind because I don't think this will bring about the kind \nof positive reform in terms of human rights and democracy in China that \nwe would all hope.\n  What is changing China--unquestionably what is changing China--is \neconomic reform. So I hope we will not support the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. I think it would be a step in the wrong \ndirection. I know there are other colleagues who share my view.\n  I see Senator Feinstein on her feet now. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and \nI thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity.\n  I didn't come to the floor prepared to speak on this amendment. I \ncame to speak on a another amendment. Having said that, I must say I am \nsorry this sense-of-the-Senate amendment has been raised. I think it \nwould be a big mistake to pass this sense of the Senate that would \nessentially say to the People's Republic of China, ``we are going to \nisolate you from the rest of the world.'' Make no mistake about it, \nthat is what this amendment says.\n  Anyone that has had a look at China knows that, historically, China \nhas never wanted to interrelate with the rest of the world. Those of us \nwho were in Hong Kong for the handover heard many comments about the \nBritish occupation of Hong Kong as a kind of bounty from the opium wars \nwhere Britain forced on China the opium trade, and the whole British \ncontrol of Hong Kong as a colony developed from that time.\n  Having said that, the question is, really, is anything productive \nsolved by forcing China into a position of isolationism, strengthening \nthe hard-liners in China, providing a setback to the development of the \nrule of law and, most importantly, providing a setback to the economic \ndemocracy that is now developing all throughout the eastern seaports of \nthe People's Republic of China? My answer to that is no. My answer to \nthat is it signals to China that, effectively, Senate policy at the \nvery least would be to try to contain China, isolate China, and not \nallow China to be a normal trading party with the United States of \nAmerica. Internationally, that signals catastrophe.\n  Now, what does it mean for the United States? For the United States, \nand as a Californian, in my State, with one-third of our economy now \ndependent on Asia--not necessarily on China, but Asia--it means a loss \nof jobs. For the rest of the United States, it means a loss of jobs. \nThe Senator from Kentucky just alluded to what it would mean for Hong \nKong. He alluded to the fact that we heard no democratic leader say MFN \nshould be denied China. Exactly the opposite. We heard democratic \nleaders in Hong Kong saying to deny China MFN would negatively impact \nthe people of Hong Kong.\n  They estimate it would take economic growth and cut it by half, from \n5 percent to 2\\1/2\\ percent. They say that it would cost up to 86,000 \njobs in Hong Kong, and that even a partial cancellation, even a 6-month \nextension, would create a kind of uncertainty that would disturb the \nmarket in Hong Kong.\n  I think it is misguided to think you can deny a nation as large as \nChina, the largest nation in the world, normal trading relations--not \nspecial trading relations, nothing special about it, but normal trading \nrelations--and do anything other than shoot ourselves in the foot, \nbecause a whole ripple effect would be felt throughout the United \nStates. And the flip side in China would be the growing isolation, the \nhard-liners being able to say, ``I told you so.''\n  Right now in China it is widely speculated that the next premier will \nbe a man whose name is Zhu Rongji. He was at one time the mayor of \nShanghai. I know him. He also is the author of the marketplace economy \nfor China. He supported Shanghai as the first independent economic \nzone, which really was the first of these dynamic economic zones, and \nthen, second, he has supervised an amazing transformation of the \nmarketplace.\n  Today, only 50 percent of the companies in China are wholly owned by \nthe central government. It used to be 100 percent of the companies were \nowned by the central government; 25 percent of these are in private \nhands today. They are becoming more competitive, more efficient. Sure, \nit is difficult because the big employers of China are the centrally \nowned companies. So it takes time.\n  In direct response to the distinguished Senator's concern about human \nrights--because I share these concerns very, very much--I have been \ntrying for 6 years now, almost twice a year, to get the Chinese \nGovernment just to sit down with the Dalai Lama, just to try to come to \nterms with him with respect to cultural and economic preservation of \nTibetans within Tibet. So far, I have not been successful. I don't \nexpect to stop trying.\n  But during the 6-year period, what I have noticed has been \ninteresting within the rest of China. What I have noticed is a growth \nin the rule of law. What I have noticed is that the Chinese are now \neager to modernize their commercial codes, their criminal codes. The \nnext step needs to be an independent judiciary; by this, I mean \nindependent from party control, a judiciary that is paid well, that is \nseen to be independent. Qiao Shi, head of the National People's \nCongress, proposed a limitation of administrative detention today in \nChina--picking up an individual, and holding them in custody cannot be \ndone for more than 30 days. That is a step forward.\n  China has lived for 5,000 years under the rule of man; the rule of \nlaw is going to take some time. I commend the distinguished Senator for \nhis commitment to this issue. If he had visited China in the late \nsixties or the early seventies, when Richard Nixon went to China and \nnegotiated the Shanghai communique in 1972, it was a very much more \nconstricted China. No one would have talked to the distinguished \nSenator. Everybody dressed alike. Everybody marched to the sound of the \nsame drummer. The red books of the Cultural Revolution were still \nevident on the streets. The music still blared every morning. The \ncontrols were evident.\n  It is a very different China today. None of that is true today. \nPeople will talk. They will say what they think. There is a freer \nlifestyle. There is an improved standard of living. I believe that if \nyou have an economic democracy, a social democracy will follow one day, \njust as sure as the sun comes up every morning, because the more people \nsee the economic marketplace, the freedom that trade gives them, the \nincreased educational levels, the benefit it produces, they then enter \ninto the dialog and they learn about other cultures.\n  So I believe that from the days of the 1960's, of the Cultural \nRevolution and its aftermath, really lasting up to 1979, 1980, in the \nensuing 17 years after 1980, there have been major changes within \nChina. What we need to do is engage China, send working teams over on a \nregular basis, sit down with Chinese leaders, enable them to understand \nhow our Government works and what our concerns are and what our \nnational interests are and, I think, bring China into the mainstream of \nworld leadership, not isolate it. Nothing sends a message of \nisolationism and containment for China more strongly than denying \nnormal trading relations.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment should be defeated. It will \nnot bring about a positive result for the ends that both the \ndistinguished Senator and I would like to see.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to my \ndistinguished colleagues from Kentucky and California. I feel \ncompelled, as I listen to the arguments that have been raised over and \nover again, and particularly the phrase that ``it is a different China \ntoday.''\n  Well, it is not my opinion that I am citing today. It is our own \nState Department's 1996 country report on the conditions in China. So I \nremind my colleagues on the floor right now that our State Department, \nin looking at China, said, yes, it is a different China;\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nthe difference is that 8 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, \nafter those brave students stood in front of those tanks, there is not \none remaining independent free voice in China today. That is our State \nDepartment. Every dissident has either been killed or imprisoned or \nexiled. There are none of those independent voices. That is the China \nthat exists today. That is what our State Department has said.\n  Now, the State Department had a new report they were going to issue. \nIt was supposed to have been out months ago. It was delayed. It was \nsupposed to have been out in June, and it has been further delayed \nuntil after the MFN votes were over. I wish the administration had \nordered that latest State Department report to be issued so that the \nMembers of the Senate could see what the latest evaluation of the \nconditions in China really are. The latest we have, in the 1996 country \nreport, is that there are no free voices in China today.\n  Now, they say we will isolate China. The same ones who say we are \ngoing to isolate China will say we can't deny MFN because they will \nsend all of those goods to Europe, they will find markets for their \nproducts in Europe. Let me assure my colleagues, you will not isolate \none-fifth of the world's population. And it is a self-contradictory \nargument to say we dare not isolate them or we will deny our American \ncitizens these goods.\n  Now, my dear colleague and distinguished friend from Kentucky said \nMr. Clinton had changed his mind when he got elected. Indeed, he did. \nHe commended him for his change of mind. Well, I criticize him for his \nchange of mind. I think he was right when he was a candidate. He then \nsaid that it was intolerable that we, as a people of conviction and \nvalues, should stand by and close our eyes to what is going on in \nChina. So I regret that he made that change, as he has made changes in \nmany other policies.\n  Well, then they say, ``It just takes time, just give them time,'' and \nif we will give them time, my colleagues say, we will see political \nfreedom, an increase in their economic opportunities and, as sure as \nday follows night, political freedom will come. Mr. President, I have \nbeen waiting for 4 years. I have been waiting for 4 years for one \nscintilla of evidence to support that notion. If I could have found \njust the slightest indication that things were getting better in China, \nI would have voted for MFN to encourage those positive changes. But by \nevery measure, it has gotten worse, and every objective observer, from \nAmnesty International, to Family Research Council, to our own State \nDepartment, has said it's worse.\n  So how can we continue to say, well, business as usual, and if we \nkeep on giving them time, it will get better, when, so far, every time \nthey have thumbed their nose at what we have done. Then we hear that no \none calls for it if you go to Hong Kong. I don't know about that, but I \ndo know that if you were in mainland China today, you could not call \nfor it because, if you dared, you would be imprisoned and you would \nrisk your very life and the lives of your loved ones. There are no \ndissidents left.\n  So to my colleagues I say, the vote on this amendment is very simple: \nto embrace the policy of profits and appeasement, or to embrace the \npolicy of principle and principled challenge to those who would abuse \nand persecute and execute their own citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Arkansas regarding MFN status for China. \nThis issue is of immense importance to Washington State and the Nation.\n  As a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I must state for \nthe record that I believe that this is not the appropriate forum for \nthis amendment. The Senator from Arkansas has chosen to spring upon the \nSenate--with little notice--his amendment to fundamentally alter our \nrelationship with the world's most populous nation.\n  I am sure the Senator knows that the House of Representatives \nrecently followed the process established by the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to overturn the President's decision to renew most-favored \nnation status for the People's Republic of China. The House of \nRepresentatives in strong bipartisan fashion rejected the effort to \noverturn the President of the United States. I applaud the House for \ntaking this action. The House vote in favor of MFN followed extensive \nhearings, much thoughtful debate, and considerable input from our \nconstituents, the business community, and the Clinton administration.\n  While this is not a new issue to many in the Senate, the Senator from \nArkansas now asks the U.S. Senate go on record on this important \nstrategic issue on the wrong bill without the benefits of adequate \ndebate and thorough consideration. I don't believe this is the way to \nmake good policy, and particularly on the United States-China \nrelationship which is perhaps the most important, most difficult and \nmost challenging relationship for United States policy makers to \nmanage.\n  I applaud Senator Hutchison's interest in the United States-China \nrelationship. In fact, I share many of the concerns that he in his \narguments has outlined. But I differ in his prescription for addressing \nthe problems in the United States-China relationship. I don't believe \nending MFN or normal trade ties with China will advance United States \ninterests. Rather, I believe the approach prescribed by opponents of \nMFN would for all intensive purposes end our relationship with China. \nFor my State, this would be disastrous.\n  Chinese students--some of whom will become future government leaders \nin China--will likely discontinue their studies at universities in this \ncountry including at the Henry Jackson School of International Affairs \nat the University of Washington.\n  As many as 400 Washington State families might lose the ability to \nadopt a young Chinese girl in the coming year as a result of this \namendment.\n  The Reverend Ned Graham and his East Gates Mininstries based in \nSumner, WA, could see its mission in China curtailed or possibly ended \naltogether. East Gates Ministries has distributed nearly 2 million \nBibles printed in Chinese dialects throughout China. Other Washington \nState faith-based ministries are active in China and could see their \nactivities halted if the Senate agrees to this amendment.\n  I recently traveled to Hong Kong and China to discuss candidly the \nissues like MFN, the World Trade Organization, Hong Kong's reversion to \nChinese sovereignty, the trade imbalance between the United States and \nChina, my personal concerns on human rights, and numerous other issues.\n  In Hong Kong, I met with officials from the U.S. Consulate, the \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce, the Hong Kong Government, and others. On \nthe street and in official meetings, I sought to determine the mood of \nthe people of the former British Colony prior to the reversion to \nChinese sovereignty. Again and again, I was encouraged to convey to the \nCongress the importance of MFN to Hong Kong. Virtually every leader \nfrom Hong Kong has communicated to Congress the devastating impact that \nMFN revocation would have on the island recently named the freest \neconomy in the world.\n  In my view, it is important for all who want to influence change in \nChina to recognize that Hong Kong's transition may be our best \nopportunity to further influence the mainland in such important areas \nas the rule of law, respect for individual rights, and the many \ndemocratic principles that we cherish in the United States.\n  In Beijing, I met with China's Vice Premier, Chinese Trade Ministry \nofficials, and Chinese leaders involved in financial services, \ntransportation, agriculture, electronics, and aviation. I also spent a \nsignificant amount of time with U.S. Ambassador Jim Sasser, our former \nSenate colleague. Ambassador Sasser, who was a China critic as a member \nof this body, now adamantly supports the renewal of MFN status for \nChina.\n  In my meeting with Vice Premier Li Lanqing, I focused on the trade \nimbalance between the United States and China, my concerns and those of \nmy constituents on human rights, and the importance of China abiding by \nits commitments to Hong Kong.\n  I also discussed the Chinese counterparts many other issues important \nto us, including the growth of the Internet in China, the competitive \nadvantage of Washington State's ports and transportation \ninfrastructure, the\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nfuture energy needs of China, food security issues, including China's \nability to feed its own people, problems associated with large, \nunproductive state-owned enterprises and growth patterns in coastal and \nrural parts of China.\n  My point in discussing my trip to China tonight is quite simple: If \nthe Senate adopts the Hutchinson amendment, it will have disastrous \nconsequences on the United States-China relationship. I believe it will \nthreaten our very ability to dialog with the Chinese on all of the \nissues I have just outlined.\n  If the opponents of MFN truly believe the Senate must go on record on \nthis issue, so be it. Let's do it in a responsible fashion with the \nproper consideration that an issue of this importance merits.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote against the Hutchinson \namendment. I believe it is unwise and irresponsible for the Senate to \naddress this issue in this fashion.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pursuant to a request by the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, the chairman of the committee and manager of the \nbill, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 900\n\n  (Purpose: To suspend temporarily the certification procedures under \nsection 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in order to foster \n  greater multilateral cooperation in international counternarcotics \n                               programs.)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kerrey, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 900.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 102, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n\n         temporary suspension of drug certification procedures\n\n       Sec. 575. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The international drug trade poses a direct threat to \n     the United States and to international efforts to promote \n     democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     combating the financial and other resources of the \n     multinational drug cartels, which resources threaten the \n     integrity of political and financial institutions both in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) Approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, \n     including 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, \n     and 9,800,000 marijuana users.\n       (4) Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic \n     and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n       (5) Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost the United \n     States approximately $67,000,000,000 in 1996, including costs \n     for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n       (6) Worldwide drug trafficking generates revenues estimated \n     at $400,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) The United States has spent more than $25,000,000,000 \n     for drug interdiction and source country counternarcotics \n     programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the \n     border, on the high seas, and in other countries, illegal \n     drugs from foreign sources are cheaper and more readily \n     available in the United States today than 20 years ago.\n       (8) The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 \n     Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 \n     Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and \n     Psychotropic Substances form the legal framework for \n     international drug control cooperation.\n       (9) The United Nations International Drug Control Program, \n     the International Narcotics Control Board, and the \n     Organization of American States can play important roles in \n     facilitating the development and implementation of more \n     effective multilateral programs to combat both domestic and \n     international drug trafficking and consumption.\n       (10) The annual certification process required by section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     which has been in effect since 1986, has failed to foster \n     bilateral or multilateral cooperation with United States \n     counternarcotics programs because its provisions are vague \n     and inconsistently applied and fail to acknowledge that \n     United States narcotics programs have not been fully \n     effective in combating consumption or trafficking in illegal \n     drugs, and related crimes, in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) existing United States domestic and international \n     counternarcotics program have not reduced the supply of \n     illegal drugs or significantly reduced domestic consumption \n     of such drugs;\n       (2) the President should appoint a high level task force of \n     foreign policy experts, law enforcement officials, and drug \n     specialists to develop a comprehensive program for addressing \n     domestic and international drug trafficking and drug \n     consumption and related crimes, with particular attention to \n     fashioning a multilateral framework for improving \n     international cooperation in combating illegal drug \n     trafficking, and should designate the Director of the Office \n     of National Drug Policy to chair the task force;\n       (3) the President should call upon the heads of state of \n     major illicit drug producing countries, major drug transit \n     countries, and major money laundering countries to establish \n     similar high level task forces to work in coordination with \n     the United States; and\n       (4) not later than one year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the President should call for the convening of an \n     international summit of all interested governments to be \n     hosted by the Organization of American States or another \n     international organization mutually agreed to by the parties, \n     for the purpose of reviewing the findings and recommendations \n     of the task forces referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) and \n     adopting a counternarcotics plan of action for each country.\n       (c) Suspension of Drug Certification Process.--(1) Section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     relating to annual certification procedures for assistance \n     for certain drug-producing and drug-transit countries, shall \n     not apply in 1998 and 1999.\n       (2) The President may waive the applicability of that \n     section in 2000 if the President determines that the waiver \n     would facilitate the enhancement of United States \n     international narcotics control programs.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 901 to Amendment No. 900\n\n              (Purpose: To perfect the pending amendment)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 901 to Amendment No. 900.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word in the pending amendment \n     and add in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SUSPENSION OF DRUG CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES.\n\n       Sec. 575. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The international drug trade poses a direct threat to \n     the United States and to international efforts to promote \n     democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     combating the financial and other resources of the \n     multinational drug cartels, which resources threaten the \n     integrity of political and financial institutions both in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) Approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, \n     including 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, \n     and 9,800,000 marijuana users.\n       (4) Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic \n     and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n       (5) Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost the United \n     States approximately $67,000,000,000 in 1996, including costs \n     for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n       (6) Worldwide drug trafficking generates revenues estimated \n     at $400,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) The United States has spent more than $25,000,000,000 \n     for drug interdiction and source country counternarcotics \n     programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the \n     border, on the high seas, and in other countries, illegal \n     drugs from foreign sources are cheaper and more readily \n     available in the United States today than 20 years ago.\n       (8) The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 \n     Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 \n     Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and \n     Psychotropic Substances form the legal framework for \n     international drug control cooperation.\n       (9) The United Nations International Drug Control Program, \n     the International Narcotics Control Board, and the \n     Organization of American States can play important roles in \n     facilitating the development and implementation of more \n     effective multilateral programs to combat both domestic and \n     international drug trafficking and consumption.\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\n       (10) The annual certification process required by section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     which has been in effect since 1986, has failed to foster \n     bilateral or multilateral cooperation with United States \n     counternarcotics programs because its provisions are vague \n     and inconsistently applied and fail to acknowledge that \n     United States narcotics programs have not been fully \n     effective in combating consumption or trafficking in illegal \n     drugs, and related crimes, in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) existing United States domestic and international \n     counternarcotics program have not reduced the supply of \n     illegal drugs or significantly reduced domestic consumption \n     of such drugs;\n       (2) the President should appoint a high level task force of \n     foreign policy experts, law enforcement officials, and drug \n     specialists to develop a comprehensive program for addressing \n     domestic and international drug trafficking and drug \n     consumption and related crimes, with particular attention to \n     fashioning a multilateral framework for improving \n     international cooperation in combating illegal drug \n     trafficking, and should designate the Director of the Office \n     of National Drug Policy to chair the task force;\n       (3) the President should call upon the heads of state of \n     major illicit drug producing countries, major drug transit \n     countries, and major money laundering countries to establish \n     similar high level task forces to work in coordination with \n     the United States;

Mr. President, I offered the second-degree amendment and it \ndoesn't substantially change the original amendment, but it is so that \nwe can have an up-or-down vote on the substance of the amendment I \noffered on behalf of myself, my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Lugar, Senator Domenici, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Hutchison, Senator Hagel, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. President, we believe that the approach contained in this \namendment will lead to a far more cooperative and effective effort to \nmeet the international threat posed by the international drug \ntrafficking that is occurring in our country and elsewhere around the \nglobe.\n  The pending amendment calls upon the President of the United States \nto establish a high-level interdisciplinary task force, under the \ndirection of General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, to develop a comprehensive strategy for \ndealing with the supply and demand side of the drug problem.\n  This amendment also urges the President of the United States to \nencourage other drug-producing, and transit countries to undertake \nsimilar efforts. Within a year's time, it calls for an international \nsummit to be held, at which time the efforts of all of the parties \nwould be merged into a multilateral battle plan to engage the illegal \ndrug trade on every front.\n  In order to create the kind of international cooperation and mutual \nrespect that must be present if this effort is to produce the results \nall of us desire, our amendment would also temporarily suspend, for 2 \nyears, the annual drug certification procedure while efforts are \nongoing to develop and implement a new strategy. It does not repeal the \ncertification process, but suspends it for 2 years in order to try this \nnew dynamic. Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, supports this amendment, as does the administration.\n  As you know, the issue of how best to construct and implement an \neffective counternarcotics policy has been the subject of much debate \nin this Chamber and, I add, much disagreement over the years. Our \nintention in offering this amendment today is to try and see if there \nisn't some way to end what has become a stale annual event, an event \nthat has not brought us one step closer to mounting a credible effort \nto eliminate or even contain the international drug Mafia.\n  We all can agree that drugs are a huge problem and a growing problem. \nIllegal drugs aren't some theoretical abstraction that only concerns \nMembers of Congress. Most American families know --many firsthand, \nunfortunately--the dangers inherent in the drug trade. They worry about \ntheir children, their schools, their streets, and their communities. \nThey know only too well the impact that unfettered drug gangs can have \non them, their families, and the towns in which they live.\n  We can all agree here, Mr. President, that there is an important \ninternational component to the drug menace. Drug kingpins have no \nrespect for international borders. They ply their trade clandestinely \nwherever the opportunities may arise. The international drug trade \nposes a direct threat, I argue, to the United States as a government \nhere at home, and to international efforts to promote democracy, \neconomic stability, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the \nglobe; but most especially, I think, here in our own hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, I have concerns about the international implications \nof the drug trade. Of even greater concern to me personally are the \neffects it is having here in the United States. Today, approximately \n12.8 million Americans use illegal drugs, including 1.5 million cocaine \nusers, 600,000 heroin addicts, and 9.8 million people who have used \nmarijuana.\n  This menace isn't just confined to our inner cities or the poor. \nIllegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic and socioeconomic \ngroup in this country. The human and economic costs are enormous and \nstaggering. Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost our Government \nand the taxpayers of this Nation approximately $67 billion in 1996, \nincluding costs for lost productivity, premature death, and \nincarceration.\n  The drug trade is an enormously lucrative business. Drug trafficking \ngenerates estimated revenues of $400 billion annually. Although often \nleft unstated, it is United States' demands for these illegal drugs \nwhich has been a driving force making drug trafficking the incredibly \nlucrative enterprise it has become. The principal focus of the U.S. \ninternational counternarcotics efforts has been to endeavor to go to \nthe source, to penetrate the narcotrafficking organizations that \ncontrol the production and distribution of drugs, and to dismantle \nthem. An important component of that international effort since 1986 \nhas also included as its centerpiece the so called ``annual \ncertification process.''\n  Mr. President, I commend those who authored the certification \nprocess. Their intent, as is the intent of us who offer this amendment, \nis the same; that is, to try and figure out a way to slow down this \ntraffic that pours into our country. Mr. President, I respectfully \nsuggest that, after 10 years, the certification process has not helped. \nTherefore, we are trying, through this amendment, a new process by \nwhich we might, hopefully, change the dynamic and reverse the present \ntrends that continue upward. The United States has spent more than $25 \nbillion since 1981 for foreign interdictions and source country \ncounternarcotics projects, and has been issuing an annual certification \nreport card since 1986.\n  Yet, despite these efforts, seizures at the borders, from the high \nseas, and other countries, foreign drugs are cheaper and more readily \navailable in the United States today than they were two decades ago. \nDrugs have continued to flood our neighborhoods and wreak havoc on our \nfamilies and our communities. I believe, as do my cosponsors of this \namendment, that it is time to be honest and to admit that our \ninternational drug strategy isn't working, and that means the entire \ncertification process.\n  Let's look at what some leading editorial pages have recently said \nabout certification; what the Nation's editorial pages say about drug \n``certification.''\n  The Washington Post:\n\n       Congress put the United States into the business of grading \n     other nations on their\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\n     performance in the war against drugs, and punishing those \n     found to fall short, back in 1986. ``Certification'' then \n     seemed an idea worth testing. It has now been tested. It's a \n     flop.\n\n  The Miami Herald, I quote:\n\n       Not surprisingly, both certified allies and decertified \n     pariah states have taken umbrage at this unilateral finger-\n     pointing by the world's largest consumer of illegal narcotics \n     * * * With certification on hold, the administration should \n     have time to craft a better policy.\n\n  San Francisco Chronicle:\n\n       Often obscured in the complexities of international \n     relations is the utter hypocrisy of the certification \n     process, in which the United States--the world's leading \n     consumer of illegal drugs--passes judgment on countries that \n     do not live up to our lofty standards of narcotics control * \n     * * If the United States, with all its power and riches, \n     cannot control or even diminish the demand for drugs within \n     its own borders, it is absurd to demand that much poorer \n     nations save us from ourselves * * * Congress should rethink \n     the world certification process and deal with international \n     problems on a country-by-country basis as the need arises * * \n     *\n\n  The Christian Science Monitor:\n\n       The U.S. and Mexico have every reason to be close partners \n     and friends--able to offer warranted criticism. The yearly \n     drug certification process is a very awkward, lopsided way of \n     delivering it.\n\n  Newsday:\n\n       The real issue now is whether the rationale for \n     certification has become so specious that the process has \n     become irrelevant. At the very least, the entire drug-\n     certification process needs to be reviewed.\n\n  The Boston Globe:\n\n       Certification is hypocritical and ineffective as a tool \n     against drugs. It should be abandoned * * * Certification is \n     largely blind to the contribution Americans themselves have \n     made to an international problem. Frustrations over how to \n     deal with that problem are not justification for pursuing \n     poor policies--and certification is doing more harm than \n     good.\n\n  Last, the New York Times:\n\n       The politicization of the debate is only one example of \n     what is wrong with the whole certification process. It began \n     in 1986 as a way to pressure supplier countries to fight \n     drugs. It has not been successful and should be abolished * * \n     * Latin Americans' resentment of the certification process \n     makes it counterproductive * * * The process does not capture \n     the ambiguities of cooperation * * * Certification is \n     ultimately dangerous because it contributes to the myth that \n     America's drug problem can best be fought overseas * * * \n     Instead of international certification, Washington should \n     examine how well its policies at home combat drugs.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of these \neditorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, June 16, 1997]\n\n                     Rethinking Drug Certification\n\n       The United States' annual rating of other countries' \n     sincerity and success in fighting the drug war has become a \n     case of good intentions gone awry. The tit-for-tat sanctions \n     of this blunt policy tool oversimplify complex issues and \n     fail to weigh policy nuances or competing national interests.\n       Legislation introduced last week by Sens. Christopher Dodd \n     (D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Arizona), and slated for a vote \n     in the Senate later this week, would suspend the \n     certification process for two years to allow the development \n     of more workable alternatives. It ought to be approved.\n       Last February's go-around over Mexico's certification \n     demonstrated just how problematic the process has become.\n       Mexico, which was in the middle of an epic drug-related \n     scandal, was certified. But Colombia, which had lost many \n     more lives and scored significant victories fighting the drug \n     cartels, was decertified.\n       It would have been absurd indeed for the U.S. to decertify \n     and impose economic sanctions on Mexico, with which we had \n     signed a free-trade agreement just three years before and \n     which was recovering--thanks to a multibillion-dollar U.S. \n     loan guarantee--from a deep economic crisis.\n       President Clinton, quite properly, gave greater weight to \n     these economic realities and the totality of our relationship \n     with Mexico than to the certification law's demand for \n     sanctions. But not before relations between the two countries \n     reached the lowest point in recent memory. And the way \n     Mexican certification was rationalized fed popular cynicism \n     in this country about the seriousness of the certification \n     exercise.\n       Sadly, the bottom line on the usefulness of the \n     certification strategy is that drugs today are far cheaper \n     and more easily available in the U.S. than when Congress \n     created the process 11 years ago.\n       There shouldn't be any doubt that fighting drugs must \n     remain a top foreign and domestic policy priority and that an \n     annual review properly focuses national attention on it.\n       But as the Dodd-McCain initiative suggests, the effort \n     should be a more comprehensive and flexible exercise that, \n     for instance, considers both foreign supply and domestic \n     demand. A new approach also should emphasize multilateral, \n     cooperative strategies as a strategy of first resort.\n       When that doesn't work, economic sanctions, diplomatic \n     pressure, law-enforcement measures, economic aid and other \n     measures should all be at the disposal of the president to \n     ensure cooperation. The war on drugs is a long, arduous \n     campaign that is more likely to be won through ingenuity and \n     tenacity than annual grandstanding and empty threats.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsday, July 16, 1997]\n\n           Find Better Ways to Stem the Flow of Illicit Drugs\n\n       An eminently sensible bill in Congress would begin to do \n     away with the ineffective practice of certifying other \n     nations' efforts to control production and shipment of \n     illegal drugs and punishing those that don't meet U.S. \n     standards. A two-year moratorium on certification is included \n     in legislation, introduced by Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-\n     Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), which calls for a \n     presidential commission to come up with a coordinated \n     strategy for drug control in consultation with other \n     countries.\n       The drug-certification law was enacted in 1986 by a \n     Congress intent on showing it could do something about drugs, \n     but it has proved to have little impact. Worse, it has \n     backfired more than once in the conduct of U.S. foreign \n     policy. In practice, it has been applied with bald-faced \n     hypocrisy: How else to explain the decertification last year \n     of Colombia, which has done its best to cooperate, and the \n     recertification of Mexico, whose government is riddled with \n     narco-corruption? Simple: Mexico is economically and \n     politically important to Washington; Colombia is not.\n       But there is a deeper hypocrisy in condemning other \n     nations' efforts to stem drug supplies when the United \n     States' own government has had so little success in \n     suppressing domestic demand for drugs. Until America can \n     address the demand problem more credibly than it has, it \n     would be wise for Washington to cooperate with other nations \n     affected by drug trafficking in devising new strategies, \n     rather than browbeating them with meaningless report cards.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, June 16, 1997]\n\n                          A Good Step on Drugs\n\n       Since drug trafficking is an international problem, \n     international cooperation to combat it has always made sense. \n     But Washington's approach to such cooperation has for the \n     last decade included a tool for bludgeoning others into \n     antidrug partnership--the decertification process, by which \n     other nations face economic sanctions by the US if they are \n     deemed noncooperative. The result in the most important \n     arena, Latin America, has been recurrent friction rather than \n     tighter cooperation.\n       This year's certification of Mexico and decertification of \n     Colombia made it more obvious than ever that this particular \n     antinarcotics tool should be junked. Politics and US economic \n     interests, rather than objective consideration of the \n     antidrug records of both countries, dictated the final \n     decision.\n       A new bill sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd (D) of \n     Connecticut and Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona would suspend \n     the decertification process for the next two years. It also \n     urges the formation of a high-level task force under the \n     direction of the government's chief drug-control official, \n     Barry McCaffrey, to reassess policy responses to both the \n     supply and demand sides of the narcotics problem. The \n     president would encourage other countries to form similar \n     task forces, and in two years an international summit would \n     be held to forge a joint antidrug strategy.\n       Some may argue that this sounds like a megastudy of a \n     problem that has already been studied to death. But the plan \n     has three elements that strongly recommend it:\n       For at least two years, and maybe more, it gets rid of the \n     divisive, counterproductive decertification club.\n       Inherent in it is a closer examination of the demand \n     problem within the US, and the possibility of productively \n     shifting resources to such needs as drug treatment. This aids \n     cooperation as well, since Latin Americans have long charged \n     that the US underplays its demand problem.\n       It holds out the possibility of an international antidrug \n     partnership based on shared interests and ideas, rather than \n     one forced together by US threats.\n       The Dodd-McCain bill should be promptly enacted.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 14, 1997]\n\n                   Drugs: Interdicting the Flow . . .\n\n       Congress put the United States into the business of grading \n     other nations on their performance in the war against drugs, \n     and punishing those found to fall short, back in 1986. \n     ``Certification'' then seemed an idea worth testing. It now \n     has been tested. It's a flop. By provoking local nationalism, \n     this sort of unilateral American intervention has, in Mexico, \n     Colombia and elsewhere, strained the anti-drug cooperation it \n     was meant to strengthen. It has centered the American fight \n     against drugs more on foreign supply than on consumption at \n     home--an emphasis that, for all the successful drug seizures, \n     has seen the international drug flow pick up over the years \n     and force prices on the American street steadily down.\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\n       Now comes a move in Congress to look at certification with \n     a beady eye. Sens. Christopher Dodd and John McCain are \n     leading a bipartisan, ideologically neutral effort that draws \n     reasonable and necessary conclusions from the experience of \n     the past decade. They would suspend for two years the process \n     of unilateral American certification and enlist the drug-\n     producing and transit countries to join the United States in \n     an international program to contend with both trafficking and \n     consumption. In a word that Americans will have to get used \n     to in dealing with these ``global'' issues, the United States \n     would ``multilateralize'' the war against drugs. Cooperation \n     would become the key.\n       International problems exist for which one-sided \n     applications of American power--in this instance control of \n     international credit--are a remedy. Drugs is not one of them. \n     While other countries are the principal source of the supply, \n     the United States is the dominant source of the demand. It is \n     laughable to pretend that just one side of this equation can \n     and need be dealt with. Then, a concentration on foreign \n     supply ignores that Americans have done no better cleaning up \n     trafficking networks in this country than others, including \n     Latins, have done with the networks abroad. The certification \n     policy, imperiously penalizing foreigners not just for their \n     lapses but for the United States' own, ignores this evident \n     fact.\n       Mexico provides a particular reason to review American drug \n     policy. Its corruption is unquestionably responsible for some \n     part of the flow of illegal drugs. But Mexico is also a \n     country now making an immense effort to undo the political \n     distortions that lie behind much of the corruption. By \n     looking for cooperative ways on drugs, the United States \n     tackles a hemispheric menace and encourages Mexican democracy \n     at the same time.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, July 7, 1997]\n\n                        Now, That's a Resolution\n\n       Sometimes, even if rarely, legislation makes such eminent \n     good sense that you wonder why it wasn't proposed sooner. On \n     point is a U.S. Senate resolution with a most reasonable \n     response to the scourge of illicit drugs. The resolution not \n     only suggests that the United States attack domestic demand \n     as well as supply, but that it work with other nations to \n     draft a cooperative ``battle plan'' to defeat the illegal-\n     drugs trade on every front.\n       This commendable proposal was introduced the other day by \n     Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and John McCain, R-Ariz. The \n     only shame was that, coming in the midst of furious budget \n     wrangling and just before the Fourth of July holiday there \n     was no time for its discussion and passage.\n       The resolution would suspend for two years the cumbersome \n     certification process that Congress foisted on the president \n     in the first place. By law the White House is required each \n     year to pass judgment on the drug-curbing efforts of nations \n     that serve as major narcotics producers or transit points. \n     Countries that do not pass muster are decertified, obliging \n     the United States to cut certain aid and oppose international \n     loans. Other, more-drastic sanctions also are authorized.\n       Not surprisingly, both certified allies and decertified \n     pariah states have taken umbrage at this unilateral finger-\n     pointing by the world's largest consumer of illegal \n     narcotics. What right has the pot to call the kettle black? \n     The whole certification sham even blew up on itself in March \n     after President Clinton decertified Colombia, which had \n     recently stepped up anti-narcotics efforts, while certifying \n     Mexico, through which are thought to come as much as 80 \n     percent of the illegal drugs entering the United States. This \n     after Mexico's chief anti-drug official was arrested for \n     allegedly aiding the head of his country's biggest, most \n     ruthless drug cartel.\n       With certification on hold, the administration should have \n     time to craft a better policy. The bipartisan resolution \n     encourages the president to foster international anti-drug \n     cooperation, culminating in a summit where strategies could \n     be mutually agreed upon. That global approach, it suggests, \n     would work in sync with a comprehensive domestic plan, \n     addressing both supply and demand problems, developed by Gen. \n     Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy, and other experts.\n       ``We need to reach out to other governments who share our \n     concerns about the threat that drugs pose to the very fabric \n     of their societies and our own. It is arrogant to assume we \n     are the only nation that cares about such matters,'' said \n     Sen. Dodd. ``Together, working collectively, we can defeat \n     the traffickers. But if we expend our energies playing the \n     blame game, we are certainly not going effectively to address \n     this threat.''\n       Well said, Senator, and well proposed.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me just emphasize, if I can, that I \ndon't necessarily agree with all of the conclusions in these \neditorials. Some have suggested repeal. There is a part of me that \nfinds that appealing. But I am not sure what we are going to offer over \nthe next 2 years is necessarily going to work either. I don't have any \nabsolute certainty of guarantees that what we offer as an alternative \nwill work. But I think all of us can agree that suspension for a couple \nof years, as General McCaffrey has suggested, to try the cover the \ndynamic here is worth the effort and worth a try.\n  This doesn't mean you are less strong or less outraged or less \nconcerned about what is happening to narcotics trafficking. Quite the \ncontrary. I think those who support this recognize that we are trying \nto get a better handle on this to see if we can't have better answers \nbecause the current process is not working. We need a better idea. \nHopefully people of good intention, good will, and putting their \nshoulders to the wheel in this country and elsewhere can come up with \nsome better ideas over the next 2 years and really begin to make some \nheadway in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I gladly yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Connecticut believe that in the \npast 5 years that we have been winning the war on drugs? Does it \nindicate to him that perhaps the price of drugs in the streets of \nHartford, CT, and Phoenix, AZ, is lower than it was 5 years ago? Has \nthe Senator from Connecticut seen any meaningful gain in the war on \ndrugs as a result of this recertification policy?\n  I have several other questions that I would like to ask.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my colleague's questions, I \nwould say, First, the price of drugs is lower today, the lowest they \nhave been in two decades. We just came from a hearing chaired by our \ncolleague from Georgia, which my colleague from Massachusetts, who is \non the floor, attended. We heard at that hearing that the problem is \ngetting worse--not better. In the countries that we have decertified, I \nsay to my colleague from Arizona, over the last couple of years the \nproblem gets worse--not better. We are getting less cooperation in many \nplaces. There is a sense of antagonism about how we approach this \nissue.\n  So while I applaud the intentions of those who authored this \nprocess--and I understand the rationale for it back in 1986--from time \nto time I think we have to step back and ask ourselves blunt questions \nas to what we have tried to do, no matter how well intended. Is it \nworking? If it is not, and if the problem is getting worse, then I \nwould say to my colleague from Arizona, in response to his question, \nthat maybe we ought to think anew. That is what this amendment does, \nwithout repealing the certification process but merely suspending it \nfor a couple of years to see if we can't come up with a better idea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Connecticut will yield for a further \nquestion, isn't there an enormous inconsistency, and, in fact, a lack \nof credibility in this decertification process when we are faced with a \nsituation where the President of the United States in the one case of \nColombia decertifies Colombia as not being cooperative in the war on \ndrugs--which is a country, as we all know, with incredible chaos and an \nanarchy that exists in that country--and at the same time certificates \nMexico largely on the grounds not that you could make the argument that \nMexico has been cooperative in the case of drugs, but there are certain \neconomic interests and other interests that we have in Mexico which \nalmost compel the President of the United States to not decertify \nMexico under the same criteria that basically the President used to \ndecertify Colombia, thereby revealing a significant flaw in this entire \nprocess and revealing a lack of credibility as far as adherence to the \ncriteria that was supposed to be set up under the conditions for \ncertification or decertification?\n  Mr. DODD. In response to my colleague's questions, I would agree with \nhim. That is one of the problems with this. It is so uneven in its \napplication, and as such one might argue that the effectiveness of it \nis thereby debilitating--that, if we are going to certify some, and \nwaive others where the problem arguably is the same, although one might \nmake a case that there are various efforts in certain countries, I \nthink you end up with the kind of situation we are in today where the \ndesire for cooperation and the efforts of cooperation have been \nseverely curtailed as a result of it.\n  So even if you are trying to send a message here, it gets lost in the \nprocess. I note in the case of Colombia--\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nwhich is certainly a major source country problem without any question \nwhatsoever--but I pointed out, as I know my colleague from Arizona has \nfrom time to time, that this has paralyzed the country of Colombia. \nMany may recall that a number of years ago the entire supreme court of \nthat country was assassinated. One attorney general after the other, \nthe chief prosecutor, all of these people have been assassinated. \nPresidential candidates get assassinated. One might argue that they are \npaying an awful price in that nation.\n  If we decertify, we lose any kind of cooperation in terms of what we \nought to be trying to seek there. In the case of Mexico, as my \ncolleague has pointed out--he certainly knows Mexico as well as any \nMember of this body--there are serious problems there and well \ndocumented. Yet, both of us are aware of the fact that there are \nserious economic implications. So we send a signal of waiving and apply \na different standard, and that message is not just heard in both \nColombia and Mexico, it resonates throughout this hemisphere. Again, my \ncolleague from Arizona spends a great deal of time on hemispheric \nissues. He has heard what I have heard over and over again; this is not \nhelping at all. There are other countries involved. We have laundering, \ntransit countries, other countries producing, and, frankly, this effort \nof cooperation is just collapsing in our midst.\n  So this has not worked.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question which \nhis response led to, isn't it true that there was a question that the \nadministration had asked itself in this process: What would be the \neffect in Mexico of a decertification of Mexico, a country that is \nuncertain if not fragile and in transition to democracy? There is \nalways a certain latent anti-Americanism in Mexico. I will not waste \nthe time of the Senate or my knowledgeable friend's time in depicting \nthe causes for that. And one of the greatest challenges that we face, I \nask my friend from Connecticut, is getting the cooperation of the \nMexicans. And, yet, isn't it also true that General McCaffrey would \ntestify that despite all of the problems that are there, despite the \ncorruption, there has been an attempt on the part of the Mexicans to \narrest their drug czar, General McCaffrey's counterpart in Mexico, and \nother actions that have been taken by the Mexicans because of their \nrecognition of the threat that drugs pose to their very national \nexistence; and, that, if we had decertified Mexico in the last \ndecisionmaking process that the President took, there is the opinion in \nthe view of many that would have harmed relations and the cooperation \nthat we are receiving would have been lessened rather than increased \nthereby inhibiting our ability to win the war on drugs and a \ndemotivated factor in helping getting them to cooperate with us?\n  Mr. DODD. I say, in my response to the questions, the Senator is \nabsolutely correct. He stated it very well. And that certainly was the \nevidence offered by General McCaffrey and others whose business it is \non a daily basis to monitor these events--and he suggested to us that, \nif cooperation is what we are seeking, the vehicle we have been using \nis not having the desired effect despite again the good intentions of \nthose who sought this process.\n  I say to my colleague from Arizona, in response to his question, that \nthe genesis of the certification process dates back to a time when I \nthink there was bipartisan frustration over whether or not there was \nenough attention being paid at the executive branch level in terms of \nthe drug-related issue. So a certification process was put in place.\n  I think most would argue today that however true those feelings may \nhave been over a decade ago that over the last number of years there \nhas been a heightened degree of involvement on the part of the \nexecutive branch--witness, of course, General McCaffrey, whom we all \nrespect--doing the best they can. It is their conclusion, as well as my \ncolleague from Arizona, as he pointed out, that this is \ncounterproductive.\n  I might point out, that the elections that recently took place in \nMexico were historic. I think my colleague and I would agree on this. \nIt looks as close to a democratic and corruption-free election as \nprobably has been held in Mexico. You have new members of the national \nlegislature, and hopefully a new beginning in many ways here. It seems \nto me that our efforts here might do a lot to get that kind of \ncooperation out of new members of the Mexican Government--the \nlegislative branch, along with President Zedillo, who, I think all of \nus would agree, has certainly been most cooperative in this effort.\n  So I agree with my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, isn't \nit also true that we will hear objections to this amendment? And some \nof those objections will be based on the lack of cooperation that we \nhave received from Mexico in fighting the war on drugs, something I \nbelieve the Senator from Connecticut and I would be the first to \nacknowledge--along with the fact that the resolution of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut a few days ago put the Senate on record in praising \nthe Mexican Government, by a unanimous recorded vote here in the \nSenate, for their efforts of transition to a free and democratic form \nof government for the first time since the revolution.\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he would not believe at this \ntime whether it would not be most inappropriate for the United States \nto be on record as condemning Mexico, at a time when we are seeing the \nprogress that we have been urging for, in fact, all of our adult lives, \nthe Senator from Connecticut and I.\n  And I also want to ask, in addition, is the Senator from Connecticut \naware of the White House letter dated July 16, signed by Samuel Berger, \nAssistant to the President for National Security Affairs:\n\n       I am writing to express the support of the administration \n     for the amendment that you and Senator Dodd are proposing. We \n     believe your amendment would allow the administration to \n     develop and implement a new multilateral strategy to stem the \n     flow of illegal narcotics. We believe the passage of this \n     amendment will lead to a more effective multilateral effort \n     in the war against drugs.\n\n  And also, is the Senator from Connecticut, who I know shares my \nprofound respect and appreciation for General McCaffrey and the job he \nis doing and the responsibilities, enormous responsibilities, we have \nplaced on General McCaffrey and the universal respect and admiration in \nwhich he is held, aware of a letter he wrote also on July 16, in which \nhe says:\n\n       Wanted to confirm that the Administration supports the \n     Dodd-McCain legislation on international drug cooperation. \n     Believe your thinking supports U.S. drug policy by \n     recommending a mechanism that would allow us to make \n     fundamental improvements in the way we cooperate with major \n     drug producing and transit countries. At a minimum, your bill \n     promises to remove a major cause of foreign policy friction \n     especially with Latin American and Caribbean countries. \n     Timing for consideration of new ideas is fortunate because of \n     the upcoming Summit of the Americas and heightened interest \n     in multilateral counter-drug cooperation following the \n     President's travel to Mexico and Central America.\n       ONDCP is prepared to lead an interagency task force to \n     develop a new strategy.\n\n  By the way, I ask my friend, is it not true that we need a new \nstrategy? That is the whole point here of this legislation. I do not \nknow how anyone could argue that the present strategy has succeeded.\n\n       Although we would want to explore a number of options, \n     elements of a new strategy might involve increased use of \n     multilateral mechanisms and international organizations such \n     as the OAS. We might also consider expansion of ad hoc \n     arrangements for in-depth bilateral counter-drug cooperation \n     with countries of particular interest such as Mexico. The \n     Department of State and ONDCP are already formulating plans \n     for a fall conference to develop new thinking along the lines \n     of your proposal.\n       Respectfully, Barry R. McCaffrey.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut, would it not be appropriate that \nwe should view the opinions of the President's national security \nadviser and the drug czar very seriously when we take into \nconsideration this legislation?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it would. I urge my colleague at the \nappropriate time to ask unanimous consent that these letters be a part \nof the Record. I thank General McCaffrey for his letter and Sandy \nBerger for his letter.\n  Again, they state it very well. My colleague from Arizona has stated \nit well. We offer this suspension--and,\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nagain, I want to emphasize ``suspension,'' Mr. President--for 2 years \nof the present law, not a repeal. There are some who would like to \nrepeal it, and I might be counted among those, but I respect the fact \nthat a suspension is the best way to go at this point.\n  But our colleague from Arizona states it well. The present system is \nbroken. It is not working. We need some new, fresh efforts here. And \nwith the commitment of General McCaffrey here saying to us, look, my \noffice is prepared to lead an interagency task force to develop a new \nstrategy. His letter to us today, I think it says it all. What better \nway to get started, if you will, than to have a clean slate for a \ncouple of years to allow General McCaffrey and his team to go forward \nand try to do that without repealing the law of certification but \nmerely suspending it.\n  You are going to get a lot more cooperation, it seems to me, with a \nsuspension for 2 years and trying to bring these countries in than \nthere will be if we gather as we do annually and go through this \nprocess, as our colleague from Arizona pointed out here, again on the \ncertification. We are out here debating 11th-hour negotiations on \nwaivers, all efforts to try to avoid a catastrophe, and once again find \nourselves in a mess with certification practices and no advance \nstrategy to deal with this issue. I am grateful to the Senator from \nArizona, the administration and General McCaffrey for this effort.\n  I think this is a good, bipartisan effort, Mr. President, to come up \nwith a new dynamic, and I thank again my colleague for his support and \nleadership on this effort.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in strong opposition, and I hope it will be robust opposition, \nto the Dodd-McCain amendment, which would gut the narcotics \ncertification process and replace it with absolutely nothing.\n  Mr. President, I just heard the distinguished Senator say ``trust \nGeneral McCaffrey.'' With all due respect to General McCaffrey, this is \nsuch a volatile and unpredictable area that it is impossible to know \nwhat to believe. It is understandable that General McCaffrey could \nstand before the world and say, ``I trust General Gutierrez Rebollo. He \nis an honest man.''\n  Whoops. The next thing we know, he is on the take. My goodness, how \ncan you gut a process and replace it with nothing except trust when we \nhave already found that trust to be wanting.\n  Now, let me say for a moment, I want to divide my remarks into three \nparts. The first is foreign assistance and who should get foreign \nassistance as a product of this amendment. The second is a \ncertification process and what it has actually done in Colombia. The \nthird is Mexico postsummit and what has not happened.\n  This debate is really about whether we should give foreign aid and \nsupport development loans to other nations with no strings attached \neven if we know that the leaders and government of the country do \nnothing to assist in stopping the flow of drugs to the United States.\n  I think we need to clear up a major misconception about the debate \nhere today on the drug certification process. This is not a debate \nabout whether drug certification is a process that hurts our relations \nwith our allies in the hemisphere because we sit and pass judgment on \nother nations. This is a debate about foreign assistance and under what \ncircumstances the United States should offer assistance to other \nnations. With the exception of humanitarian assistance, the United \nStates provides foreign assistance not only because America has a great \nand good tradition of assisting other states, but because we want to \nencourage certain types of behavior--because we want cooperation on \npolitical, security, or economic policy.\n  The distinguished manager of the bill, Senator McConnell, has said it \nvery well today again and again. He said, ``Foreign aid is not an \nentitlement program. Just because you received it last year does not \nmean you should receive it this year. You have to earn it.''\n  A nation that does not fully cooperate with our efforts to keep drugs \nfrom reaching our schools and our children has not earned the right to \nreceive foreign assistance from the United States. We are not obligated \nto provide assistance. We provide this assistance because it is in our \ninterest to do so, because it encourages behavior and policies which we \nsupport. Before we provide money, we have every right to expect that we \nwill get cooperation from those nations to which we provide it. Indeed, \nwe have a duty to our constituents not to send their tax dollars to a \ncountry if it is undermining our counternarcotics effort. That, in \nfact, is why we have the certification process as an instrument for \ncooperation--not because we want or enjoy the opportunity to sit in \njudgment on other nations. It is not a policy for faint hearts. I admit \nthat. It is not about rating who we like or who we do not like. It is \nnot about saying you are good and you are bad.\n\n  The current certification process may not be perfect, but it \naccomplishes something very important. Once a year it focuses the \nattention of our executive branch and of other nations whose \ncooperation we need on what is perhaps the most crucial national \nsecurity issue this country faces.\n  If anyone had to ask me what is America's No. 1 national security \nthreat, I would say drugs, drugs, drugs. There is no other. It is my \nfirm belief that without the drug certification process, we would have \nno debate of this kind. So I am not sorry we have this process. I think \nit focuses our efforts, and, even when it bruises feelings of other \nnations, it ultimately produces more cooperation, not less.\n  Now, let us for a moment look at Colombia, a country which we did \ndecertify 2 years ago. The evidence is clear. When we decertified \nColombia, the reaction was initially very harsh, and then, very \nquickly, Colombian cooperation began to improve.\n  Colombian officials came to my office just a month or so ago, and \nhere is what they told me: In the last year, Colombia has fumigated \n20,000 hectares of cocoa, the most ever; destroyed 800 drug \nlaboratories; began working with the United States to develop a radar \nsystem to allow the government to secure control of all Colombian \nairspace, an air control system that allowed them to force down \napproximately 50 small drug-runner planes--force down 50 small drug-\nrunner planes--which would have otherwise evaded Colombian air traffic \ncontrol.\n  They have begun working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop \nstrategies for intercepting narcotics traffickers at sea; they have \npassed tough new laws on asset forfeiture for narco-traffickers, and \nthey are implementing them; they have arrested and convicted at least 5 \npoliticians I know of, and incarcerated them for taking money into \ntheir campaign funds from narco-traffickers; they have passed tough new \npenalties increasing sentences by 4 and 10 times for drug-related \noffenses; and they have instituted aggressive new proceedings against \nthe Cali and Medellin cartel leaders. The Medellin cartel leaders are \nall in prison. The cartel is no more. And the Cali cartel is in the \nprocess of disintegrating.\n  Does anyone honestly believe that Colombia would have taken these \nsteps in this fashion if it had not been for the U.S. drug \ncertification process? I think not. And as a matter of fact, I am of \nthe view that if this continues, Colombia should be recertified, and we \nshould say thank you for working on this problem in the way in which \nyou have.\n  Before Colombia was decertified, the powers of the cocaine cartels \ngrew. The number of hectares planted with coca grew. The corruption in \nthe Colombian judicial and political systems grew. But when the United \nStates said ``enough'' and decertified Colombia, all of a sudden the \nColombian Government did an aboutface. I think that this example can \naffect other nations as well. Unfortunately, much of the trafficking \nand the transportation of drugs has moved to Mexico, and this is the \nnext frontier of the battle.\n  Now, let's compare the situation in Colombia today with that in \nMexico today post-summit, post-Presidential visit to Mexico. Still, not \na single extradition of a Mexican national on drug charges. I say on \ndrug charges. On other charges perhaps. Despite all of the debate last \nyear, despite the economic summit, not a single extradition\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nof a Mexican national wanted in this country for drug charges has been \ncarried out by the Mexican Government.\n  There are continued restrictions on the operations of United States \ndrug enforcement agents in Mexico. Even when working in cooperation \nwith their Mexican counterparts they still cannot protect themselves if \nthey are working on the other side of the border. They still are not \nallowed to carry weapons. Coast Guard ships in pursuit of trafficking \nvessels on the sea still need to give Mexico 30 days' notice before \nputting into port to refuel. There are no air or maritime agreements to \nforge a joint approach for interdiction of narco-trafficking. There is \nstill massive corruption at all levels of the government, law \nenforcement and the military, prosecutors killed, judges murdered, and, \nmost recently, the plastic surgeon that did the surgery on Amado \nCarrillo-Fuentes has reportedly--I cannot verify it, but reportedly--\ndisappeared.\n  Drug cartels are running rampant in Mexico. Corruption along the U.S. \nborder--and I will speak for California--has never been worse, never \nbeen worse. The cartels are now controlling street gangs in Los \nAngeles, and this is where I stand up and say ``I have had enough.''\n  My distinguished colleague and friend from Connecticut read from a \nnumber of editorials. You know, I judge stories by the by-line. There \nis a reporter whom I respect very much. His name is Marcus Stern. He \nwrites for the San Diego Union Tribune. This is a headline on the 12th \nof this month, ``Drugs still flown over the border, say agents.'' Let \nme quote from part of this article:\n\n       But a dozen military and civilian officials directly \n     involved with the counter-drug effort along the California-\n     Mexico border said in interviews during recent weeks that the \n     skies in San Diego and Imperial counties are largely out of \n     control and are still being heavily used by drug traffickers.\n       It's pretty much wide open * * * \n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       But the antidrug officials interviewed in recent weeks said \n     military observation posts deployed along the border are \n     spotting a half-dozen planes a week flying into Imperial \n     County alone. The planes are flying low at dusk with their \n     lights out, the officials said.\n\n  This is happening every day on the border. It is the wrong time to do \ngut the certification process. The administration has agreed to give us \na report on September 1 on progress made by Mexico. That is pursuant to \nour Senate-passed resolution. I, for one, am eagerly awaiting it, to \nsee what progress has been made. At this stage, I know of no real \nprogress that has been made.\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue that Mexico fails to cooperate \nbecause of the certification process. They argue that Mexican pride and \nnationalism make it difficult to appear to respond to American threats. \nThat's nonsense. It is baloney.\n  President Zedillo, whom we all believe is committed to fighting the \ndrug traffickers, has said repeatedly that drug trafficking is the No. \n1 threat to Mexico's national security. Well, either it is or it isn't. \nIf it's such a grave threat to Mexico's national security, they should \ncooperate with us in their own interests, not because we make demands. \nExtradite drug pushers, allow U.S. Coast Guard ships to refuel, allow \nDEA agents working the other side of the border to carry firearms to \nprotect themselves. I believe we have every legitimate reason to make \nclear we will not accept anything less than full cooperation.\n  The whole issue is an issue right now, precisely, I believe, because \nthe administration was not honest in the certification process in \ndealing with Mexico. As much as I, too, would like to see a more \nflexible certification process, the situation with Mexico, for me, \nunderscores exactly why we need a certification process.\n  I come from a State that is perhaps the most impacted State in the \nUnion with these drugs. Yes, cocaine prices have dropped on the streets \nof Los Angeles in the last 5 years. It is not because of a \ncertification process. It is because we have not had the guts to do \nwhat we should have done and decertify Mexico. I believe that's the \nreason. To replace a policy which may come to some fruition this next \nyear with nothing is wrong.\n  I agree with the idea of a commission. I am happy to have \ncommissions. I learned when I was mayor, if you didn't know what to do, \nappoint a committee. Better still, appoint a commission.\n  But I know what to do. We have to stop those overflights. We have to \nsee that the border is enforced. We have to press for cooperation. We \nhave to have extradition for those for whom there is a bona fide \nAmerican arrest subpoena or warrant who traffic in narcotics.\n  So, I am not prepared to vote for an amendment that leaves us with no \nplan but simply takes Mexico off the hook: No evaluation this fall, no \nability to read the September 1 report presented by the administration \nand make a decision as to whether there has or has not been any \nprogress, then wait 2 or 3 years for this undefined, ephemeral \n``something.''\n  Respectfully, I can't turn around and just depend on trust when \nanother nation's leading anti-drug official turns out to be on the \ntake. What's wrong with our intelligence? How can that happen? We don't \nquestion it even. How can that happen? It did. And that, I believe, \ntypifies our drug policy with Mexico. Frankly, it has been one of spin. \nI, for one, am not going to buy the spin. I want to see the results on \nthe street.\n  When cocaine prices on the street corners of Los Angeles rise, I know \nsomething has happened. When I pick up this newspaper and, instead of \nseeing ``Drugs still flown over the border,'' I see ``Five Planes \nDowned, Pilot, Copilot Arrested, Two Tons of Cocaine Recovered,'' then \nI know we have something going on on the streets, as they say. So, that \nis what I am looking for. When I see Mexico say, ``Here are the cartel \nleaders, we are going to bring them to trial, we are going to bust the \ncartels,'' then I know we have something going.\n  So, until then, to do away with the certification process, I think, \nis to say to the people of the United States, ``We are going to do \nnothing for the next 3 years.'' I, for one, am not going to be party to \nthat policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter signed by Senator Grassley, Senator Coverdell, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator John Kerry, and myself, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n\n     Vote ``no'' on the Dodd-McCain amendment to end narcotic \n         certification.\n\n       Dear Colleague: We write to urge you to join us in opposing \n     the Dodd-McCain amendment on narcotics certification. This \n     amendment would dramatically weaken the United States' \n     ability to gain cooperation from other nations in the war \n     against international narcotics trafficking.\n       The Dodd-McCain amendment would effectively end the \n     narcotics certification process and replace it with . . . \n     nothing!\n       The Dodd-McCain amendment would tell other nations that we \n     will provide them foreign assistance with no strings \n     attached, even if they do nothing to assist stopping the flow \n     of drugs to the United States.\n       The Dodd-McCain amendment would instantaneously deprive the \n     United States of the leverage we have used successfully to \n     gain greater anti-narcotics cooperation from many nations, \n     including Colombia, following its decertification two years \n     ago.\n       The Dodd-McCain amendment would send a signal to our \n     friends and partners--and to the drug lords--that the United \n     States is not serious about combating narcotics.\n       The Dodd-McCain amendment calls for a task force on \n     international narcotics control and an international summit \n     to develop a multilateral strategy--which are laudable \n     goals--but it would unnecessarily gut one of the central \n     tools in our current narcotics control strategy, without \n     specifying what will replace it.\n       The influx of illegal narcotics is perhaps the gravest \n     national security threat facing the United States today. In \n     order to effectively combat this threat, the United States \n     needs to work with our friends and partners in the Western \n     Hemisphere to interdict this massive flow of drugs and to \n     arrest and punish the drug lords.\n       But when we do not receive the full cooperation of other \n     nations in these efforts, we must be able to act to let them \n     know that they must do more. That is why we have the drug \n     certification process. We urge you to oppose the Dodd-McCain \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     John Kerry.\n     Paul Coverdell.\n     Robert G. Toricelli.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to make it clear I disagree with the Dodd-McCain\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\namendment. We have been focusing in this debate on the necessity and \nthe impact of the certification process on foreign countries as if the \nonly purpose of this was to put pressure on foreign countries. That \nprobably is the primary purpose and maybe the only one we talk about. \nBut, as well, I would like to suggest that we have a situation where \nthis process keeps our own Government decisionmakers responsible. In \nother words, through this certification process, we are causing them to \nmake an annual judgment of whether or not our process of interdiction \nin other parts of the world on drugs is actually working and effective. \nI think that is a very important purpose of our process, to make our \nown elected and appointed government public officials take care to look \nat the process, look at whether the policies are working, to assess \nthose policies, maybe to suggest changes in those policies--maybe even \nin basic law--but, also, to make a judgment of whether or not they are \neffectively carrying out the laws the way intended.\n  I find the assumptions upon which the Dodd-McCain amendment is based \nto be wrong. I believe what it represents is a moving away from a \nserious standard of dealing with the drug problem. I believe it gives \nother countries a bye on taking drugs seriously. I believe it lets the \nU.S. administration off the hook. So I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting against this amendment. If anything, we should be discussing \nmeasures to strengthen the process. It is a process that has served us \nwell.\n  We have had a letter by the present drug czar quoted on the floor of \nthe Senate as supporting this amendment. I would like to suggest to you \nthat I have had an opportunity to visit with another drug czar--former \ndrug czar now--Bill Bennett. He was a very good drug czar. He was a \ndrug czar when policies were working. He speaks very strongly in \nsupport of the present certification process and, consequently, would \nurge our vote against the suggestions of Senator Dodd and Senator \nMcCain.\n  It is argued by the proponents that the certification process does \nnot work. No evidence is offered for this view. It is simply asserted. \nBut what does ``working'' look like? I would like to ask a question in \na different context to make this very point. Just recently we passed \nlegislation putting more teeth into the sanctions for countries that \nsupport international terrorism. Do we believe that passing such laws \nwill end international terrorism forever? Or do we believe that we need \nto have measures in place to ensure appropriate means are available to \nus, means that will help us uphold U.S. interests and international \nstandards of conduct? I do not think anyone here believes that our laws \nwill necessarily end terrorism as we know it. That is not the intent. \nThe intent is to set a standard that terrorism is wrong and that we are \ngoing to fight terrorism wherever we can.\n  We have passed legislation to hold countries responsible for \nviolating intellectual property rights. Do we expect this legislation \nto end all pirating of books or CD's? Or do we expect to have the means \navailable to us to respond to all counterfeiting, to send a message \nabout what the standard is that we believe that we need to uphold? I \nthink everyone knows the answer.\n  Why are we seeking to establish some sort of different standard for \ndrugs? It seems to me in the case of terrorism we say terrorism is \nwrong, we pass laws against it, we fully expect to enforce them in \nevery way we can in an effort to end terrorism. We may not actually end \nterrorism, but it is a standard. So the certification process is not \nabout the ultimate end to drug production or trafficking. Our law will \nnot end that any more than any of these other laws that I have \nmentioned will end the problems that they address. The intent is to \nestablish needed standards, to set the terms of reference for what \ndoing something meaningful looks like, and to take appropriate action \nwhen this does not happen.\n  Some, however, seem to want to hold drug certification to an \nimpossible standard of judgment. The argument made is that \ncertification does not work. In fact, certification is doing exactly \nwhat Congress intended. It forces the U.S. administration at least once \na year to take international drug policy seriously. It also requires \nthem to account for their actions to the Congress. I can appreciate \nthat the administration may not like having to make all these very \ntough decisions. But we must hold this President and future Presidents, \nas we have held past Presidents, accountable for this process.\n  Certification also forces other countries to do the same thing. Now, \nwhat about those other countries? These are countries that are major \ndrug producers or transiting countries for illegal drugs. A goodly \npercentage of those drugs are then smuggled into our country. These \nactivities are illegal under international law and even under the laws \nof the countries from which the drugs come.\n  In any case, these same countries have bilateral agreements with the \nUnited States committing them to take steps to stop drug trafficking \nand production. In addition, many of these countries receive U.S. \nassistance, that is money and support, to combat illegal drug \ntrafficking.\n  What does certification do then? It asks that these countries take \nserious steps to meet their obligations under international law, under \nlocal law, and under these bilateral agreements. It asks the \nadministration to report to Congress on whether countries are doing \nthis. It sets measures for determining what cooperation looks like. If, \nin the judgment of the administration, the country does not meet these \nstandards, then it proposes limited sanctions. It also provides a means \nfor Congress to exercise its foreign policymaking authorities to \noverride the President if it does not accept his determination.\n  It is hardly outrageous, Mr. President, that we expect other \ncountries to abide by laws and by commitments, international and \notherwise, made by those countries. It is hardly unfair to expect an \nassessment of these efforts. It is not unrealistic to expect that we \nwill take appropriate responses if minimal standards are not met, and \nwe are perfectly within our right to decide not to continue our \nsupport. That support, after all, is not an entitlement, and it is not \nbeyond the pale that we ask for an accounting.\n  Certification has been around for about 10 years. As with other \ncases, the longer the requirement has been on the books and the more \nCongress has insisted that it be taken seriously, the more used and \nuseful the process has become. The process has gathered momentum. Last \nyear, in fact, I asked the Congressional Research Service to review the \nmerits of the certification process. That review, which is still \navailable, makes clear how the certification process has matured and \nproved effective. In that review, a former senior State Department \nofficial and ambassador makes the point that the certification process \nworks. Other countries take it seriously. He recommended keeping it.\n  Not only has the standard been applied with more rigor, it has also \nencouraged greater cooperation from certified countries. All in all, \nmore countries now take as a given that drug control must be an \nimportant element in their thinking. This was not always the case. It \nis why Congress required certification in the first place. The need has \nnot changed. If anything, the need is greater today.\n  I want to make one final point. Some have argued that we must not \ncontinue the certification process in regard to Mexico because it might \ndamage the evolution of democracy there. While I agree that we must \nsupport democracy in Mexico, we must not end up supporting a \nnarcodemocracy there. A recent New York Times piece by Tim Golden makes \nit clear just what the problems we and the Mexicans face from their \ndrug traffickers because of their influence within the country of \nMexico. Their strength and influence is all the more reason why we must \nnot back away from certification.\n  Although it can be a painful process, it forces both countries and \ntheir governments to examine their situations. Sometimes the role of a \nfriend is to deliver bad news. Nor do we become the friend of democracy \nin Mexico by shying away from our duty to the American people. As long \nas Mexico remains a major producing and transiting country, as long as \nMexican authorities cannot or will not take adequate steps to control \ncorruption, we cannot afford to ignore what happens in Mexico.\n  With these thoughts in mind, I ask you to vote against the Dodd-\nMcCain\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\namendment. But in addition, we were told again, referring to a letter \nfrom General McCaffrey, the President's drug czar, about his support \nfor this amendment.\n  I refer, in closing, to the March 1997 report from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \nEnforcement Affairs, the International Narcotics Control Strategy \nReport. This is an annual report, and on page 6, it speaks about the \ncertification process. The last paragraph says: ``The process works.'' \nThis is a document that has been approved by every Government agency \nthat has something to do with the war on drugs. It says, after ``The \nprocess works'':\n\n       The certification process has proved to be a remarkably \n     effective diplomatic instrument for keeping all governments \n     aware of the need to pull their weight in the international \n     antidrug effort.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rest of the paragraph be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       By now, most governments are aware that US law requires the \n     President to provide an annual assessment of counternarcotics \n     performance. And most know that the outcome of that \n     assessment depends heavily on their efforts throughout the \n     year. The drug certification process holds them publicly \n     responsible for their actions before their international \n     peers. Though many governments understandably resent the \n     process, most governments try to ensure that they receive \n     full certification the following year. They know that the \n     President of the United States would not make such a serious \n     determination without sound, objective evidence. The purpose \n     of the law is not to punish; it is to hold every country to a \n     minimum acceptable standard of cooperation, either by meeting \n     the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention or by \n     their own efforts. We believe that openness is one of the \n     best safeguards against corruption. Most governments also \n     recognize that we are not asking any country to do the \n     impossible. By regular and sustained collaboration throughout \n     the year we work with most of the governments concerned to \n     establish realistic goals for certification purposes. We know \n     that some governments face greater obstacles than others and \n     we take that into account.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in conclusion, when we are being read \nletters and saying how the administration supports this, remember that \nevery agency within the Federal Government that had to review this \nprocess in March of this year said the process works. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to step back carefully \nand to analyze, as closely as possible, the realities that surround \nthis question of certification. Two of the more capable and \nknowledgeable Senators with respect to international affairs--and I \nrespect both of them enormously--are bringing this amendment to the \nfloor. On most issues, we agree. This is one where I am convinced of \nthe bona fides of their intent, but where I am equally as convinced \nthat the effect of what they are doing, the effect of this amendment \nwill be to take a serious step backward in whatever level of war on \ndrugs you want to determine exists.\n  I do not believe that that is anything but an inescapable conclusion \nbased on a number of different realities: based on what countries are \ndoing today because of the certification process, based on the choices \navailable to the President within the certification process and, most \nimportant, based on what they are proposing, as opposed to the road \nthat we have already traveled.\n  What do I mean by that? Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Connecticut are proposing that we just chuck the \ncertification process for a 2-year period, a suspension they call it, \nwhile we gather a task force and ultimately, hopefully, a summit. Who \nwill attend the summit is totally up for grabs. Who will appoint a task \nforce is totally up for grabs. But I ask every Senator here who has \ntraveled the journey of drug fighting over the last years to ask \nthemselves if what they need is another task force when, in fact, \neverything that we are asking other nations to do is part of an \ninternational convention today.\n  The certification process is not some American-dreamed up notion of \ntaking an American standard and asking Mexico or some other country to \nlive up to the American standard. We are asking countries to live up to \nthe standard that they have signed, that they have agreed to live up to \nalready, that they already got together on at a global summit under the \nUnited Nations and agreed would be the standard of their behavior. That \nis what this is all about.\n  If the Senate wants to come here today and vote to say that they can \nbetter the Vienna Convention, the United Nations Convention Against \nIllicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, then I \nwould like to know how.\n  The countries that have already signed the international agreement \nare the very countries about whom today we are making a judgment about \nwhether or not they are cooperating: Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, \nBahamas, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Paraguay, Nigeria, \nMexico, the Russian Federation, Syria --they are all signatories. They \nalready came together. They already signed an agreement. They said they \nwould behave by a different standard, and all we are doing in the \ncertification process is saying we are going to make a judgment about \nwhether or not the taxpayer dollars of U.S. citizens ought to go to a \ncountry that signed an international agreement, said it would do X, Y, \nand Z, but isn't doing it.\n  What are we being offered instead? Instead, we are being offered the \nnotion that we are going to chuck the process of certification so we \ncan take a couple of years to meet again and come to agreement again on \nthe very thing we agreed on, presumably, a number of years ago. What \nare the things we agreed on in this convention that we have already \nsigned?\n  Let me give you one example. Here is one called extradition. Each of \nthe offenses to which this article applies shall be deemed to be \nincluded as an extraditable offense in any extradition treaty existing \nbetween the parties.\n  We have an extradition treaty with Mexico. It is an agreement as part \nof the 1990 accord. We already ratified it. We signed it. They signed \nit. But they don't do it. So what is the response? The response is to \ncome to the floor and say, ``Oh, gosh, these countries get really upset \nbecause we try to hold them to the standard they said they would live \nby, so we better pull back because they don't like the fact that we \nwant to hold them to their word, and we're going to go talk about what \nwe might do in order to, once again, get them to do what they already \nsaid they would do.''\n  It is the most incredible thing I have ever heard. Of course, they \ndon't like the certification process, because it works. This is not a \nstale annual event. It is anything but stale. It is working, and it is \nworking, Mr. President, because we have taken it seriously.\n  Senator Grassley just quoted the International Narcotics Control \nStrategy Report of the United States of America, this year, this March, \n1997. This is what our State Department said only a few months ago:\n\n       The certification process has proved to be a remarkably \n     effective diplomatic instrument for keeping all \n     governments aware of the need to pull their weight in the \n     international antidrug effort. By now, most governments \n     are aware that U.S. law requires the President to provide \n     an annual assessment. . .\n\n  And so on.\n  ``Proved to be remarkably effective.'' This is Mexico driven, because \nwe had a difficult time, frankly, because many of us thought that the \nadministration made the wrong decision. They could have certified \nMexico with a waiver, and that would have permitted Mexico to continue \nto get its aid because, as a matter of national security interests, \nmost of us thought it should, but we also knew there were problems in \ncooperation.\n  Mr. President, if my colleagues believe that the next step in the \ndrug war is to come to the floor and take 2 years to go through some \nkind of task force effort to dream up some better way of holding these \ncountries accountable, I would be amazed if there is any response from \nthose other countries except continued delay, obfuscation. If they want \nour money and they are willing to do something to get our money, but we \ntake away that whole requirement, what is going to leverage that \ncooperation? More talk? More good wishes? More signatures on a piece of \npaper that they have already signed?\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the things that they have \nalready said they would agree to do.\n  They would agree to promote cooperation among the parties so they may \naddress more effectively the various aspects of illicit traffic in \nnarcotic drugs.\n  They will carry out their obligations under this convention in a \nmanner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and \nterritorial integrity.\n  Each party shall adopt measures as may be necessary to establish as \ncriminal offenses the production, manufacture, and so forth.\n  There are still nations struggling to do that.\n  Each party is supposed to make the commission of the offense \nestablished in this treaty subject to imprisonment or other deprivation \nof liberty.\n  They are supposed to ensure that their courts will have jurisdiction. \nThey are supposed to ensure that they trade evidence. They are supposed \nto extradite. They are supposed to provide mutual assistance and the \ntransfer of evidence and people. They are supposed to enter mutual \nlegal assistance treaties.\n  There are a whole bunch of things here that we already agreed we are \ngoing to do. And under the certification process, all we do is make a \njudgment as to whether or not they are doing it and as to whether or \nnot we are going to give them continued American aid if they are not.\n  Mr. President, let me just share with you, our colleagues have come \nto the floor and they have said, ``Gee-whiz, people are complaining. \nAnd this doesn't work.'' But they have not shown you how it does not \nwork. There is no showing that this does not work.\n  The fact that drugs still enter the United States is more a \nreflection of our unwillingness to commit adequate resources to drug \ntreatment, to drug testing, to education, to alternatives for children, \nto police in the streets and all the things that would make more of a \ndifference than it is to the certification process. But the fact is, \nthat on the international front the certification process has worked.\n  Let me be very specific about it.\n  In the Bahamas, effective counternarcotics cooperation specifically \nintensified with the implementation of the certification process in \n1987. The Bahamian Government's willingness to accept more of our \nassets, U.S. Government assets, and to provide additional resources of \nits own in the fight increased the moment they knew they were subject \nto certification.\n  In December of 1986, the Bahamas passed a new, tougher drug law. And \nmore recently, in 1995 and 1996, the Bahamas passed money-laundering \nlaws and implemented regulations based on U.S. Government certification \nrelated to demarches. The fact is, we had issued demarche after \ndemarche to those countries, and they have responded to those because \nthey knew there was a process in place that created accountability for \nthe first time.\n  Another example. Jamaica. The Jamaican Government was particularly \nslow to pass money-laundering legislation or to even ratify the very \ntreaty that I just talked about. But as a result of the demarches that \nwe issued, and using the leverage that existed in the certification \nprocess, Jamaica specifically reversed that situation in 1995 and 1996.\n  Jamaica is now a party to the convention and has a new money-\nlaundering law. In 1995, the President gave Peru a national defense \ncertification because their record was mixed. They had successful \ninterdiction but they had no reduction in the coca crops. Since that \ntime, the Government of Peru has implemented a strong coca reduction, \nan alternative development program which has resulted in an 18 percent \nreduction in the total of Peruvian coca cultivation. So that worked as \na result of the decertification process.\n  What about Colombia which we heard talk about? Colombia was \ndecertified in 1996 and 1997. It received a national interest \ncertification waiver in 1995. There is no question that the Colombians \nwere very unhappy with the original decertification. Who would not be? \nBut the fact of the matter is, that when they were faced with the \nramifications of that decertification, the Colombian Government's law \nenforcement efforts have improved ever since then.\n  Key Cali syndicate leaders have been arrested, and there is the \naerial eradication of coca and opium and poppy which has improved. In \naddition to that, the longstanding constitutional prohibition against \nthe extradition of Colombian nationals has now been reopened in the \nform of legislation presented by the Colombian Government to the \nColombian Congress. Let me emphasize that. Colombia took away one of \nthe principal ingredients of the international convention. The \ninternational convention required people to be able to extradite. \nColombia wrote that in at the insistence, Mr. President, of the cartel. \nHow do we know that? We know that because subsequent raids uncovered \ndocuments that showed the cartel's own drafting of the constitutional \namendment to do away with extradition.\n  So as a result of our decertification, we have been able now to move \ntoward the process of changing the one thing that the cartel members \nfear the most, the possibility of being extradited to serve time in an \nAmerican prison, not in one of their prisons of comfort and of personal \nconvenience that they negotiate in Columbia. That is why they took it \naway. And now we are on the road to getting it back. Why? Because we \nhad the certification process in place. That is why.\n  I talked to General McCaffrey today. And I understand \nhow administrations work and the marching orders are, but I will tell \nyou, I sensed no great overpowering conviction that this is the right \nstep to take, notwithstanding the letter that he has written.\n\n  In addition to that, I believe that this process is being foisted on \nthe Senate in a way that does not adequately permit for alternative \npossibilities. I am not suggesting the certification process is the \nonly way to proceed. I am not suggesting that it is the best thing in \nthe world. I am not suggesting that it cannot be refined.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that rather than just suspend it \naltogether with some high hope that you are going to come back and \nsomehow do what we have already done, we ought to at least leave it in \nplace until we offer some concrete alternative or put together a task \nforce that works while it is in place so we can continue this process, \nand then if there is a legitimate substitute, open our minds to \nsubstituting it. But what we are being offered is a suspension with a \nhope that some future photo opportunity or some future meeting will \nproduce what meetings heretofore have not been able to produce.\n  I say to my colleagues, that even in Mexico--even in Mexico--the \npossibility that we might have decertified them actually produced last-\nminute steps in an effort to try to say, gee, we really are \ncooperating. And so they dismissed some 1,250 Federal law enforcement \nofficers, they removed the drug czar for narcocorruption in February, \nthey passed the organized crime bill and the criminalization of money \nlaundering and chemical diversions, and they reorganized Mexico's whole \nantidrug structure. How can you say it is not even working in Mexico \nwhen the fact is, that those steps were taken precisely because the \ndecertification process is in place?\n  I am not going to go through all of them now, but while my colleagues \ncome here and talk about the discomfort that is created or talk about \nhow uncomfortable it is for our relationship with these countries, you \ncan look at every single other country, and you will see progress that \nis being made as a consequence of the existence of this bill. You can \nsee it in Panama. You can see it in Bolivia. You can see it in \nParaguay. And you can see it elsewhere, Mr. President.\n  So the point is, the certification process is not a substitute for a \ncomprehensive strategy to deal with drugs, but it is an effective tool \nwhich the State Department only a few months ago was lauding as an \neffective tool.\n  And it seems to me that the hue and cry you hear from these \ncountries, ``Gee, we don't like you holding us accountable,'' is in \nfact its best argument for the reality that this works. Is it a rough \ntool? Yes, I will admit, sure it is. It has its element of hardness in \nthat sense. But Mr. President we have traveled this road for a long \ntime--a long time.\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\n  We have written a number of drug bills in our country. We have put \nadditional cops on the streets. We are trying to augment our own drug \nstrategy at home. But the fact is, that the domestic side is only one \npiece of any strategy to deal with drugs. You need effective law \nenforcement at home, you need effective education at home, and you need \neffective treatment at home.\n  And we have been negligent with respect to a number of those. But \nthat does not mean that you can turn around and throw away the other \nside of the coin, which is the interdiction and international \ncooperation which is also an important tool. And I respectfully suggest \nto my colleagues that the certification process deserves better than \nsimply to be put into hanging suspension, with some promise of more \ntalk that will only result in ratification ultimately of the very \ninternational agreement that it is based on.\n\n  I emphasize to my colleagues, this is not some ``Yankee from the \nNorth'' standard. That is how they effectively play those politics. \nThey very effectively do that. And then they complain to our diplomats \nwhen they go to Mexico, and they say, ``Oh, boy, you guys are stirring \nup the politics of our country because you're sort of imposing this \nstandard on us.''\n  Mr. President, it is not our standard. It is their standard. They \nsigned the international treaty. And all we are doing is making a \njudgment of whether our tax dollars ought to be given to those \ncountries that signed the agreement and then do nothing to live up to \nthe standard. This is not our standard. It is the world's standard. \nThey have signed on to it. They ought to live up to it. And we should \nnot walk away from the one effective tool we have put in place that \nhelps us hold on to that standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be brief. I know that the managers of the bill and \neveryone else wants to get votes and final passage on this issue. I \nthink the issue has been pretty well ventilated.\n  I will just make a couple comments. One is that a comment was made \nearlier about General McCaffrey. I think it is important to point out \nthat no matter where we are on this issue --which side--that General \nMcCaffrey deserves our respect and our admiration and appreciation. \nThere was some allegation about his judgment of the Mexican general, \nand I think we all make mistakes from time to time. But the fact is \nthat General McCaffrey has, in the view of all objective observers, \ndone an outstanding job.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts just made a reference to our tax \ndollars. The Senator from Massachusetts knows full well that no foreign \naid goes to Mexico. The only money that goes to Mexico is strictly for \nthe purposes of drug interdiction. That is the only money. In fact, the \nMexicans pride themselves on not taking foreign aid from the United \nStates of America. So I think it ought to be viewed in that context.\n  But finally, Mr. President, when we vote on this I think the \nfundamental questions are as follows: Has the present policy succeeded \nin helping us win the war on drugs? Has the present process of \ncertification or decertification raised the price of drugs in Phoenix, \nAZ, and Detroit, MI, and New London, CT, and Boston, MA? Has the \npresent policy been instrumental in getting the kind of cooperation and \nassistance that we need from the Mexican Government and their \nofficials? Has the present policy of certification, decertification, \nhad any beneficial impact on stopping the drug trafficking which goes \nacross our border in large quantities as we speak?\n  Those are the questions that have to be asked. And if you believe \nthat the present policy and certification has worked, and has proved a \nbenefit and has been helpful or has been an ingredient in raising the \nprice of drugs, winning the war on drugs, closing our border to the \nflow of drugs, increasing cooperation assistance on the part of the \nMexicans, then I say vote against this pending amendment.\n  But I say that the President's national security adviser, the drug \nczar, and many other experts throughout the country have said, look, \nlet us try something different. Let us come up with some new ways which \ncan address this terrible scourge that is destroying the youth of \nAmerica. Let us try a new way.\n  That is all this says. Let us try to be more effective. Let us try a \nway of suspending, simply suspending for 2 years, not abolishing, but \nsuspending for 2 years the certification process in hopes that all of \nus together, the executive and legislative branch, working with the \nAmerican people, can come up with a way of winning a war that it is sad \nto say, Mr. President, we are losing.\n  If those who oppose this amendment think that what we are doing now \nworks, fine. They are entitled to that opinion. But I do not believe \nthat those we place in positions of responsibility in the executive \nbranch of Government share that view, nor do most experts. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut read off the editorial comment from literally every \nmajor newspaper in America in favor of this amendment. And I do not \nblindly follow the advice and recommendations of all of the experts, \nnor the leaders of our administration and those we entrust to conduct \nof our national security policy and our drug policy. But I say, we \nignore that advice and recommendation at some risk.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can quickly dispense of further debate \nand vote on this.\n  I thank the chairman and floor manager for his indulgence as we have \ndiscussed this very important issue. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will be able to get a consent \nagreement to have a series of votes here shortly. I know Senator \nCoverdell is here and wants to speak to the Dodd-McCain amendment. We \nwill offer a unanimous consent request for some votes on or around 6 \no'clock shortly.\n  Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from Georgia wants to speak. I will \ntake 2 quick minutes, if I may.\n  I answer the question the Senator from Arizona asked, which was the \nquestion about the effectiveness and price. The test of whether or not \ncertification is effective is not just a reflection of what happens to \nthe price of drugs or their availability. Everybody knows that \ninterdiction is ultimately an impossible task. Drugs will come in. The \nquestion is, are you raising the cost of business sufficiently that the \nrisks are great enough for those who engage in it that you have a \nlegitimate effort to reduce it from scourge to nuisance? The truth is, \nMr. President, there are a whole set of other questions you have to ask \nto really test that effectiveness.\n  For instance, do they extradite people? Do they have a law of \nextradition? Do they have asset seizure and forfeiture laws? Have they \nimplemented the laws of asset seizure and forfeiture? What kind of \nsentencing structure do they have? Do people actually serve time? Do \nthey trade evidence with you? Do they create a mutual legal assistance \ntreaty? There are a whole series of judgments here where, I suggest \nrespectfully to my colleagues, the vast majority of the evidence is on \nthe side of those who say this certification process is working because \nit has produced results in every one of those other areas of \nmeasurement.\n  Now, the other point I make--I know that you have editorials. Sure \nyou have editorials. I have read some of them. One comes from my own \nnewspaper in Massachusetts. Most people that I have talked to about \nthis process make the judgment that the reason they viscerally feel it \nis not a fair thing to do is they think we are implementing a standard \nthat is just American, that we are sort of judging them and then, in a \nhigh-handed fashion, coming in and saying, ``Hey, you are not good \nenough for America.'' The point that I think needs to be reemphasized \nover and over that many are not aware of is, it is not an American \nstandard, it is the internationally arrived at standard which they have \nagreed to live up to themselves. So we are really finding only one tool \nexisted in the process.\n  The last point I make is that this does not have to be as difficult \nas it was made this year with respect to Mexico. Most people, I think, \ncame to the conclusion ultimately that, while they wanted to avoid a \npolitically sticky situation, Mexico was not, in fact, capable of \ncooperating fully, and there were plenty of ways to praise the \ndemocratic process, plenty of ways to praise President Zedillo, plenty \nof ways\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nto bolster those who wanted to make it happen and provide a waiver that \nallowed them to be certified, but on the basis of national interest.\n  Had that happened, there would have been no great fight in the U.S. \nSenate, and had that happened, we would not be here today putting to \nthe test the one tool that has worked in helping us to hold the Vienna \nTreaty accountable.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will not be supporting the Dodd-\nMcCain amendment, but I wanted to make several observations about the \nsituation we are facing this evening.\n  First, I want to commend Senator Dodd of Connecticut for his extended \ninterest in this subject, for his cooperation and longstanding work on \nthe matter. I am an admirer of his work. I believe, however, that this \nis not the way to close the circle on the long, extended debate on \ncertification and that process.\n  As chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I promised to \nhold hearings on the issue. As Senator Dodd knows, I have long said \nthere are real questions about this process that need airing. I have to \nsay I am somewhat disappointed by General McCaffrey and NSC Adviser \nBerger coming forward in this manner without a thorough discussion. I \nworked extensively, along with Senators Dodd, Kerry, McCain, Hutchison, \nand others, when this became so contentious before, and I think we \nought to have had more notice with regard to their views on this than \nwe have had.\n  I want to point out that the certification process has had successes, \nas Senator Kerry has pointed out, and it has created issues and \nproblems, as Senator Dodd has pointed out. There have been benefits and \nthere have been problems. The idea of shutting the process down without \na fix on where we are going to go bothers me. Senator Dodd and I have \ntalked about an alliance. Well, maybe that would be an appropriate new \nplace to go. But to just stop what we are doing without knowing where \nthat new place is and in this manner, I don't think is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, the certification process is not only about other \ngovernments. It has been a tool for the Congress to be at the table on \nthese issues with our own executive branch. In fact, in the long debate \nover certification of Mexico, it did result in this letter from the \nPresident to myself and Senator Feinstein, and it makes an extensive \noutline.\n\n  It says:\n\n       I want to keep the Congress informed of the progress we are \n     making toward achieving the objectives set forth in my 1997 \n     national drug control strategy and the U.S.-Mexico alliance \n     against drugs. Director McCaffrey will provide further \n     details on these issues to Members of both Houses in the near \n     future. My administration will also provide the Congress, by \n     September 1, [that is this September] 1997, a report covering \n     each of the issues contained in the Senate Resolution passed \n     in March as elaborated in your recent letter and discussions \n     with my administration.\n\n  In other words, through the discussions about the process, the \nadministration has told the Congress it is going to come with a full \nreport and present it to the Congress in just a month and a half. It \nstrikes me that we ought to see the report, hold the hearing, and then \nsee what it points us toward--not just suddenly come forward and end \nthe process before we have had the report. I have to say, Mr. \nPresident, if it were not for the process, I doubt we would have ever \ngotten this letter.\n  The last point I make is, I just came from a hearing, a portion of \nwhich Senator Dodd was able to attend, but he had to return to the \nfloor. The discussions by the various witnesses were exceedingly \nalarming. They described, on our border, armed conflict. They described \ndrug cartels operating in military fashion--not a bunch of hooligans--\nwith the most sophisticated equipment, semiautomatic weapons, night \ngoggles and sophisticated communication systems that allowed them to \nambush our own agents. The testimony alluded to a growing number of \noccurrences, already 70 this year, of similar incidences--armed assault \non U.S. Border Patrol, targeted agents, assassination threats.\n  Senator McCain is correct, the status quo is not working. I believe \nthe correct response is to hear from the administration as they \npromised, to hold our public hearings, to air the various ideas and \nconcepts, and then come forward in an organized, methodical manner and \nhear where we go in the future. Senator Dodd and I agree completely \nthat the status quo is unacceptable. We are just not quite on the same \ntime line as to where we go from here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Dodd's \namendment. The drug certification process is fatally flawed.\n  Mexico was fully certified even though 7 percent of the cocaine and \n50 percent of the marijuana sold in the United States comes in through \nMexico.\n  Colombia wasn't certified, neither were other rogue states even \nthough their contribution to the drug supply is not prominent. Under \nthis process, our diplomatic friends get certified as ``fully \ncooperating,'' and rogue nations do not regardless of whether a country \nis a major contributor to the supply of drugs in the United States or \nnot.\n  I view the determination of which countries are cooperating as a law \nenforcement function, yet the State Department has prominent role in \nadvising the President.\n  This sense of the Senate amendment calls for the suspension of the \ndrug certification procedures for two years. It calls for high-level \ntask force to develop a comprehensive program for addressing domestic \nand international drug trafficking and fashioning a multilateral \nframework for improving international cooperation.\n  It would put the Director of the National Drug Policy in charge of \nthe task force.\n  The amendment calls for the President to persuade other heads of \nstate from drug producing countries and major drug transporting \ncountries to establish similar task forces.\n  Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment, the amendment \ncalls for the President to convene an international summit.\n  We need a better tool than the certification process.\n  The new strategy has to focus on bringing the known traffickers to \njustice.\n  Last year, I offered an amendment to withhold foreign aid to Mexico \nuntil Mexico either brought to trial themselves or extradited the ten \nmost wanted drug lords living in Mexico.\n  Two of the top ten are no longer heading up the big drug cartels.\n  Juan Garcia Abrego was convicted in Houston and sentenced to 11 life \nsentences.\n  Amador Carillo Fuentes, considered the wealthiest and most powerful \ndrug baron died earlier this month. He was known as the ``lord of the \nskies'' because he owned a fleet of 727's which allowed him to \ntransport drugs from Colombia to Mexico.\n  His headquarters were in Juarez, a little more than an hour away from \nNew Mexico.\n  He died earlier this month, but this will not be the end of this \ncartel's influence and drug dealing.\n  We have to do something more effective in this area.\n  The new policy has to be primarily a law enforcement function.\n  Enhanced extradition has to be an important part of the new policy.\n  Comprehensive money laundering laws must be passed in all countries \nand officials must be trained to identify money laundering schemes and \nto enforce the laws.\n  Young people need to be educated about the dangers of drugs.\n  We can't solve this drug problem alone. We need international \ncooperation.\n  This amendment provides a framework for a better, more aggressive \npolicy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dodd-McCain \namendment.\n  For the past 11 years, we have experimented with the policy of \n``certifying'' foreign countries as cooperating or failing to cooperate \nwith our efforts against the international narcotics trafficking. That \nis a fair test for any policy. And it appears to me that the \ncertification policy simply isn't working.\n  Many countries we have decertified--Burma, for example, or \nAfghanistan--now produce significantly more narcotics than they did \nbefore. Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are at least as easy to find on \nour streets today as they were in 1986. It is clear that, at best,\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\nour decertification of these countries did nothing to stop them and \ntheir mafia organizations from producing narcotics.\n  So certification has been an ineffective policy. And the Dodd-McCain \namendment takes a sensible approach--it does not abolish certification, \nbut suspends it while we try to work out a more effective approach. If \nthere is nothing better out there, certification will go back into \neffect.\n  Finally, in my view, annual debates over whether to certify various \nforeign countries has distracted us from the more fundamental problems \nwe face here at home. That is, enforcing the laws. Putting drug dealers \nin jail. Rehabilitating drug users when possible. And stopping kids \nfrom trying drugs in the first place. If we can do those things, the \nactions of foreign countries will still be important, but they will be \nsecondary issues.\n  So I think Senator Dodd and Senator McCain have a good idea. We \nshould take a second look at a policy that doesn't work very well. We \nshould try and find a better one if we can. And we should get back to \nbasics and solve our problems here at home.\n  Mr. President, I have a full statement on the underlying bill and the \nimportance of keeping up on our commitment to Israel and the Middle \nEast. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Dodd-McCain \namendment that will put this charade of certification aside and try \nsomething new in the war on drugs. I think, Madam President, all of us \nwant the same result; we want to stop the illegal drugs from coming \ninto our country. Today, 13 million Americans use illegal drugs; 1.5 \nmillion use cocaine, 600,000 use heroin, and 10 million use marijuana.\n  Madam President, it is coming in through Mexico. Twenty percent of \nthe heroin, 70 percent of the marijuana in this country, and 50 to 70 \npercent of the cocaine comes in through Mexico. This is under the \nprocess we have now--certification--which is insulting, which does not \nhave any positive consequences and, I submit, really only has negative \nconsequences.\n  Madam President, how is the best way for us to attack the issue of \nillegal drugs coming in from Mexico? Is it to insult our neighbor? Is \nit to berate them? What does that give us? It gives us a hostile \nneighbor. Is that going to help? I hear people on this floor talking \nabout Mexico as if it is 2,000 miles from our border. Madam President, \nMexico is our border. We share family ties, we share a trade \nrelationship, we share problems for both of our countries in illegal \ndrug transit. It is bad for Mexico, it is bad for the United States. \nAnd I submit that we share friendship. We know Mexico is not doing \nenough; they know it. I have met with President Zedillo on this issue. \nI am convinced that he is trying to do everything he can. He is \nattacking this issue. Berating his country is not going to help the \nsituation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for the Dodd-McCain amendment. Let us \ntry something new. Let us look for positive results in a partnership, \nnot an adversarial relationship that cannot help us. It will not solve \nour problem and it could make worse problems on our border than we \ncould ever foresee. Let's do something different; let's give it a \nchance. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, [Mr. Gramm], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, since 1986, we have had a policy called \n``certification,'' whereby we stand in judgment of our neighbors as to \nwhether they are in fact making the best effort they can make in \nhelping us keep drugs out of our country and helping themselves prevent \ndrugs from corrupting their country.\n  In the case of Mexico, we have declared through a Presidential \ncertification, since 1986, for 11 years, that Mexico is making a full-\nfaith effort, and every year for 11 years we have suspected that it was \nnot so. For the first 10 years of this process, I kept hoping things \nwould get better, hoping for the best, voting to certify something that \nwe suspected was not true but hoped that it would become true. This \nyear, I decided that maybe we should try something different and deny \ncertification. The President decided to move ahead with certification.\n  The point I want to make is very simple: It can never be good public \npolicy to put ourselves in a position where, in order to continue to \nwork with our neighbors to try to keep drugs from coming into our \ncountry, we have to certify something that is not true. I think that, \nafter 11 years, it has become clear that this process is not working. \nIt puts us continually in a position of choosing whether to certify \nthings that are not true. It seems to me that as a matter of national \npolicy, just as well as a matter of personal policy, that can never be \na good thing to do.\n  I don't know whether certification was ever a good policy or not. But \nI think that after 11 years, we know it does not work. And I think \nsetting the process aside for 2 years, giving us an opportunity to try \nto figure out what we are going to do in terms of a permanent policy, \nis the right thing to do.\n  I agree with my colleague from Texas. If you want your neighbors to \nwork with you, the worst thing you can do is slap them in the face.\n  We are under a procedure now that does not work. I think it is time \nto change it. The proposal before us is simply to set it aside for 2 \nyears to figure out what we are going to do permanently. I think it is \na reasonable proposal. I hope my colleagues agree.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request--\n--\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for 2 minutes before he makes that \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I have been listening for the last hour and a half, \nroughly, to all the argument against this amendment, except for my 2 \ncolleagues from Texas, to whom I am grateful for making their case. I \nwant to make the case on behalf of Senator McCain and myself, and \nSenators Domenici, Cochran, Daschle, Kerrey, Warner, Inouye, Hutchison, \nand others who have supported this amendment, the cosponsors of the \namendment. We have had 11 years. We didn't come up with this overnight. \nWe have had 11 years. We have now 12.8 million people using illegal \ndrugs in this country; 1.5 million cocaine addicts; 600,000 heroin \naddicts. What do we want to do, wait another year, another 2 years? Do \nyou want that number to be 13 million drug addicts in the country? How \nabout a million heroin addicts? When do we stop?\n  The present system isn't working. We have decertified about 7 \ncountries over the last several years. If anything, we have had less \ncooperation--Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Syria, Colombia--and what do we \nget back from it? If this is working so well, are these countries \ncooperating today? No, we are not getting cooperation. All we are \ngetting is a deluge of drugs pouring into the country.\n  So I don't disagree that maybe the certification may be the only \nanswer. But how about for 24 months we try something else, after 11 \nyears, and if we get nothing but an increase in supply, lower costs, \nand the problem becomes worse and worse and worse, why don't we try \nsomething else? That is all Senator McCain and I are suggesting--for 24 \nmonths, suspend the certification process. Listen to General McCaffrey; \nhe supports what we are trying to do here. He doesn't have a silver \nbullet either. But maybe, just maybe, we might come up with a better \nidea and do so in a sense of cooperation with nations we are going to \nhave to have cooperation from if we are going to succeed.\n  So, Madam President, with all due respect, when I hear that this is \ncoming sort of unannounced--and I listened today, as I was at those \nhearings as well, to those witnesses and I heard them as well. The \nsituation is worse today than 6 months ago, a year ago, or two years \nago, and it is getting worse. So how about trying something else, which \nis something we don't do terribly frequently around here; we stick with \nprovisions and say you can't change them.\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\n  We represent 5 percent of the world's population and we consume over \n50 percent of the illegal drugs in the world. Before we start lecturing \neverybody else, we ought to look in our own backyard and decide what we \ncan do here at home as well.\n  For those reasons, I urge our colleagues to give us a chance, with \nthis modest proposal, to try something different. As General McCaffrey \nsaid in his letter, and Sandy Berger at the National Security Council, \nthis deserves an opportunity to be tried. I urge my colleagues to do \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Barry McCaffrey to Senator \nMcCain and a letter from Samuel Berger to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Wanted to confirm that the \n     Administration supports the Dodd-McCain legislation on \n     international drug cooperation. Believe your thinking \n     supports U.S. drug policy by recommending a mechanism that \n     would allow us to make fundamental improvements in the way we \n     cooperate with major drug producing and transit countries. At \n     a minimum, your bill promises to remove a major cause of \n     foreign policy friction, especially with Latin American and \n     Caribbean countries. Timing for consideration of new ideas is \n     fortunate because of the upcoming Summit of the Americas and \n     heightened interest in multilateral counter-drug cooperation \n     following the President's travel to Mexico, Central America \n     and the Caribbean.\n       ONDCP is prepared to lead an interagency task force to \n     develop a new strategy. We must build on our National Drug \n     Control Strategy. We can accomplish the requirement to build \n     a more effective concept for multi-national cooperation in \n     the two years provided by your bill.\n       Although we would want to explore a number of options, \n     elements of a new strategy might involve increased use of \n     multilateral mechanisms and international organizations such \n     as the OAS. We might also consider expansion of ad hoc \n     arrangements for in-depth bilateral counter-drug cooperation \n     with countries of particular interest such as Mexico. The \n     Department of State and ONDCP are already formulating plans \n     for a fall conference to develop new thinking along the lines \n     of your proposal.\n       Thanks for your continued leadership on the drug issue.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Barry R. McCaffrey,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I am writing to express the support of \n     the Administration for the amendment that you and Senator \n     McCain are proposing to S. 955, the Foreign Operations, \n     Export Financing and Related Operations Appropriations Bill \n     for FY '98.\n       We believe your amendment would allow the Administration to \n     develop and implement a new multilateral strategy to stem the \n     flow of illegal narcotics. We believe the passage of this \n     amendment will lead to a more effective multilateral effort \n     in the war against drugs.\n       I, therefore, urge the Senate to pass your and Senator \n     McCain's amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n                                        National Security Affairs.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me say, before propounding this \nunanimous-consent request, we can see the light at the end of the \ntunnel. This unanimous-consent request has been cleared on both sides. \nWe will have three votes beginning in about 10 minutes from now and \nthat leaves very little left to do before final passage. So we are \nalmost through.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I now be recognized for \nup to 8 minutes for an explanation of the amendment on Cambodia, which \nis at the desk, and further, following that debate, the Senate proceed \nto vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment No. 886, the one I \nwill describe shortly, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in \nrelation to the McConnell amendment No. 887, also about Cambodia, which \nI anticipate will be voice-voted, to be immediately followed by a vote \non or in relation to the Allard amendment No. 891, to be immediately \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Dodd amendment No. 901. I \nfurther ask consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nprior to the remaining votes in the sequence. I finally ask unanimous \nconsent that all votes in the sequence following the first vote be \nlimited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, before the Senator from Kentucky \ncontinues, I also ask unanimous consent that Greg May, a fellow in \nSenator Feingold's office, be granted floor privileges for the \nremainder of the consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I join my friend from Kentucky and say \nthat we do see light at the end of the tunnel. I urge Senators, if they \nreally have something they feel is absolutely urgent for the good of \nthe world and the Nation and their States and the Senate, and so forth, \nthat they discuss it with the Senator from Kentucky and myself during \nthese rollcall votes, so that we can wrap this bill up.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I might say that, other than the \nHutchinson amendment, I am not aware of any other votes that we will \nneed before going to final passage.\n  When the subcommittee marked up this bill, the situation in Cambodia \nwas grim. The Far Eastern Economic had labeled Phnom Penh, the Medellin \non the Mekong. In a shocking series of stories, the Review described a \nnation's slide into corruption and the close collaboration between \nsenior Cambodian officials and drug smugglers. Making matters worse, a \nsenior officer said, ``Cambodia is now like Noriega in Panama. Nobody \ndares to speak out because they will be killed.''\n  Journalists who have called attention to the corruption and smuggling \nhave been fined, jailed, and assassinated. Days after running a story \ndetailing the criminal kingdom built up by a close associate of Hun \nSen, the newspaper's editor was gunned down midday in downtown Phnom \nPenh.\n  However, this is not a situation which has just unraveled over the \npast month. This is a story which has unfolded over the past 2 years \nand unfortunately, U.S. Government officials and policy appear to have \naided and abetted this sorry turn of events.\n  As the committee report notes, the evidence of corruption and \npolitical violence is not new. Democracy has been under attack for the \npast 2 years.\n  In testimony before the House International Relations Committee, the \npresident of the International Republican Institute pointed out in \n1995, tiring of his attacks on their corruption, Government officials \nengineered the ouster from the party and Parliament of Sam Rainsy. The \ntestimony then went on to say the following:\n\n       Building on their success in removing one vocal critic, the \n     government has targeted up to six other parliamentary members \n     for expulsion . . . the number of newspapers is declining by \n     the month. Journalists are regularly harassed and beaten and \n     several have been killed . . . The government has been \n     largely successful in silencing all internal opposition and \n     criticism.\n\n  Unfortunately, for the past 2 years as the problems mounted, the \nadministration failed to use our assistance programs, strong ties, and \nclose relationships to leverage reforms crucial to the country's \nsurvival.\n  A few short months ago, in testimony before the subcommittee, AID's \nadministration compared Mongolia and Cambodia, citing both as \ndemocratic success stories. At the same time, the lives of opposition \ncandidates were being threatened, Hen Sen was actively thwarting all \nefforts to appoint independent judges or create a commission to \nestablish the framework for the planned 1998 elections.\n  When weeks of Mr. Atwood's testimony, 16 people were killed and \nanother 120 wounded in a grenade attack on a public rally against \ncorruption. Human rights organizations claimed this was a clear attempt \nto assassinate one of the Government's most vocal critics, Sam Rainsy.\n  As the political violence escalated, the administration continued to \nendorse Cambodia as a responsible candidate to join ASEAN. Evidence \nthat narcotics traffickers were subsidizing the leadership was \ndismissed. In May, in the face of overwhelming evidence that drug \nrelated corruption tainted\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nthe most senior leaders in government, Secretary Albright testified \nbefore the subcommittee, that ``we are very careful in the way we do \nthe certification'' and expressed confidence that Cambodia deserved to \nbe recognized as fully cooperating in our international \ncounternarcotics efforts.\n  During his visit here this spring, Sam Rainsy, the critic who has \nbeen targeted by Hen Sen's henchmen, pleaded with the State Department \nto change course and move quickly to condition aid to his country--to \ntake every step necessary to force Prince Ranariddh and Hen Sen back to \nthe negotiation table--to make every effort to salvage what was left of \nhis country's hope for democracy. He called attention to the \nincreasingly public efforts both leaders were making to arm private \nmilitias--a sign, he warned of the civil conflict to come.\n  While the administration continued to talk of Cambodia's success, the \ncommittee listened to the Cambodians and international observers who \nurged action to stop the slide toward war. In response to the \ndeteriorating situation, we reported out a bill which required the \nSecretary to certify that four conditions had been met prior to the \nrelease of any additional assistance. Specifically, she had to \ndetermine that the Government had taken steps to: First, end political \nviolence and intimidation of opposition parties and members; second, \nestablish an independent election commission; third, protect the rights \nof voters, candidates and election observers and participants by \nestablishing laws which guaranteed freedom of speech and assembly; and \nfourth, eliminate all official corruption and collaboration with \nnarcotics smugglers.\n  We had hoped that the Secretary would deliver a similar tough message \nduring a planned June trip to Phnom Penh. Many of us held out the slim \nhope that she would be take on the important challenge of getting the \ntwo leaders to the table to work toward reconciliation and free and \nfair 1998 elections. I believe her planned visit represented the last \nwindow of opportunity to effect any change. Unfortunately, there were \nsufficient uncertainties about the outcome that prompted her advisors \nto recommend the visit be canceled--and with that, the window of \nopportunity slammed shut.\n\n  The rest, as they say, is history.\n  Since the coup, it is clear, the administration continues to be \nreluctant to challenge or confront Hun Sen. I think this is a serious \nmistake. It not only causes friends and allies to doubt our commitment \nto democracy, we risk further instability in a vital part of he world. \nIf an interest in South East Asian stability does not persuade my \ncolleagues of the merits of engagement, they might consider the need to \nsee some good come out of the substantial bilateral and multilateral \ncommitment we have supported which now exceeds $4 billion.\n  To address the changes which have occurred since the bill was \nreported from committee, I would now like to offer two amendments which \nmodifies the two Cambodia-related sections in the bill. They are \nvirtually identical but affect two different spending accounts. In \neach, I have added a new condition which prohibits aid to Cambodia \nunless there is a certification that the Government has not been \ninstalled by the use of force or a coup.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues believe there should be \nlanguage linking aid to the restoration of a democratically elected \ngovernment. In theory, I agree. However, given the fact that Hun Sen \nactually participated in the election, I believe the administration \nwould continue on the wrong policy track and take advantage of such a \nprovision and simply certify that an elected official was serving in \noffice.\n  Prince Ranariddh must be restored to office and his party must be \ngiven the opportunity to actively and freely engage in the political \nprocess. But that will not happen unless the Administration takes the \nfirst basic step and acknowledges that he has been the victim of a \nbold, ruthless military coup. These amendments compel the \nadministration to make that decision.\n  To address the changes which have occurred since the bill was \nreported, I have an amendment at the desk which adds a new condition \nbanning aid until the Secretary certifies the government was not \ninstalled by force or coup.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 886 and 887, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I now send modifications to \namendments 886 and 887, which are already at the desk, and ask that \nSenators Kerrey of Nebraska and Hagel be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments will be so modified.\n  The amendments (Nos. 886 and 887), as modified, are as follows:\n\n\n                     amendment no. 886 as modified\n\n       On page 11, line 14 strike all after the word ``Of'' \n     through page 12, line 13, ending with the number ``1997.'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be made \n     available for activities or programs in Cambodia until the \n     Secretary of State determines and reports to the Committees \n     on Appropriations that the Government of Cambodia has: (1) \n     not been established in office by the use of force or a coup \n     d'etat; (2) discontinued all political violence and \n     intimidation of journalists and members of opposition \n     parties; (3) established an independent election commission; \n     (4) protected the rights of voters, candidates, and election \n     observers and participants by establishing laws and \n     procedures guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly; (5) \n     eliminated corruption and collaboration with narcotics \n     smugglers and; (6) been elected in a free and fair democratic \n     election: Provided, That the previous proviso shall not apply \n     to humanitarian programs or other activities administered by \n     nongovernmental organizations: Provided further, That 30 days \n     after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigations, shall report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations on the results of the FBI investigation into \n     the bombing attack in Phnom Penh on March 30, 1997.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                     amendment no. 887 as modified\n\n       On page 96, line 20 strike all after the word ``Cambodia'' \n     through page 97, line 2, ending with the word ``smugglers.'' \n     and insert in lie thereof the following: ``has: (1) not been \n     established in office by the use of force or a coup d'etat; \n     (2) discontinued all political violence and intimidation of \n     journalists and members of opposition parties; (3) \n     established an independent election commission; (4) protected \n     the rights of voters, candidates, and election observers and \n     participants by establishing laws and procedures guaranteeing \n     freedom of speech and assembly; (5) eliminated corruption and \n     collaboration with narcotics smugglers and; (6) been elected \n     in a free and fair election.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor along \nwith Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy of amendments numbered 886 and \n887 to S. 955, the foreign operations appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998. These amendments will prohibit the Government of Cambodia \nfrom receiving financial assistance from the United States until the \npolitical violence is ended, the human rights of Cambodians are \nrespected, and either the former coalition government is restored or \nfree and fair democratic elections take place. These amendments will \nalso ensure that the United States will oppose aid offered by \nmultilateral financial institutions to Cambodia until those same \nconditions are met.\n  The events of the past week in Cambodia have focused our attention \nagain on a nation that has experienced tremendous suffering in the last \n30 years. Twenty years ago, the murderous reign of Pol Pot and his \nKhmer Rouge began in Cambodia. The genocidal Khmer Rouge regime \nimprisoned thousands of its citizens and executed an estimated one \nmillion people or 20 to 30 percent of the populace. I had hoped that \nsuch horrors had ended for Cambodia. Unfortunately, last week political \nintimidation and violence again erupted in the capital of Phnom Penh, \nending the rule of law and bringing chaos and uncertainty to the \nnation.\n  Recent press stories detailing the forced emigration and \nextrajudicial executions of opposition leaders highlight the gravity of \nthe situation.\n  It would be easy to turn our backs to a nation with such a dark past. \nBut the poor and terrifying history of Cambodia should not influence \nour decision on whether to stay involved in Cambodia. The nation and \nthe people of Cambodia are important to our national interests. The \nUnited States must stay engaged and continue to work for democracy and \nthe rule of law in Cambodia. In 1991 a significant agreement was signed \nin Paris between the political factions in Cambodia which brought the \npromise of elected government and democratic institutions. Under the \nauspices of the United Nations and observer nations, elections were \nheld in Cambodia in 1993. The clear desire of the Cambodian people\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\nfor democracy was shown by the participation of ninety percent of the \npopulation in those elections. In the four years since those elections, \nthe people of Cambodia have worked to preserve their fragile democracy \nand the rule of law. Cambodia may have suffered a setback in its \nefforts to build strong democratic institutions. But it is not without \nhope.\n  The United States should not abandon a people committed to the ideals \nof democracy and the rule of law. These amendments hold out the promise \nof renewed United States assistance to Cambodia once the political \nviolence ends and an elected government takes power in Cambodia.\n  Until these conditions are met, this legislation allows humanitarian \nassistance to be sent to Cambodia, but only if it is administered \nthrough non-governmental organizations and not the Government of \nCambodia.\n  It is my hope that the situation in Cambodia improves and our two \nnations can again work together to build a democratic Cambodia. If the \ncoalition government is restored, these amendments permit the \nresumption of assistance to the Government of Cambodia. If elections \nare held in 1998 as planned, the United States may again provide \nassistance to a democratically elected government in Cambodia.\n  While we can play a major role, the United States alone cannot help \nbring democracy and the rule of law in Cambodia. I fully expect the \nAdministration to continue to work with the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations [ASEAN], the United Nations, and donor nations to improve \nthe situation in Cambodia. Other nations such as Thailand and Japan \nhave played a major role in promoting democratic ideals in that nation. \nThe United States needs to work with these nations to return a \ndemocratically-elected government to Cambodia and promote the \ninstitutional reforms that will bring peace and prosperity to a people \nwho so desperately need it.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 886, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays on the McConnell amendment \nNo. 886.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, will the Senator yield a minute of his \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I yield such time as he may desire.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I strongly support what the Senator from \nKentucky wants to accomplish with his amendment on Cambodia. There has \nbeen a violent coup, if the press reports are accurate, and we have no \nreason to believe they are not. Members of the opposition have been \nassassinated. Leaders in the opposition have been murdered. This is a \nviolent coup.\n  The amendment makes clear that assistance for nongovernmental \norganizations would be allowed to continue.\n  I want to make sure we don't inadvertently prevent aid from resuming \nif the democratically elected government is restored. But I have no \ndoubt, in that kind of situation, that the Senator from Kentucky would \nwant to make clear--or, if that occurred, would want to join with some \nof us to make clear--that such aid would continue. But this has been a \nvery violent coup. Opposition people are being silenced or killed. And \nI support the intent of the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Vermont.\n  Madam President, if I have any time, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The question now occurs on amendment No. 886, as modified, offered by \nthe Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell]. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this is an amendment previously \ndiscussed before the vote started. I am prepared to take a voice vote \non it. It is noncontroversial and I think supported by my colleague.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I join with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky in \nthat request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 887), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There now will be 2 minutes of debate on \namendment No. 891 offered by the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard].\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank you. In 1994, OPIC's lending \nauthority for its insurance financing was last raised and has been \nfrozen ever since. Since that time, the administration----\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I do not know whether other Senators can \nhear or not. I cannot. May we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate is not in \norder. The Senate will be in order. Senators will please cease their \nconversations or take their conversations to the Cloakrooms.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  In 1994, OPIC's lending authority for its insurance and financing was \nlast raised and has been frozen since then. On the administrative cost \nside, we have seen a growth during that period, when their authority \nwas limited, from $20 million to about $32 million. This amendment just \ntakes the administrative cost back to the 1994 level. It is a\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\nreduction of $11 million in administration. I ask for a yea vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this in many ways would cut off our nose \nto spite our face.\n  I oppose this amendment but I see the Senator from Nebraska, who had \nspoken earlier, and I will yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  I again say what I said this afternoon regarding my good friend and \nreal neighbor next to me. His amendment I think at best is \nshortsighted. I came to this body with the background of a small \nbusinessman, Madam President. I know a little something about OPIC. I \nhave marketed companies, built companies, that have worked around the \nworld. I understand the importance of what OPIC is. This is an \norganization that, in fact, sends money back to the Treasury each year. \nThis is an organization that creates jobs. It has a tremendous ripple \neffect all across this country. And as we are able to export American \ntechnology and products abroad, the support for all of those products \ncomes from American companies in each of our States. I respectfully \nrequest that my colleagues vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senate will be in \norder.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Presiding Officer, what is the parliamentary \nsituation?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 901\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided on the Dodd amendment No. 901. The \nSenator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to yield 30 seconds to my \ncolleague from Arizona.\n  This amendment, offered by myself, Senator McCain and many others, \nsuspends for 24 months the voting on the certification process. All the \nreports are collected, but this is an opportunity, as General McCaffrey \nsays in his letter endorsing this amendment, this gives us time to try \nsomething different. After 11 years, the problem has gotten worse. We \nneed to try a different dynamic. This will give us 24 months to try it. \nWe urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield 1 minute in opposition to the \namendment to Senator Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the Senator from Arizona was \nrecognized for 30 seconds.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, the certification process is not \nperfect. The Foreign Relations Committee has committed to hearings on \nthis. That is the appropriate venue to discuss it. We should not \nsuspend the process without the new place to go or the new system being \nin order. We send the wrong message at the wrong time, and I urge my \ncolleagues not to suspend and leave no system in place.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I would like to see if we can get a \nunanimous consent agreement, and if we can, we can tell the Members we \nwill not have any further votes tonight. I have discussed this with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. I do have one other amendment I have \nto put in the stack. We may work something out on it, but in case we \ncannot, we need to have the vote in the morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on the Bingaman amendment \nNo. 896 at 9:30 a.m.--let me modify that. Let's put that at 10 o'clock \non Thursday--to be followed immediately by a vote on the Hutchinson \namendment, to be followed immediately by third reading of the bill and \nfinal passage, all occurring without action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I assume that we will have 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate on the amendment before voting?\n  Mr. LOTT. I amend the UC to make it clear to have, what has become \ncustomary, 2 minutes for a final explanation of what is in the \namendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Will these be 10-minute votes after the first one?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we intend to have 10-minute votes after \nthe first vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, the Bingaman amendment would be a \nchange in policy toward Cuba and we would have only 2 minutes to \ndiscuss that relative to its merits.\n  Mr. LOTT. There will be debate on that issue further tonight. The \nquestion was, would there only be 2 minutes for debate on the Bingaman-\nGraham amendment. I believe there would be further discussion on that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As long as Senators would like to discuss it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Tonight.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Would it be possible to ask, given the interest of \nmany on this and the impact this would have on American policy toward \nCuba, that we might, in this instance, ask for 5 minutes on each side \nto make our positions clear to Members before they vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I amend the UC to ask consent that we have \n10 minutes equally divided on both the Bingaman amendment and the \nHutchinson amendment if that time is required, with the debate on those \nto begin shortly after we come in at 9:30, and then the vote to begin \nat 10 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I understand Senator Specter has a \nproblem, and we will hear from him in a few minutes. He is apparently \non his way.\n  Mr. LOTT. I didn't hear any objection.\n  I think it is unfortunate we are not going to be able to get a \nunanimous-consent agreement now. By not doing so, we may have a \nproliferation of amendments, and we may have to go on later tonight. We \nhave really been working very well across the aisle to avoid this sort \nof problem, but I don't think we can resolve it right now.\n  So, we can proceed with this vote and see if we can work out an \nunderstanding as to how we will proceed later on tonight or in the \nmorning, and we can try the unanimous consent request again after the \nvote. We cannot assure Senators at this point that there will be no \nfurther votes tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the leader will yield, in the interest of \naccommodating a lot of our Senators who have made plans, could we at \nleast give them assurance that between now and 9:30 there will be no \nvotes tonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could, I appreciate the Democratic leader's efforts. \nHis effort has been about like mine--not too good yet.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Let's have the vote and work on this during the vote and try to get a \nUC after the vote.\n  I believe we have the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 901\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

I further ask there be 10 minutes equally divided for \ndebate relative to the Bingaman and Hutchinson amendments prior to each \nvote with respect to the amendments that are pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, does the leader also intend \nto ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays that have been \nordered on the underlying amendment, or ask to have it withdrawn?\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 900, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Dodd \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 900) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that when the Senate receives the House \ncompanion bill, the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration and \nall after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 955, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read for a third time \nand passed and the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House on the disagreeing votes and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I \nunderstand this agreement, it does not prevent us from going ahead and \nfacilitating the passage of some agreed-to amendments this evening. \nThere are two Senators here with amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have an unprinted amendment at the desk \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 902.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       The Boeing Company and McDonnell Douglas have announced \n     their merger; and\n       The Department of Defense has approved that merger as \n     consistent with the national security of the United States; \n     and\n       The Federal Trade Commission has found that merger not to \n     violate the anti-trust laws of the United States; and\n       The European Commission has consistently criticized and \n     threatened the merger before, during and after its \n     consideration of the facts; and\n       The sole true reason for the European Commission's \n     criticism and imminent disapproval of the merger is to gain \n     an unfair competitive advantage for Airbus, a government \n     owned aircraft manufacturer;\n       Now therefore, It is the Sense of the Senate that any such \n     disapproval on the part of the European Commission would \n     constitute an unwarranted and unprecedented interference in a \n     United States business transaction that would threaten \n     thousands of American aerospace jobs; and\n       The Senate suggests that the President take such actions as \n     he deems appropriate to protect U.S. interests in connection \n     therewith.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent Senators Murray and Boxer be \nadded as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is a last-minute amendment and I \ngreatly appreciate the indulgence of the managers, but it is of vital \nimportance. It now is increasingly evident, overwhelmingly evident, \nthat the European Commission is going to attempt to reject the Boeing-\nMcDonnell Douglas mergers in spite of the fact that the Department of \nDefense feels this is a significant step forward for our national \ndefense, in spite of the fact the Federal Trade Commission has not \ndetermined there are any trade violations in connection therewith.\n  That decision on the part of the European Commission seems to have \nbeen made in the absence of any evidence\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\nand before any evidence was submitted to it and solely on behalf of \ncreating a competitive advantage for Airbus. If it should hold, it will \nhave a seriously adverse impact on employment in the United States, \nparticularly with the Douglas portion of McDonnell Douglas, which could \nnot survive unaided or unmerged.\n  This resolution simply states those facts and states that any such \ndisapproval would be an unwarranted and unprecedented interference in a \nbusiness decision appropriately made in the United States and suggests \nto the President he take such actions as he deems necessary under the \ncircumstances.\n  I will make more extensive remarks on this issue sometime tomorrow, \nbut I appreciate the support of my colleagues on a matter of great \nimportance to employees in many States throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 902) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay it on the table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 898\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment numbered 898 to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 898.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . RESTRICTION ON ASSISTANCE MADE TO THE PALESTINIAN \n                   AUTHORITY.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be obligated or expended with respect to \n     providing funds to the Palestinian Authority, unless the \n     President certifies to Congress that:\n       (1) the Palestinian Authority is using its maximum efforts \n     to combat terrorism, and, in accordance with the Oslo \n     Accords, has ceased the use of violence, threat of violence, \n     or incitement to violence as a tool of the Palestinian \n     Authority's policy toward Israel;\n       (2) after a full investigation by the Department of \n     Justice, the Executive branch of Government concludes that \n     Chairman Arafat had no prior knowledge of the World Trade \n     Center bombing; and\n       (3) after a full inquiry by the Department of State, the \n     Executive branch of Government concludes that Chairman Arafat \n     did not authorize and did not fail to use his authority to \n     prevent the Tel Aviv cafe bombing of March 21, 1997.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides that none of the \nfunds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Palestinian \nAuthority shall be paid over to the Palestinian Authority unless the \nPresident certifies to the Congress, first, that the Palestinian \nAuthority is using its maximum efforts to combat terrorism in \naccordance with the Oslo accords, has ceased the violence or threat of \nviolence or incitement of violence as a tool of the Palestinian \nAuthority.\n  Second, after full investigation by the Department of Justice, the \nexecutive branch of Government concludes that Chairman Arafat had no \nprior knowledge of the World Trade Center bombing.\n  Third, after a full inquiry to the Department of State, the executive \nbranch of Government concludes that Chairman Arafat did not authorize \nand did not fail to use his authority to prevent the Tel Aviv cafe \nbombing of March 21, 1997.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would not impact upon the expenditures \nof U.S. funds for projects like water authorities or other projects \nwhich go to the people who are now directed to receive these funds, but \nto articulate with precision, would only involve the moneys which would \nbe paid to the Palestinian Authority.\n  It may well be that there is no intent to pay money now in the \npipeline for the Palestinian Authority, but I must say, Mr. President, \nthat after making substantial efforts to find out exactly what is going \non in the administration, I have been unable to make that \ndetermination. But whether or not there is an intent by the \nadministration not to pay money in the pipeline to the Palestinian \nAuthority, it is my view that this amendment is necessary as a matter \nof policy.\n  With respect to the issue of Chairman Arafat's knowledge of the Trade \nCenter bombing, a report has been made by Deputy Education Minister \nMoshe Peled of Israel that Arafat had prior knowledge of the bombing of \nthe Trade Center in New York City in 1993.\n  I have asked the Department of Justice, Mr. President, to conduct an \ninvestigation to determine whether or not that is true.\n  I ask unanimous consent the correspondence be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my statement as if read in full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essence of the matter is that this issue has been \nraised by a responsible Israeli official, and if Arafat in fact had \nprior knowledge of the bombing of the Trade Center, he may well be an \naccessory before the fact, or a coconspirator, and if that is so, he \nwould be extraditable to the United States under provisions of our \nterrorist legislation passed in 1984 and 1986.\n  It is simply unsatisfactory and intolerable to have that issue \noutstanding and be providing funding for the Palestinian Authority.\n  The issue has also been raised on the bombing of the Tel Aviv cafe on \nMarch 21, 1997, as to whether Chairman Arafat and the PLO made a \nmaximum effort to stop that kind of terrorism. Immediately after the \nbombing, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Arafat gave a green \nlight to that bombing. When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \nappeared before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee in our hearing this \nspring, she responded that Arafat had not given a green light, but \nneither had he given a red light. Under the provisions of the amendment \nintroduced by Senator Shelby and myself, Arafat has an absolute \nobligation, along with the PLO, to make the maximum effort to fight \nterrorism.\n  I have written to Secretary Albright on this subject, and I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is unsatisfactory, Mr. President, if Arafat did \nanything but put down a red light to stop the bombing of the Tel Aviv \ncafe which killed three Israelis and wounded dozens more, estimated to \nbe approximately 40 other Israelis. There ought to be absolutely no \ndoubt that if any funding is to come from the U.S. taxpayers to the \nPalestinian Authority, there be a certification by the President, based \non evidence that Yasser Arafat was not a party to, did not know about, \nwas not an accessory before the fact, or a coconspirator on the bombing \nof the Trade Center in 1993 and he, in fact, made the maximum effort \nwhich would require a red light on the bombing of the Tel Aviv \nrestaurant.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, this amendment is acceptable \nto both managers of the bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This is in response to your letter to \n     the Attorney General dated April 1, 1997. Your letter \n     encloses a news article from The Jerusalem Post in which it \n     is reported that Yasser Arafat may have had prior knowledge \n     of the bombing of the World Trade Center building on February \n     26, 1993.\n       Aside from the news report enclosed with your letter, the \n     Department of Justice is unaware of any information that \n     Yasser Arafat either had prior knowledge of the bombing of \n     the World Trade Center or was in any way involved in the \n     conspiracy to bomb the building. We have queried the Israeli \n     authorities about this information and they deny the accuracy \n     of the statements attributed in the article to the Deputy \n     Education Minister.\n       I hope this information is helpful. If we can be of further \n     assistance with regard to this or any other matter, please do \n     not hesitate to contact this office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General,\n     Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: By letter dated April 1, 1997, \n     (copy enclosed) I wrote to you concerning Israeli Deputy \n     Education Minister Moshe Peled's statement that Palestinian \n     Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had prior knowledge of the \n     1993 plot to bomb New York City's World Trade Center.\n       By letter dated April 29 (copy enclosed) Assistant Attorney \n     General Andrew Fois responded with a very generalized \n     statement about having ``queried the Israeli authorities.'' \n     No mention was made whether the Department of Justice talked \n     to Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled or did any real \n     pursuit on the matter.\n       Since I do not speak Hebrew, my assistant, David Brog, \n     Esquire, talked to Mr. Peled. Mr. Peled said that he was not \n     prepared to disclose any more information on Chairman \n     Arafat's connection in the World Trade Center bombing beyond \n     what he told the Jerusalem Post. Mr. Brog said that Mr. Peled \n     was not flexible on this point and that he (Mr. Brog) had the \n     impression that Mr. Peled had gotten into some trouble for \n     his previous disclosure.\n       I am interested to know whether the Department of Justice \n     talked to Mr. Peled before Mr. Fois's letter to me of April \n     29. If so, what he said. If not, why wasn't Mr. Peled \n     questioned.\n       I considered this an extremely serious matter. As you know, \n     Chairman Arafat could be extradited to the United States if \n     there is evidence to support Mr. Peled's charge.\n       I formally request the Department of Justice to conduct a \n     real investigation on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General,\n     Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: Just yesterday I saw a news \n     report that Israeli intelligence has evidence that \n     Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had prior \n     knowledge of the 1993 plot to bomb New York City's World \n     Trade Center which killed six people.\n       That news report quoted Deputy Education Minister Moshe \n     Peled stating:\n       ``More than that, he [referring to Arafat] was part of the \n     discussions on the operation.''\n     The news report further said that Arafat was privy to the \n     conspiracy and met with Sudanese and Islamic terrorist \n     leaders.\n       With this letter, I am enclosing for you a photostatic copy \n     of the news report from the Jerusalem Post on March 26.\n       I would very much appreciate it if you would conduct the \n     appropriate investigation to determine what evidence exists, \n     if any, of Arafat's complicity in this matter.\n       It appears to me that, if true, Arafat would be \n     prosecutable under U.S. criminal laws. I would appreciate \n     your advice as to what indictments could be brought as to \n     Chairman Arafat.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Madeleine Albright,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: According to the weekend press \n     reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated \n     that Palestinian Chairman Yassir Arafat has indirectly given \n     a green light to the terrorists resulting in the suicide bomb \n     which killed and wounded many Israelis last Friday.\n       According to the news reports, Chairman Arafat and the \n     Palestinian authority released Ibrahim Maqadmeh. Prime \n     Minister Netanyahu further stated that Chairman Arafat and \n     the Palestinian authority have failed to detain known \n     terrorists and to confiscate weaponry.\n       In my judgment, it is very important for the State \n     Department to make a factual determination as to whether \n     Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority did give a \n     green light indirectly to the terrorists and whether there \n     was a failure to detain known terrorists and to confiscate \n     weaponry.\n       I would appreciate your advice, as promptly as possible, on \n     your Department's conclusion as to whether Chairman Arafat \n     and the Palestinian authority gave an indirect green light to \n     the terrorists.\n       As you know, an amendment offered by Senator Shelby and \n     myself to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995 \n     conditions the $500 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinian \n     authority on presidential certification that the Palestinian \n     authority is complying with all of its commitments under its \n     peace accords with Israel, including its commitment to \n     prevent acts of terrorism and undertake ``legal measures \n     against terrorists, including the arrest and prosecution of \n     individuals suspected of perpetrating acts of violence and \n     terror.''\n       The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign \n     Operations, on which I sit, will soon be considering this \n     issue for fiscal year 1998 so I would appreciate your prompt \n     response.\n       In addition, I would appreciate your advising me as to \n     whether there is any U.S. aid in the pipeline which has not \n     yet been turned over to the Palestinian authority. If so, I \n     request that such payments be withheld until the \n     determination as to whether the Palestinian authority is \n     complying with the Specter-Shelby amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 898) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have passed, have we, the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton]?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We agreed to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Did that show the other distinguished Senator from \nWashington as a cosponsor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                                 Egypt\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the hour is late, and I know a number of \nour colleagues, Senator DeWine in particular, has been very gracious or \nanxious to discuss some important issues.\n  I just rise for a few moments to discuss the role of Egypt in the \nMiddle East process. I think we all understand the dream of peace in \nthe Middle East is going to take courage, patience and commitment from \nall of the countries in the region. Unfortunately, Egypt, the second \nlargest recipient of U.S. aid, has taken a number of actions of late \nwhich seem more likely to undermine the peace that grew out of Anwar \nSadat's courageous decision to go to Israel.\n  I rise, therefore, with several other colleagues, questioning several \nof these actions by Egypt, a long-time recipient of substantial amounts \nof U.S. foreign assistance. These actions, in my view, raise serious \nquestions, especially when they seem to contradict U.S. efforts to \nsecure a lasting peace in the Middle East. Specifically, I am troubled \nby Egypt hosting an Arab League summit in Cairo earlier this year in \nwhich Egypt supported the renewal of the Arab League boycott of Israel. \nThis represents a clear violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace \ntreaty. U.S. policy has long sought to end the boycott. Yet, in this \nsituation there is a recipient of U.S. aid that supports it. I am also \ntroubled that Egypt has emerged as Libyan Leader Qadhafi's most \nimportant advocate internationally.\n\n  Egyptian President Mubarak has publicly stated that Egypt does not \nproduce chemical weapons, that Libya does not produce chemical weapons. \nHe has advocated easing United States sanctions on Libya, and he has \nviolated the U.N. ban on air travel by allowing Qadhafi to fly to the \nArab summit in Cairo.\n  What is particularly of distress to this Senator is President Mubarak \nwas the only leader to decline President Clinton's invitation to attend \nan October Middle East summit in Washington to revise the peace process \nand to end ongoing violence.\n  Most recently, Mr. President, and colleagues, we have seen some \nefforts by top Egyptian officials to take actions to reinvigorate the \npeace negotiations. I am very hopeful that those recent actions will be \na signal that Egypt intends to play a more constructive role in the \ndays ahead, in terms of producing a lasting peace. I have been \nespecially pleased to see the strong, bipartisan support here in the \nSenate for the Middle East process, and for the good work begun in \nOslo, and I am very hopeful that Egypt will see that there is strong \nconcern right now in the United States Senate about a number of their \nactions of late and that the Congress will be monitoring those actions \ncarefully.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 903\n\n       (Purpose: To limit assistance for Haiti unless certain \n     conditions are satisfied)\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 903.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, line 4, strike ``Institute.'' and insert \n     ``Institute: Provided further, That of the funds made \n     available under this heading for Haiti, up to $250,000 may be \n     made available to support a program to assist Haitian \n     children in orphanages.''.\n       On page 18, line 2, before the period insert the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That of the amount appropriated under \n     this heading, not less than $500,000 shall be available only \n     for the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) of the Haitian \n     National Police''.\n       On page 93, strike lines 7 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                   limitation on assistance for haiti\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Limitation.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be provided to the \n     Government of Haiti unless the President reports to Congress \n     that the Government of Haiti--\n       (1) is conducting thorough investigations of extrajudicial \n     and political killings;\n       (2) is cooperating with United States authorities in the \n     investigations of political and extrajudicial killings;\n       (3) has made demonstrable progress in privatizing major \n     governmental parastatals, including demonstrable progress \n     toward the material and legal transfer of ownership of such \n     parastatals; and\n       (4) has taken action to remove from the Haitian National \n     Police, national palace and residential guard, ministerial \n     guard, and any other public security entity of Haiti those \n     individuals who are credibly alleged to have engaged in or \n     conspired to conceal gross violations of internationally \n     recognized human rights.\n       (b) Exceptions.--The limitation in subsection (a) does not \n     apply to the provision of humanitarian, electoral, counter \n     narcotics, or development assistance.\n       (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirements of \n     this section on a semiannual basis if the President \n     determines and certifies to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress that such waiver is in the national interest of the \n     United States.\n       (d) Parastatals Defined.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``parastatal'' means a government-owned enterprise.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment is an attempt to strengthen \nour aid program to the troubled republic island of Haiti. It would help \nmake sure that United States assistance is properly targeted, so it can \nbe more readily effective in areas vital to United States interests.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does three things. No. 1, it provides up \nto $250,000 for a program to assist Haitian children currently in \norphanages. Today, Mr. President, Catholic Relief Services [CRS], and \nthe Adventist Development and Relief Agency [ADRA] support thousands of \nHaitian children. They basically administer AID Food. There are \nthousands of children who are receiving one meal a day because of AID \nassistance that is administered through both CRS and the ADRA. It is \nvitally important that this assistance continue.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not deal directly with this food. \nWhat it does deal with is the bigger problem of the orphanages of \nHaiti. I have had the opportunity to visit at least 12 of these \norphanages in Haiti over the last few months. There are at least 70 \nsuch orphanages just in the Port-au-Prince area alone, containing \nthousands of children. It is something to see and something to behold \nto see the work that is being done. These orphanages would break a \nperson's heart, and does, when you see the children who are there. This \namendment sets aside a relatively small amount of money to look at this \nproblem from the long range.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, due to lack of resources the orphanages in \nHaiti cannot take in many of the needy children. This amendment would \nprovide much-needed resources to help alleviate the demand on these \norphanages, by helping take care of the children in other ways.\n  Clearly, what these children need, in the final analysis, is not just \ntemporary shelter, but permanent placement in safe, stable homes where \nthey can count on food and clothing. The funds provided by this \namendment would help make that permanent home a reality for more of \nHaiti's children. It would do this by bringing about some coordination \namong the orphanages and coordination with respect to our AID mission.\n  Mr. President, the second part of our amendment would specify that no \nless than $500,000 be made available, and made available only for the \nSpecial Investigation Unit, the SIU, of the Haitian national police.\n  Mr. President, in my visits to Haiti I have talked with members of \nthe SIU, and I talked with the American contract officer who is down \nthere assisting the SIU unit. One of the things that we have observed \nand that this country has promoted in emerging democracies is the \nbelief that if a country is to emerge as a democracy, whether it be \nHaiti, whether it be Bosnia, wherever in the world, that the country \nhas to turn its back on its past and has to stop tolerating political \nmurders, political killings, political crimes, whether they occur from \nthe left or from the right. The SIU unit has a very specific task. Its \ntask is to target these political murderers, to bring them to justice, \nand to see that they are successfully tried. By doing that, and only by \ndoing that, Mr. President, can we effectively see justice in these \nemerging democracies. And only by doing this can the people of the \ncountry understand that democracy not only means free elections, but \ndemocracy also means justice, and these days of political killings must \nbe over.\n  It is important, Mr. President, that support for the SIU \ninvestigations continue as investigators build compelling cases against \nthose who have used brutal force to achieve, in the past, political \ngoals.\n  Mr. President, over 80 extrajudicial and political killing cases have \nbeen assigned to the SIU by the Government of Haiti. The Government has \nrequested that close to two dozen of those cases be investigated on a \n``priority basis.'' However, sadly, not enough progress has been made \non these high-profile political murder cases. In fact, to date, none of \nthe cases have been successfully prosecuted.\n  Mr. President, the SIU is being integrated slowly into the newly \nformed judicial police and is receiving more and more political \nsupport, and support from the Haitian people. The people of Haiti want \nto turn the corner on their long history of political violence. \nContinued assistance and targeted assistance to the SIU would \nstrengthen Haiti and strengthen United States-Haiti relations as well.\n  No. 3, and probably most important. This amendment would limit \nassistance to Haiti, unless four conditions are met:\n  Funds are made available if the President reports to Congress that \nthe Government of Haiti, No. 1, is conducting thorough investigations \nof extrajudicial and political killings; No. 2, is cooperating with the \nUnited States authorities on this matter; No. 3, has made progress in \nprivatizing major Government-owned enterprises, including progress \ntoward the material and legal transfer of ownership of these \nenterprises; finally, No. 4, that the government is taking action to \nremove from the Haitian national police, and from related agencies, \nindividuals who are alleged, credibly alleged, to have engaged in or \nconspired to conceal gross human rights violations.\n  Now, Mr. President, in essence, my amendment is designed to make \nclear that Congress does not intend United States assistance to Haiti \nto be viewed as unconditional. In fact, the first two conditions that I \nhave just mentioned were already imposed by Congress in the form of an \namendment sponsored by our distinguished colleague, former majority \nleader of the U.S. Senate, Senator Bob Dole. By adding the new third \nand fourth conditions, this amendment strengthens the Dole amendment \nthat currently governs our policy toward Haiti.\n  Now, the limitations I propose will not apply to the provision of \nhumanitarian, electoral, counternarcotics, or developmental assistance, \nand it does, as the Dole amendment does, contain a ``national \ninterest'' presidential waiver.\n  Mr. President, the amendment currently in force which limits \nassistance to Haiti, the Dole amendment, has been waived four times \nover the last two years by this administration.\n  I believe the conclusion is clear. To make sure United States \ninterests in Haiti are protected, that amendment\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\nneeds to be strengthened. That is the purpose of this amendment that I \nam offering today.\n  Mr. President, Haiti is now in the midst of a political crisis. The \nresignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth on June 9 has laid bare a \nvery serious problem of leadership. For a number of reasons, which \ninclude the political prominence of former President Aristide, the \ncurrent President, President Preval--despite some truly heroic \nefforts--has not yet been able to effectively promote economic reform.\n  Mr. President, if this crisis is not met successfully, it could pose \na real threat to United States policy interests and to the overall \ninvestment the United States has made in Haiti since our deployment of \ntroops beginning in September 1994. In my view, Mr. President, if \nPresident Preval is given the space to govern, there is no reason to \nbelieve he will not make the necessary reforms--as he did previously in \npromoting fiscal austerity over the last 16 months.\n  Mr. President, we want to help President Preval find that space to \ngovern. That is one major purpose of the amendment that I am proposing.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we as a nation cannot afford to wash \nour hands of a country in which we have made such a sizable investment. \nThe amendment I am proposing today would make our aid more effective \nand would help the forces in Haiti that are fighting the uphill battle \nfor genuine reform.\n  Mr. President, I request a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 903) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n       full funding for the international development association\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I voice my support for meeting \nU.S. commitments to the International Development Association [IDA] by \nfully funding replenishment to IDA-10 and IDA-11.\n  The International Development Association was established in 1960 to \nlend to the poorest and least creditworthy developing countries on \nconfessional terms. Only countries with a per capita income below $905 \nwith limited or no ability to borrow on market terms and a record of \nusing IDA resources effectively are eligible. Currently, 79 counties \nmeet IDA's loan criteria--55 percent of the world's population. Twenty \ncountries have graduated from IDA. Very notably, three of these \ngraduate countries--Botswana, Korea, and Turkey--are now IDA donors. \nThis is a solid rate of success.\n  IDA provides development assistance to poor countries through loans, \nrather than grants. Loans must be repaid in full. IDA funds come \nlargely from contributions of 35 donor countries negotiated in general \nreplenishment. Increasingly, repayments of past IDA loans are \nsupplementing IDA income. As a result, the U.S. share of contributions \nto IDA has decreased by 20 percent since it was established in 1960.\n  The administration's request of $1.035 billion for IDA is divided \ninto two parts: $235 million to meet U.S. payments to IDA's 10th \nreplenishment and $800 million for the first of two U.S. payments for \nIDA-11. The subcommittee recommends $950 million in funding for IDA for \nfiscal year 1998. This would fully fund the first U.S. payment for IDA-\n11 but not fully meet payment owned for IDA-10. I support increasing \nthe appropriation for IDA by $84.5 million to fund both replenishments \nin full.\n  I appreciate the work that the subcommittee has done to address a \nmajor concern associated with IDA: Restrictions on U.S. procurement \nopportunities imposed by the Interim Trust Fund [ITF]. The ITF was \ncreated by donors who did not want to disrupt IDA's operations by \nleaving a 1-year gap in new funding when the U.S. budget situation \nprecluded us from meeting commitments to both IDA-11 and IDA-10. At \nthat time, controversy emerged over the terms of the ITF which limited \ndecisionmaking and procurement to contributing countries only. As a \nresult, U.S. officials and businesses were excluded from participating \nin projects financed by the $3.3 million fund. Last year, the Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill contained a provision that required the \nadministration to work with other donors to modify procurement \nrestrictions. The administration has negotiated an agreement with the \nITF whereby $1 billion, or about one-third, of projects financed by the \ntrust fund have not yet been completed. Full funding of IDA-10 and IDA-\n11 will allow U.S. firms to bid on these contracts. The Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee's efforts on the matter of U.S. procurement are \ncommendable.\n\n\n                              Section 569\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished ranking member, Mr. Leahy, regarding the meaning and \nintent of a provision in this bill, section 569. This involves a matter \nof great importance to my colleague Mr. Leahy and myself--human rights. \nI commend my colleague for his leadership on this important issue.\n  I share your concern that U.S. foreign assistance funds not be used \nby perpetrators of gross violations of human rights. I also share your \ninterest in ensuring that perpetrators of such crimes are brought to \njustice. To this end, section 569 of this act prevents funds made \navailable under this act from being provided to any unit of the \nsecurity forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has \ncredible evidence to believe a member of such unit has committed gross \nviolations of human rights. Would the Chairman agree that this \nprovision only applies to units of the security forces of a foreign \ncountry that currently have members against whom we have credible \nevidence of gross violations of human rights.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So that if a unit was believed to have had, at some time \nin the past, a person against whom we have credible evidence of human \nrights abuses, but that no such person currently is a member of such a \nunit, that unit would be eligible to receive assistance under this act?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Vermont, and I \nlook forward to working with him on this matter in the future.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee.\n  It is my understanding that the foreign operations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998, S. 955, includes an increase of $30 million to combat \ninfectious diseases such as TB, malaria, dengue fever, and the ebola \nvirus.\n  It has been brought to my attention that the Gorgas Memorial \nInstitute is developing an innovative regional TB control initiative \ndesigned to address major issues in reducing the global TB epidemic \nthrough training and new approaches to disease control. I believe the \nwork done at the institute would fit well with the priorities outlined \nby the committee.\n  Would the ranking member join me in urging the Agency for \nInternational Development to provide funding for this initiative?\n  Mr. LEAHY. This initiative sounds like the kind of initiative the \ncommittee wanted to consider supporting in providing these funds and I \nwould encourage AID to give full and fair consideration of the Gorgas \nInstitute's proposal.\n\n\n                            nagorno karabagh\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI Mr. President, I would like to engage the ranking member \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding \nhumanitarian assistance to Nagorno Karabagh.\n  The conflict in Nagorno Karabagh has cost over 15,000 lives and has \ncreated severe economic hardship and deprivation. In Nagorno Karabagh \nthere are thousands of land mines directly threatening lives and \nstifling agricultural production. There is a severe shortage of \nmedicines and vaccines. This shortage has made it difficult to treat \nand prevent intestinal and acute respiratory infectious diseases in \nchildren. The Azerbaijani and Turkish blockades have substantially \nworsened these problems.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development and the United Nations \nprovide humanitarian aid to Armenia and Azerbaijan--but this aid does \nnot get to the people of Nagorno Karabagh.\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nNongovernmental organizations do provide a small amount of humanitarian \nassistance to the people of Nagorno Karabagh, but these programs \nreceive no funding from USAID.\n  I strongly believe that the United States should provide funds to \nnongovernmental organizations to provide aid to all areas of conflict \nin the Caucasus--including Nagorno Karabagh. Politically based \ndiscrimination against providing humanitarian assistance to particular \ncategories of recipients is against our values--and is inconsistent \nwith America's long-term foreign policy goals.\n  Mr. President, few people have done more to provide aid to people in \nneed than the Senator from Vermont. I would like to ask him if he will \ncontinue to work with me to remove any constraints in providing \nhumanitarian aid to the people of Nagorno Karabagh?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the Senator's position. I strongly support \nthe principle of delivering humanitarian aid to those in need in the \nCaucasus and will work with her in the conference to try to ensure that \nthese needs are met.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 955, \nthe foreign operations and export financing appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  The Senate bill provides $16.8 billion in budget authority and $5.1 \nbillion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of \nState, Export and Military Assistance, Bilateral and Multilateral \nEconomic Assistance, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 1997.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $16.8 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n  The subcommittee is at its section 602(b) allocation for budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this \npoint.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           S. 955, FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS, 1998, SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL          \n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory   Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n  Budget authority............................................  .......     16,721   .......        44    16,765\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,083   .......        44    13,127\nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority............................................  .......     16,721   .......        44    16,765\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,083   .......        44    13,127\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority............................................  .......     16,844   .......        44    16,888\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,171   .......        44    13,215\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority............................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  .......\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  .......\nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO--                                                                              \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority............................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  .......\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  .......\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority............................................  .......

Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill has come to \nthe Senate floor, and commend the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Vermont for all of their hard work in authoring this important \nlegislation. S. 955 provides increased funding for international \naffairs functions of our Government, a priority that has been neglected \nin recent years. I agree with Secretary of State Madeline Albright, who \nhas argued that we can no longer conduct foreign policy on the cheap.\n  Section 571 of this bill is a briefly worded but very significant \nrestriction on U.S. military assistance. Mr. President, Indonesia is an \nemerging power in South Asia that has a very considerable economic \nrelationship with the United States. I have long believed that we \nshould fully engage the developing world not only for our own economic \ninterests, but also so that the citizens of these nations can enjoy \neconomic prosperity. Such economic development is the best means of \nenhancing long-term peace and stability.\n  Unfortunately, though, Indonesia has yet to join the community of \nnations in respecting basic human rights and permitting political \nfreedom. Indonesia's continuing repression of East Timor has dampened \nhope that this nation's tremendous economic success will be matched by \nprogress on human rights and democracy. In just the past month, \ninternational human rights activists have cited the disappearance and \npossible torture of a number of East Timorese civilians. This news \ncomes as the State Department has sharply criticized Indonesia's human \nrights record in its annual report issued in January.\n  These events are just the latest examples of the Indonesian \nGovernment's continuing denial of fundamental rights to the people of \nEast Timor. This past May, Indonesia held an election which was widely \ndiscredited as undemocratic. This election, which returned the ruling \nparty to power as has been done in every election since 1971, was \nmarred by violence that killed 200 people. Clearly, Indonesia must end \nits behavior that has caused so much pain and suffering among its \npeople.\n  Mr. President, section 571 would simply prevent United States \nmilitary equipment sold or transferred to Indonesia from being used in \nEast Timor, the site of the most egregious human rights violations \ncommitted by this government. The United States should have no part of \nthis oppression, particularly through the provision of military \nequipment. I commend the managers of this bill for including this \nimportant restriction, and am hopeful that it will be enacted into law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased that the bill managers were able to accept my \namendment to prohibit Army Corps consideration of permits that would \nresult in the diversion of ground water from the Great Lakes Basin.\n  As my Great Lakes colleagues know, the Army Corps recently stated its \nopinion that ground water is not covered by section 1109 of the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986. This section states that, ``No water \nshall be diverted from any portion of the Great Lakes within the United \nStates, or from any tributary within the United State of any of the \nGreat Lakes, for use outside the Great Lakes Basin unless such \ndiversion is approved by the Governor of each of the Great Lakes States \n. . .'' and places contraints on funds for any Federal agency study of \nthe feasibility of such a diversion. As I have indicated to the Army \nCorps, a careful review of the act's legislative history, the Great \nLakes Charter, the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, the Federal charter \nof the Great Lakes Commission and its predecessor, and subsequent \ncongressional authorizations and appropriations referencing the waters \nof the Great Lakes Basin, shows that ground water recharging or \ndischarging into the Great Lakes is clearly part of the Great Lakes \nBasin hydrologically speaking and is therefore not divertable without \nadherence to section 1109. In a nutshell, I disagree with the Corps' \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nGreat Lakes region and the conferees to keep this provision intact. \nThis 1-year prohibition will provide time for the appropriate parties \nto get together and determine how best to proceed, including possible \nlegislative clarification, to permanently prevent covert diversions of \na very precious resource, ground water in the Great Lakes Basin.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, as a member of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, I want to commend both Chairman McConnell and Senator \nLeahy. Once again, the leadership of the subcommittee has produced a \nbill that I am sure will be widely and bipartisanly supported by the \nSenate.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to commend Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright. The Secretary appeared before the subcommittee to \nexplain and justify the administration's increased request for this \nbill. But she went further than this, further than her Democratic and \nRepublican predecessors at the State Department. Secretary Albright has \ntaken the case for foreign aid and the work of this subcommittee \ndirectly to the American people. She has done a remarkable job \nconveying to our constituents the benefits to the American people of \nour role in the world and the importance of continued U.S. leadership \nabroad.\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\n  The foreign operations, export financing, and related programs \nAppropriations bill provides monies to meet a great number of important \npolicy initiatives. I want to use my time today to draw attention to \njust a few of the important initiatives.\n  Importantly and with my full support, this bill fully funds the \nAdministration's assistance request for our democratic ally Israel. I \nvisited Israel late last year with a delegation of my constituents. It \nwas my first trip to the Middle East. The trip was a wonderful \nexperience that has benefited me personally and professionally as I \napproach my work at the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I met with \nPrime Minister Netanyahu, with the chief Palestinian negotiator, and \nwith the Norweigian diplomats who negotiated the Oslo accords. I met \nwith the Ambassador to Israel, toured important historic and cultural \nsites, and stood atop the Golan Heights. More than ever, I am convinced \nthat the foreign assistance moneys provided by this legislation to \nIsrael and in support of the peace process are warranted and of \nstrategic importance to the United States.\n  This bill is also a key tool in our efforts to increase U.S. exports \nand to generate new jobs all across the country. The provisions of this \nbill providing moneys for the Export-Import Bank of the United States, \nthe Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade Development \nAgency are vitally important to my constituents. A recent 1997 study \ntitled, ``Foreign Exports and the Washington State Economy,'' concluded \nthat ``no state derives more economic benefit from the production of \ngoods and services for the foreign markets that Washington State.'' \nShortly after the turn of the century, one in three Washington State \njobs will be reliant upon international trade. Jobs related to trade in \nmy state also paid wages 46 percent higher than the State average. \nThese trade promotion programs are priority issues for me and I am \npleased that we've met the administration's request for these programs. \nIn the case of the Ex-Im Bank, the subcommittee has exceeded the \nadministration's request.\n  Another key component of this bill is our assistance program to \nRussia and the newly independent states. This assistance is as \nimportant as any granted by the United States. It is a small price to \npay to ensure that the trillions of dollars spent on the cold war does \nnot go to waste. Certainly there are problems on the ground in Russia \nand the NIS countries; religious persecution, political and economic \ncorruption, weapons proliferation and environmental pollution to name \njust a few. The United States must be diligent in tackling these \nproblems as they arise in our continuing efforts to promote and support \ndemocracy.\n  I am particularly interested in our efforts to increase and highlight \nthe linkages between the Russian Far East and the west coast of the \nUnited States. Washington State is as involved in the Russian Far East \nas any State in the country. Chairman Stevens is also personally very \nknowledgeable about the importance of this region as Alaska also \nmaintains many direct ties to the Russian Far East.\n  The Committee bill also contains many important provisions to \nchildren. It contains funding for UNICEF and other child survival \nprograms. Our bill provides moneys to educate young girls as well as \nprovide microcredit loans to young families and women in the developing \nworld. These funds make an enormous difference in the lives of millions \nof children and families in the world.\n  I have touched on just a few of the the provisions within this \nimportant bill. Again, I want to thank the manager's for bringing this \nlegislation to the Senate today. And I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the foreign operations legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to commend the managers of the FY \n1998 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for their hard work in \nfashioning this measure, and for getting it to the floor in a timely \nmanner. The bill appropriates some $13,244,208,000 for the programs in \nFY 1998, is within its 602(b) Allocations, and is below the amount \nrequested by the Administration by about $116 million\n  The committee in its report indicates that the time is arriving for a \nreview of our priorities and programs in this area, a bottom up review \nand a new scrutiny over programs and the extent to which they serve \nU.S. interests abroad. I am pleased that the Committee has focused on \nthe progress we are making in supporting the growth of democracy and \nfree market economies in Eastern Europe, the former states of the \nSoviet Union, and Russia and the Ukraine. Certainly the payoff for \nhelping stabilize and nurture the growth of solid democratic \ninstitutions is far preferable to the extreme expense of maintaining \narms races, such as we had to do during the course of over four decades \nof cold war.\n  I am pleased that the Committee has included a provision that I \nsuggested to provide traditional incentives, through programs such as \nthe EXIM Bank, OPIC, the Trade and Development Program and the Foreign \nCommercial Service, to American companies operating in the oil-rich new \nsovereign nation of Azerbaijan. The bill pays appropriately high \nattention to the Caucasus, including Georgia, and Armenia, as well as \nAzerbaijan, and I think it is appropriate. American companies need the \nunstinting support of our government so as to compete effectively in \nthat region, in light of the fact that foreign nations provide heavy \nassistance to their firms in that region. We need to keep the playing \nfield level so that our firms stand a fighting change of success in \nthat region in the development of Caspian region oil.\n  I am pleased that the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. McConnell has \noffered an amendment to restore the earmark for Egypt in the bill. I \nbelieve that there should be a time in the not too distant future when \nthe earmarks for Egypt and Israel should be reduced and finally \neliminated. They are in effect entitlements which have accounted for a \nlarge percentage of our national program, and I do not think they \nshould be regarded as permanent. They must be subject to review just as \nthe rest of our programs are. Having said that, however, I believe \nthat, so long as the earmark for Israel remains in the bill, that for \nEgypt must as well.\n  Egypt has been a pillar of strength and support for the United States \nacross the board. It has served to pick up the flagging momentum of the \npeace process which resulted from the negative actions by the Israeli \nPrime Minister and his right wing constituency in initiating \ninflammatory new settler housing in disputed Arab territories throwing \na cold bucket of water on the momentum of that process. The Egyptian \ngovernment has acted with courage and constancy in bringing its good \noffices to bear as an intermediary between the Israeli government and \nthe Palestinians as a time when the United States needed help in that \nrole;. I did not agree with removing the earmark for Egypt, just at a \ntime when I think Egyptian actions were serving as invaluable support \nfor the United States in keeping the peace process moving against a \ndifficult adverse current established by Israeli actions. So, encourage \nthe President of Egypt, Mr. Mubarak, to continue his efforts to play \nthe constructive role that he has been playing in the Middle East.\n  I would also point out, Mr. President, that Egypt and the United \nStates have a special security relationship, a relationship that proved \ninvaluable to the United States during the Gulf War against Kuwaiti \naggression, is the basis for extensive exercises and joint operations \nday in and day out, together in the Middle East. Our two nations work \nclosely together to counter terrorism, and extremism, to protect the \nsecure flow of oil from that region, and the safe use of the vital air \nand sea routes in the region. It should be clear that Egypt's important \nstrategic, geographical position, commanding the waterways linking the \nGulf, Europe and the United States, makes her an indispensable \nstrategic partner of the United States. This is a relationship that \nrequires nurturing and regular dialogue and support.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the foreign operations \nappropriations bill now before the Senate, which will provide the \nnecessary funds for foreign assistance programs of the United States in \nthe coming fiscal year. Foreign aid is an important component of U.S. \nforeign policy. In addition to being a tangible demonstration of \nAmerican leadership, it is a key instrument in encouraging and \nsupporting\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nAmerican values of democracy, respect for human rights, and free trade.\n  In recent years, foreign policy spending has suffered drastic \ncutbacks. According to a study of the Congressional Research Service, \nprepared earlier this year at my request, foreign policy spending for \nthe current fiscal year is at its lowest level in 20 years.\n  Moreover, the steepest reductions in our foreign policy budget have \ncome in foreign assistance, which at $11.5 billion last year, in fiscal \nyear 1998 dollars, is lower, in real terms, than any year of the last \ntwenty, and some 36 percent below the historical average of that \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, this year's foreign operations bill thankfully has \nstarted to reverse this precipitous decline. It provides $13.24 billion \nfor foreign assistance and export financing programs. I commend the \nAppropriations Committee for its hard work and applaud the bipartisan \neffort its members have shown in enhancing the level of funding for our \nNation's foreign assistance programs.\n  This legislation provides enhanced funding for critical foreign \nassistance programs, a few of which I will mention briefly.\n  The Appropriations Committee has recognized the importance of \ndevelopment assistance programs by providing $1.8 billion, $100 million \nover the President's request.\n  While the $485 million appropriated for the seed program for newly \ndemocratizing countries in Eastern Europe is regretfully below the \nPresident's request, the Committee's recommendation of $800 million for \nthe nations of the former Soviet Union will allow our Nation to \ncontinue its efforts to bring democracy, stability, and prosperity to \nthose former Communist States.\n  Mr. President, I am somewhat concerned about the considerable number \nof earmarks in this bill, and the number of ``subearmarks,'' that is, \ndesignation of funds for specific programs within specific countries in \nEastern Europe and Eurasia.\n  I am not opposed to earmarks in principle; Congressional priorities \noften differ with those of the executive branch, and the Congress has \nevery right to protect those priorities by specific earmarks.\n  But the proliferation of such provisions unduly limits the \nadministration's flexibility in a region that is constantly in flux. So \nI hope the committee will consider reducing the number of earmarks in \nthe conference with the House.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately it has become popular of late to assert \nthat foreign aid is merely the foreign policy equivalent of welfare--a \nsupposed massive giveaway that yields few benefits to American \ninterests.\n  To the contrary, American contributions to these efforts are an \nimportant way in which we protect our interests abroad, a fact that the \nAppropriations Committee has recognized through its enhanced funding \nlevels for foreign assistance programs.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy once again \nfor their work on this important piece of legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n\n                  Child Survival and Disease Programs\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the child \nsurvival and disease program fund. I understand that the House \nCommittee on Appropriations, as a part of its foreign operations, \nexport financing, and related programs bill, has recommended that $650 \nmillion be allocated to the fund's programs for fiscal year 1998. On \nthe House side, the subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead, \nas my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Tony Hall, has also in \nprotecting these child survival programs. I commend him for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  The Clinton administration, however, has not specifically designated \nany direct funding for the child survival programs. Mr. President, in \norder to preserve the benefits of these important programs for children \nworldwide, I believe that the Senate should accept, when we go to \nconference, the House language that was agreed to in committee for this \nfund. It is, I believe, Mr. President, a tragedy, that millions of \nchildren die each year through disease, malnutrition, and other \nconsequences of poverty that are both preventable and treatable. The \nprograms in the child survival fund, which are intended to reduce \ninfant mortality and improve the health and nutrition of children, \naddress the various problems of young people struggling to survive in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Mr. President, this fund places a priority on the needs of more than \n100 million children worldwide who are displaced and/or who have become \norphans. The fund includes initiatives to curb the resurgence of \ncommunicable diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, in the \nunderdeveloped world, eradicating polio, as well as preventing and \ncontrolling the spread of HIV and AIDS.\n  Mr. President, aside from the addressing issues of health, the fund \nalso supports basic education programs. Investment in education yields \none of the highest social and economic rates of return because it gives \nchildren the necessary tools to become self-sufficient adults. Each \nadditional year of primary and secondary education results in a 10-to-\n20 percent wage increase, and a 25-percent net increase in income.\n  Mr. President, the programs supported by the child survival fund are \neffective, and they are effective because they save three million lives \neach year through immunization, vitamin supplementation, oral \nrehydration therapy, and also through the treatment of childhood \nrespiratory infections which are the second largest killer of children \non Earth.\n  Mr. President, eliminating the symptoms and the causes of this \nproblem is not only the humane thing to do. It is also a necessary \nprerequisite for global stability and for global prosperity.\n  In my view, Mr. President, Congress needs to maintain its support for \nthese very valuable programs. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee will, when we go to conference, accept the \nHouse language.\n  The child survival and disease programs are effective, they are \nimportant, and they should, Mr. President, be continued.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee on the floor, and my colleague from the State \nof Kentucky. I wonder if he has any comment about this.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have listened closely to the comments \nof my good friend from Ohio, and I would like to thank him for them and \ncommend him for his tireless efforts in supporting the children's \ncauses, not only here in the United States but throughout the world.\n  I would like to assure my good friend from Ohio that I will give \nevery possible consideration to his request when we go to conference \nwith the House on the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, if I could inquire of my colleague from Kentucky, I \nhave a statement which I would like to give at some point this evening \nin regard to the vote we are going to have tomorrow. I can refrain from \ndoing that if it works with the chairman's schedule, or I can do it \nnow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have a block of amendments that have been cleared on \nboth sides that I would like to offer. Senator Bennett is also here.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the floor at this time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Amendments Numbered 904 to 919, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, this is a short, simple amendment dealing \nwith our China policy. It has the support of the State Department; \nbusiness; and Chinese dissidents. I hope it will also get the support \nof Congress.\n  The amendment, very simply, allows the Asian Environmental \nPartnership to operate in China. It does not add any spending to the \nbill, and does not change the basics of the program in any way. So I \nhope this will not be controversial.\n  Let me begin with a review of what the Asian Environmental \nPartnership does. AEP is a small export promotion program created \nduring the Bush Administration. It offers technical help with \nenvironmental policy, and brings foreign governments together with \nAmerican producers of environmental services and technologies.\n  In several Southeast Asia countries, AEP has helped us achieve \nenvironmental goals and to boost American exports to a region where we \nsuffer large trade deficits. But the Asian Environmental Partnership \ndoes not now operate in China. That is because it receives some funds \nfrom the Agency for International Development, which is barred from \noperating in China.\n  It is very clear, of course, that we do not need a foreign aid \nprogram for China. China has a lot of money and is quite capable of \nsupporting itself.\n  But it is just as clear that we need a sound approach to \nenvironmental problems in China. Whether you look at water pollution, \nurban air, rural lakes and streams, or hazardous waste, China is one of \nthe world's most polluted countries. That causes a great deal of \nsuffering for Chinese people. And as China grows, it makes more and \nmore contribution to global climate change, ocean pollution, and other \nphenomena which affect China's neighbors and even us here in the United \nStates.\n  We in America can help ease these problems. We can provide some \nhumanitarian relief from needless suffering caused by unsafe water, air \nand waste. We can help protect ourselves from future environmental \nthreats.\n  And we can gain some benefit for ourselves in the process. We are \namong the world's most competitive producers of environmental goods and \nservices, and with some effort we can create a large foreign market for \nour companies.\n  That brings me to the second reason we need this amendment. That is, \nwe need an export promotion policy for China.\n  Last year, we exported about $14 billion worth of goods and services \nto China, while importing about $51 billion. So we had a $37 billion \ndeficit. This year's figures look no better.\n  The main reason for this deficit is the massive set of tariffs, \ndiscriminatory inspection standards, quotas and other trade barriers \nerected by the Chinese government. But a second reason--one which we \ndon't really like to admit to ourselves--is that we do very little \nexport promotion to China.\n  Germans, Japanese, Southeast Asians and other competitors push \nexports as hard as they can. We don't match their efforts anywhere in \nthe world, and we do worst of all in China, where agencies like AEP \ncan't operate. There is no doubt that costs us.\n  This is basically common sense. It is good for everyone. For no \nadditional money, this amendment will help us export and improve our \ntrade balance. It will help us deal with some very difficult \nenvironmental problems. And it will, to some extent, supplement our \nhuman rights goals by making life in China a little better.\n  That is why this amendment has gotten very broad support. The State \nDepartment supports it. American environmental and business groups \nsupport it. And Chinese dissidents, support it. Let me quote from a \nletter I received from the China Strategic Institute, founded by former \npolitical prisoner Wang Juntao:\n\n       The China Strategic Institute is pleased to learn of your \n     efforts to bring the US-Asia Environmental Partnership to the \n     People's Republic of China. Not only can such a program \n     assist China in combating the severe environmental \n     degradation that plagues the Chinese population, but also . . \n     . the development of civil society. I strongly hope that this \n     amendment finds the support to become law.\n\n  To sum up, with this amendment we can do something good for everyone. \nBy passing it, we can promote American exports. We can do something \ngood for the Chinese people. We can promote the interest of both \ncountries in a healthy environment. And we won't spend any more money. \nSo I hope the Senate will support it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 907\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure Congressional notification of the costs to the \nFederal Government of all federal programs associated with the proposed \nagreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the Framework \n                  Convention on Climate Change (FCCC)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the new \n     section as follows:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Kennedy is \nan original cosponsor of this amendment along with Senators Moynihan, \nD'Amato, and Torricelli.\n  This amendment would withhold 5 percent of funds made available in \nthis bill to any country that the President determines violates United \nNations sanctions against Libya. The amendment exempts development \nassistance and humanitarian assistance.\n  As my colleagues know, the United Nations imposed sanctions against \nLibya in 1992 in response to the Libyan Government's failure to \nextradite to the United States or Scotland two Libyan intelligence \nagents indicted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. One hundred \nand eighty-nine Americans were killed in that terrorist bombing. The \nfamilies of those innocent victims are still waiting for justice.\n  Among other things, the U.N. sanctions prohibit international flights \ninto and out of Libya. They also prohibit supply to Libya of aircraft \nand aircraft components.\n  Nonetheless, some countries in the international community continue \nto help Libya's Khadaffi violate the sanctions.\n  For example, five countries have allowed Libyan airlines to land on \ntheir soil in violation of the sanctions. These countries include \nNiger, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ghana.\n  The amendment we are offering today would force countries that help \nLibya violate U.N. sanctions to choose between 5 percent of their \nforeign assistance and their support of a terrorist state.\n  The amendment is forward looking. It does not penalize any country \nfor past actions. Let me repeat that. It does not penalize any country \nfor past actions. Nor does it single out any country.\n  Rather, it lays down a marker and sends a signal that in the future \nviolating the international sanctions against Libya will have a \nfinancial cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm honored to be a sponsor of Senator \nLautenberg's amendment to withhold 5 percent of United States \nassistance from any country which, in the future, violates the United \nNations sanctions against Libya.\n  It is nearly 9 years since December 1988, when Pan Am flight 103 was \nbombed out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, \nincluding 189 Americans. In 1991, after an extensive international \ninvestigation, two Libyans were indicted for that terrorist bombing, \nbut they have never been brought to trial because the Government of \nLibya continues to defy the international community.\n  United Nations sanctions against Libya were first adopted in 1992. \nThese sanctions prohibit international flights to and from Libya, the \nsupply to Libya of aircraft, aircraft parts, military equipment and \ncertain oil equipment. They also freeze funds of the Libyan Government \nand reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic missions abroad.\n  It is obvious that the current sanctions are too mild to bring about \nthe surrender of the suspects by Libya. Senator Lautenberg and I, and \nmany of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, have repeatedly \ncalled for stronger sanctions, including an international oil embargo \nagainst Libya, because additional sanctions are clearly necessary to \nachieve their goal and see that justice is done. Regrettably, many of \nour European allies buy Libyan oil, and have been unwilling to take \nthis step.\n  Even the current mild sanctions against Libya are not being enforced. \nAccording to the Department of State, numerous violations of the \nsanctions have occurred. But when the United States brings such cases \nto the attention of the sanctions committee at the United Nations, the \ncommittee refuses to investigate them.\n  Recently, for example, the United States provided evidence to the \nSecurity Council sanctions committee, involving attempts by Libya to \nimport aircraft parts, via Belgrade, in violation of the U.N. \nsanctions. The sanctions committee refused to investigate this \nviolation.\n  There have also been several instances in which other countries have \npermitted Libyan planes to land in their territory, despite the U.N. \nprohibition on such landings.\n  If there are no consequences for violating the U.N. sanctions then \nthe sanctions are useless. If the United Nations is unwilling to \nenforce its own sanctions, the United States is left with no other \nchoice but to impose unilateral measures.\n  In this unsatisfactory situation, the Lautenberg amendment is a \nmodest but necessary step for the United States to take. Its provisions \nare not retroactive, but it puts other countries on notice for the \nfuture. If they violate the U.N. sanctions against Libya, their action \nwill cost them part of the U.S. aid they receive.\n  I urge the Senate to approve the amendment, and to take this \nreasonable step to see that justice is done for the victims of the Pan \nAm flight 103 terrorist atrocity.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of the Kennedy-D'Amato amendment, which would restrict aid to \nthose countries which fail to comply with the United Nations sanctions \nagainst Libya. I rise today in strong support of its passage.\n  Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council renewed international \nsanctions against Libya, as they have every 120 days since they were \nfirst imposed in 1992. Unfortunately, Mr. President, despite the fact \nthat Libya refuses to comply with the will of the international \ncommunity and extradite to the United States or Great Britain two \nLibyan nationals indicted as suspects in the murders of 270 people, the \nsanctions renewal was challenged by several African states.\n  This challenge is just the latest episode in Libya's arrogant \ninternational campaign to avoid the justified opprobrium of the \ninternational community. Libya has gone so far as to intrude on the \nprivacy of the victims of its criminality by writing directly to the \nAmerican families of Pan Am 103 proposing their supposed ``compromise'' \nwith international law directly to the families. Mr. President, I \ncannot overestimate how damaging it is to the interests of all \ndemocratic governments for Libya to be thrown a lifeline by the African \nmembers of the security council. Libya's U.N. Ambassador reportedly \nsaid after the Security Council vote, ``We can from now on behave as if \nthese sanctions were not there.'' These sanctions are there, and they \nwill remain.\n  There are several episodes over the past two years that highlight the \nneed for this amendment. Earlier this year, a Libyan-registered \naircraft flew from Libya to Niger and returned to Nigeria despite U.N. \nsanctions. Last July, Muammar Qaddafi left Tripoli to attend an Arab \nsummit meeting in Cairo. He arrived in Egypt by plane and left by \nplane, a clear violation of the ban on air travel. In December, the CIA \nrevealed that Ukraine agreed to three\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\ndifferent arms deals with Libya. The first involved the sale of $500 \nmillion worth of short-range ballistic missiles. A second deal called \nfor Ukraine to provide maintenance services and spare parts valued at \n$10 million. The third agreement involved Iran's purchase of Ukrainian \nweapons with the intent of transferring them to Libya.\n  Today we have made clear our determination to bring to justice those \nwho destroyed 270 lives and brought suffering on countless other loved \nones. I am pleased to join my colleagues in sponsoring legislation to \ndeny United States assistance to any countries that violate \ninternational sanctions against Libya. We will make it clear to Libya \nthat this pariah regime cannot escape the consequences of its lawless \nbehavior.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 910\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . WAR CRIMES PROSECUTION.\n\n       (a) Section 2401 of Title 18, United States Code (Public \n     Law 104-192; the War Crimes Act of 1996) is amended as \n     follows:\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``commits a grave breach \n     of the Geneva Conventions'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``commits a war crime'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking ``the person committing such breach or the \n     victims of such breach'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``the \n     person committing such crime or the victim of such crime''; \n     and\n       (B) by inserting before the period at the end of the \n     subsection ``or that the person committing such crime is \n     later found in the United States after such crime is \n     committed'';\n       (3) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by striking ``the term `grave breach of the Geneva \n     Conventions' means conduct defined as'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``the term `war crime' means conduct (1) defined \n     as''; and\n       (B) by inserting the following before the period at the \n     end: ``; (2) prohibited by Articles 23, 25, 27, or 28 of the \n     Annex to the Hague Convention IV, Respecting the Laws and \n     Customs of War on Land, signed on October, 1907; (3) which \n     constitutes a violation of common Article 3 of the \n     international conventions signed at Geneva on August 1949; or \n     (4) of a person who, in relation to an armed conflict and \n     contrary to the provisions of the Protocol on Prohibitions or \n     Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-traps and Other \n     Devices as amended at Geneva on 3 May 1996 (Protocol II as \n     amended on 3 May 1996), when the United States is a party to \n     such Protocol, willfully kills or causes serious injury to \n     civilians'';\n       (4) by adding a new subsection (d) to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Notification.--No prosecution of any crime prohibited \n     in this section shall be undertaken by the United States \n     except upon the written notification to the Congress by the \n     Attorney General or his designee that in his judgment a \n     prosecution by the United States is in the national interest \n     and necessary to secure substantial justice.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that my amendment to \nstrengthen our ability to prosecute war criminals in the United States \nhas been accepted by the Republican side.\n  This amendment, which builds on the War Crimes Act of 1996, closes \nsome gaps in our Nation's implementation of the Geneva and Hague \nConventions.\n  The War Crimes Act of 1996 only permits prosecution for war crimes in \nthe United States if the person accused of committing the crime, or the \nvictim of a war crime, is a national of the United States or a member \nof the U.S. Armed Forces. While noble in its intent, that act does not \npermit the United States to prosecute non-U.S. nationals who come \nwithin our jurisdiction. It leaves the United States open as a \npotential safe-haven for war criminals seeking to escape prosecution.\n  Currently, we have no extradition treaties with 75 nations including \nSomalia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Iran. If a war criminal \nfrom any of these countries takes refuge in the United States, we \ncannot extradite him. The alternative--deportation--is a long and \ncomplex process which becomes even more difficult when the accused is \nto be deported to a specific country. Even if deportation is \nsuccessful, a war criminal may be returned to a country in which the \njudicial system is nonfunctional--Cambodia, for example--thus escaping \nprosecution altogether.\n  My amendment allows us to prosecute war criminals located in the \nUnited States, regardless of their nationality. The amendment in no way \nobligates the United States to prosecute war crimes, nor does it permit \nthe extradition of non-U.S. nationals of the United States for \nprosecution if the victims of the crime are not United States \nnationals. Any case undertaken by our Government requires written \nnotification to the Congress by the Attorney General, who must take \ninto consideration U.S. national interests and the necessity of U.S. \nprosecution, to assure a just resolution in each case. The United \nStates will not be drawn into international conflicts where we have no \nsignificant national interest.\n  The amendment expands the scope and offers a more specific definition \nof what constitutes a war crime that the 1996 act. The 1996 act only \nrefers to grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which are \ndefined as willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including \nbiological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious \ninjury to body or health, and extensive destruction of property, not \njustified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully or \nwantonly.''\n  My proposed 1997 amendments also covers articles of the 1907 Hague \nConvention IV which clarify actions prohibited in war.\n  The inclusion of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is vital \nin that it expressly allows the United States to prosecute war crimes \nperpetrated in noninternational conflicts, such as Bosnia and Rwanda. \nIn January 1997, there were a reported 35 such internal conflicts, from \nAlgeria to Kasmir.\n  Finally, violations of the protocol on prohibitions or restrictions \non the use of mines, booby-traps and other devices will constitute a \nwar crime under this amendment, once the United States ratifies this \nimportant protocol.\n  The International Committee of the Red Cross, the American Red Cross, \nthe State Department, the Department of Defense, and President Clinton \nall support the expansion of United States prosecutorial authority as \nit is contained in this amendment. With its adoption, we will be \nfollowing in the footsteps of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and \nAustralia--each of which passed similar laws in the 1950's. It is time \nfor us to join them.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 911\n\n(Purpose: To Allocate Funds for a Western Hemisphere International Law \n                      Enforcement Academy (ILEA))\n\n       On page 28 line 19 after the word ``country'' insert the \n     following:\n       ``Provided further. That of this amount not to exceed $5 \n     million shall be allocated to operate the Western Hemisphere \n     International Law Enforcement Academy under the auspices of \n     the Organization of American States with full oversight by \n     the Department of State.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment to the foreign operations \nappropriations bill asks that $5 million of the funding appropriated \nfor international narcotics control be allocated out of existing funds \nfor the establishment of an international law enforcement training \nacademy [ILEA] for the Western Hemisphere.\n  The State Department set up the International Law Enforcement Academy \nin Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 and has since trained 300 law enforcement \nofficials.\n  This amendment would establish a similar international law \nenforcement training academy but for the Western Hemisphere and for \nwhich the President requested in his 1998 budget.\n  Mr. President, the allocated funds would be for operations of such an \nacademy and a facility would need to be found. I understand that the \nState Department has been trying to find such a facility for the past \nyear, but we have not reached an agreement among Latin American \ncountries.\n  My amendment would allow the academy to be established in \nconsultation with the Organization of American States, representing our \nCentral and Latin American neighbors.\n  Mr. President, I do not have to explain the terrorist and narcotic \nthreats in this hemisphere. The ILEA is a way for the United States to \nestablish law enforcement networks that lead to a more effective \napproach to fighting international organized crime and drug \ntrafficking.\n  Such an academy would help us create closer working relationships and \nnetworks with foreign police that are needed to find fugitives and \ncombat financial corruption.\n  I urge Senators to vote in support of a Western Hemisphere \ninternational law enforcement academy.\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\n                           amendment no. 912\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the reform and annual review of United States \nsponsored training programs of Latin American military personnel at the \n    School of the Americas and elsewhere to ensure that training is \n  consistent with respect for human rights and civil control over the \n                               military)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n\n     reform and review of united states sponsored training programs\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) United States training of members of Latin American \n     military and security forces that occurred primarily at the \n     Army School of the Americas between 1982 and 1991 has been \n     severely criticized for promoting practices that have \n     contributed to the violation of human rights and have \n     otherwise been inconsistent with the appropriate role of the \n     Armed Forces in a democratic society.\n       (2) Numerous members of Latin American military and \n     security forces who have participated in United States \n     sponsored training programs, have subsequently been \n     identified as having masterminded, participated in, or sought \n     to cover up some of the most heinous human rights abuses in \n     the region.\n       (3) United States interests in Latin America would be \n     better served if Latin American military personnel were \n     exposed to training programs designed to promote--\n       (A) proper management of scarce national defense resources,\n       (B) improvements in national systems of justice in \n     accordance with internationally recognized principles of \n     human rights, and\n       (C) greater respect and understanding of the principle of \n     civilian control of the military.\n       (4) In 1989, Congress mandated that the Department of \n     Defense institute new training programs (commonly referred to \n     as expanded IMET) with funds made available for international \n     military and education programs in order to promote the \n     interests described in paragraph (3). Congress also expanded \n     the definition of eligibility for such training to include \n     non-defense government personnel from countries in Latin \n     America.\n       (5) Despite congressionally mandated emphasis on expanded \n     IMET training programs, only 4 of the more than 50 courses \n     offered annually at the United States Army School of the \n     Americas qualify as expanded IMET.\n       (b) Limitation on Use of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, none of the funds appropriated in this Act \n     under the heading relating to international military \n     education and training may be made available for training \n     members of any Latin American military or security force \n     until--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense has advised the Secretary of \n     State in writing that 30 percent of IMET funds appropriated \n     for fiscal year 1998 for the cost of Latin American \n     participants in IMET programs will be disbursed only for the \n     purpose of supporting enrollment of such participants in \n     expanded IMET courses; and\n       (2) the Secretary of State has identified sufficient \n     numbers of qualified, non-military personnel from countries \n     in Latin America to participate in IMET programs during \n     fiscal year 1998 in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, and has instructed United States embassies in the \n     hemisphere to approve their participation in such programs so \n     that not less than 25 percent of the individuals from Latin \n     American countries attending United States supported IMET \n     programs are civilians.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this act, the Secretary of State shall report in \n     writing to the appropriate committees of Congress on the \n     progress made to improve military training of Latin American \n     participants in the areas of human rights and civilian \n     control of the military. The Secretary shall include in the \n     report plans for implementing additional expanded IMET \n     programs for Latin America during the next 3 fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to rise to comment on the \namendment that may be offered by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois [Mr. Durbin]. His amendment would seek to close, once and for \nall, the U.S. Army School of the Americas, presently located at Fort \nBenning, GA.\n  I am totally sympathetic with the intent of the Senator's amendment. \nClearly the entire history of the School of the America's, and \nparticularly the period from 1982-1991, is shameful. It has left a \nlegacy that is an ugly blemish on our country's credibility as an \nadvocate of full respect for human rights and the rule of law in a \nregion where human rights violations have occurred with impunity.\n  Like Senator Durbin, I believe that the United States has a special \nobligation to promote democracy throughout the world, and most \nespecially in our own hemisphere.\n  Given the recent history of military rule in many countries in the \nregion, it is particularly important that the United States strongly \nsupport the concept of civilian control over national military \ninstitutions.\n  It also means highlighting the importance of respecting the human \nrights of all the peoples of the hemisphere. And, in particular, the \nobligation of military and security forces throughout the region that \nthey do so. Finally it means stressing the principle that national \nmilitary and security forces are accountable for acts that fall short \nof acceptable international human rights standards and practices.\n  I would say to my colleague from Illinois, that if closing down the \nSchool of the Americas would remedy all of the evils that have been \nperpetrated by a number of individuals trained there over the years, I \nwould strongly support his effort.\n  Unfortunately, even if we were to shut the doors at the School of the \nAmericas tomorrow, that would not be the case. Moreover, the School of \nthe Americas is not the only location where Latin American military \npersonnel receive United States-supported training.\n  Equally important is acknowledgment that countries throughout the \nregion have legitimate national security interests that necessitate the \nexistence of national armed forces in these countries.\n  Shutting the School of the Americas doesn't obviate the need that \nregional militaries get the right kind of training for their personnel.\n  I have had the opportunity to review excepts from the manuals that \nwere utilized in the training of Latin American personnel throughout \nthe 1980's and into the early 1990's. Clearly these manuals espoused \npractices that can only be described as coercion, torture, and \nassassination.\n  I know that the Defense Department has looked into the background of \nthese manuals, and has found, not once but twice, that mistakes were \nmade--but that no one is really responsible.\n  Frankly, it defies credibility to accept one of the central \nconclusions of the 1997 Defense Department inspector general's review \nof this.\n\n  Among other things, the IG concluded that while,\n\n       . . . five of the seven manuals contained language and \n     statements in violation of legal, regulatory, or policy \n     prohibitions, such as motivation by fear, payment of bounties \n     for enemy dead, false imprisonment, and the use of truth \n     serum . . . . Army personnel involved in the preparation and \n     presentation of the intelligence courses did not recognize \n     that the training materials contravened DOD policy and [there \n     was] no evidence that a deliberate and orchestrated attempt \n     was made to violate DOD or U.S. Army policies.\n\n  So much for any sensitivity with respect to human rights that United \nStates troops are supposed to be indoctrinated in.\n  School of the Americas instructors tutored Latin American military \npersonnel in how to use threats of force with prisoners, neutralize \nopponents, hold prisoners in clandestine jails, and infiltrate and spy \non civilian organizations and opposition political parties for at least \n10 years. Despite the fact that such training explicitly violates U.S. \npolicy.\n  The IG does not deny that such training was a clear violation of U.S. \npolicy, but attributes it to the equivalent of staff error. The IG \nfound that--\n\n       . . . from 1982 to 1991, many mistakes were made and \n     repeated (with respect to use of these manuals) by numerous \n     and continually changing personnel in several organizations \n     from Panama to Georgia to Washington, DC. Lack of attention \n     to the Department of Defense and U.S. Army policies and \n     procedures by those personnel and organizations perpetrated \n     the assumption that the materials in the Spanish language \n     intelligence manuals were proper and doctrinally correct.\n\n  I don't know anything about the background of the current IG who came \nto this conclusion.\n  But I think it is safe to say that if he/she had bothered to review \nthe extensive Congress debate that occurred during much of this same \ntime period over United States policy with respect to Latin America--he \nwould have found the often stated concern about the substantial human \nrights abuses that were being perpetrated by members of these military \nforces, particularly those in Central America.\n  Those of us who were here remember only too well that the Department \nof Defense was being queried on a weekly basis about all aspects of \nU.S. policy during that time period--including the training and other \nsupport the United States was providing to these military and security \nforces.\n  Many of us in this body who participated in those rancorous debates \ncould\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\ntake up hours here today reliving that period.\n  But that isn't a good use of the Senate's time, nor does it do \nanything to address the underlying concerns with respect to the nature \nand content of United States-sponsored military training programs for \nthe Latin American and Caribbean region.\n  The amendment that I will offer at the appropriate time would go to \nthe heart of this. It would not close the School of the Americas. \nRather, it would mandate that at least 36 percent of IMET-supported \ncourse curriculum be for, so-called expanded IMET courses--namely those \ndevoted to training Latin American Armed Forces in skills that will \nbetter prepare them to serve their democratic countries as we enter the \n21st century. It would also require that these courses be available to \nnonmilitary government officials with responsibilities for defense \npolicies in their countries as well.\n\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, in 1989 Senator Leahy first \nintroduced the concept of this new, so-called expanded IMET. Simply \nput, to qualify as an expanded IMET course its purpose must be to \neducate Latin American military and civilian personnel in the proper \nmanagement of their defense resources, in improving their systems of \nmilitary justice in accordance with internationally recognized \nprinciples of human rights or in fostering greater respect for and \nunderstanding of the principle of civilian control of the military.\n  Despite the fact that Senator Leahy first proposed the creation of \nexpanded IMET more than 8 years ago, even today Latin American military \nstudents are afforded very few opportunities to avail themselves of \nsuch courses.\n  Only 4 of the more than 50 courses offered in the 1997 School of the \nAmerica's curriculum quality as expanded IMET courses.\n  That is totally unacceptable and is additional evidence that the U.S. \nArmy just doesn't get it when it comes to the importance that must be \naccorded to promoting respect for human rights throughout the \nhemisphere.\n  For that reason this amendment would specifically mandate that 30 \npercent of Latin American IMET funds be spent in support of preparing \nLatin American military and appropriate civilian and legislative \ndefense personnel for their appropriate roles in democratic societies \nas we begin the next millennium.\n  I would hope that all of my colleagues would support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 913\n\n  (Purpose: To recommend that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam be \n  placed on the list of terrorist organizations by the Department of \n                                 State)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM.\n\n       Sence of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Department of State should list the Liberation Tigers of \n     Tamil Eelam as a terrorist organization.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy for accepting this amendment expressing the \nSense of the Senate that the State Department should list the \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] as a terrorist organization. I \nbelieve that the LTTE meets the criteria approved during the 104th \nCongress to designate terrorist organizations, and I urge the State \nDepartment to carefully examine the evidence.\n  Section 302 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996 defines a terrorist organization as one which is foreign, engages \nin terrorist activity, and threatens the security of the United States. \nThere is no doubt that the LTTE is a foreign organization. Its main \ncenters of activity are located in the United Kingdom and France, as \nwell as Canada, Australia, and India.\n  The State Department's Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996 \ndetails LTTE abuses which are undoubtedly terrorist activities. The \nLTTE regularly commits extrajudicial killings, and is responsible for \ndisappearances, arbitrary arrests, detentions and torture. An attack on \nthe army base at Mullaitivu in July 1996, orchestrated by the LTTE, \nkilled more than 1,500 government troops. In the aftermath, an equally \nimportant fact came to light. It is clear that the LTTE regularly \nrecruits children into its military forces.\n  In the northern part of the island, the LTTE has expelled almost \n46,000 Muslim inhabitants, almost the entire Muslim population, from \ntheir homes. These individuals have been threatened with death if they \nreturn. Lastly, the LTTE has been held responsible for the \nassassination of an Indian Prime Minister, a President of Sri Lanka, a \nPresidential candidate, and senior Sinhalese and Tamil political \nleaders.\n  It is clear that these activities are of a terrorist nature, and I \nbelieve that they threaten the national security of the United States. \nSection 302 defines national security as that pertaining to ``national \ndefense, foreign relations, or economic interests of the United \nStates''. In this sense, the promotion of democracy, free-market \neconomies, and human rights throughout the world are fundamental to our \ninterests. However, the LTTE does not follow the rules of democratic \nprocedure. In fact, the LTTE espouses socialism and seeks to establish \na socialist state in Sri Lanka. This stated ideology is far removed \nfrom the free-market policies that the United States promotes.\n  With these facts in mind, I am hopeful that the State Department will \nmove to list the LTTE as a terrorist organization. The safety and \nsecurity of the United States, and our friends in Sri Lanka, depend \nupon it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 914\n\n   (Purpose: To limit international military education and training \n                          assistance for Peru)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n\nlimitation on international military education and training assistance \n                                for peru\n\n       Sec.   . None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be provided to the Government of \n     Peru for international military education and training under \n     chapter 5 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, \n     unless the President certifies to Congress that the \n     Government of Peru is taking all necessary steps to ensure \n     that United States citizens held in prisons in Peru are \n     accorded timely, open, and fair legal proceedings in civilian \n     courts.\n\n  Mr. Leahy. Mr. President, I support Senator Durbin's amendment to \ncondition IMET for Peru on timely, open and fair legal proceedings in \ncivilian courts for United States citizens being held in Peru.\n  The Government of Peru deserves credit for the progress in human \nrights it has made in recent years. The number of extrajudicial \nkillings and disappearances has decreased dramatically. However, \nfreedom of the press, executive interference in the judiciary, the \nexistence of faceless military courts for civilians, lengthy pre-trial \ndetention and abysmal prison conditions continue to be serious \nproblems. This amendment conditions IMET assistance on speedy \nresolution of the cases of American citizens who are in Peruvian \nprisons awaiting a fair trial.\n  Jennifer Davis and Krista Barnes each have admitted their guilt on \ndrug-trafficking charges and cooperated fully with the Peruvian police. \nThey have been imprisoned for over 9 months, waiting to be tried and \nsentenced so they may be transferred to a U.S. prison under our \nprisoner exchange treaty. They are victims of Peru's excruciatingly \nslow legal process and life-threatening prison conditions.\n  Lori Berenson was tried, convicted and sentenced almost 2 years ago \nunder a legal system set up to combat terrorism in Peru that violates \ninternational standards of due process. In late 1996, the Peruvian \nmilitary's highest court upheld her life sentence. Ms. Berenson plans \nto appeal to the Supreme Court of Peru. In the meantime, Ms. Berenson \nis struggling through another winter in prison in the freezing \nmountains of Peru.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this amendment will encourage Peru \nnot just to take action in the cases of these young women, but that it \nwill spark a vigorous effort to improve the judicial process in Peru so \nthat no one--no Peruvian or American or any other citizen--will have to \nendure lengthy pretrial detention, wretched prison conditions and a \nclogged legal docket that violate minimum international standards of \ndue process and the treatment of prisoners.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 915\n\n       On page 43, line 3 after the word ``(IAEA).'' insert the \n     following new section:\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment along \nwith Senator Helms and Senator Faircloth.\n  My amendment would provide that none of the funds appropriated for \nthe new arrangements to borrow [NAB] by the International Monetary Fund \ncould be made available until the relevant authorizing committees have \nreviewed these provisions and authorizing legislation has been enacted.\n  The Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund have \nasked Congress to give the IMF $3.5 billion of the taxpayer's money to \nsupport the new arrangements to borrow. The NAB is an arrangement where \n25 participating countries agree to lend funds to the IMF, in \npredetermined amounts, whenever the organization believes those funds \nare needed to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international \nmonetary or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat \nto the stability of that system.\n  This appropriations bill supports this request by including $3.5 \nbillion for the NAB.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the authorizing committees have not had \nan opportunity to review these new arrangements to borrow. We need to \nhave hearings and fully review these provisions, which have significant \nconsequences for the American taxpayer.\n  We simply can't give an international bureaucracy such as the IMF a \nblank check without a thorough review by the relevant congressional \ncommittees. My amendment would simply do this--give us the opportunity \nto fully examine this proposal.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 917\n\n       On page 30, line 9, after the word ``Act'' insert ``or the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 918\n\n(Purpose: To limit aid to the Government of Congo until a Presidential \n                             certification)\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be provided to the Government of the Congo \n     until such time as the President reports in writing to the \n     Congress that the Government of Congo is cooperating fully \n     with investigators from the United Nations or any other \n     international relief organizations in accounting for human \n     rights violations or atrocities committed in Congo or \n     adjacent countries.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 919\n\n       On page 34, and the end of line 21 strike the period and \n     insert: ``Provided further, That $60,000,000 of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available under this heading \n     shall be made available for the purpose of facilitating the \n     integration of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: Provided further, \n     That, to carry out funding the previous proviso, all or part \n     of the $60,000,000 may be derived by transfer, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, from titles I, \n     II, III, and IV of this Act.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. It \nrequires a modest amount of funds be dedicated to supporting NATO \nintegration costs for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  Earlier this month at Madrid, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nmade a historic decision: to invite three former members of the Warsaw \nPact to join NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made \ntremendous progress since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Their economies \nare free, their militaries are under civilian control, their disputes \nwith their neighbors have been resolved.\n  The invitation to join NATO is not a gift--it has been earned by the \nhard work and sacrifice in each of these three countries. Including \nthem in NATO will change the course of history--no longer will they be \nat the mercy of stronger neighbors.\n  I led a delegation to Europe just before the Madrid summit. We met \nwith NATO officials in Brussels and we went to Budapest, Hungary for a \nfirsthand assessment of that country's progress. We all left convinced \nthat Hungary--like Poland and the Czech Republic--has earned the \ninvitation to become members of the most successful alliance in \nhistory.\n  In the coming months, the Senate will consider all the issues \nassociated with NATO enlargement. One of the key issues will be the \ncosts--the total cost of enlargement, the U.S. share of that cost, and \nhow that overall cost will be shared with existing and prospective NATO \nmembers.\n  I believe the costs of enlarging NATO will be manageable. I believe \nthere will be greater costs if we do not enlarge NATO. But the concern \nover the cost is legitimate. Much of the concern is based on a fear \nthat NATO enlargement will drain a defense budget already under siege--\nalready stretched too thin from humanitarian interventions that have \nlittle to do with U.S. national security.\n  I believe we should look at ways to finance NATO enlargement from \nnon-defense sources. My amendment today helps pave the way for that \napproach by earmarking foreign aid funds for Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic.\n  There is a lot of money in this bill for programs that, in my view, \nare a lower priority than NATO enlargement. For example, the bill \ncontains $950 million for the International Development Association to \nmake concessional loans to countries like India and China. The bill \ncontains $1.3 billion for development assistance, much of it going to \ncountries where United States strategic interests are far less than in \nCentral Europe.\n  My amendment is designed to give maximum leverage to the managers in \nconference to ensure adequate funds are made available for the three \ncountries invited to join NATO--funds to finance language training, \ncommunications modernization, and equipment interoperability.\n  Much has been done by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to \nprepare their military forces for admission into NATO, but much more \nneeds to be done. Meeting these needs will be a major share of the cost \nof NATO enlargement.\n  Chairman McConnell has long been a leader in supporting enlargement \nof NATO to include new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. His \nreport points out the importance of keeping the NATO enlargement door \nopen, and his bill takes a number of steps to provide reassurance to \nthose not invited in the first wave of enlargement--especially for the \nBaltic States.\n  Adoption of this amendment--with the other provisions in the bill on \nNATO related issues--will send a\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nstrong signal of Senate support financing a key element of enlargement \npreparation for the Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I thank \nthe managers for their cooperation and I thank Senators Lieberman, \nSmith of Oregon, Hollings, Shelby, Roth, Biden, DeWine, Coats, Hagel, \nand Frist for cosponsoring the amendment. I urge support for the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Numbered 904 through 919) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nHouse companion measure is passed by the Senate pursuant to the \nprevious order that the passage of S. 955 be vitiated, and that S. 955 \nbe indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe that completes the evening \nfor Senator Leahy and myself. Senator DeWine is here, and would like to \nspeak. And I believe Senator Bennett is here, and we may shortly take \nleave.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky that I enjoy working with him. But I know the Senate is in the \nable hands of the distinguished Senator from Utah. Now that I have \nsomebody who actually looks a little bit like me on the floor, I, too, \ncan leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7544-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7593-S7602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Legislative Branch bill provides \n$1,537,827,000 in new obligational authority, exclusive of House items, \nfor fiscal year 1998. This is $64,947,000 below the President's request \nand $51,600,000 above the fiscal year 1997 level.\n  The majority of the increases in the bill account for cost of living \nadjustments.\n  Mr. President, I wish to correct an impression that is being \ncirculated throughout the press. There is no provision in this bill for \na pay increase for Members of Congress. That is the issue that is taken \ncare of in other bills.\n  The Senate items include provisions to reduce the appropriation for \nofficial mail from $10 million to $8 million in fiscal year 1998 and \ncombine the franking allowance with the official personnel and office \nexpense allowance--this will reduce paperwork and provide flexibility \nfor offices to meet their needs.\n  The bill eliminates the disparity in staff salaries of Senate \nemployees versus all other Federal employees (including those of the \nHouse.) This disparity was caused by the Senate employees not receiving \nthe 2-percent COLA in 1996, which as provided to all other Federal \nemployees.\n  Approximately 80 percent of the Architect's request for capital \nprojects to ensure that certain repairs and maintenance are not \ndelayed. If this maintenance is taken care of now, it should pay off in \nsubstantial cost savings in the future.\n  The GAO is provided $346.75 million, which conforms to the commitment \nto stabilize the GAO budget and staff level (3,500 employees) after a \n2-year reduction of 25 percent. This recommendation provides sufficient \nfunds for mandatory cost increases, including the COLA.\n  I want to take the opportunity now before presenting the bill to \nthank Senator Dorgan, the ranking member on the Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee, for his cooperation and his work on the bill. I have \nenjoyed my experience as the chairman of the subcommittee, and Senator \nDorgan's cooperative spirit has been a large part of that enjoyment. I \npay tribute to him and to his staff for the professional way in which \nthey have handled this responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill continues the legislative branch's \ncontributions toward deficit reduction and the goal of the balanced \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 110, S. 1019, the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations bill, and, further, the managers' amendment, which is at \nthe desk, be considered as read and agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 920\n\n       (Purpose: To provide funds for a pilot program of studies \n     of scientific and technological issues to assist the Congress \n     in anticipating, understanding and considering such issues in \n     the course of determining public policy on existing and \n     emerging national problems)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 920.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 38, line 2, insert before the period the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That $500,000 shall be available only \n     for expenditure on studies and assessments, to be carried out \n     by not-for-profit scientific, technological, or educational \n     institutions, of the matters described in section 472(c) of \n     title 2, United States Code: Provided further, That topics \n     for studies and assessments under the previous proviso, and \n     the institutions designated to carry out the studies and \n     assessments, shall be selected by the voting members of the \n     Technology Assessment Board under section 473 of title 2, \n     United States Code, from among topics requested pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of section 472(d) of such title''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment addresses an important \nneed of the Congress created by the demise, two years ago, of the \nOffice of Technology Assessment. That need is for authoritative and in-\ndepth studies of scientific and technological issues that are at the \nroot of many of the problems that we are called on to address through \nlegislation.\n  Over the 23 years of its existence, from 1972 to 1995, the Office of \nTechnology Assessment functioned as our in-house brain trust. It was a \ncompetent, timely, and impartial source of scientific and technical \nadvice on a wide range of issues. In early 1995, the decision was made \nto end the existence of the Office of Technology Assessment by zeroing \nout its appropriation. The judgment of the Congress at that time was \nthat it needed to demonstrate to the American people that it was \nwilling to downsize its own operations. I miss the OTA, and I know that \na lot of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House do too. I am not \nproposing today to reverse what we did 2 years ago by recreating new \noffices in the Congress or by hiring new permanent staff. I believe \nthat there are other, more flexible ways for Congress to gain direct \naccess to high-quality and timely advice and insight on cutting edge \nscience and technology relevant to our legislative duties.\n  My amendment attempts to use the existing legislative authorities for \noversight of the old OTA to oversee a new pilot experiment. Members \nshould realize that while we terminated the OTA by ending its \nappropriation, the underlying authorities governing the OTA are still \non the books. For example, there is continuing legislative authority in \ntitle 2 of the United States Code to have a Technology Assessment Board \nof 12 members: 6 from the House and 6 from the Senate, with each \nchamber's representation evenly divided between the parties and \nappointed by the respective leadership. This is an excellent group to \ndecide on which topics should be studied using the funds that would be \nprovided by my amendment. The old OTA authorities also provided that \ntopics for OTA studies be suggested by chairs of committees, ranking \nmembers, or numerical majorities of committees, or by the Technology \nAssessment Board. That is a sound procedure for identifying potential \nstudy topics. My amendment uses both of these authorities, but contains \na crucial difference in how the studies are executed. In place of a \npermanent, continuing organization to undertake studies, my amendment \nprovides for selection of external scientific, technological, or \neducational institutions to carry out the studies that would be funded \nunder my amendment. Think of it as a ``virtual OTA'' or, if you prefer,\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nan ``outsourced'' one. The contractual arrangements with these \ninstitutions would be handled by the GAO, which already has a wide \nnetwork of similar contracting arrangements with accounting firms all \nover the country. Thus, there is no institutional mortgage associated \nwith my amendment, and no new Congressional organization. I think that \nevery member who reluctantly voted to terminate the OTA, because of the \nneed to downsize our operations, can support my amendment with a clear \nconscience. We aren't bringing back a big bureaucracy. We are giving \nourselves access, on topics that Members themselves determine are the \nmost pressing to have authoritative scientific and technical insight, \nto the analytical capabilities of our best not-for-profit and \neducational institutions.\n  Let me reiterate the key points behind my amendment. I am proposing a \nway for Congress to acquire better scientific and technological advice \nwithout an institutional mortgage. My amendment puts 12 members, \nselected by the bipartisan leadership of the Senate and the House, \ndirectly in charge of deciding how the funds under this amendment will \nbe spent and what will be studied. My amendment allows all Committees \nof Congress to nominate topics worthy of study and to propose which \nnot-for-profit institution would be most suitable to engage in their \nstudy. Contracting would be handled through the General Accounting \nOffice, which routinely contracts to external sources for expert advice \nand assistance in its own audits.\n  I am proposing an experiment of limited scope, only $500,000, which \nprobably translates to somewhere between two and five studies. The \noffsetting funds of $500,000 come from the budget of the General \nAccounting Office, which is receiving over $354 million in \nappropriations in this Act. That is less than three-tenths of 1 percent \nof the GAO budget for this experiment. The contracting burden for GAO \nunder my amendment is hardly crushing--an additional 2 to 5 contracts \nwon't stretch their resources. I will also note that the Appropriations \nCommittee's own report for this bill voices concern that GAO may have \ngiven priority to audits initiated under its own authority over those \nrequested by committees and Members of Congress. My amendment \nrepresents a use of funds that is 100 percent directed to Member and \nCommittee requests, and overseen by a bipartisan group appointed by the \nleadership.\n  I believe that this is a sensible request and I urge the adoption of \nmy amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 920) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1019, the fiscal \nyear 1998 legislative branch appropriation bill, and applaud the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett, for the work he has done \nin reporting this bill to the Senate. This bill, as recommended by the \ncommittee, provides $1,537,827,000 in budget authority, exclusive of \nHouse items. This total is $64,947,000 below the President's request \nand $51,600,000 above the fiscal year 1997 enacted level. As I \nindicated, these figures do not include spending by the House of \nRepresentatives, as each body normally defers to the other body to set \nits own budget. To date, the full House has not yet acted on the \nlegislative branch appropriation bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  S. 1019 includes not only funding for the salaries and expenses for \noffices and committees of the Senate, but also includes the budgets of \na number of outside agencies that provide important services to the \nSenate, including the General Accounting Office, the Government \nPrinting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Library of \nCongress, the Capitol Police, and the Architect of the Capitol.\n  Mr. President, the subcommittee chairman has done an excellent job of \nhighlighting the major provisions in this bill, so I will take just a \nminute to draw attention to what I believe to be an important issue.\n  For the General Accounting Office, the committee provides an \nappropriation that is an increase of $14 million over the fiscal year \n1997 enacted level. This amount provides sufficient funding to \nstabilize the workforce of 3,500 employees and to pay for mandatory \ncost increases to support the men and women who work for GAO, in \nkeeping with the agreement reached last Congress between GAO and \nappropriators to reduce GAO's budget by 25 percent over 2 years . As \npart of the commitment, appropriators committed to provide funding \nstability for the GAO once the 2-year, 25 percent reduction was \nachieved. I believe that it is important to note that the Senate has \nlived up to its commitment to the GAO and I, for one, will work \ndiligently to keep a level of funding that is worked out in our \nconference with the House that is consistent with this commitment.\n  Mr. President, let me close by again commending the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Bennett. In his first year as chairman of the \nlegislative branch subcommittee, he has proven himself to be a very \ncapable leader, who has worked with me on a bipartisan basis. I also \nwish to express my thanks to the subcommittee staff--Jim English, Mary \nDewald, and Christine Ciccone--for their fine work, and also to \nrecognize the excellent support we had from Mary Hawkins, of my staff, \nand Chip Yost, of Senator Bennett's staff.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in February 1987 the Senate and House passed \nS. Con. Res. 18 (100th Congress) authorizing the printing as a Senate \ndocument of ``The Senate 1789-1989.'' A compilation of some 80 \naddresses that I had delivered during the 1980's on the history of the \nUnited States Senate, the book formed part of Congress' commemoration \nof its bicentennial. Between 1988 and 1993, the publication appeared in \nfour volumes: two volumes of the addresses, together with a volume of \nclassic Senate speeches and a statistical appendix. Printed in a large \nformat with attractive historical illustrations, these books received \nfavorable reviews. Volume I was awarded a prize by the Society for \nHistory in the Federal Government and commended by the American Library \nAssociation. Additional printing industry awards went to several of the \nGovernment Printing Office contractors involved in the books' \nmanufacture.\n  Through the Government Printing Office, copies of these volumes were \ndistributed to government depository libraries throughout the country. \nThe printing resolution stipulated that ``in addition to the usual \nnumber of copies, there shall be printed with suitable binding 5,000 \nadditional copies for use by the Secretary of the Senate.'' These \ncopies have been and continue to be distributed to educational \ninstitutions and other appropriate recipients. In addition, the \nSuperintendent of Documents purchased for sale 4,600 copies of Volume \nI; 2,300 of Volume II; and 1,000 each of Volumes III and IV. Reflecting \nthe superior quality of the books, the Government Printing Office \noffered these volumes at an average price of $56.\n  In April of this year, my office inquired of the Government Printing \nOffice, as we do periodically, how many of each volume had been sold \nand how many remained on hand. This time, we were astonished to learn \nthat the number of volumes remaining was a total of 3,260 less than it \nshould have been when we subtracted the number of copies sold since our \nlast inquiry from the number that had remained at that time. When we \nasked GPO about the fate of these other copies, we were informed that \nthere had been a ``stock reduction''--apparently meaning that 3,260 of \nthese beautiful valuable volumes were disposed of.\n  On April 23, I wrote to Michael DiMario, the Public Printer, to \nrequest an explanation. On May 6, he responded that there had indeed \nbeen such a stock reduction in order to save storage costs and \nstreamline sales operations. He further stated that, if additional \ncopies of these volumes were ever needed, they could of course be \nreprinted. No one who has seen these beautifully crafted books could \npossibly believe that it would be cost effective to destroy more than \n3,000 copies and reprint them later, rather than simply paying for \nlower-cost off-site storage until they should be needed. If such a \nreduction was in fact necessary, I cannot fathom the distorted thinking \nthat would destroy books of such long-term value without at the very \nleast informing the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, or my \noffice, and giving us the opportunity to acquire these copies to make \nthem available to various educational entities. When I expressed these \nfurther concerns to Mr. DiMario, I did at last receive an apology and \nan acknowledgement that it\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nhad in fact been an error to dispose of the books without prior \nnotification.\n  What of our nation's libraries? I have in mind those at the public \nand community college level that may lie outside the depository \nprogram. Would they not welcome surplus copies of selected government \ndocuments once thought worthy of being included in the Government \nPrinting Office's sales program? Are we so distorted in our priorities \nthat we prefer to shred such useful information rather than to \ndisseminate it?\n  I continue to be gravely concerned about this unfortunate incident, \nwhich demonstrates a major flaw in the procedures of the Superintendent \nof Documents and the Government Printing Office. Perhaps this was \nsimply an unfortunate exception. Or perhaps it reveals a pattern of \ninattention, carelessness, or even malfeasance. What other titles in \nthe Superintendent of Documents' inventory may have received similar \ntreatment in the name of ``stock reduction?'' I, for one, would like an \nanswer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum to me from \nthe Senate Historian, Dr. Richard Baker, on this subject, dated April \n23, 1997, together with an exchange of correspondence between myself \nand the Public Printer, Michael DiMario, be included in the record at \nthis point. This correspondence includes my letters to Mr. DiMario \ndated April 23, 1997, and June 17, 1997, and his responses to me dated \nMay 6, 1997, and July 11, 1997.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       U.S. Senate\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1997.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n     From: Dick Baker.\n     Re: GPO sales copies of ``The Senate, 1789-1989.''\n\n       Yesterday, at your request, we asked GPO how many copies of \n     each volume they had sold. When they supplied the \n     information, we discovered some disturbing information. In \n     early 1995, the Superintendent of Documents reported having \n     on hand the following numbers of copies:\n       Volume I--1,618.\n       Volume II--1,260.\n       Volume III--963.\n       Volume IV--855.\n       After selling only a few hundred more copies of each, GPO \n     reported yesterday that it had the following numbers of each \n     on hand:\n       Volume I--299 (131 sold since 1995 should leave 1,489).\n       Volume II--271 (69 sold since 1995 should leave 1,191).\n       Volume III--137 (166 sold since 1995 should leave 797).\n       Volume IV--279 (84 sold since 1995 should leave 771).\n       These figures leave 3,260 volumes not accounted for:\n       Volume I--1,188.\n       Volume II--920.\n       Volume III--660.\n       Volume IV--492.\n       When we asked about the fate of these other copies, we were \n     informed that there had been a ``stock reduction.'' As far as \n     we can determine, this means that 3,260 books were disposed \n     of.\n       Attached is the draft of a possible letter you may wish to \n     send to the Public Printer requesting and explanation of this \n     decision.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    April 23 1997.\n     Mr. Michael F. DiMario,\n     Public Printer, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. DiMario: It has come to my attention that the \n     sales inventory of all four volumes of ``The Senate, 1789-\n     1989'' has been drastically reduced. Perhaps this action is \n     in line with the Superintendent of Documents' standard \n     policy, but I find it most distressing because these books \n     were designed to have long-term value.\n       I would appreciate receiving an explanation of this \n     decision.\n       With all good wishes, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd.\n                                  U.S. Government Printing Office,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Public Printer,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: This is in response to your letter dated \n     April 23, 1997, inquiring about the sales inventory of the \n     four volumes of ``The Senate, 1789-1989.'' Let me assure you \n     that we recognize the historical value of this series and \n     have designated all four volumes as titles which shall remain \n     in print and available through our sales program \n     indefinitely.\n       In September 1996, the Superintendent of Documents took a \n     number of steps to reduce costs in the sales program and to \n     provide more efficient service to the public. After \n     conducting a study, it was determined that it was more cost-\n     effective to maintain an adequate inventory of sales titles \n     based on their projected life cycle and to reprint, if \n     necessary.\n       This policy recognizes, however, that some publications \n     such as The Senate will have a much longer life cycle than \n     the ordinary book. Based on current projections, we have on \n     hand an average supply of 9 years for the four volumes. The \n     life cycle for most books is 18 months. The Superintendent of \n     Documents' staff frequently reviews the sales history of each \n     publication. Because of the importance of The Senate, we are \n     prepared to reprint at any time. The sales program pays all \n     costs when we go back to press.\n       As you know, our sales program must recover all expenses \n     from revenues. The program has come under increasing \n     financial pressure recently with some agencies withdrawing \n     titles traditionally sold by the Government Printing Office \n     (GPO) in favor of exclusive arrangements with the National \n     Technical Information Service or other partners. This is \n     causing needless duplication of effort, confusion to those \n     who wish to purchase Government information products, and a \n     substantial loss of revenue to the GPO sales program. In this \n     difficult environment, it is our goal to streamline our \n     operations, improve customer service, and keep prices as low \n     as possible, while at the same time ensuring long-term \n     availability of valuable publications such as The Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael F. DiMario,\n     Public Printer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    June 17, 1997.\n     Mr. Michael F. DiMario,\n     Public Printer, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. DiMario: Your response to my April 23, 1997, \n     letter leaves several questions unanswered.\n       I understand the need to manage the inventory of \n     publications that have a limited shelf life. Printing on \n     demand makes a great deal of sense for bills, reports, and \n     other routine documents. The wisdom of that policy is far \n     less apparent for a ``Level 1'' publication such as ``The \n     Senate 1789-1989.'' I find it difficult to believe that off-\n     site storage costs for this four-volume work would have been \n     greater over a nine-year period than reprinting costs.\n       Your letter does not explain why the Government Printing \n     Office did not contact my office, or the Office of the \n     Secretary of the Senate, to offer to transfer copies deemed \n     to be in excess of projected demand requirements. I am unable \n     to comprehend this lack of communication in the light of the \n     close working relationship this project has inspired over the \n     past decade between the Senate and GPO.\n       When a commercial publisher or university press decides to \n     unload an unwanted title, it is a matter of standard practice \n     and common courtesy to give the author the opportunity to \n     acquire copies. Had we been afforded that opportunity, it \n     would have advanced our plans to make these works widely \n     available to educational entities, both in this country and \n     abroad, and would have quickly absorbed your ``surplus.'' Had \n     someone within the Superintendent of Documents' office \n     bothered to make a single phone call, he or she could have \n     aided a useful project and avoided a needless waste of \n     resources.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Robert C. Byrd.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  U.S. Government Printing Office,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Public Printer,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: This letter is in response to your \n     letter of June 17, 1997, concerning ``The Senate 1789-1989.''\n       I apologize both officially and personally for the \n     unfortunate unilateral reduction of the Superintendent of \n     Documents sales inventory of this publication. I was not \n     aware of the reduction until I received your letter of April \n     23, 1997. Nevertheless, I recognize that full responsibility \n     for this action rests with me and no one else.\n       My regrets are keenly felt since as Assistant Public \n     Printer for Operations and Procurement at the time of the \n     printing of Volume I, I had personal knowledge of your direct \n     participation in the selection of appropriate paper, binding, \n     and font style. Moreover, having family roots in West \n     Virginia, as a history major at Davis and Elkins College, and \n     as a member of its Board of Trustees, I have a keen awareness \n     of and great admiration for your love of the Senate as well \n     as your extraordinary scholarship and sense of the importance \n     of history, both ancient and modern, and I understand how our \n     unthinking actions must have hurt you deeply. I am truly \n     sorry.\n       In fact, it is our policy to contact the publisher of a \n     book when we are reducing inventory, and to offer publishers \n     the excess copies at no charge. This policy was not followed \n     with respect to ``The Senate 1789-1989'' during the major \n     inventory reduction that occurred in the latter part of FY \n     1996, which was undertaken to reverse a trend of financial \n     losses. The Superintendent of Documents instructed sales \n     program staff to move quickly to restore the sales program to \n     financial soundness by the beginning of FY 1997. Because of \n     the short deadline and the large number of titles and copies \n     involved, they did not follow standard policy to contact \n     publishers. Both the management and staff of the sales \n     program are deeply chagrined by this error, and the \n     Superintendent\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n     of Documents has assured me that steps have been taken to \n     ensure our policy on notification of publishers will be \n     strictly followed when making future inventory reductions.\n       As you say in your letter, the Senate and the Government \n     Printing Office (GPO) have maintained a close working \n     relationship during the past decade on ``The Senate 1789-\n     1989.'' We have distributed all four volumes to the 1,380 \n     Federal depository libraries throughout the Nation, and in \n     June 1997 we provided 60 copies of each volume to the United \n     States Information Agency for use in their libraries abroad.\n       Again, both personally and in my capacity as Public \n     Printer, and on behalf of all the employees of GPO for whom \n     you have been a greatly honored customer and friend, I \n     apologize for the haste with which the inventory reduction \n     was made and for our failure to inform your office. We have \n     taken steps to ensure that this does not happen again, and I \n     look forward to continuing to work with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael F. DiMario,\n                                                   Public Printer.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1019, the Fiscal \nYear 1998 Legislative Branch Appropriation bill. This is the first year \nthat the distinguished Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] and the very \nable Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] have served as chairman and \nranking member, respectively, and they are to be congratulated for the \nexpeditious manner with which they have brought this prudent \nlegislation to the floor. Both Senators are to be commended for the \nefforts that they have made to ensure that the Legislative Branch of \nthe Government is funded in a fiscally sound and responsible way.\n  S. 1019, as recommended by the committee, provides $1,537,827,000 in \nbudget authority, to fund salaries and expenses of the Senate and those \nagencies that provide important services to this institution, such as \nthe General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Library of Congress, the Capitol \nPolice, and the Architect of the Capitol. In addition, S. 1019 is well \nwithin its 602(b) subcommittee allocation. This bill does not provide \nfunding for House items, as the full House has not yet acted on the \nLegislative Branch Appropriation bill for fiscal year 1998 as it is \ncustomary that each body defers to the other body to set its own \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I again commend the chairman and ranking member of the \nLegislative Branch Subcommittee for their outstanding work. I also \nthank the committee staff who have worked hard on this bill: Jim \nEnglish, Mary Dewald, and Christine Ciccone.\n  This is a good bill and deserves the support of the Senate. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered as read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with any statements related to the \nbill appear at the appropriate point in the Record.\n  The bill (S. 1019), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1019\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the legislative \n     branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for \n     other purposes, namely:\n\n                   TITLE I--CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS\n\n                                 SENATE\n\n                           expense allowances\n\n       For expense allowances of the Vice President, $10,000;

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide that \nconsideration may not be denied to preference eligibles applying for \ncertain positions in the competitive service, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n           THE VETERANS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nEmployment Opportunities Act of 1997, along with my good friend and \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Max Cleland. We are joined by Senators \nHutchinson of Arkansas, Helms, Dorgan, Roth, Faircloth, Burns, \nLandrieu, Moynihan, Reid of Nevada, and Campbell. This important piece \nof legislation is needed to help America's most deserving and self-\nsacrificing citizens, our veterans, to get and hold jobs with the \nFederal Government.\n  In 1944, the Congress enacted the first veterans employment \npreference legislation. That law was intended to assist service men and \nwomen returning from the battlefields of World War II in getting \nFederal Government jobs. Through the years many changes have taken \nplace in the way we manage civil service personnel within our \nGovernment, and most recently there has been considerable focus on \ndownsizing the Federal bureaucracy. One thing has not changed however, \nand that is that our veterans need to find employment when they return \nto civilian life.\n  This bill addresses the critical need to revise and make more ``user \nfriendly'' those laws that help veterans to get Federal jobs, and to \nhold on to them as the Government downsizes. I want to emphasize that \nthis bill does not guarantee anyone a job, but it does allow the \nsacrifices made by those who served in uniform to have their service \nrecognized as they are considered along with others for Federal jobs.\n  The statistical evidence of need for this legislation tells a \ntroubling story. When Federal job openings occur, the hiring official \nis sent a job referral list that includes the names of qualified \napplicants from which the job can be filled. The General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] found that 71 percent of job referral lists were returned \nwithout hiring when a veteran headed the list. By contrast, 51 percent \nof nonveteran lists are returned. Not only are veterans not getting the \npreference that the statutes require, but too often, veterans are less \nlikely than other applicants to be hired for a Federal job.\n  This bill will also end unfair designer RIFs that single out veterans \nfor removal from the Federal work force during reductions in force. \nPerhaps more important, this bill makes a violation of this law a \nprohibited personnel practice, putting teeth in the law where none now \nexist.\n  I am proud to say that 19 military, veterans, and patriotic \nassociations have indicated that such legislation is needed and that \nthey strongly support this legislation.\n  Those who have made very special contributions to America and our way \nof life, ensuring freedom and individual liberties to all Americans, \ndeserve recognition and fairness when applying for employment in \nFederal Government. Our veterans do not ask for special privileges. \nFifty years ago this Nation made the decision to recognize the \nsacrifices and extra commitment made by\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nour veterans for America. This legislation ensures that special \nrecognition will be provided.\n  I am very proud to join my friend and colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Max Cleland, who himself has made \ntremendous contributions to this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska on his tremendous work and the work of his staff \nin putting together this legislation. He and his team have worked \nclosely with me and my staff. This legislation is a result of their \nefforts.\n  It is my pleasure to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Hagel, \nin cosponsorship of this important bill to improve our veterans \npreference system. As the former head of the Veterans Administration \nmyself, I certainly see the need for it.\n  During World War II, America decided to pay special recognition to \nthe men and women who have defended our freedom by serving in the armed \nforces. The Veterans Preference Act has been the law of the land since \n1944. The premise of this law is simple. When veterans return to \ncivilian life after serving in combat, they are given a preference if \nall other factors are equal when they seek to work for the Federal \nGovernment. I do not think anyone could argue with offering such a \npreference to the men and women of who risked their lives in service to \nthis Nation.\n  That simple premise still holds true today. While we live in a time \nof relative peace, the sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform \nwho serve in or near combat are just as great. We must remain steadfast \nin our commitment to our veterans.\n  Unfortunately, after over 50 years of operation, the preference is \nnot working as intended. Today, many veterans do not receive the hiring \npreference guaranteed to them. It brings to my mind a quote from one of \nWellington's troops:\n\n       In time of war and not before, God and the soldier men \n     adore. But in time of peace with all things righted, God is \n     forgotten and the soldier slighted.\n\n  We are slighting our soldiers by not honoring a commitment made to \nthem in recognition of their sacrifice. There is compelling anecdotal \nevidence that leads us to believe that the current law is not working. \nFurthermore, the General Accounting Office has concluded through its \nreview of the veterans preference program that in many instances, \nveterans are less likely than other applicants to be hired for Federal \njobs.\n  We believe this is wrong. We need to put more teeth in our veterans \npreference law.\n  Our bill has seven simple parts to it.\n  First, it will create an effective redress system for men and women \nwhose veterans preference rights are violated.\n  Second, it will remove artificial barriers that bar qualified \nveterans from competing for Federal jobs.\n  Third, it will prohibit unfair personnel practices which rig the \nsystem against job protection rights of veterans.\n  Fourth, it will provide enhanced opportunity for veterans to find \nother Federal jobs during reductions in force.\n  Fifth, it will extend the veterans preference to nonpolitical jobs in \nthe legislative and judicial branches and the White House.\n  Sixth, our bill will make a violation of veterans preference laws a \nprohibited personnel practice, providing enhanced for disciplinary \nmeasure for those who wilfully violate the law.\n  Finally, the measure extends the preference to those men and women \nnow serving in Bosnia.\n  Our bill is supported by all of the major veterans service \norganizations including The American Legion, AMVETS, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Air Force Sergeants \nAssociation, the Blinded American Veterans Foundation, the Blinded \nVeterans Association, the Disabled Veterans, the Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, the Jewish War Veterans of the USA, the Korean War \nVeterans Association, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the \nNational Association for Uniformed Services, the National Military and \nVeterans Alliance, the Naval Reserve Association, the Noncommissioned \nOfficers Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the \nVietnam Veterans of America.\n  As a Vietnam Veteran, I look forward to working with my fellow \nVietnam Veteran, Senator Hagel, on passing this critical legislation to \nstrengthen the veterans preference program. I urge the support of my \ncolleagues and this bill's swift passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Daschle)\n  S. 1024. A bill to make chapter 12 of title 11 of the United States \nCode permanent, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                the family farmer protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Working \nFamily Farmer Protection Act of 1997. As the only family farmer in the \nSenate, I feel I have a unique responsibility to make sure that family \nfarming remains a strong and vibrant part of American life. For \ngenerations, family farms have fed this country. But the global \nmarketplace presents some new and unique challenges to the family \nfarmer. That's why I'm introducing the Family Farmer Protection Act \ntoday, on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin.\n  This bill makes chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code permanent. \nCurrently, chapter 12 is due to expire in 1998, and I think it would be \na terrible error if this Congress did not act now to reauthorize \nchapter 12 on a permanent basis.\n  In order to understand why we need to make chapter 12 permanent, I \nthink we have to go back a decade or so to the 1980's farm crisis. \nDuring the mid-1980's, the agricultural economy in the Midwest took a \nsharp downturn. And many family farmers were forced into bankruptcy. At \nthat time, the only choice a family farmer had was to go into chapter \n11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11, the creditors form a \ncommittee and help to draw up a reorganization plan. Most family farms \nonly had one major creditor--the bank with the mortgage on the farm. \nAnd that one creditor was able to keep farmers from reorganizing in an \neffective way. As a result, the family farmers who filed chapter 11 \nwere frequently forced out of farming. In short, the family farm was on \na fast track to extinction, and family farmers were fast becoming an \nendangered species.\n\n  That's why in 1986 I drafted an entirely new chapter of the \nBankruptcy Code to preserve the family farm. That chapter is chapter \n12. Chapter 12 simply limits the power of the bank to exercise a veto \nover a farmer's reorganization plan.\n  I think it's very important to realize that chapter 12 is not a \nhandout or a get-out-of-debt-free card. Farmers are hard-working people \nwho want the chance to earn their way. In fact, chapter 12 is modeled \non chapter 13, where individuals set up plans to repay a portion of \ntheir debts.\n  Chapter 12 has been wildly successful. So many times in Washington we \ndevelop programs and laws with the best of intentions. But when these \nprograms get to the real world, they don't work well. Chapter 12, on \nthe other hand, has worked exactly as intended. According to a recent \nUniversity of Iowa study, 74 percent of family farmers who filed\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\nchapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming and 61 percent of farmers who \nwent through chapter 12 believe that chapter 12 was helpful in getting \nfarmers back on their feet.\n  In conclusion, chapter 12 works and it works well. Let's make sure \nthat we keep this safety net for family farmers in place. I urge my \ncolleagues to think of this bill as a low-cost insurance policy for an \nimportant part of America's economy and America's heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1025. A bill to provide for a study of the south Florida high-\nintensity drug trafficking area, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  expansion of south florida hidta to include i-4 corridor legislation\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, cosponsored \nby Mr. Mack and Mr. Grassley, which will expand the existing south \nFlorida high-intensity drug trafficking area [HIDTA], to include the \nInterstate 4 corridor which runs between Daytona Beach and the Tampa \nBay area in my home State of Florida.\n  Illegal drug activities continue to plague the State of Florida. In \n1994, more than $5 billion in funds from cocaine traffic were laundered \nthrough south Florida and the I-4 corridor. Over 23 metric tons of \ncocaine were seized during that same time period. Over 250 organized \ndrug trafficking groups have been identified as operating between south \nFlorida and the I-4 corridor. These statistic are staggering. While \nsome progress is being made to limit the spread of illegal drugs, there \nis still a lot of work to be done. I continuously hear from the law \nenforcement personnel operating along the I-4 corridor that they are \nbeing overwhelmed by the growth in drug trafficking activities in that \narea. Drug traffickers are becoming increasingly proficient in \ndistributing drugs. They are using high technology equipment to evade \ndetection. They have an extensive communications network, and almost \nunlimited funds with which to pursue their illegal activities. Current \nlaw enforcement assets are simply no match for the highly organized \ndrug operators. Seized assets from drug traffickers in this area during \n1996 included over $425 million in currency and property. The basic \nproblem is how do we compete with these highly funded and well equipped \ndrug trafficking organizations?\n  I repeatedly hear the same story from the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Customs Service, the FBI, and the Florida \nDepartment of Law Enforcement; they need help. This is a problem which \nimpacts not only the State of Florida, but it also impacts the entire \nNation as illegal drugs are distributed from the I-4 corridor to other \nparts of the country.\n  The statistics on the growth of the drug industry along the I-4 \ncorridor are sobering. Nationwide, cheap, high purity heroin is making \na comeback in popularity, and demand is on the rise. The drug \nsyndicates are meeting the growing demands. Cocaine continues as a \npopular recreational drug. As long as there is a demand, drug dealers \ncontinue to find ways to meet that demand. Despite a massive education \nand public awareness campaign to warn teenagers about the dangers of \ndrug use, teen drug arrests have more than doubled in the past 5 years. \nSome of those arrested are as young as 12 years old. In the Orlando \narea, over 1,500 teens between the ages of 12 and 17 years old were \narrested for using or selling illegal drugs in 1995. The city of \nOrlando, through which the I-4 corridor runs, ranked fifth in the \nNation for cocaine-related deaths per capita in 1995. Other crimes such \nas shootings, carjackings, robbery, and gang activities are byproducts \nof the drug problem, and are also on the rise in our local communities. \nWe are truly battling for the lives of our young people.\n  There is a general feeling of despair among the various agencies \ntrying to combat this problem. We need to be proactive in helping them. \nBecause of its central location, the I-4 corridor is emerging as a hub \nused increasingly by international drug syndicates to distribute their \ngoods throughout the Nation. This is a problem which affects us all. \nThe use of illegal drugs and drug related deaths are increasing at an \nalarming rate.\n  As we saw with the establishment of a HIDTA in south Florida, a \ncoordinated Federal, State, and local effort is the key to bringing \nthis problem under control. This HIDTA has proven itself as a model of \nefficiency and effectiveness in controlling the expansion of drug \nactivities in the area. The existing south Florida HIDTA is a model of \nthe results which can occur when the various law enforcement agencies \nmount a coordinated battle with a unified strategy of engagement. We \nhave seen moderation in the drug related incidents since the south \nFlorida HIDTA was established in 1990. In fact, the success of the \nsouth Florida HIDTA is partially responsible for the increase in \nillegal drug activity along the I-4 corridor.\n  Expanding this successful HIDTA to include the I-4 corridor makes \ncommon sense. It will allow us to devote additional resources to combat \na problem which has nationwide implications.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The international drug trade poses a direct threat to \n     the United States and to international efforts to promote \n     democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule \n     of law.\n       (2) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     combating the financial and other resources of the \n     multinational drug cartels, which resources threaten the \n     integrity of political and financial institutions both in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) Approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, \n     including 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, \n     and 9,800,000 marijuana users.\n       (4) Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic \n     and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n       (5) Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost the United \n     States approximately $67,000,000,000 in 1996, including costs \n     for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n       (6) Worldwide drug trafficking generates revenues estimated \n     at $400,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) The United States has spent more than $25,000,000,000 \n     for drug interdiction and source country counternarcotics \n     programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the \n     border, on the high seas, and in other countries, illegal \n     drugs from foreign sources are cheaper and more readily \n     available in the United States today than 20 years ago.\n       (8) The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 \n     Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 \n     Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and \n     Psychotropic Substances form the legal framework for \n     international drug control cooperation.\n       (9) The United Nations International Drug Control Program, \n     the International Narcotics Control Board, and the \n     Organization of American States can play important roles in \n     facilitating the development and implementation of more \n     effective multilateral programs to combat both domestic and \n     international drug trafficking and consumption.\n       (10) The annual certification process required by section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     which has been in effect since 1986, has failed to foster \n     bilateral or multilateral cooperation with United States \n     counternarcotics programs because its provisions are vague \n     and inconsistently applied and fail to acknowledge that \n     United States narcotics programs have not been fully \n     effective in combating consumption or trafficking in illegal \n     drugs, and related crimes, in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) existing United States domestic and international \n     counternarcotics program have not reduced the supply of \n     illegal drugs or significantly reduced domestic consumption \n     of such drugs;\n       (2) the President should appoint a high level task force of \n     foreign policy experts, law enforcement officials, and drug \n     specialists to develop a comprehensive program for addressing \n     domestic and international drug trafficking and drug \n     consumption and related crimes, with particular attention to \n     fashioning a multilateral framework for improving \n     international cooperation in combating illegal drug \n     trafficking, and should designate the Director of the Office \n     of National Drug Policy to chair the task force;\n       (3) the President should call upon the heads of state of \n     major illicit drug producing countries, major drug transit \n     countries, and major money laundering countries to establish \n     similar high level task forces to work in coordination with \n     the United States;

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The international drug trade poses a direct threat to \n     the United States and to international efforts to promote \n     democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     combating the financial and other resources of the \n     multinational drug cartels, which resources threaten the \n     integrity of political and financial institutions both in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) Approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, \n     including 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, \n     and 9,800,000 marijuana users.\n       (4) Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic \n     and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n       (5) Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost the United \n     States approximately $67,000,000,000 in 1996, including costs \n     for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n       (6) Worldwide drug trafficking generates revenues estimated \n     at $400,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) The United States has spent more than $25,000,000,000 \n     for drug interdiction and source country counternarcotics \n     programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the \n     border, on the high seas, and in other countries, illegal \n     drugs from foreign sources are cheaper and more readily \n     available in the United States today than 20 years ago.\n       (8) The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 \n     Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 \n     Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and \n     Psychotropic Substances form the legal framework for \n     international drug control cooperation.\n       (9) The United Nations International Drug Control Program, \n     the International Narcotics Control Board, and the \n     Organization of American States can play important roles in \n     facilitating the development and implementation of more \n     effective multilateral programs to combat both domestic and \n     international drug trafficking and consumption.\n       (10) The annual certification process required by section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     which has been in effect since 1986, has failed to foster \n     bilateral or multilateral cooperation with United States \n     counternarcotics programs because its provisions are vague \n     and inconsistently applied and fail to acknowledge that \n     United States narcotics programs have not been fully \n     effective in combating consumption or trafficking in illegal \n     drugs, and related crimes, in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) existing United States domestic and international \n     counternarcotics programs have not reduced the supply of \n     illegal drugs or significantly reduced domestic consumption \n     of such drugs;\n       (2) the President should appoint a high level task force of \n     foreign policy experts, law enforcement officials, and drug \n     specialists to develop a comprehensive program for addressing \n     domestic and international drug\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\n     trafficking and drug consumption and related crimes, with \n     particular attention to fashioning a multilateral framework \n     for improving international cooperation in combating illegal \n     drug trafficking, and should designate the Director of the \n     Office of National Drug Policy to chair the task force;\n       (3) the President should call upon the heads of state of \n     major illicit drug producing countries, major drug transit \n     countries, and major money laundering countries to establish \n     similar high level task forces to work in coordination with \n     the United States; and\n       (4) not later than one year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the President should call for the convening of an \n     international summit of all interested governments to be \n     hosted by the Organization of American States or another \n     international organization mutually agreed to by the parties, \n     for the purpose of reviewing the findings and recommendations \n     of the task forces referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) and \n     adopting a counternarcotics plan of action for each country.\n       (c) Suspension of Drug Certification Process.--(1) Section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     relating to annual certification procedures for assistance \n     for certain drug-producing and drug-transit countries, shall \n     not apply in 1998 and 1999.\n       (2) The President may waive the applicability of that \n     section in 2000 if the President determines prior to December \n     31, 1999 that the waiver would facilitate the enhancement of \n     United States international narcotics control programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GORTON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 902\n\n  Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Boxer) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, S. 955, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       The Boeing Company and McDonnell Douglas have announced \n     their merger; and\n       The Department of Defense has approved that merger as \n     consistent with the national security of the United States; \n     and\n       The Federal Trade Commission has found that merger not to \n     violate the antitrust laws of the United States; and\n       The European Commission has consistently criticized and \n     threatened the merger before, during, and after its \n     consideration of the facts; and\n       The sole true reason for the European Commission criticism \n     and imminent disapproval of the merger is to gain an unfair \n     competitive advantage for Airbus, a government-owned aircraft \n     manufacturer;\n       Now therefore, It is the sense of the Senate that any such \n     disapproval on the part of the European Commission would \n     constitute an unwarranted and unprecedented interference in a \n     United States business transaction that would threaten \n     thousands of American aerospace jobs; and\n       The Senate suggests that the President take such actions as \n     he deems appropriate to protect U.S. interests in connection \n     therewith.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DeWINE AMENDMENT NO. 903\n\n  Mr. DeWINE proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 955, supra;

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) United States training of members of Latin American \n     military and security forces that occurred primarily at the \n     Army School of the Americas between 1982 and 1991 has been \n     severely criticized for promoting practices that have \n     contributed to the violation of human rights and have \n     otherwise been inconsistent with the appropriate role of the \n     Armed Forces in a democratic society.\n       (2) Numerous members of Latin American military and \n     security forces who have participated in United States \n     sponsored training programs, have subsequently been \n     identified as having masterminded, participated in, or sought \n     to cover up some of the most heinous human rights abuses in \n     the region.\n       (3) United States interests in Latin America would be \n     better served if Latin American military personnel were \n     exposed to training programs designed to promote--\n       (A) proper management of scarce national defense resources,\n       (B) improvements in national systems of justice in \n     accordance with internationally recognized principles of \n     human rights, and\n       (C) greater respect and understanding of the principle of \n     civilian control of the military.\n       (4) In 1989, Congress mandated that the Department of \n     Defense institute new training programs (commonly referred to \n     as expanded IMET) with funds made available for international \n     military and education programs in order to promote the \n     interests described in paragraph (3). Congress also expanded \n     the definition of eligibility for such training to include \n     non-defense government personnel from countries in Latin \n     America.\n       (5) Despite congressionally mandated emphasis on expanded \n     IMET training programs, only 4 of the more than 50 courses \n     offered annually at the United States Army School of the \n     Americas qualify as expanded IMET.\n       (b) Limitation of Use of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, none of the funds appropriated in this Act \n     under the heading relating to international military \n     education and training may be made available for training \n     members of any Latin American military or security force \n     until--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense has advised the Secretary of \n     State in writing that 30 percent of IMET funds appropriated \n     for fiscal year 1998 for the cost of Latin American \n     participants in IMET programs will be disbursed only for the \n     purpose of supporting enrollment of such participants in \n     expanded IMET courses; and\n       (2) the Secretary of State has identified sufficient \n     numbers of qualified, non-military personnel from countries \n     in Latin America to participate in IMET programs during \n     fiscal year 1998 in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, and has instructed United States embassies in the \n     hemisphere to approve their participation in such programs so \n     that not less than 25 percent of the individuals from Latin \n     American countries attending United States supported IMET \n     programs are civilians.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall report in \n     writing to the appropriate committees of Congress on the \n     progress made to improve military training of Latin American \n     participants in the areas of human rights and civilian \n     control of the military. The Secretary shall include in the \n     report plans for implementing additional expanded IMET \n     programs for Latin America during the next 3 fiscal years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TORRICELLI AMENDMENT NO. 913\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Torricelli) proposed an amendment to the bill, \nS. 955, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Donald Patterson was a \nfriend, dedicated father and community leader who was respected by all \nwho knew him. Judge Patterson honorably served the people of Lauderdale \nCounty, AL, as an elected judge in the 11th Judicial District of \nAlabama.\n  Don grew up in Florence, AL and then received both his bachelor's and \nlaw degrees from the University of Alabama. Always a leader, Don was \npresident of the student government association while at the \nuniversity. Following his graduation from law school, Don served active \nduty in the U.S. Army, and later, 6 years in the U.S. Army Reserve.\n  In 1959, Don began his law practice with Bert Haltrom. The two \ncontinued to practice until Bert Haltrom was appointed U.S. district \ncourt judge. Until Don's election to the circuit court in 1989, he \npracticed law with Florence attorney Gary Jester.\n  Judge Patterson was a true gentleman and leader. His Christian values\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nare reflected not only in the way he lived his life, but in the many \norganizations he led, belonged to and served. Until his passing, Judge \nPatterson was a member of the Alabama Judicial Study Commission and a \ndirector of the Alabama Circuit Court Judges Association.\n  Additionally, Judge Patterson served as chairman of the Florence-\nLauderdale Industrial Expansion Committee; director of the chamber of \ncommerce; past president of the Florence Rotary Club, and a recipient \nof the Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International Award. Furthermore, \nhe served numerous other legal, civic, and Christian groups.\n  Judge Patterson was a first-rate judge and lawyer--always very \nprofessional and knowledgeable. As a Sunday school teacher and past \nchairman of the board of the First Methodist Church of Florence, he was \nan exemplary citizen, leader, and role model. And as a husband, father, \ngrandfather, and friend, Don was a compassionate and wonderful human \nbeing.\n  My prayers go out to Don's family and friends. Don Patterson's \nlifelong dedication to community and country made our world a better \nplace--he will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7615-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RESPONSE TO THE AMERICAN LEGION\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, recently I received a letter from \nthe national vice commander of the American Legion expressing his \ndispleasure with my concerns with the process surrounding the selection \nof a site and design for the World War II Memorial.\n  As a matter of public record, I would like to submit my response and \nan article from the May 23, 1997, issue of the Washington Post. The \nWashington Post article discusses the recent problems with the Korean \nWar Memorial, including flooding and damage to shade trees in the \nsurrounding areas. I thought this article might be of interest to the \nAmerican Legion and my colleagues.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1997.\n     Robert L. Bowen,\n     National Vice Commander, The American Legion, Woodbridge, VA.\n       Dear Mr. Bowen: Although I am opposed to the selection of \n     the Rainbow Pool Site, I fully support the construction of a \n     memorial to the veterans of World War II and have even called \n     for the construction of a museum. The struggle and sacrifices \n     made by my parents' generation during the most pivotal event \n     of the 20th Century is a story that must be thoroughly told \n     to my children and grandchildren's generations.\n       There is a process for building a memorial--any memorial--\n     on Federal property, which has many steps and procedures. \n     Currently there is some confusion as to whether this process \n     is being properly followed, because of an apparent rush for \n     approval and completion. The result could cause the \n     construction of a memorial not befitting to those it portends \n     to honor, and puts at peril the sacred space that is our \n     National Mall.\n       Certainly you are aware of the situation concerning the \n     Korean War Memorial (please see the attached article from the \n     Washington Post.). This memorial has been closed almost as \n     much as it has been open to the public in its two years and \n     is already suffering from disrepair and flooding problems \n     because of its location on the Mall--which lies on a flood \n     plain.\n       The current proposed site for the World War II memorial \n     lies on this same flood plain and, besides its 50-foot-high \n     berms and 7.4 acres of land space, calls for a significant \n     amount of subterranean construction.\n       Because there have been no studies as to the effects of \n     subterranean construction on this site and the Mall, nor any \n     studies on the impact the size and scope of the proposed \n     memorial will have on the Mall, I am concerned about its long \n     term impact and the cost to taxpayers, the City and the \n     Federal government. Because once the memorial is completed, \n     it will be turned over to the National Park Service for \n     overall maintenance and thus will be supported by taxpayer \n     dollars.\n       I am absolutely concerned with how our veterans of World \n     War II are honored. That is why I am particularly troubled \n     that the National Park Service has ruled it will close any \n     memorial built on the Rainbow Pool Site during July 4th \n     weekend celebrations, because the Rainbow Pool Site is the \n     launch location of the fireworks display. This seems to \n     belabor the point that not enough scrutiny is being given to \n     what is being built, where.\n       I appreciate and share your concern about the progress of \n     the World War II memorial and will continue to work on behalf \n     of the veterans and the American people to ensure that a \n     proper and fitting monument is constructed and that the \n     integrity of our National Mall is maintained.\n       Please feel free to contact me in the future if you have \n     any further concerns and I hope you will join me in my \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Kerrey.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 23, 1997]\n\n       Neglected But Not Forgotten, Korean War Memorial Gets Help\n\n                           (By Linda Wheeler)\n\n       Officials of the troubled Korean War Veterans Memorial have \n     promised the fountain will flow and the walkway will be open \n     for the country's official observance of Memorial Day on \n     Monday.\n       The two-year-old monument, near the Lincoln Memorial, was \n     partially closed in September when the fountain broke, \n     walkway paving stones buckled and 40 dead shade trees were \n     removed. Since then, various federal agencies and private \n     contractors involved with the memorial have argued over who \n     will pay for the repairs.\n       Some of the work is being done under warranty, said \n     American Battle Monuments Commission spokesman Joe Purka. The \n     commission built the memorial and has agreed to fund $100,000 \n     in repairs until liability is determined.\n       Purka said the commission, founded in 1923, has \n     responsibility for maintaining 24 American military \n     cemeteries in foreign lands and 27 memorials here and in \n     other countries. He said the commission took the money for \n     emergency repairs to the Korean War Veterans memorial from a \n     general fund that is to be reimbursed.\n       The World War II Memorial, planned for the Rainbow Pool \n     site on the Mall, is also a commission project.\n       Last week, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a Korean War hero and \n     a sponsor of the memorial, sent a tersely worded letter to \n     the commission, the Army Corps of Engineers as general \n     contractor and the National park Service after news accounts \n     of the memorial's condition. In the May 13 letters, he said \n     he wanted the memorial fixed promptly.\n       ``It is disrespectful to our Korean War veterans to see the \n     national memorial to their service in such disrepair,'' he \n     wrote. ``I would hesitate to take a visitor to this memorial, \n     which I supported and worked for over several years.''\n       Purka said Glenn's letters ``may have added a little \n     impetus'' in getting repairs underway.\n       Yesterday, water flowed through the fountain again, and two \n     ducks paddled around the circular pool. Nearby a grader \n     pushed fine, crushed gravel into the pool and the walkway \n     were closed off with yellow tape and orange cones.\n       John LeGault, 65, a Korean War veteran visiting from \n     Montrose, Colo., said Wednesday he wasn't surprised to see \n     the memorial torn up. ``Who cares?'' he asked. ``That was the \n     forgotten war and this is the forgotten memorial. Considering \n     how long it took to build it, it will take another 2 to fix \n     it.''\n       William Weber, also a Korean War veteran and chairman of \n     the Gen. Richard G. Stilwell Korean War Veterans Memorial \n     Fund Inc., said he understands LeGault's frustration. He and \n     other board members struggled for nine years to raise the $18 \n     million to build the memorial, only to see problems show up \n     within six months of the July 27, 1995, dedication by \n     President Clinton.\n       ``The memorial seemed to deteriorate so quickly and then it \n     took so long to take action to do the repairs,'' Weber said. \n     ``Many of us were very frustrated.''\n       Weber said supporters of the memorial have recognized the \n     need for a private fund to handle large repairs not covered \n     by the Park Service but have only recently begun to raise \n     money.\n       Care of the nation's memorials falls to the Park Service \n     when they are built on federal parkland. However, over the \n     years maintenance costs have risen with aging memorials and \n     Congress has tightened the Park Service's budget.\n       Since 1986, builders of memorials have been required to set \n     aside 10 percent of the construction costs for the Park \n     Service's use. For the Korean War Veterans Memorial, about \n     $1.2 million was turned over to the Park Service, Purka said. \n     However, the Park Service said those funds are for routine \n     care--not major repairs such as the fountain and the $30,000 \n     tree replacement.\n       The Park Service has replaced dead shrubs around the 19 \n     stainless steel soldier figures that are part of the memorial \n     and has enhanced the lighting for nighttime visits.\n       Weber said there will be a small ceremony at the memorial \n     on Monday to mark the holiday. About 70 Korean War veterans \n     are expected to gather at 1 p.m. for the presentation of the \n     colors and the laying of a wreath.\n       Park Service spokesman Earle Kittleman said the agency was \n     pleased the work at the memorial finally was getting done. \n     For months, he had to respond to phone calls and letters from \n     concerned veterans.\n       ``We want visitors to the parks to be able to walk into the \n     memorial without running into obstacles and closed areas,'' \n     he said. ``We are happy that all the parties have worked \n     together and everything will be ready for Memorial \n     Day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7616-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7616-S7617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPLANATION OF SELECTED VOTES TO THE TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, now that the Taxpayer Relief Act \nof 1997\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\nhas passed the Senate, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss \nseveral of the more important votes that took place.\n  The first of these was the Daschle amendment. This amendment \nconstituted a comprehensive substitute to the Finance Committee plan, \nbut I believe it failed to live up to the spirit of the budget \nagreement between congressional leadership and the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The Daschle substitute would have provided only $68.5 billion in net \ntax cuts to the American people--not the $85 billion called for in the \nbudget agreement. An $85 billion tax cut represented less than 1 \npercent of the total tax burden over the next 5 years, yet the Daschle \nsubstitute would have reduced that relief by almost 20 percent. The \nDaschle amendment reduced the $500 per child tax credit to $350. It \nexcluded millions of tax-paying families with teenage children from \nreceiving any tax relief at all, including as many as 50,000 families \nin Michigan. And it drastically reduced the capital gains tax relief \nfor seniors and small businessmen. For these reasons, I opposed it.\n  There were several amendments targeted at the Finance Committee's \n$500 per child tax credit. The Kerry amendment would have made the \nchild tax credit refundable against FICA tax payments. To pay for \nrefundability, the amendment would have reduced the income levels at \nwhich the credit is phased-out.\n  Mr. President, I support making the family tax cuts in this \nlegislation broader to include lower-income families, but I oppose \ntaking tax relief away from middle-class families to do so. The Kerry \namendment would have eliminated the $500 credit for millions of middle-\nclass families who pay almost 40 percent of their income in taxes while \nredirecting that relief towards families with no income tax burden and \nactually receive money from the Federal Government.\n  A similar amendment, offered by Senator Landrieu, would have \npermitted families receiving payments under the earned income credit to \nalso receive full $500 per child tax credits. Senator Landrieu would \nhave offset these new payments by reducing the allowable family income \nfrom $110,000 to $75,000. Once again, this amendment would have taken \nrelief away from taxpaying families. While I support giving tax relief \nto families of all incomes, it is not right to take tax relief away \nfrom families earning as little as $75,000 to make it possible.\n  An amendment which I supported was offered by Senator Gramm to \nprovide the full $500 per child tax credit to parents of children ages \n13 to 17. Under the Finance bill, the full child credit would only go \nto those parents who deposit it into a qualified tuition savings plan \nfor their children. For those parents who are unable to afford such a \nplan, or whose children do not go to college, they would only qualify \nfor a reduced tax credit. I disagree with this approach, and supported \nthe Gramm amendment. The whole purpose of the $500 per child credit is \nto let families keep more of what they earn so they can spend that \nmoney on their priorities, not the Federal Governments. In Michigan, \nthousands of families have children who choose not to go to college. I \ndo not believe they should be penalized for making that choice.\n  Senator Jeffords offered an amendment to make the existing dependent \ncare tax deduction refundable. I support making childcare available to \nmore parents, but I am concerned that the Jeffords amendment would \ncreate a bias against small, neighborhood child care givers and towards \nlarge, accredited facilities. Specifically, the Jeffords amendment \nwould give families a larger tax credit for sending their children to \nan accredited facility than if they chose a smaller, unaccredited \ncaregiver. I believe this is a poorly thought out provision which \ncreate an unjustified intrusion by the Federal Government into the \nchild care decisions of parents. Rather than allow parents to make \ntheir own child care decisions free from a biased tax code, this \namendment would have placed parents in a position of losing part of \ntheir tax credit just because they chose the neighbor they know and \ntrust, rather than the stranger working at the large, accredited child \ncare center. For that reason, I opposed the amendment.\n  Another amendment I opposed was the Kennedy amendment to raise the \ncigarette excise tax by an additional 23 cents. Senator Kennedy's \nintention was to use the $12 billion raised by this tax to provide \nadditional funding for children's health insurance.\n  Mr. President, I support the underlying bill's provision to ensure \nthat deserving children get adequate funding to meet the health \ninsurance challenge. The Finance Committee bill, as amended by the \nSenate, would spend $24 billion over the next 5 years, or about $1,600 \nper child to address this issue. Senator Kennedy's amendment would \nprovide an additional $12 billion over 5 years for health insurance \ncoverage. Mr. President, I believe it is incumbent upon Senator Kennedy \nand other supporters of this higher level of funding to demonstrate how \nthese sums could be effectively spent to combat a problem that the \nClinton administration has agreed could be solved with a lower funding \nlevel. In my opinion, Senator Kennedy failed to make that case, and for \nthat reason I opposed the Kennedy amendment.\n  One amendment which I supported was offered by Senator Durbin to \nprovide the self-employed with the ability to deduct 100 percent of \ntheir health insurance costs. I believe the current policy toward self-\nemployed Americans is unfair and discriminatory and I supported the \nDurbin amendment in an effort to ensure that this issue was addressed \nby the conference committee. While the Durbin amendment failed on a \npoint of order, a subsequent Nickles amendment to provide 100 percent \ndeductibility by the year 2007 was adopted and will likely be made part \nof the bill sent to the President. I supported that amendment as well, \nand look forward to seeing this provision made law.\n  A final effort which I supported was the McCain point of order \nagainst the creation of an intercity passenger rail fund. My vote in \nsupport of Senator McCain should not be interpreted as a vote against \nAmtrak. Instead, I opposed this fund because it is designed to skirt \nthe existing budget process and create a bias for Amtrak funding and \nagainst other Federal programs, such as veterans' programs, community \nhealth centers, and other essential services. In my opinion, the \nproponents of the Amtrak fund have failed to demonstrate why Amtrak \nfunding should be given a special place of prominence among all other \nfederal programs. Next year, the Federal Government will take in $1.7 \ntrillion in tax revenues. If Amtrak funding is a priority, I am \nconfident that sufficient money can be found in the budget without \nresorting to tax increases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7616-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7617-S7618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SENATOR TORRICELLI HONORS DEPARTING SWEDISH AMBASSADOR\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nmonumental service and dedication of one of Sweden's finest Ambassadors \never to have served in the United States, Mr. Henrik Liljegren. After \n4\\1/2\\ years in Washington, Ambassador Liljegren is being reassigned to \nIstanbul, Turkey, and I want to take this opportunity to express my \nadmiration for, and gratitude to, this skilled diplomat.\n  Ambassador Liljegren has spent his time in Washington carefully \nfostering a new level of understanding between our two countries. The \nend of the cold war has created new perspectives for Sweden's foreign \npolicy, and new opportunities for Sweden and the United States to \nfurther their relationship. Ambassador Liljegren is well respected for \nhis willingness to promote closer ties between the people of our two \ngreat nations.\n  His strategy for strengthening United States-Swedish ties has been \nmultifaceted and creative. For example, he recently testified before \nthe Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to help \ndetermine whether or not neutral countries had profited from their \npolicies during the Second World War. Ambassador Liljegren was aware of \nthe State Department's Eizenstat Report, which was stern in its \ncondemnation of neutral states during this period, and was forthcoming \nin explaining his country's policies vis-a-vis the Third Reich. His \ntestimony was influential in drawing attention to the systematic effort \non the part of the Swedish Foreign Ministry to assist the Jews during \nWorld War II.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate and the entire Nation, I \nwant to\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\nagain express our gratitude for Ambassador Liljegren's service, and \nwish him the best of luck as he continues his career in Turkey.\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO STEPHANIE A.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Stephanie A. Frank of Dover, NH, and Erick N. Viorritto of \nManchester, NH, on being selected as the Granite State winners of the \n1997 White House Presidential Scholars Program sponsored by General \nMotors and Saturn. Stephanie and Erick were chosen on the basis of \nacademic and artistic success, leadership, and involvement in their \nschool and community. Each student also selected the teacher who has \nhad the most impact on his or her accomplishments.\n  Stephanie and Erick, along with their parents and honored teachers, \nspent a week in Washington, and attended the Presidential Scholar \nMedallion ceremony hosted by President Clinton. Stephanie, a graduate \nof Dover High School in Dover, NH, brought her teacher Mr. Christopher \nLawrence to accompany her on the trip, while Erick, a graduate of \nManchester's West High School in Manchester, NH, brought his teacher \nMr. Gaston P. Normand, Jr., for the festivities.\n  Founded in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the White House \nPresidential Scholars Program honors the Nation's most accomplished \nstudents. This year, 141 high school seniors were chosen from among \n2,600 eligible candidates on the basis of academic and artistic \nsuccess, leadership, and involvement in their school and community.\n  As a former high school teacher myself, I commend Stephanie and Erick \nfor their hard work and outstanding achievements. Congratulations to \nStephanie and Erick on this distinguished honor.

Mr. President, half a billion people throughout \nthe world have disabilities, and 85 percent of them live in poverty. In \nmany countries, disability can be a barrier to the many aspects of life \nthat those of us without disabilities often take for granted. It has \nbeen 15 years since the United Nations World Programme of Action \nConcerning Disabled Persons was adopted to improve the lives of \ncitizens with disabilities in their nations. As a result, many \ncountries are responding to the United Nations challenge and doing more \nto help citizens with disabilities live fuller and more productive \nlives.\n  In 1996, the World Committee on Disability, an organization dedicated \nto supporting the U.N. Programme, initiated an annual award named for \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt to honor nations that make \nsignificant progress toward meeting the United Nations goals. On \nSeptember 15, 1996, the first FDR International Disability Award went \nto President Kim Young Sam of South Korea. The award is a bust of FDR \nand a $50,000 donation to a Korean non-governmental disability \norganization, and it recognizes South Korea's impressive strides in \nimproving the lives of its citizens with disabilities. South Korea has \ntaken steps to legislate needed protections and to provide physical and \nemployment rehabilitation services. Buildings, education, and \nemployment are being made accessible to those with disabilities. \nPresident Kim is also waging a public awareness campaign to involve \nmore nondisabled South Koreans in the lives of those with disabilities.\n  I commend South Korea for the progress it is making. The 1996 award \nis a great honor for that country, and an example for other nations. \nAlready, President Kim has created a fellowship fund to provide \nassistance to 10 outstanding Koreans with disabilities each year, and \nother nations are following South Korea's leadership.\n  This international award is also a reminder that there is still much \nmore to do to ensure that persons with disabilities have the \nopportunity to become independent and productive citizens and lead \nfulfilling lives. I commend the World Committee on Disability for its \nleadership. I look forward to this year's award and to continuing to \nmake worldwide progress on this extremely important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7618-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOLLY A. CORNELL\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am saddened to note the \npassing of Holly A. Cornell of Charbonneau, one of Oregon's leading \ncitizens, who died at his home on July 1 after a long illness at the \nage of 83. A July 7 memorial service for Mr. Cornell was held at the \nLaSells Stewart Alumni Center on the Oregon State University Campus in \nCorvallis.\n  Mr. Cornell, a founding partner and the ``C'' in what became Oregon's \nown CH2M HILL, was the international engineering and environmental \nconsulting firm's first employee. He returned to Corvallis after World \nWar II to co-found the firm that was to become Cornell, Howland Hayes & \nMerryfield [CH2M]. He managed numerous water, wastewater and industrial \nprojects for CH2M, and opened the firm's Seattle office. He also served \nas director of technology, president and chief executive officer and \nchairman of the board.\n  Among his many accomplishments were ushering CH2M HILL into the \ncomputer age, and managing complex projects such as the Milwaukee \nMetropolitan Sewerage District's pollution abatement project. At the \ntime of Mr. Cornell's 1980 retirement, CH2M HILL had grown from a four-\npartner office in a second-floor Corvallis office to an international \nconsulting firm employing 1,900 professionals in 20 U.S. offices and \ntwo overseas locations.\n  His legacy, which is one of the Nation's largest employee owned \ncompanies, has become a $1 billion a year business which employs more \nthan 7,000 employees in 120 worldwide locations.\n  Mr. Cornell is the second CH2M HILL founder to pass away. Fred \nMerryfield, the Oregon State engineering professor who conceived the \nidea for the firm, died in 1977. The other founders are retired, but \nremain active in CH2M HILL affairs, in their communities and in their \npersonal lives.\n  Ralph R. Peterson, CH2M HILL's president and CEO, said,\n\n       It was my personal pleasure to work with Holly from the \n     time I joined the firm in 1965 until Holly's retirement in \n     1980. Of course, he excelled at whatever job he undertook, \n     but what I remember most of Holly during those times are the \n     lasting relationships he forged with clients, on projects: \n     clients and projects like to Boeing 747 Assembly Plant in \n     Everett, Washington; and the Denver Water Board's Foothills \n     Water Treatment plant in Denver. These became landmark \n     projects, but what is truly impressive is that those clients \n     are still valued CH2M HILL clients today.\n\n  Mr. Cornell was born in Boise, ID in 1914 and earned a bachelor's \ndegree in civil engineering from Oregon State College in 1939. He \nearned a master's degree from Yale and worked for the Standard Oil Co. \nin California before being called to active Army duty in 1941. Mr. \nCornell served with distinction in the Army Corps of Engineers in \nEurope during World War II and received the Bronze Star medal. He was \nexecutive officer of an engineer group under Gen. George Patton that \nrepaired Germany's famed Remagen Bridge, enabling Allied forces to \ncross the Rhine.\n  Mr. Cornell was active in numerous professional societies including \nthe American Consulting Engineers Council, the American Society of \nCivil Engineers, the American Water Works Association, and the \nProfessional Engineers of Oregon. The latter society recently named him \nOregon Engineer of the Year. He also was active in a university \nfraternal organization, Phi Delta Theta, and several honorary societies \nincluding Phi Kappa Phi and Tau Beta Pi.\n  Mr. Cornell enjoyed golf and travel. His wife, Cleo, preceded him in \ndeath. He is survived by a son, Stephen Cornell, Seattle; a daughter, \nCynthia Wildfong, Castle Rock, CO; and three grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7618-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7618-S7619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE SIOUX FALLS VA MEDICAL AND REGIONAL OFFICE CENTER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Vincent Crawford and his staff at the VA \nMedical and Regional\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\nOffice Center [VAMROC] in Sioux Falls on receiving the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans' 1997 Large Employer of the Year Award. This award is \na testament to VAMROC's continuing efforts to hire disabled veterans, \nand I am honored that VAMROC's work was recognized by DAV.\n  This national award is presented annually by the DAV to a business \nwith more than 200 employees who assertively hire disabled veterans. \nThe center's Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Division provides \nveterans with valuable work experience and training positions, which \nopens up new employment opportunities within South Dakota's VA medical \ncenters, and with the private sector. The per capita rate of veterans \nplaced in employment by the VAMROC's Vocational Rehabilitation and \nCounseling Division leads the Veterans Benefits Administration Regional \nOffices in this category.\n  The VAMROC works in conjunction with the local union representing its \nemployees to ensure that disabled veterans will receive consideration \nfor job openings at VAMROC. Recent veterans employment statistics show \nthat of VAMROC's 704 employees, 219 were veterans for a 31-percent \nemployment rate. Of these 219 veterans, 60 were disabled veterans and \n163 were Vietnam era veterans.\n  Mr. President, I always have felt that veterans in South Dakota are \nextremely fortunate to have such high quality facilities, doctors, \nstaff, and administrators at our VA hospitals that provide care second \nto none. VAMROC certainly exemplifies this commitment to our veterans. \nOur veterans made a commitment to their Nation, trusting that when they \nneeded help, the Nation would honor that commitment. VAMROC's \nleadership and dedication is an example of how our Nation can best \nserve the needs of our veterans. Again, I congratulate Director \nCrawford and his staff at VAMROC on receiving this award of \naccomplishment, and I thank them for their continued service to South \nDakota's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7618-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF CHARLES ROBERT ``BOB'' LOCK\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the European \nUnion for its decision yesterday to begin membership talks with six \ncountries, five of them in Central and Eastern Europe.\n  Mr. President, as anyone who has followed my numerous statements on \nNATO enlargement knows, I have frequently criticized the European Union \nfor not moving speedily enough toward its own stated goal of \nenlargement. The EU's announcement that it will begin talks early next \nyear with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and \nSlovenia is welcome for several reasons.\n  First of all, it recognizes that these are the countries that have \nalready made the most progress in meeting the EU's demanding economic \nand political qualifications. Five other prospective candidates--\nBulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia--now realize that \nthey have more work to do.\n  Second, the naming of five Central and East European countries for \nthe next round of EU enlargement in itself will add to the emerging \nEuropean security architecture, along with the other web of ties \nconnected with EU membership.\n  Third, the naming of Cyprus to the list of prime candidates for EU \nmembership should help to move the parties on that island to a final, \nequitable solution that eliminates the division of the country, which \nhas persisted for twenty-three years.\n  I do not underestimate the complexity of accession negotiations as \nthe European Union concurrently moves toward ``an ever closer union.'' \nNonetheless, I hope that the talks with the six prime candidates will \nmove speedily so that they can join the European Union before the end \nof this century.\n  Again, I congratulate the European Union on the step it has \ntaken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7619-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7619-S7620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SITUATION IN BOSNIA\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the present \nsituation in Bosnia, the small Balkan country which is the scene of a \nmilitary commitment involving thousands of American military personnel, \na significant slice of our military forces, and the logistics and \nintelligence which support them.\n  Our military led the way into Bosnia as the NATO alliance took on the \nrole of overseeing the security aspects of the Dayton accords. Our \nsoldiers and other NATO forces have prevented a recurrence of war and \nthey have provided a security umbrella beneath which Bosnian refugees \ncould have returned to their homes and Bosnia could have resumed normal \nlife--if the leaders of the Bosnian factions had permitted it. \nUnfortunately, these leaders retain office and retain their access to \npublic money through policies of ethnic division and hostility, not \npolicies of reconciliation. Consequently there has been little progress \nin achieving the political goals of the Dayton accords.\n  The restoration of Bosnia's economic infrastructure is similarly \nhobbled, partly because some of the factional leaders prefer the graft \ninherent in government monopolies to the prosperity that comes from \nopen competition. Another reason is the weakness of the civil component \nof the international effort to implement Dayton. The diplomats from \nEuropean Union and NATO countries who are charged with civil \nimplementation have been doing their best, but they lack the authority, \nthe resources, and the planning ability which characterize their NATO \nmilitary counterparts. The international response to Bosnia is somewhat \nlike a human body which is strong and vibrant on one side, the military \nside, and weak and withered on the other, civilian, side. This \nimbalance threatens the success of our military deployment because the \ncivil tasks are the tasks which will bring lasting peace to Bosnia. The \neconomic infrastructure must be restored. Local sectarian barriers must \nfall and people and trade must move freely throughout the country and \nacross its borders. The rule of law must replace the rule of local \nbosses and the police must become impartial instruments of the law. \nForeign investment, integration with Europe, and the eventual \nprosperity which is needed to undergird peace will not occur unless \nthese civil tasks are accomplished. Because these tasks are so \nessential to a successful outcome in Bosnia, our soldiers there will \nsome day be measuring the value of their Bosnia service medals based on \nhow well the civilian component of the effort did its job.\n  A precondition for democracy in any country is justice: the ability \nfor any citizen to get justice from his or her institutions, and the \nability of those institutions to provide justice when crimes are \ncommitted. This precondition is lacking in Bosnia. Furthermore, the \nvery concept of justice is daily mocked by the presence in Bosnia of \nindividuals who have been indicted for war crimes by the Hague \nTribunal. Until these individuals are tried by the Tribunal, until the \npeople of Bosnia see that the world takes seriously what happened to \nthem and is committed to doing justice, the Bosnians of all ethnic \ngroups have no reason to hope for a better future. If the crimes that \noccurred during the Bosnian civil war are not publicly brought to \nclosure, if the criminals can just wait out the world's outrage, then \nthere is no reason for the average Bosnian to have any hope in a \ndemocratic future.\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is because justice for war crimes is so important \nthat I am particularly pleased at recent news reports that NATO is now \nacting to capture persons in Bosnia who have been indicted for war \ncrimes. The recent raid conducted by British troops to capture a \nsuspected war criminal who was subsequently transported to the Hague \nshould give hope to ordinary Bosnians that justice will be done and \narmed thugs will not continue to dominate their local affairs. I \napplaud the bravery of the British troops in this raid and I urge \nadditional raids by the NATO forces in Bosnia to accomplish this \nessential and unfinished part of our collective duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7619-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to make a very brief \nstatement about an action taken earlier this day when I was unable to \ncomment--the adoption of the Smith amendment as it had to do with \nreligious liberty in Russia.\n  I know everyone talked about the importance of religious freedom and \nindependent religious liberty, and how important it is for that value \nto be established in Russia. And I do not want to repeat those \narguments. There is just one point I think that needs to be made here.\n  The psychologists have a term ``xenophobia'' which they use to \ndescribe those who have a fear of strangers, or a fear of anything \nforeign. As we look at the long and troubled history of Russia, and \nthen the Soviet Union, we see that one of the driving forces in that \nculture has been xenophobia--terrible fear under the czars of any kind \nof Western influence somehow creeping into Russia; terrible fear under \nthe commissars, or Communist dictators from Lenin and Stalin all the \nway down through Khrushchev and Brezhnev of anything that they \nconsidered to be foreign. It was one of the major problems of the \nSoviet Union and one of the major difficulties that they had in \nbecoming an accepted part of the world family of nations.\n  We all rejoiced when the Berlin wall came down, when in the spirit of \nglasnost--or openness--Mr. Gorbachev led the Soviet Union into an \natmosphere of much less xenophobia.\n  The thing that distresses me the most is the piece of legislation \nthat passed the Russian Parliament, and that is now sitting on \nPresident Yeltsin's desk, is that it is a clear return to the days of \nxenophobia--fear of anything from outside.\n  Yes. Religious liberty is important. Yes. I voted for the Smith \namendment to establish the importance of religious liberty. But I voted \nfor the Smith amendment even more firmly because I believe the Russian \npeople must be told in as firm a fashion as possible that if they \nreturned to the days of the darkest period of the czars, if they \nreturned to the days of the darkest period of the Soviet Union with an \nunfounded and irresponsible fear of anything that comes from beyond \ntheir borders, they will be taking a most serious downward turn in the \nculture and future of their Republic.\n  So in that, Mr. President, I cast my vote in favor of the Smith \namendment hoping to send that message to the people of Russia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7620-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MFN STATUS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be voting on Senator \nHutchinson's amendment with regard to most-favored-nation status with \nChina.\n  I intend tomorrow to vote for the amendment offered by my friend from \nArkansas, Senator Hutchinson. I would like to emphasize, however, first \nand foremost, that this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is not \nbinding. It does not in any way alter or reverse the President's \ndecision to extend most-favored-nation trading status with China. As we \nall know, the House of Representatives already has voted against a \nresolution revoking China's MFN status.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment is more a chance to make a \nstatement--frankly, for me, a chance to express my frustration with \ncertain activities taken by the Chinese Government.\n  Let there be no misunderstanding. I believe that China needs to \nreassess its actions in a number of areas because I believe Congress--\ncertainly this Senator--is losing patience.\n  Let me be a bit more specific. I am very concerned first about \nChina's weapons proliferation activities particularly in the Middle \nEast. In the past 2 years, it has been reported in the media that China \nhas supplied Pakistan with key components to develop its own nuclear \nweapons program as well as ballistic missiles to deliver such weapons. \nChina also has been the source for Iran's growing cruise missile \ncapability, which poses a clear threat to our military personnel and \ncommercial shippers in the Persian Gulf.\n  Further, I am concerned about Chinese state-owned companies knowingly \nsupplying assault weapons to criminal gangs in California. \nRepresentatives of these companies were arrested in a sting operation \njust last year and are now awaiting trial in California. I am very \nconcerned about repeated human rights violations throughout China as \nwell as religious persecution and religious repression.\n  I am very concerned about the hideous practices of forced abortions \nand sterilization in China. I am concerned about the possible reversal \nof various political liberties such as free speech and assembly in Hong \nKong.\n  These are all very serious issues, and I believe that we need to take \naction to try to address each one. My vote tomorrow in favor of this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution will be an expression of these concerns. \nHowever, I believe there are far more effective ways to demonstrate our \ncommitment to these issues than just the sense of the Senate before us. \nI suggest if we truly want to address all these issues constructively, \nwe should bring before the Senate legislation that is targeted for its \nclear solutions.\n  For example, the Senate recently passed legislation offered by my \ncolleague who just spoke a moment ago, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Bennett, which calls on our President to enforce our Nation's \nnonproliferation laws against China for its efforts to supply Iran with \ncruise missiles. I was a cosponsor of this legislation, which, by the \nway, passed the Senate unanimously.\n  We can do more. We could and we should bring before the Senate the \nlegislation that was introduced by my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, legislation which would impose penalties on countries \nguilty of supporting or tolerating religious persecution, and I am a \nproud cosponsor of this bill.\n  We should bring before the Senate the legislation introduced by the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, which would impose targeted \nsanctions against China in cases of religious persecution and against \nChinese companies for illegal weapons transfers into the United States.\n  This bill would also increase United States support for human rights \nand democracy-building initiatives in China, including Radio Free Asia \nand the National Endowment for Democracy. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this legislation as well.\n  If we truly want to take strong, constructive action in regard to \nChina, the options are clearly before us. The sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution before us is not the best way to address all of the issues \nof concern we have with China, but it is, I believe, helpful to send a \nsignal to the Government of China that the people of the United States \nare genuinely concerned about the direction China has taken in a number \nof areas. Again, it is just a signal. But we should use the opportunity \nto make this signal strong and very clear.\n  I believe, as I have stated, that we can do much more, more that is \nconstructive and more that I believe can make a real and positive \ndifference for the people of China. I hope in the weeks and months \nahead we will take these actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/16/senate-section/article/S7620-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7620-S7621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 17, 1997\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.
