Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with the \nhandling of United States foreign policy on the eve of President \nClinton's second summit with the People's Republic of China. American \nforeign policy should promote freedom, democracy, respect for human \ndignity, and the rule of law. It is hard for me to imagine that the \nPresident would reward inappropriate actions by the Chinese Communist \nParty leaders while simultaneously sanctioning the democratic leaders \nin India.\n  Over India's 50-year history, U.S. relations have been hot and cold. \nBut we cannot deny the reality that today, India is the largest \ndemocracy in the world. India recently held the largest democratic \nelections in the history of the world. And democracy is more than just \na word. We have a common bond with the Indian people based upon a \ncommitment to democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. They are a \npeople who have struggled for freedom from a colonial power in order to \ngain independence. We share that struggle in our histories.\n  India has many friends in the United States, and many Americans \nproudly claim Indian heritage. But our relationship with India has been \nneglected, and unfortunately, we find ourselves in a difficult bind. \nDue to India's recent decision to detonate nuclear devices on May 11 \nand May 13, we have instituted sanctions. I deeply regret the \ncircumstances regarding India's decision to detonate nuclear devices. \nBut the increased instability has been caused by China's proliferation \npolicies, a U.S. foreign policy which favors China over India, and the \nlicensing of technologies by the United States which enhances China's \nmilitary capabilities.\n  Let me review some of the facts.\n  India has broken no international laws or agreements by choosing to \ntest nuclear devices.\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\n  India is not a known proliferator of weapons or weapons technology.\n  India's 50-year history demonstrates peaceful intent exercised within \na democratic society.\n  India has been a nuclear power since it conducted its first nuclear \ntests in 1974; this status did not change with last month's tests.\n  Although not at war, India's borders are considered ``hot spots'' for \nseveral reasons.\n  Since independence in 1947, India and Pakistan have been disputing \nborders.\n  Also since independence, India has understood the importance of good \nrelations with China for its own security.\n  Relations were clouded by China's occupation in 1950 of Tibet, which \nhad been independent until then and served as a stable buffer between \nthe two countries. This occupation brought Chinese expansion to India's \nborder.\n  India sought renewed cooperative relations on the basis of a policy \nthat recognized Tibet's genuine autonomy under Chinese sovereignty in \norder to maintain a buffer between India and China.\n  Relations completely changed, however, following China's military \nbuild-up in Tibet beginning in 1956 and 1957. During this period, China \nbegan the systematic oppression of Tibetan religion and culture, \nforcing the mass migration of Tibetans. The Dalai Lama and thousands of \nTibetans were given refuge in India in 1959. After forty years, the \nTibetan oppression continues, the military occupation of Tibet \ncontinues, and nearly 200,000 Tibetans remain in India.\n  Between 1957 and 1962, India's relations with China were marred by \nBeijing's huge territorial claims amounting to 50,000 square miles, and \nits illegal use of force to occupy 15,000 square miles of that claimed \narea.\n  Indian attempts to reach a border settlement through negotiations \nwith China failed in 1961, and its attempts to prevent further Chinese \nencroachment into Indian territory was met by a massive Chinese \ninvasion in 1962.\n  To this day, China continues to occupy 15,000 square miles of Indian \nterritory in Ladakh and it claims sovereignty over the entire 35,000 \nsquare miles of India's Northeastern most province [Arunachal Pradesh]. \nThis source of tension and deep concern has not been removed despite \nseveral rounds of Sino-Indian diplomatic negotiations to resolve the \nborder dispute since 1981.\n  China conducted its first nuclear test in October 1964, within 2 \nyears of the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War. In 1966, China tested its \nfirst medium range ballistic missile, and tested again in 1970.\n  India decided to develop its nuclear weapons program in 1970. It \nconducted its first tests, declaring its capability to the world, in \n1974.\n  India did not join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty--known as the \n``NPT''--in 1968 because the treaty sought to ensure an arms control \nsystem that would allow the five powers alone--China, France, the \nUnited Kingdom, Russia, and the United States--to possess nuclear \nweapons. That meant that China, the internally oppressive and \nundemocratic occupying force on India's border, would be permitted to \nhave nuclear weapons while India, fearful and insecure, would be denied \nany recourse to such weapons.\n  India has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because the \ntreaty seeks to prevent India from conducting further tests without \nlimiting China's ability to do the same. Like the NPT, India refuses to \njoin this treaty as a nonnuclear power unless China and the other \npowers agree to disarm.\n  Between 1974 and 1998, India experienced sanctions by the United \nStates on nuclear energy, space, computer, and other technologies.\n  Following India's first nuclear tests in 1974, it did not conduct \nfurther tests, until now.\n  India has not been a proliferator of nuclear weapons and missiles but \nChina, a nuclear power, has proliferated.\n  Some estimates indicate 90 percent of China's weapons sales go to \nstates which border India. Of particular concern is Chinese \nproliferation of such weapons and technologies to Pakistan.\n  Between 1974 and 1998, India has tried to break through the \ndifficulties with China and Pakistan. India had not conducted any \nfurther tests, even though China had. India had not illegally \nproliferated weapons--China had. But India has been denied the same \nnuclear and technical cooperation which we have accorded to the PRC.\n  India's commercial electricity needs are among the largest in the \nworld, similar to China's. We have recently signed a nuclear \ncooperation agreement with the PRC, but maintain restrictions on \nnuclear power agreements with India.\n  India's testing in 1974 and in 1998, again, violated no agreements. \nNorth Korea expelled international inspectors in 1993, in direct \nviolation of the NPT. We ``rewarded'' the brutal dictatorship in North \nKorea with a classic appeasement plan--free fuel oil and $4 billion \nworth of the top of the line nuclear reactors in exchange for their \npromises to do what they didn't do under an internationally binding \nagreement.\n  China may be too preoccupied today to directly threaten India, but \nthey need only employ Pakistan as a surrogate belligerent to jeopardize \nIndia's security.\n  Mr. President, the United States is helping the largest single-party \nauthoritarian government in the world suppress the development of the \nlargest democracy in the world. I submit that China's behavior against \nstudents on Tiananmen Square, resistance to freedom and democratic \nreforms, abysmal human rights record, and dangerous and irresponsible \nproliferation activities deserve America's scorn more than India's \nlegal actions taken in defense of its own national interests. There is \nsomething inherently wrong with sanctioning a democracy legally acting \nin its perceived national interests while rewarding a single party \ncommunist state which threatens regional security in violation of \ninternational law.\n  India watched carefully as the United States has led the world in a \npolicy of engagement with China. From the U.S.-China relationship, \nIndia has learned some important lessons. First, look at the rationale \nthe U.S. gives for its policy toward China. We must ``engage'' with \nChina because it is the most populous country, an enormous potential \nmarket, a major trading nation, a member of the permanent five at the \nUnited Nations Security Council, and China is a nuclear power with a \nmodernizing military. With these qualifications China has been able to \nget top priority and attention from U.S. Government and business \nleaders. In spite of posing a potential threat to the United States and \nbeing among the world's worst human rights violators, China gets the \nperks of enormously favorable trade and investment flows and top level \ndiplomatic treatment, including presidential visits, while India gets \nsanctioned. This makes no sense--it is strange--and it's just wrong.\n  The United States largely overlooks India despite its 950 million \npeople, its democratic government, and the largest middle class in the \nworld. Demographers predict that India's population will surpass that \nof China sometime during the next century. Thus, the only attribute \nIndia lacks when compared with its sometimes-aggressive neighbor, in \nthis administration's definition of importance, is acceptance into the \n``nuclear club.'' The message sent by the Clinton foreign policy team \nhas encouraged India to conclude the most effective way to ensure its \ninterests are protected from an increasingly powerful Asian superpower, \nand garner greater diplomatic and commercial attention from the West, \nis to remind the world of its nuclear deterrent capability.\n  What lessons are we to learn? First, the United States should be more \ncautious with our definition of ``engagement.'' By overlooking China's \nproliferation activities--not imposing sanctions when required by law--\nwe are rewarding the wrong behavior. Second, understanding that India \nconsidered its security environment to be precarious enough to risk \nglobal condemnation and economic sanctions, the U.S. should take a \ncloser look to assess whether India's fears and actions were justified. \nAnd finally, we must base our foreign policies upon the principles of \nfreedom, democracy, respect for human dignity, and the rule of law. We \nmust look to our friends first in this endeavor, and work together to \n``engage'' those who would oppose freedom in the world. India, along \nwith Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and other Asian democracies should \nform the foundation\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\nfrom which our engagement in Asia begins. Working with the democracies \nof the world, we should engage China and bring the 1.2 billion Chinese \npeople into the community of free nations.\n  A foreign policy devoid of principle has led us to the point where we \nare rewarding dictators and punishing democracies. The President's \nvisit to China this month represents another opportunity to define the \nUnited States' role in the world. The President must clearly articulate \nwhich behavior deserves praise, and which does not. He must demonstrate \nstrong leadership on behalf of the American people. We must all \nunderstand, the behavior which the United States rewards is likely to \nbe the behavior we will see more of in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 8 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6357-7", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6359-S6361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE TOBACCO BILL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just say a few words about the \ntobacco bill which we have been on here for a couple, 3 weeks now in \nthe Senate.\n  In my opinion, this tobacco bill is a historic piece of legislation. \nAnd I have complimented personally the Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, for his leadership in the Commerce Committee and here on the \nSenate floor in bringing this bill here and pushing for its enactment. \nI believe very strongly that when historians look back on the 105th \nCongress and ask, What did the 105th Congress accomplish? if we are \nable to pass tobacco legislation, significant tobacco legislation, that \nwill be the single item they will point to as a substantial and major \naccomplishment by this Congress. So the time we are spending on this \ntobacco bill is time well spent.\n  I firmly believe that since I have been here in the Senate--and I \nhave been here now nearly 16 years--during that time there has been a \ndramatic change in public opinion on the issue of smoking and tobacco \nuse in this country, particularly on the issue of young people \nbeginning to smoke.\n  What I see this legislation as is an effort to bring our public \npolicy into line with our public opinion, because public opinion has \nchanged dramatically. Our public policy has not changed to the same \nextent, and we need to get on with the business of changing public \npolicy to mirror and reflect what the American people want to see done. \nThat is why the legislation is so important.\n  We have spent many hours discussing this legislation. We have had \nseveral amendments offered and debated, and several adopted. I think \nall of that is to the good. And I think anyone who has watched the \nSenate operate for any period of time would have to acknowledge that, \nalthough we have spent substantial time on the tobacco bill, so far we \nhave not seen a concerted effort by the leadership to bring this issue \nto a close, to bring the debate to a close, to get a defined list of \namendments that need to be concluded before we can finish the bill and \nmove on to another item.\n  So, clearly, that is our agenda for this week. I believe very \nstrongly we can finish this bill this week, or certainly if not this \nweek, we can finish it next week. We owe it to the American people to \ndo that.\n  I know there are others in the Senate who have different opinions on \nthat. We have heard a lot of public statements over the recent weeks \nand months about how this bill is dead and how the bill is dead on \narrival. And I have thought, if I had a dollar for every statement that \nhas been uttered about how this bill is dead, I would be a rich man \ntoday. Mark Twain was famous for his statement that the news reports of \nhis demise were exaggerated. And I think that the news reports about \nthis bill being dead are exaggerated as well.\n  I think there is ample support here in the Senate to pass this bill. \nThere is ample support in this Senate to pass a strong bill, to send it \nto conference, and I hope that there is support in the House of \nRepresentatives to do the same thing. Time will tell whether that turns \nout to be the case.\n  So I believe very strongly we need to go ahead and get a cloture \nmotion filed again. I hope Senator McCain, the lead sponsor of the \nbill, will take that initiative. I think we need to get a defined list \nof amendments that still need consideration once that cloture motion is \ncompleted, and then we need to go ahead and conclude action on the \nbill.\n\n  I believe the best thing we can do for the American people before the \nFourth of July break--and the Fourth of July break will begin the \nFriday after this Friday--the most important thing we can do for the \nAmerican people is, prior to that date, going ahead and passing this \nhistoric legislation and sending it to conference.\n  I urge the majority leader to use the power of his position, which is \nsubstantial, to move the bill forward. I compliment all my colleagues \nwho have voted for cloture in the previous efforts to bring closure to \nthe debate and to get a limited list of amendments for further \nconsideration. But I urge everyone, this week, to vote for cloture. I \nhope we can get that done. I hope we can pass a bill with a strong \nbipartisan vote and send it to conference. I think the American people \nwill thank us for that action, and we owe that to them.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico would yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico makes a point \nthat I feel strongly about. If we don't finish this product now, if we \ndon't get a tobacco bill completed in the Senate, in my judgment, we \nprobably will never get it done.\n  We have come a long, long ways. We are, I think, close. I don't think \nthere is any question but if the tobacco bill were voted on by the full \nSenate, it would pass. I don't think there is much question about that.\n  There are some in the Senate, however, who are intent on trying to \nkill the legislation. So we have been tied up here in legislative \nknots, going through some amendments, but going through a process that \nhas led some to conclude that maybe this bill ought to get pulled, \nmaybe we ought to go to something else.\n  I ask the Senator from New Mexico, as it was stated this weekend by \nthe majority leader that perhaps we have to move to some other \nlegislation, is it the belief of the Senator from New Mexico that if we \ndon't get this bill completed now, it is likely we will never get this \npiece of legislation?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I respond to the question by just saying \nI believe we have this week and we have next week. There is no more \nimportant activity we can commit that time to than completing action on \nthis bill. I think the momentum for moving ahead on the bill will be \nlost if we don't get it done before we break for the Fourth of July \nrecess.\n  Clearly, the notion of giving up on this and moving to another piece \nof legislation--I don't know of any other piece of legislation that is \nso urgent or so important that it would justify going off of this bill. \nI am not aware of anything on the Senate's schedule that would justify \nthat action.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further, I \npoint out that I, and I think a number of others in this Chamber, would \nresist strongly an attempt to move to some other piece of legislation. \nThat would require a motion to proceed, which obviously some of us \nwould resist strenuously. We think it is important to finish this bill.\n  I think that some have missed the point. You go through this process \nand have a debate. Some have missed the point. The point here is about \ntrying to prevent children from smoking in this country and trying to \nprevent the tobacco industry from targeting kids with their tobacco \nproducts. That is not rocket science. We can do that.\n\n  The piece of legislation that is before the Senate is a good piece of \nlegislation which has a series of things in it which are very \nimportant--smoking cessation programs, counteradvertising programs, \nprohibitions against advertising in ways that will target children, \ngetting rid of vending machines in areas where children have access to\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\ncigarettes--a whole series of things that try to make certain that in \nthe future we will not have the tobacco industry able to target kids to \naddict them to cigarettes.\n  We know every day 3,000 kids start smoking in this country. We know \n1,000 of those 3,000 will die. We know 300,000 to 400,000 people in \nthis country die every year from smoking and smoking-related causes. We \nalso know that smoking cigarettes and the use of tobacco products is \nlegal for adults and will always remain legal. No one is suggesting \nthat it be illegal. But we are saying with this piece of legislation \nthat we ought not have a tobacco industry get its new customers from \nteenagers.\n  I read yesterday and the day before a whole series of statements we \nhave now unearthed from the bowels of the tobacco companies which \ndemonstrate that they understood that their customers are teenagers, \ntheir future customers come from teenagers. If you don't get them when \nthey are young, you don't get them. The industry's own documents \nsuggest that--that if you don't get them when they are kids, almost \nnever will they reach age 30 and try to evaluate, What am I missing \nfrom life? come up with the idea they are missing smoking, and go out \nand start getting addicted to cigarettes. That almost never happens.\n  I say to the Senator from New Mexico, and I ask him this question, it \nseems to me we have kind of lost our way here on this bill as it has \nbeen on the floor of the Senate for some weeks now. It seems to me that \nwe have, through amendments, gone zigzagging across the landscape here \nand forgotten what the central premise of this piece of legislation is; \nthat the central premise, is it not, is to try to make certain that we \nare not having an industry targeting our kids to smoke, and also \nproviding a whole series of steps--smoking cessation programs, \ninvestment in health research, counteradvertising, and a range of other \nthings--to try to make sure that will not happen in the future; is that \nnot the case?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think that is clearly the case.\n  I think although there have been some far-reaching amendments added \nto the bill, the central core of the bill remains the same. It remains \nan effort to deal with the problem of young people beginning to smoke. \nAnd, of course, it is a public health issue.\n  That is the reason I believe this legislation is historic, because it \ngoes directly at dealing with the major public health issue that is \nbefore this country today and that can be dealt with. So, I think it is \nextremely important we move ahead.\n  I understand there are particular provisions of the bill and \nparticular provisions of some of the amendments that various Members \ndon't like, but it is almost ironic because you hear people come to the \nfloor and support amendments to the bill and then use the fact that \nthose amendments have been adopted as a reason for claiming that the \nbill is now so loaded down that we can't support the bill. To my mind, \nthe right course is for us to go ahead and pass the bill, consider \nremaining amendments, adopt those that have the votes there to adopt, \npass the bill in that form, get it to conference, and hopefully the \nHouse will do the same.\n  I believe that the same people who are urging me as a Senator to take \naction on this important public health issue are urging Congressmen \nfrom my State to take action on this important public health issue as \nwell. I hope that if we do the right thing before the Fourth of July \nbreak, the House will come back in July and do the right thing by \npassing a responsible bill and then we will be able to get a conference \nand get something that we can send to the President before we adjourn \nthis fall. That is what is important. We have a historic opportunity \nhere. I hope very much we will rise to the occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we started debate on this bill weeks and \nweeks ago here on the floor of the Senate. We started action on this \nbill months ago in the Commerce Committee. I think we may have \nforgotten that we started real action nearly a year ago. It was on June \n20 of last year that there was an agreement announced between the \nattorneys general and the tobacco industry. That was the basis that led \nCongress to act. We are talking 1 year. On June 20 of 1997, the \nattorneys general entered into an agreement with the tobacco industry.\n  Here we are, June 16 of 1998, and we still haven't acted. Now some \nare saying we shouldn't act. The majority leader said over the weekend \nthat he thought this bill was dead. Well, he has said that about every \nweek. About every week there is an announcement by the majority leader, \nthe bill is dead. He said that when it was still in the Commerce \nCommittee, yet it came out of the Commerce Committee on a 19-1 vote.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that this has been going on for \na year because that has special importance. We are talking about 3,000 \nyoung people who take up the habit every day--3,000. Over a year, that \nis over a million kids who have taken up the habit of smoking and the \nuse of tobacco products.\n  And we know that one-third of them will die prematurely as a result. \nThat is, over 300,000 children are going to die prematurely because \nthey have taken up the habit in the one year since the settlement \nbetween the attorneys general of the various States and the tobacco \nindustry. They entered into an agreement to fundamentally transform \npolicy toward tobacco in this country. And now the question is, Is \nCongress going to act, or are we going to have an enormous leadership \nfailure here in the U.S. Senate? That is the question.\n  I don't think anybody wants to have that kind of failure on their \nhands. The fact is, it is very interesting that when people have a \nchance to vote, things are much different than when they are just \ntalking with the newspapers. We have seen that over and over and over. \nIn the Budget Committee, in the Finance Committee, when people had a \nchance to vote, they did vote, and the outcome was often much different \nthan what was predicted.\n  Let's look at the bill before us. We are talking about seeing the \nprice increase $1.10 a pack over the next 5 years. Why is that \nimportant? Well, every single expert that has come and testified, every \nelement of the public health community has said that a significant \nprice increase is important in order to reduce youth smoking. That is \nnot the only part of reducing youth smoking, but it is an important \npart. Second, we voted on look-back provisions. Look-back provisions \nare the penalties to be imposed on the industry for the failure to \nreduce youth smoking in line with the goals provided for in the \nlegislation.\n  We made a significant change here on the floor of the Senate. Before, \nmost of the fee was going to be charged to the industry on an industry-\nwide basis. Some of us didn't think that made much sense, because what \nhappens when you do that is you put the good in with the bad. Those \ncompanies that have accomplished the goal pay the industry penalty just \nas those companies who have failed to reach the goal. What sense does \nthat make? That is not fair. Instead, we think most of the fee ought to \nbe placed on the companies which are the ones that failed to meet the \ngoal. They are the ones that ought to be held accountable, the ones \nthat ought to pay, and so that change was made here on the floor.\n  Third, we dealt with the question of liability. Out of the Commerce \nCommittee, just as in the proposed settlement, there was special \nprotection for this industry--protection never given any other industry \nin our history. The vast majority of us on the floor of the Senate \nsaid, no, that is not right; we should not be giving special protection \nto this industry. That is not appropriate. So that was changed.\n  There have been other significant changes on the floor of the Senate. \nA third of the revenue will now go for tax relief. Some of it is \ndesigned to relieve the marriage penalty. In addition, there will be \nother tax relief as well. So about a third of the revenue now goes for \ntax relief. Many of us thought it was appropriate to have some of the \nmoney go toward tax relief in this package, and now fully a third of it \ndoes.\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\n  In addition, there are provisions to deal with illegal drugs. That is \na matter that is now included in the legislation. Not only are we \ndealing with tobacco, tobacco products, but also illegal drugs. There \nare very strong provisions which have now been included in this \nlegislation that relate to that. There is also the question of FDA \nauthority. FDA has been given the authority to regulate this drug as \nthey regulate other drugs in our society.\n\n  We still have several matters left to resolve. One is the whole \nquestion of agriculture, how tobacco farmers will be treated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, has \n8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  We have important matters left to resolve. How are tobacco farmers \ngoing to be treated? What are we going to do about the question of \nattorneys' fees. Obviously, none of us wants to see attorneys unjustly \nenriched by these tobacco settlements. In the underlying bill, the \nMcCain bill, which came out of the Commerce Committee on a 19-1 vote, \nthey provided for arbitration. Many of us think that is the best way to \nresolve this matter--to have parties get together and resolve, on an \narbitration basis, differences over attorneys' fees so attorneys are \nnot unjustly enriched by these settlements.\n  Mr. President, most important is that I think we ought to stay on \nthis bill until it is finished. We have spent 3 weeks of the Senate's \ntime so far on this legislation. Let's finish the course. Let's get \nthis bill resolved. I think that makes sense. I think it would be an \nenormous leadership failure if this Senate didn't take final action on \nthis legislation. Some are saying the House isn't going to have a bill. \nWell, none of us can tell that until we act. We have taken a lead on \nthis question in the U.S. Senate; we ought to complete our action and \nthen let the House decide what it does. Let them be accountable for \ntheir action--or their failure to act.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will stay on this bill until we finish this \nbill. That ought to be our message. The reason is very important. We \nhave delay, and this delay is costing people's lives. As I indicated, \nwe are in a circumstance in which, since the industry entered into a \nsettlement with the attorneys general nearly 1 year ago, 1 million kids \nhave taken up the habit. Fully a third of them are going to die \nprematurely--over 300,000 young people.\n  Let me just close by saying the tobacco companies tell you in their \npaid advertising--they describe this bill in unfavorable terms. Let's \nremember their background. They have misrepresented this issue \nrepeatedly.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from North Dakota, \nMr. Dorgan, is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take another minute or so of my \ntime. I know the Senator from Kansas wishes to seek the floor.\n  Virtually everything we do represents a series of choices. We have a \nchoice now here in the Senate; we can choose to succeed, or we can \nchoose to fail on this tobacco legislation. As Senator Conrad has \nindicated, we have come a long way, and we have had people all along \nthe way who are detractors. I can remember how controversial it was \njust to put a warning label on the side of a pack of cigarettes. Do you \nremember how controversial that was? It was the right thing to do, \nobviously. Would someone vote now to take the warning label off? I \ndon't think so.\n  The legislation before the Senate is very important. We as Senators \nand as a body can choose to succeed or fail. To those who want to \nchoose to fail and say this bill cannot become law, we are going to \npull the bill and go to something else, we simply want to say that some \nof us will resist that with great effort. We will resist every decision \nto move to other legislation before we complete work on this \nlegislation. We hope the bipartisan leadership of the Senate will \ndecide that this bill is important enough to finish, and it can be \nfinished, in my judgment, this week or next week. We have traveled too \nfar a distance on this to fail in the final week on a piece of \nlegislation this important to our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the State of Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6359-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6361-S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in his remarks in this body last Friday, \nour colleague from Nebraska, the distinguished Senator, Mr. Hagel, \nissued what I considered to be a most important wake-up call to this \nbody.\n  Senator Hagel said:\n\n       I am very concerned that this Congress is not paying enough \n     attention to what is going on around the world. I am \n     concerned that we are not linking it, we are not \n     interconnecting the dots. I find it remarkable that on the \n     floor of the U.S. Senate, over the last few weeks, we have \n     been consumed with billions of dollars of new taxes and \n     building a larger government when essentially half of the \n     world is burning.\n\n  And Senator Hagel went on to say:\n  ``I hope that our colleagues take a serious look at what is going on \naround the world,'' and he cited the ever worsening Asian economic \ncrisis--it now also threatens China; a serious recession in Japan; the \nimmense and growing economic problems in regard to Russia; the \nresulting loss of investor confidence in world markets; and a very \ndirect signal to all of us that ``something is wrong.'' That certainly \nhas been reflected in the recent decline in the stock market.\n  Mr. President, one thing that certainly is wrong is the inordinate \namount of time that we are spending on tobacco legislation. I think the \nmajority leader was certainly right when he said yesterday--and to a \ncertain extent I agree with my colleagues who have just spoken before \nme on the floor--that we need to either end debate, or pass the bill, \nor actually defeat the bill, or set the bill aside.\n  It is not my intent to discuss the merits of what has evolved out of \nthe tobacco briar-patch debate. I want to say that I personally \nsupport--strongly support--the efforts to address the problem of \nteenage smoking and addiction. I do not question the intent of \nsupporters of what has been produced so far. But I do believe the bill \nhas serious flaws and we have gone far afield from the original goal, \nmore especially in regard to the problem of teenage smoking and \naddiction. And I would say that as we each individually shine the light \nof truth into the darkness in debating the tobacco bill, let us \nremember that our flashlights are somewhat dimmed by partisan overtones \nand personal finger pointing.\n  If Nero fiddled while Rome burned, the Senate has certainly huffed \nand puffed for weeks on a tobacco bill--I am not trying to perjure it--\nwhile issues of national and economic security are not being addressed.\n  As we debated yet another tobacco amendment yesterday, warplanes from \nthe United States and Europe roared over the mountains of Albania and \nMacedonia, a direct threat to Serbian leaders to end the growing and \nexpanding violence around Kosovo.\n  Twenty-seven U.S. warplanes took part in the 6-hour exercise that was \ncalled Determined Falcon. I don't know how determined that Falcon is. \nThree hundred and fifty U.S. soldiers are already stationed in \nMacedonia. NATO commanders have been asked to propose additional \ncontingency operations.\n  The only response that I am aware of that has come from the Senate in \nregard to the growing possibility that we become directly involved in \nyet another ethnic civil war--an expansion of Bosnia--is the warning \ndelivered by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in \na recent briefing just last week.\n  The chairman pointed out that our military is already stretched, it \nis stressed, it is overcommitted, and we simply do not have the men and \nwomen and material to do that job. We have an urgent need to increase \nour commitment to national security.\n  We have an urgent need to act on the defense authorization bill so we \ncan do\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\nthat, and so we may discuss and debate and act on our involvement in \nBosnia, in the Gulf, and in Kosovo. Every single day that this \nstalemate on tobacco legislation continues, a pay raise is held up for \nAmerica's fighting men and women around the world who continue to \nsuffer from low morale and a lack of interest in reenlistment.\n  Mr. President, I have heard there could be some 90 amendments to the \ndefense authorization bill raising matters the Senate should address. \nWe have the potential nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, \nthe administration's nonproliferation policy, and the impact of ill-\nadvised sanctions. Sanctions? Sanctions? My word, as the Senator from \nNebraska pointed out in his remarks on Friday, we have sanctions on \nover 70 nations around the world involving two-thirds of the world's \npopulation. Our exports have declined. We have a growing crisis in \nagriculture, as referred to by the Senator from North Dakota, the \n``stealth crisis.'' It is no stealth. It is real. We must address that \nproblem.\n  As a result of sanctions, agriculture is going through a necessary \nhardship. And we have all sorts of problems in farm country--not only \nin the northern plains. We have disease, we have overproduction in \nother parts of the world, we have declining exports, we have unfair \ntrading practices, and we have a trade policy that is yet to be \ndetermined. We have a real problem in farm country.\n  We can address the sanctions bill in the agriculture appropriations \nbill, which is waiting in the tobacco wings. In that bill we have the \nsanctions reform legislation of Senator Lugar, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, more especially in \nregards to Pakistan and India, and key agricultural exports programs. \nWe need to act. We need to act, Mr. President.\n  From that standpoint, I would be happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska for any comments he would make. I thank him for \nissuing a wake-up call to the Senate as of last Friday.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Kansas.\n  Mr. President, Senator Roberts has touched upon some of the most \nimportant core issues in the debate that we have had over the last 4 \nweeks on the tobacco bill.\n  I would find it interesting again to recite what has really happened \nin the world since we began consideration of the tobacco bill on \nMonday, May 18th. This is our fourth week now on the debate on this \nbill.\n  What has happened in the course of the last 4 weeks is we have seen \nIndia and Pakistan test for nuclear explosions, we have seen a new wave \nof an Asian market crisis begin, we have seen Asian stocks plummet, we \nhave seen the Japanese yen drop precipitously, and leading now to \nChina's warnings that it may devaluate its currency. We have also found \nJapan officially entering a severe recession, the first since the early \n1970s.\n  As my distinguished colleague from Kansas referred to a few minutes \nago, Kosovo has erupted into flames with NATO exercises now fully \nengaged on the borders of Albania and Kosovo. There is a very real \npossibility of a war spreading further south into the Balkans, engaging \nMacedonia, Greece, and other nations.\n  Russia has entered a severe economic problem.\n  Our U.S. agricultural foreign markets are shrinking due to economic \nproblems.\n  Abroad U.S. exports are down.\n  And, as my friend from Kansas pointed out, we have a military that \nfor the 15th year in a row finds its budget dropping, all at the same \ntime that we are asking our military to do more with less--more \ndeployments, longer deployments.\n  Something, Mr. President, is going to have to give here.\n  But what has the Senate done? The Senate continues to talk about \nhigher taxes and more government and more regulation. We let all of \nthese other important issues that affect every American, our future, \nand the course of the world hang suspended like it is not there. We \nignore these issues. We ignore these issues at our peril and at the \nworld's peril.\n  This U.S. Senator is ready to say let's move the tobacco bill caucus \noff the track, and let's get to what is real in this country. Let's get \nto the real issues facing our Nation--not just the farmers and the \nranchers in Nebraska, and exporters all over the world, but our \nnational defense issues, our trade policy, the sanctions issues, and \nall of the other issues that we have talked about. That is what is \nreal.\n  That is what the greatest deliberative body in the world should be \ndealing with and talking about--not increasing taxes by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars and bringing to the American people more government \nand more regulation.\n  I again appreciate very much the thoughts and comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, and his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I shall not take all of the time.\n  I want to thank my distinguished friend and colleague for his \ncontribution. I want to pay particular credit to Senator Hagel for his \nwork in enabling the Senate to move on IMF legislation. The Senator \nworked extremely hard with leadership of the Congress on both sides to \nimplement serious reforms in the IMF bill, and to move ahead with the \nIMF bill. I hope the House of Representatives will simply address that \nlegislation.\n  The Senator mentioned the most-favored-nation status for China, which \nis simply regular trading status that is exceedingly important. I have \nalready indicated my concern about sanctions reform.\n  I think we ought to move on fast-track legislation. I was talking to \nthe majority leader yesterday and he agrees with that. There are going \nto be 12 major farm organizations and commodity groups coming to the \nHill to visit with us on Thursday. We would like to change the whole \nattitude and the whole situation in regard to trade.\n  It seems to me if we could really recommit to that, it would be most \nhelpful--especially in agriculture. Our whole economy relies on \nexports. I have never seen this Congress more insular, more \nprotectionist, and more consumed with legislation that tends to be \neither ideological or attempts to legislate morality. It is just as \nimportant to prevent bad legislation from passing as it is to enact \ngood legislation. And I am not trying to point any fingers at any \nMember who has strong feelings about tobacco legislation. I do. I have \nyoungsters who are teenagers, and I am concerned about this just as \nmuch as every Member of the Senate, but this has gone far afield from a \nbill to really direct itself at real answers to teenage smoking and \naddiction. And, in the meantime, we have these problems that are \nextremely serious.\n  And so I would simply quote again the majority leader who is not \ntrying to perjure the bill. He was right when he said, ``We must end \ndebate. Either pass, defeat, or set the bill aside.'' And let's move \nand get on with the business that directly affects the livelihood and \nthe pocketbook of virtually every American when things such as world \npeace are hanging in the balance.\n  Mr. HAGEL. If my colleague will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I would like to report on a comment made this morning by a \nsenior World Bank official warning of a looming global recession. He \nsays, ``We are probably at the end of the first cycle of a crisis and \nwe are entering into a deep recession. And you could even use the term \n`depression'.''\n  The point here is IMF funding and MFN status and fast track, all of \nthese combine together to be essential components of a trade policy, of \na foreign policy, of a national defense policy that directs this Nation \nand directs the world. We can't just pick and choose--maybe this, maybe \nnot this. But it has to be debated and viewed and acted on in total. So \nI appreciate again my colleague's comments on this, and I yield.\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. In closing, I am reminded of an old Mills Brothers' \ntune--that really dates me--and it was, ``I Don't Want to Set the World \non Fire.'' I want to make it clear, I don't want to set the tobacco \nbill on fire; I just want to light a flame in the heart of our national \nsecurity and our economic well-being. And with that rather dubious \nreference as to what we are about, Mr. President--we need to act on \nother matters--I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes remaining in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, then I will use some of that time. I thank \nthe Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6361-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE TOBACCO BILL\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I certainly want to echo the statements of \nmy colleagues from Kansas and Nebraska about the importance of dealing \nwith our agricultural situation in this country. Last week, in my State \nof Idaho, wheat hit $1.90 as a result of the impact of the sanctions \nthat are being imposed by this administration in reaction to laws that \nwere passed by Congress a good number of years ago.\n  I say this this morning to refocus us to understand that much of what \nwe need to do is not getting done. Now, my colleagues on the other \nside, I have a feeling, would like to spend a lot more time on the \ntobacco issue. Somehow they think they are gaining points in the \npolitical arena that is warming up out there for many of our colleagues \nin the coming days through to November. I would like to suggest they \nlook at the polling data of recent, that they talk with the American \npeople just a little bit, that they ask teenagers in this country where \nthe real problems are, and maybe they would agree with us that it is \ntime we deal in some degree of finality with S. 1415, the tobacco bill.\n  I know it is great politics, or at least many thought it was great \npolitics, to be antitobacco, anti-teen smoking, and to raise a heck of \na lot of money to do a lot of different things from the government \nlevel. It is important that this Congress be anti-teen smoking. It is \nimportant that we express our frustration and, if necessary, our anger \nwith the tobacco companies on what they have done, and I think we can \ndo that and should do that. But you do not do it by sucking the life \nout of lower-income Americans, raising taxes, shoving this commodity \nthat we dislike into the black market and saying you have solved the \nproblem by creating great new bureaucracies that we know will spend the \nmoney and get very little done.\n  For the moment, let's do a reality check. We have been debating this \nbill now for upwards of 3 weeks. We have been adding a lot of \namendments. Everybody has been pounding their chest on all of the good \nthings we are going to do if we pass the bill. Here are the good things \nwe have not done. Let me analyze for you the revenue flow over this \nmultibillion-dollar bill.\n  S. 1415, major revenues: 5 years, $55-plus billion; floor amendments \ncosting $35 billion; original 1415 spending, $65 billion; total \nspending commitments, $100 billion.\n  Whoops, Mr. President, whoops. We have already overspent $35 billion \nin the first 5 years. What does that tell you about a Congress that is \ntrying to be fiscally responsible and balance its budget? When it comes \nto feeding at the trough of American politics, we do not care, do we? \nOr at least somebody does not care, because S. 1415 is now badly out of \nline with the revenues it proposes and the moneys it plans to spend.\n  By this action, is this Senate proposing that we raise another $35 \nbillion or $40 billion over the next 5 years in revenues to fund all of \nthese great new government programs that are going to take all of our \nkids off smoking, or at least 35 or 45 or 55 or 60 percent over the \nnext decade? Have we talked to our kids recently about that? Have we \nasked teenage America that if we raise the price of a pack of \ncigarettes another $2 a pack or $3, are they going to quit smoking?\n  Well, I will tell you they don't think so. Neither do their parents. \nLast week, I was in the Chamber with a poll by the American Viewpoint \npolling group, a reputable group. You have read the poll. It has been \ntalked about in the national press. Fifty-nine percent of the parents \nrecognize that peer pressure and friends of their teenage sons and \ndaughters are those who are the greatest influence on them when it \ncomes to smoking.\n  Guess what the biggest problem is out there. It is not smoking. It is \ndrugs. It is the concern by our parents, the parents of America that \ntheir kids might somehow get associated with drugs. Why? Because drugs \nkill immediately. That is why. And that is the greatest concern. And \nyet we have stumbled down the road for 3 weeks and done one good thing: \nconvinced the American people that we are slipping back into our old, \nbad habits of big government and great programs and lots of new money \nto spend. And in the meantime, they have become convinced that the bill \nbefore us ought to be defeated by a great number. That is the reality \nof what we are doing.\n  Let me close by saying one more time, S. 1415 over the 5-year period \nhas a deficit in money now of $35 billion. Is the other side proposing \nto raise that in new taxes in some form from the working men and women \nof this country to fund the panacea of big, new government? I hope they \ndo not. I will not vote for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6363-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, last night, I spoke about the Texas/\nMaine/Vermont Compact bill, H.R. 629, that is now going to conference \ncommittee. It has to do with low-level radioactive waste being dumped \nin the community of Sierra Blanca, TX. It is a compact between Maine \nand Vermont that affects the people of Sierra Blanca.\n  Last night, we sent instructions to conferees to insist on two \namendments that had been agreed upon by the Senate. One amendment says \nthat if the people of Sierra Blanca, disproportionately poor and \nLatino, are able to prove disparate impact--that they are \ndisproportionately affected, that they have been targeted because of \nlow income, because they are a poor community, because of the color of \ntheir skin--then they have every right to challenge the dump. I don't \nknow why we don't at least give people that chance. That amendment has \nnow been approved by the Senate. It is terribly important, because all \ntoo often when it comes to the location of these sites, we dump them--\nno pun intended--right on the heads of poor people and communities of \ncolor.\n  The second amendment--and I had a chance to speak about this last \nnight--I call a protection clause. It is very similar to the amendment \noffered by Congressman Doggett which passed in the House. Basically, it \nsays that if the compact waste is only supposed to come from Maine and \nVermont, then let's affirm this with an amendment which makes it clear \nthat the waste will only come from Maine and Vermont. Otherwise, there \nis a very good chance that the people of Hudspeth County and Sierra \nBlanca will become a national depository for nuclear waste from all \nover the country. That is the last thing I think the people in Texas\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\nwant. That is certainly the last thing that the people in the community \nof Sierra Blanca want.\n  The reason I mention both of these amendments is that we now have \ninstructions to our conferees to insist on these amendments in \nconference committee. This is a battle that has been going on for over \na year in the Senate. I raised questions about this starting a year \nago. What I said was that, as a Senator from Minnesota, I am concerned \nabout this issue of environmental injustice and, if we have to approve \nthis compact, let us make sure there is some fairness to this and some \njustice to it.\n  My colleagues in the Senate have gone on record in favor of both of \nthese amendments. The House of Representatives has gone on record as \nbeing in favor of the Doggett amendment, which is also a Wellstone \namendment, that says, indeed, the waste will only come from Maine and \nVermont.\n  As we go to conference, I want to emphasize one point to my \ncolleagues, and that is, don't strip these amendments from this bill in \nconference committee. That is what the nuclear utilities would like \nconferees to do, but it will make a mockery of the House and Senate. It \nwill, in fact, give people not only in Texas but from around the \ncountry reason to think this is another example of a back-room deal, \nanother example of the legislative process at its worst, another \nexample of big utility companies riding roughshod over poor communities \nand, for that matter, regular citizens in this country.\n  I want to make it clear to colleagues that it is extremely important \nthat the conferees live up to our instructions and that these \namendments become part of this bill. If they do not, it will be a \nstriking example of unequal access to political power, which is, I \nthink, the reason we have too much environmental discrimination all \nacross the country in the first place.\n  I make this plea to my colleagues, to the conferees: We have voted to \nkeep these amendments in this bill. The Senate is on record unanimously \nas saying that these amendments should be part of this compact and \ntherefore it is extremely important that these amendments not be \nstripped out. The issue of environmental justice deserves better than \nthat, the people of Sierra Blanca deserve better than that, and people \nin our country have a right to expect a higher standard of conduct from \ntheir elected representatives than to try to knock this out in the dark \nof night.\n  I say to colleagues, I have tried to work with my colleagues, even \nthose who are in disagreement with me. But if these amendments are \ntaken out of the conference committee--and I hope that they will not \nbe, I pray that they will not be--but if they are, I will take \nadvantage of every procedural means at my disposal to make sure that \nthis does not happen, and to make sure that there is some environmental \njustice when it comes to this compact which all of us are going to have \nto vote on as Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington for letting me have an \nopportunity to speak from the floor to give colleagues a sense of where \nwe are on this compact. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6363-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6364-S6372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 2705 by \nthe Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this will mark the third occasion on which the Senate \nhas debated a limitation on attorneys' fees in connection with the \nlitigation that led to this debate on tobacco legislation. As a \nconsequence, I do not believe this debate need last for as extended a \nperiod of time as did those on the earlier Faircloth amendments, and I \nbelieve the leadership is attempting to reach a time agreement on this \namendment, with a vote to take place perhaps right after the official \nSenate photograph early this afternoon. On the other hand, I do not \nhave any official notification about a formal time agreement, but I \nwill proceed on the basis that this Gorton amendment can be debated \nrelatively expeditiously.\n  I have examined the debate on the last amendment on attorneys' fees \nthat took place on June 11, less than a week ago, and I believe that \nthe rationale for passing legislation with some limits on attorneys' \nfees in connection with this litigation was so well stated by the \nSenator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, and by the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, and by others that I do not need to repeat \nin detail their scholarly approach and analyses of the subject.\n  Mr. President, you may say, agreeing with their rationale, why is it \nthat this Senator voted against both the first and the second Faircloth \namendments? The answer to that is simple. I believe that it is \nappropriate for the Congress to limit attorneys' fees in connection \nwith this litigation for reasons that I will outline briefly in the \ncourse of these comments. At the same time, I did not believe that the \nparticular limitations contained in the two earlier Faircloth \namendments were fair or just. So, with some regret but with firmness, I \nvoted to table each of those amendments.\n  The fundamental reason for my opposition to those two amendments was \nthe fact that they treated all attorneys in all tobacco cases as being \nsubject to the same cap or the same limitation. Whether that litigation \nand those attorneys were involved from the very beginning with the \nStates of Mississippi and Minnesota, at a time at which tobacco \ncompanies had not lost any litigation at all, when those initial \nattorneys came up with what were novel and difficult theories of law \nand took a tremendous risk in the litigation in which they were hired, \nthose attorneys were treated the same in the two earlier amendments as \nattorneys who have just recently gotten into litigation on this issue \nafter it was obvious that, at the very least, settlements were \navailable to all of the plaintiffs and, for that matter, were treated \nthe same as any attorney who brings litigation in the future when both \nthe States and this bill have so substantially changed the burden of \nproof in tobacco litigation that one may almost say that an attorney \nwho loses a tobacco case will be exposed to malpractice litigation \nthereafter.\n  Mr. President, that is fundamentally unfair. And so the amendment \nthat I have put before the Senate today, for our vote, treats \nattorneys' fees differently depending on when the litigation was \ncommenced. I have adopted all of the considerations for judges to use \nin determining the amount of attorneys' fees that are fair in a given \ncase that were a part of the second Faircloth amendment. They, in turn, \nare an expanded version of considerations that the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has articulated as used when the question of reasonable \nattorneys' fees has come before the Supreme Court.\n  So the dollar figures that we use per hour in this amendment are \nceilings; they are not floors. If, in any case, the courts or others \nwho make judgments in this connection feel that those figures are too \nhigh--and I think there will be many instances in which they do--they \nmay be reduced below that ceiling. We simply set a ceiling.\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n  The ceiling, unlike the $1,000 ceiling in the last Faircloth \namendment which was mitigated by allowing a cost recovery greater than \nthe actual cost expenditures, is simply this. For lawyers who are part \nof litigating cases that began before 1995, the ceiling will be $4,000 \nan hour--four times that in the Faircloth amendment. For lawyers as a \npart of litigation that was brought after the beginning of 1995 but \nbefore April of 1997, the maximum figure, the ceiling, will be $2,000 \nan hour. Why, you may ask, April 1997, 2 months before the tobacco \nsettlement was announced? That was the date, the time, that Liggett \ngave up--in effect, turned state's evidence--turned all of the internal \nmemoranda, which show the horrendous way, the unprincipled way, the \ntobacco companies had acted, over to the general public, to all of the \nlawyers.\n  So after that date, after a date at which tobacco litigation was not \nonly unprecedented and of extraordinary difficulty but really quite \nsimple and easy, the maximum figure will be the $1,000 an hour--in this \ncase, identical to the overall limit in that Faircloth amendment, but \nonly a recovery of actual costs.\n  And, finally, beginning on a date that roughly corresponds with the \nbeginning of this debate on the floor of the Senate, in the \nanticipation that even the rules of evidence will be lower and lesser \nif this bill should pass, the ceiling will be $500 an hour--actually \nlower than the Faircloth amendment itself.\n  It seems to this Senator, Mr. President, that that is more nuanced \nand more fair than the one-size-fits-all proposition that was contained \nin the two earlier amendments on which we voted.\n  As a consequence, this amendment is suggested to all of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate, both those who felt that a lower limit was \nappropriate but were unsuccessful in getting a majority and those who, \nlike myself, objected to the two earlier Faircloth amendments.\n  I believe it is very difficult to stand for the proposition that \nthere should be no limitation under any set of circumstances. That \nmight be an appropriate position for Members of the U.S. Senate if we \nwere not engaged in this debate. If the very people whose clients have \ncome before us asking us to pass that bill--ratify the settlement made \nby the great majority of States of the United States--had not come here \nto Congress to ask us to pass this legislation, we would have no \nbusiness simply debating attorneys' fees in the abstract in this \nconnection. But they are here. They have used up, as the Senator from \nIdaho said, too much of our time already, time which might more \nprofitably have been devoted to other legislation.\n\n  But it has been a serious debate. It has been a debate in which we \nhave examined every single element not only of the litigation that led \nto this debate but of the whole relationship between tobacco, the \ntobacco industry, and the farmers, teenagers, adults, health care, and \nthe like. And to say that the only aspect of tobacco policy that we \ncannot and should not examine is the fees of the attorneys who are \ninvolved in this litigation, to me, Mr. President, is an unsupportable \nproposition.\n  Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago I came across a short essay by \nStuart Taylor, Jr., which appears in the May 30 edition of the National \nJournal. I ask unanimous consent that that essay be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Mr. Taylor, in stating the case for \nlimitations on lawyers' fees, sets up the five fundamental arguments \nagainst doing so and deals with each of those five.\n  The first is, ``Don't mess with the marketplace''--that these were \naccounts freely entered into. In the first place, I am not sure that \nthere was a great deal of ``marketplace'' in connection with litigation \nmuch of which was solicited by the lawyers themselves.\n  But in any event, the marketplace disappears with this legislation. \nThere is no real marketplace for tobacco products anymore. It will be \nthe most regulated marketplace for any legal commodity in the United \nStates, far exceeding the degree of regulation applied to alcohol and \nalcoholic beverages, for example. So if we can regulate the marketplace \nfor tobacco, we can regulate the marketplace for tobacco lawyers.\n  The second objection that is brought up is that these are sacrosanct \ncontract rights. But, of course, these are contract rights that are \nsubject to review by the courts, by the judges who are dealing with \nthis litigation. There have already been judgments made in that \nconnection. The law is clear that attorneys' fees must be reasonable. \nAnd when they are unreasonable or overreaching, the courts, with their \nequity powers, said, ``We can intervene.'' Well, then, Mr. President, \nit seems to me that we can intervene as well. We represent the \nconscience of the people of the United States. And I believe \noverwhelmingly the people of the United States will reject the kind of \nattorneys' fees running up into the billions of dollars that seem \nclearly possible and perhaps close to certainty should we not intervene \nin this aspect of the marketplace.\n  The third objection is States rights--that all of this litigation was \nbrought by the States; we ought to stay out of it. Again, Mr. \nPresident, a good argument had the States not come to us and asked us \nto pass this legislation, because literally, in the case of most of \nthem, they could not reach the goals they sought without the assistance \nof the President and the Congress of the United States.\n  The fourth reason--and it has been expressed on this floor--is that \nthese lawyers deserve these big, huge fees. I was presiding, Mr. \nPresident, when Senator Hollings eloquently made that case, that \nwhatever they get they earn. Well, I suppose one can make that \nargument, but I do not believe that most of the American people believe \nthat lawyers, under any circumstances, should earn $10,000 or $50,000 \nor $92,000 or $200,000 an hour for their work, no matter how \nimaginative and how successful that work may be.\n  I think there are very few Members of this body who believe firmly \nthat they deserve fees larger than the $4,000 cap that is included in \nthis amendment.\n  The final argument that Mr. Taylor set out in his essay 2 or 3 weeks \nago was that $250 an hour was not enough. That, of course, was a \nreference to the first Faircloth amendment, and I agreed with Mr. \nTaylor, $250 was not enough for those who had begun this litigation by \nany stretch of the imagination. I don't think, myself, $1,000 was \nenough.\n  That is why, with a bit more reluctance, I voted against the second \nFaircloth amendment. But I certainly believe that the staged amount \nthat we have in this amendment is enough and is enough for each of the \nfour different categories of lawyers to whom it applies. It is for that \nreason that I have placed this proposal before the Senate once more in \na different fashion than the fashion in which it previously appeared.\n  This is a legitimate part of the debate over tobacco legislation. We \nshould reflect the conscience of the American people in this \nconnection. We should try to see to it the maximum amount of money, \nconsistent with fairness, that changes hands in one respect or another \nas a result of this legislation goes to the social and mostly \nantismoking purposes for which it is intended. We don't need to make \nbillionaires out of lawyers simply because they were lucky enough or \neven wise enough to get into this field at an opportune time. We \nparticularly don't need to do that for those lawyers who didn't either \nbother or have enough imagination to get into it until this kind of \nlitigation was a slam dunk.\n  This is perhaps one element of our system of justice that \nincreasingly disturbs the American people. We have dealt with it a \nlittle bit at a time in tort reform legislation. I hope that the Senate \nwill take up a product liability bill and I hope now we can get a \nbipartisan degree of support here on the Senate floor and get a \nsignature from the President on a modest attempt to reform our legal \nsystem.\n  I voted for all such reforms that have come before the Senate while I \nhave been here in the last 7 years. I am not generally considered to be \nsomeone who defends trial lawyers. I found it a little bit awkward to \nvote against the first two Faircloth amendments, but I think even with \nrespect to people with whom I disagree, with whom many of\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\nus disagree, fairness is vitally important. I have designed this \namendment in a way to be fair and to be equitable, to treat people in \ndifferent circumstances differently. I submit it to the consideration \nof the Senate on that basis.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the National Journal, May 30, 1998]\n\n                          (Stuart Taylor Jr.)\n\n         Tobacco Fees: The Rewards of Winning Could Be Stunning\n\n       It's an estimate, but perhaps not all that far-fetched: In \n     some cases, lawyers suing the tobacco companies could make as \n     much as $100,000 an hour if the cozy contingency fee deals \n     they have signed with state attorneys general and others are \n     left intact.\n       That helps explain why some in Congress are pressing to add \n     curbs on lawyers' fees to the $515 billion tobacco bill \n     sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\n       In Texas, five leading plaintiffs lawyers would split a pot \n     of $2.3 billion over the next 25 years--15 percent of a $15.3 \n     billion statewide settlement--under a contingency fee deal \n     signed by Democratic state Attorney General Dan Morales for a \n     lawsuit to recover health care costs attributable to tobacco.\n       The five lawyers did not keep track of the hours they \n     worked. Nor have they specified how much of the money they \n     would share with the dozens of other lawyers who helped them. \n     But professor Lester Brickman of Benjamin Cardozo Law School, \n     an expert witness in a court challenge brought by Texas' \n     Republican Gov. George W. Bush against the fee deal, says the \n     lawyers' hourly rates come to at least $92,000, based on his \n     estimate that they almost surely put in no more than 25,000 \n     hours on the cases.\n       In Florida, West Palm Beach Circuit Judge Harold J. Cohen \n     invalidated as ``unconscionable'' a deal that would give the \n     state's 12 lead private lawyers $2.8 billion--25 per cent of \n     a similar, $11.3 billion statewide tobacco settlement. But \n     his decision was overturned on May 18, on procedural grounds, \n     and sent back for further action.\n       The total cut for the plaintiffs lawyers in all current and \n     future tobacco cases covered by the McCain bill could run as \n     high as $5 billion a year, with the biggest bucks coming from \n     future class action suits on behalf of sick smokers and their \n     families.\n       The plaintiffs lawyers and their champions--one of them \n     Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.--make no serious efforts to \n     knock down the numbers. In fact, they dismiss the dollar \n     figures as irrelevant. ``Don't give me this billable hours or \n     $180,000 an hour or $5 an hour or whatever it is,'' Hollings \n     declared in a May 19 debate. ``This isn't any hourly thing. . \n     . . They deserve every dime of it and more.''\n       Hollings was speaking against an attempt by Sen. Lauch \n     Faircloth, R-N.C., to amend the McCain bill by capping the \n     anti-tobacco lawyers' fees at $250 an hour. Faircloth's rider \n     was rejected, 39-58. The bipartisan majority's objections \n     were essentially these:\n\n\n                    don't mess with the marketplace\n\n       Congress does not curb the gargantuan compensation packages \n     of, say, tobacco executives, other corporate fat cats, actors \n     or star athletes. So why should it selectively restrict the \n     fees of the entrepreneurs of litigation--especially those who \n     take on Big Tobacco?\n\n\n                            contract rights\n\n       Any move by Capitol Hill to override contingency fee deals \n     would interfere with the lawyers' contract rights. ``A deal \n     is a deal,'' in the words of Sheldon Schlessinger, one of the \n     Florida lawyers pressing for a full 25 per cent cut.\n\n\n                             states' rights\n\n       In the many cases in which attorneys general and other \n     state officials have retained private lawyers to sue tobacco \n     companies, federal fee-capping legislation would interfere \n     with the states' rights to sign whatever contingency fee \n     deals they choose.\n\n\n                         they deserve big fees\n\n       The plaintiffs' lawyers are entitled to generous rewards \n     because they took extraordinary risks--which even state \n     governments could not take on their own--and used their \n     expertise, financial resources and entrepreneurial flair to \n     bring to their knees the mighty tobacco companies, which \n     until recently had seemed invincible.\n\n\n                           $250 is not enough\n\n       While it may seem a princely wage to most people, $250 an \n     hour is barely half the rate tobacco companies and other \n     corporate clients pay their highest-paid lawyers. And those \n     lawyers are paid whether they win or lose. Contingency fee \n     layers, on the other hand, get nothing when they lose. So \n     when they win, they should get more--far more, in some \n     cases--to compensate for their risks.\n       This last point is so clearly, well, on the money, that by \n     itself it warrants rejection of Faircloth's $250-an-hour cap, \n     which smacked of standard conservative Republican lawyer \n     bashing.\n       But what about a fairer, more realistic curb on fees in \n     tobacco cases covered by the McCain measure? Brickman--a \n     leading scholar on contingency fees and a fierce critic of \n     excessive ones--proposes an upper limit of $2,000 an hour, \n     several times the rates charged by the tobacco companies' \n     lawyers.\n       Although some of the points noted thus far could be raised \n     against a $2,000-an-hour fee cap, the counterarguments seem \n     more persuasive.\n       Don't mess with the marketplace? Precious little evidence \n     suggests that many contingency fee lawyers engage in the kind \n     of competition for business that is the essence of a health \n     marketplace--perhaps because most smokers and other \n     individual plaintiffs don't have the time or expertise to \n     bargain or shop around for better fee deals.\n       And even some of the fee deals signed by presumably astute \n     state attorneys general, such as Dan Morales, seem remarkably \n     unsophisticated (at best), with the same fixed percentage of \n     the award going to the lawyers no matter how large the award. \n     Noting that Morales (like many other politicians) got \n     campaign contributions from some of the same lawyers, Bush \n     and Brickman have suggested that he either sold out or was \n     snookered or both. (Morales, returning the fire, has called \n     Bush a lackey of the tobacco companies.)\n       Be that as it may, the McCain bill would not leave much \n     freedom in any corner of the tobacco marketplace. It would \n     subject tobacco products, advertising and litigation alike to \n     pervasive federal regulation, in a manner somewhat analogous \n     to the government's Medicare and Medicaid systems, which of \n     course impose strict limits on doctors' fees.\n       The McCain measure would also make winning a lawsuit \n     against tobacco companies far easier (by superseding key \n     state tort law rules), while at the same time giving the \n     companies strong financial incentives to offer plaintiffs \n     generous settlements rather than fighting tort suits and \n     class actions all the way to trial. For a Congress that would \n     thus be enriching both plaintiffs and their lawyers--by \n     eliminating much of the risk of litigation and enabling them \n     to win with relatively little effort--it would be a bit odd \n     to ignore the matter of how much money the lawyers should be \n     able to take off the top.\n       Contract rights? As fiduciaries, lawyers everywhere are \n     subject to ethical rules barring them from charging \n     ``excessive'' or ``unreasonable'' fees. So Brickman's \n     proposed fee cap would clash with the contract rights of only \n     those who can show that they can reasonably demand more than \n     $2,000 an hour.\n       Individual lawyers should be free to try to make such a \n     showing, on a case-by-case basis, and, if they are \n     successful, obtain an exemption from the $2,000-an-hour cap. \n     But few would (or should) succeed. And a requirement that \n     lawyers present justifications in court for such \n     exceptionally high fees would have the wholesome effect of \n     spurring judges to put teeth into the seldom-enforced ethics \n     rules against unreasonable fees.\n       States' rights? The McCain bill would virtually take over--\n     at the behest of the states themselves--the pending state \n     lawsuits to recover tobacco-related costs incurred by \n     combined state-federal Medicaid programs. In this context, on \n     what basis could any state official object to attaching a \n     $2,000-an-hour fee cap, especially one that would benefit the \n     state's citizens?\n       While some opponents of any fee cap assert that the main \n     beneficiaries would be the merchants of death (aka the \n     tobacco companies), it seems more likely to affect only the \n     split between the merchants of litigation (aka the trial \n     lawyers) and their clients--the states themselves, smokers \n     and others.\n       Do the lawyers really deserve more than $2,000 an hour? \n     Many surely do not, because their risk of loss has \n     diminished, and will diminish even more if the McCain bill \n     passes. Fred Levin, a Florida lawyer, helped illustrate this \n     point by boasting on ABC's 20-20 program not long ago that he \n     not only had brokered the contingency fee deal between the \n     state and its private lawyers for his ``good friend'' \n     Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles, but also had the lawsuit \n     against the tobacco companies ``a slam dunk,'' by slipping \n     through the state Legislature obscure amendments that \n     virtually guaranteed victory to the state.\n       Not much risk there. Could even so stalwart a champion of \n     the trial lawyers as Sen. Hollings explain why, for such \n     lawyers, $2,000 an hour is not enough?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I say the Senator from Idaho \ncame to the floor to argue that the tobacco legislation now spends more \nmoney than it takes in. The argument neglects one fundamental fact, and \nthat is the legislation can't spend more than it takes in because the \nauthorizations, including the drug amendment, come from the trust fund \nonly. You can earmark all you want to, but unless the money is in the \ntrust fund, it can't be spent. That is, obviously, up to the \nappropriators.\n  Having only been here for 12 years, I have, time after time after \ntime, observed authorizations of large amounts of money which are then \nreduced by the appropriators, as which is their job, to fit into the \noverall budget. These authorizations that are a result--the drug \namendment, prevention, cessation, counterads, research, et cetera--that \nare authorized, cannot be appropriated unless the money is there in the \ntrust fund.\n  By the way, those who would argue that we need to reduce the size of \nthis bill by about $100 billion, I say that is a very likely outcome if \nwe are successful in reducing teen smoking, because the volume of \ncigarettes sold in\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\nAmerica, if we are successful, would be reduced significantly, which \nwould, first of all, mean less revenues and less payments into the \ntrust fund which is set up, and over time, obviously, would then reduce \nthe amount of money that can be spent. Most experts believe that if \nthis legislation is enacted that we could effectively reduce teen \nsmoking in America.\n  So I say to my friend from Idaho when he comes to the floor, when we \ncome to the floor in a day or so with a defense authorization bill \nwhich greatly exceeds the amount that is budgeted, I hope that he will \nmake the same arguments that we exceeded in practically every other \nauthorization bill. As the Senator from Idaho well knows, the way we do \nbusiness around here is we authorize a certain amount of expenditures \nand then that is subject to the appropriators who are guided by the \nbudget--in this case, guided by the amount of money that will be in the \ntrust fund. I think it is important that be mentioned.\n  I think most of us agree it is time we made a decision on this bill. \nI want to comment on the Gorton amendment. I think it is important. I \nthink it is a good amendment. I think Senator Gorton, Senator Sessions, \nand Senator Faircloth have great credibility in this body--both Senator \nGorton and Senator Sessions having been former attorneys general. I \nbelieve that it is appropriate if we are going to designate how the \nmoney is spent that comes from the increase in the price of a pack of \ncigarettes, then there should also be some limitation on the amount of \nmoney that is paid for legal expenses.\n  Senator Gorton's amendment calls for initially $4,000 an hour and \nscales down as to what time in the calendar the legal entities entered \ninto these settlements. I think most Americans would believe that \n$4,000 an hour is a rather generous wage. In fact, there are very few \nAmericans who are compensated to the tune of $4,000 an hour.\n  The argument will be made on the other side that we are dictating \nsomething that should be left up to the States, should be left up to \narbitration. We have just passed several amendments that come from that \nside that dictate exactly what the States should do. We just passed one \nthat said a certain amount of money had to go to early child \ndevelopment. We passed one that said a certain amount had to go to a \nspecific kind of research.\n  In all due respect to the arguments that somehow we are interfering \nwith some kind of States rights here, then obviously an amendment \nshould be supported that says the States can do whatever they want to \nwith any of the money that goes to them, which contemplated in the \noriginal bill is some 30 to 40 percent of the entire amount of money \nthat is collected.\n  Most Americans, when asked if $4,000 per hour is adequate \ncompensation to anyone--there may be some exception to that, perhaps \nbrain surgery--but for legal services I think the overwhelming majority \nof Americans would view $4,000 per hour as more than generous \ncompensation. In fact, if we pass the Gorton amendment, there will be \nsome who will complain that this is far too generous. I remind \nobservers that this is the third iteration we have attempted to try to \nbring some restraint to what many Americans are appalled to discover--\nthat a single law firm, in the case of the Florida settlement, could \nmake a couple of billion dollars.\n  I don't think that is appropriate, and I believe that we ought to act \noverwhelmingly in favor of the Gorton amendment.\n  We have been told of two possible substitute amendments--one by \nSenator Hatch and the other by Senators Gramm and Domenici. I hope and \nexpect that if those amendments are to be offered, we can move to them \nshortly.\n  As I said, the Senate has adopted several significant amendments, \nparticularly with respect to how funding under this bill is \napportioned. I thought it might be helpful to recap for the Senate \nwhere the bill stands in that regard.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that under the managers' amendment, \n$52 million would be available in the trust fund in the first 4 years \nand an additional $72 billion in the following 5 years, producing a 9-\nyear total of $124 billion.\n  The Senate adopted amendments to the bill to provide $3 billion to \nassist veterans with smoking-related diseases and $46 billion in tax \ncuts, leaving a total of $75 billion over 9 years for apportionment to \nthe four major accounts authorized under the bill--the State account, \nthe public health account, the research account, and the farmer \nassistance account.\n  Under the bill, 40 percent of the money, or $30 billion over the next \n9 years, would be made available to the States to settle their Medicaid \nand legal claims against the tobacco industry. This would mean a payout \nof approximately $3.3 billion per year, or an average of $66 million \nper State per year, to compensate State taxpayers.\n  And 22 percent of the money, or $16.5 billion over 9 years, would be \nmade available for public health programs, including \ncounteradvertising, smoking prevention and cessation services, as well \nas for drug control programs authorized under the Coverdell-Craig \namendment. As the bill currently stands, the precise amounts and \nselected purposes would be subject to appropriations.\n  This means an amount of approximately $1.8 billion available for \npublic health and subject to drug control purposes. Under the bill, 90 \npercent of the money reserved for public health is to be block-granted \nto the States.\n  Another 22 percent of the funds, or $16.5 billion over 9 years, would \nbe made available for health research at the National Institutes of \nHealth and Centers for Disease Control. This would mean a payout of \nnearly $1.8 billion per year for advanced medical research.\n  As you know, Mr. President, lately the public health groups have \ncomplained about some of the reductions as a result of setting aside $3 \nbillion for veterans' treatment of tobacco-related illness as a result \nof tax cuts and as a result of an anti-illegal drug program. It still \nprovides $1.8 billion per year for advanced medical research. I would \nsay that is a significant amount of money.\n  The bill designates 16 percent of the fund to tobacco farmer and farm \ncommunity assistance. Also, Mr. President, $1.8 billion is available \nfor public health. And $1.8 billion is, I think, a sizable amount of \nmoney. This is a total of $12 billion over 9 years, or a yearly payout \nof $1.3 billion.\n  The farm provisions still have to be worked out. I hope we can \naccomplish that end expeditiously and in a manner that is fair and \nappropriate.\n  I remind my colleagues again that the bill, as modified, contains \nmeasures of enormous benefit to the Nation, including vital anti-youth \nsmoking initiatives that will stop 3,000 kids a day from taking up a \nhabit that will kill one-third of them, critical funding for \ngroundbreaking health research, and assistance to our Nation's veterans \nwho suffer from smoking-related illnesses.\n\n  I would like to mention again, Mr. President, that for reasons that \nare still not clear to me, money was taken to use for highways that \nshould have been used for treating veterans who suffer from tobacco-\nrelated illnesses. This provision of the bill is an effort to provide \nsome funding for veterans who were encouraged to smoke during the \nperiod of time they were serving this Nation.\n  The bill will also fund a major antidrug effort to attack the serious \nthreat posed by illegal drugs, and it contains one of the largest tax \ndecreases ever to eliminate the marriage penalty for low- and moderate-\nincome Americans, and achieve 100 percent deductibility of health \ninsurance for self-employed individuals. In fact, every penny raised \nabove the amount agreed to by the industry last June is returned to the \nAmerican people in the form of a tax cut.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. I think it is rather important. It \nhappens that this tax cut takes into consideration all of the \nadditional funds above that which were agreed to by the attorneys \ngeneral and the industry last June.\n  The bill provides the opportunity to settle 36 pending State cases, \ncollectively, efficiently, and in a timely fashion. I argue that it is \nnow time to finish our business and move the process forward.\n  There are those who labor under the unfortunate misapprehension that \nif we do nothing, the issue will go away. I don't believe that is \ncorrect. I don't\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\nbelieve it is correct because the facts won't go away. Mr. President, \n3,000 kids take up the habit every day, teen smoking is on the rise, \nand that probably won't stop unless we do something.\n  Mr. President, 418,000 Americans die of smoking-related illnesses \nevery year--the No. 1 cause of preventable disease and death in America \nby far. This death march won't stop unless we do something. The \ntaxpayers must shell out $50 billion a year to pay for smoking-related \nhealth care costs--nearly $455 per household. That number is increasing \nbecause the number of youth smokers is rising. I want to again repeat, \nthose who call this a ``big tax bill''--and I congratulate the tobacco \nindustry for doing polling and finding that most Americans \nunderstandably are opposed to ``big tax increases,'' but I argue that \nthe tobacco industry is responsible for one of the biggest tax \nincreases in the history of this country. That tax increase is what \ntaxpayers have to pay to treat tobacco-related illnesses. Those \ntobacco-related illnesses are directly related to the sale of their \nproduct.\n  If the bill disappears--which would be much to the industry's \ndelight--the State suits will not disappear with it. If we fail to act, \nthe States will continue their suits and they will win judgments and \nthe price of cigarettes will increase sharply. So please don't be \nmisled by those who would have the public believe that killing this \nbill would eliminate taxes or relieve smokers of an undue price \nincrease. Following the Minnesota settlement, the price of a pack of \ncigarettes went up 5 cents, on an average, throughout the country, not \njust in Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, we have a tendency to throw around polling data quite \nfrequently. Recently, there was a poll paid for by the tobacco \ncompanies, and some of the opponents took great heart in that the \nAmerican people somehow did not support legislation to attack the \nproblem of kids smoking. There was another telephone survey conducted \nby Market Facts TeleNation, which is an independent polling firm, and \nthis poll was paid for by the Effective National Action to Control \nTobacco. Mr. President, these polls' questions are always very \nimportant because how they shape the question quite often dictates the \nanswer. We know very well how highly paid pollsters are.\n  Here is the question:\n\n       As you may know, the Congress is currently considering the \n     McCain tobacco bill, which creates a national tobacco policy \n     to reduce tobacco use among kids. Based on what you know \n     about the bill, do you favor or oppose Congress passing the \n     McCain bill?\n\n  Registered voters in favor were 62 percent. It is broken down: 45 \npercent strongly favor; 17 percent somewhat favor; strongly oppose, 23 \npercent; somewhat oppose, 9 percent. All adults who favor are 62 \npercent; oppose, 30 percent.\n\n       Question: The McCain bill includes public education to \n     discourage kids from smoking, help for smokers to quit, \n     enforcement of laws to prevent tobacco sales to kids and \n     increases in the price of tobacco products to discourage use \n     by kids. There would also be strict limitations on tobacco \n     advertising and marketing to kids, as well as authority for \n     the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco like it \n     does other consumer products. These programs would be funded \n     by increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over \n     the next 5 years. Knowing this about the McCain bill, do you \n     favor or oppose the bill?\n\n  This is what we call usually a ``push question.'' And the number goes \nup to 66 percent registered voters strongly favor, and about 4 percent \noppose.\n\n       Question: If two candidates for Congress were otherwise \n     equal, but one supported the McCain bill and the other \n     opposed it, would you be * * *\n\n  More likely to support the candidate who supports the bill, 44 \npercent more likely; more likely to support the candidate who opposes \nthe bill, 18 percent; 37 percent would say no effect on their vote; 44 \npercent would most likely support the candidate who supports the bill.\n\n       Question: Some in Congress have proposed amendments to the \n     McCain bill that address issues other than tobacco use--like \n     tax reductions and the war on illegal drugs. Which of the \n     following statements do you agree with most?\n\n  The tobacco bill should address issues only, and other issues should \nbe dealt with in separate legislation, 79 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this poll be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nEffective National Action to Control Tobacco: A Public Health Coalition\n\n\n                         tobacco survey results\n\n       Telephone survey using a random digit sample, commissioned \n     by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and conducted June 12-\n     15, 1998 by Market Facts' TeleNation, an independent polling \n     firm.

Mr. President, as we do battle of the polls, there is one \ntoday that I think in many ways supports the argument that the American \npeople want to do something about the issue. The other argument that I \nhear quite often is the American people do not care, that they care \nmore about illegal drugs, that they care more about crime, that they \ncare more about education. I agree with that. But they also care about \ntobacco.\n  After this issue is taken up, I understand there will be efforts to \ntake up the issue of patients' rights under the present health \nmanagement regime in America. I haven't seen that in any polls. That is \none of the most important issues. Yet, I think Members of this body \nthink that it is of great importance. We are going to take up the \ndefense bill, of which there will be several controversial issues, such \nas ballistic missile defense, our sanctions on China, et cetera.\n  I haven't seen those in any polls either. But yet I think the \nAmerican people care about our Nation's security, especially our \nability to defend the Nation.\n  Should we do something about illegal drugs? Yes. I hope we will. I \nbelieve that this bill has been improved by that.\n  Should we do something about education? I believe that we have had \nsignificant and substantial debate on the floor of the Senate regarding \nthat issue. The very excellent bill of Senator Coverdell was passed \nafter a very difficult process.\n  Should we do things about crime? Yes.\n  But, Mr. President, I think we should also do something about this \nissue as well.\n  As I began my comments, I believe that we are in an important period \nof time. I say the best way to proceed is to have a cloture vote \nproposed by the majority leader, which is the way we do business around \nhere. If the Senate, in its wisdom, decides by 40 votes, and we don't \nhave enough votes to conclude debate after being here in this fourth \nweek, then we should go on to other issues. If there are sufficient \nvotes, 60 votes to invoke cloture, I urge both proponents and opponents \nof the legislation to try to complete action on this legislation this \nweek.\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\n  We all know we have 13 appropriations bills; perhaps product \nliability reform; perhaps other issues that are important to the \nAmerican people as well.\n  I don't mind staying here all summer, if I may borrow a phrase from \nanother leader of a different magnitude than I. But I believe that we \nhave discussed and debated this issue at great length, and it is now \ntime for us to make a decision as to whether we move forward on this \nbill or not, or throw the issue back to the States. Thirty-six \nattorneys general voted for it. Larger and larger settlements, and \nlarger and larger legal fees will occur. But most importantly, as I \nhave said on a number of occasions on the floor, today 3,000 kids will \nstart to smoke, and tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator McCain, for \nhis remarks and putting some of this argument back in perspective.\n  I want to address briefly the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton. I know there are other colleagues waiting \nto speak on this question.\n  Mr. President, I understand the strong feeling that we want to limit \nlawyers' fees. I don't think there is a Member of this body that isn't \nconcerned about seeing lawyers get windfall results for themselves as a \nresult of this litigation.\n  We have in the McCain legislation, the bill that came out of the \nCommerce Committee on a 19-to-1 vote, a strong bipartisan vote, a means \nof addressing that problem.\n  What is in the bill is a provision for arbitration panels to \ndetermine what are the appropriate legal fees.\n  I think probably that is the best answer, as imperfect as it is.\n  The problem with the our taking action is, What action do you take? I \nthink Senator Gorton has probably the best chance of prevailing. But it \nhas problems. I think his is probably the most thoughtful provision \nbefore us.\n  But I say to my colleague from Washington, I think there are real \nproblems with what he has proposed. Under Senator Gorton's proposal, \nfees would be limited to $4,000 an hour for actions filed before 12-31 \nof 1994. The problem is that may be way too much. It is even \nconceivable in certain circumstances that it is too little, but I think \nit is more likely that it is too much.\n  He also provides $2,000 an hour for actions filed between 12-31 1994 \nand 4-1 1997.\n  I tell you, my own view is that may well be too much. It is hard to \nsay because it is an arbitrary cap. That is the problem with what the \nSenator from Washington is offering. In many cases, it may be way too \nmuch.\n  He says it establishes a cap, not a floor. But I think we all \nunderstand what happens in these cases. Very often what is intended is \na cap which then becomes a floor. What we may find out is that people \nbeing compensated at $4,000 an hour do not deserve a fraction of that. \nOr we may find that we have attorneys who file actions between 12-31 \n1994 and 4-1 1997 who are capped at $2,000 an hour. That may be far in \nexcess of what they should receive.\n  He also provides for $1,000 an hour for actions filed between 4-1 \n1979, and 6-15 of 1998; $1,000 an hour.\n  Again, because this is arbitrary, it can wind up being too much in \none case when it goes down to $500 for actions filed after 6-15 of \n1998. Those would be new cases.\n  That may be appropriate for those who have just gone out and made a \ncopy of the previous actions filed by others, but if it is a new \naction, taking on the tobacco industry on a new theory where a law firm \nhas to put up substantial resources of its own to bring an action, $500 \nmay not be enough.\n  The point is we don't know. Sitting here in this Chamber, how do we \nmake a decision about what is an appropriate legal fee for literally \nthousands of cases across this country. I don't think it is possible \nfor us to make this judgment. That is why some of us believe an \narbitration panel is the appropriate resolution. Let's leave it up to \nthe parties at issue. They each name somebody on their behalf, and \nthose two name a third, and they reach a conclusion on what the \nappropriate fees are in a particular case. But to have us sit in \nWashington and try to decide what a contract ought to be in the State \nof Minnesota is really pretty far-fetched. We often say we are engaged \nin too much micromanagement from here in Washington. In fact, our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle say that frequently, and \nfrequently they are right. If there was ever a case of micromanagement, \nthis is it. We are deciding what legal fees should be in the State of \nWashington, the State of Minnesota, the State of North Dakota. I don't \nthink so. I tell you what an appropriate legal fee in North Dakota is \nand what an appropriate legal fee in New York is are probably not the \nsame. For us just to put in an arbitrary amount that applies across the \ncountry is meddling at a level that I think is counterproductive.\n\n  Now, we have heard, gee, some of these cases that are settled are \ngoing to lead to a windfall for the attorneys at issue. I tell you, I \nam very concerned about that. That is why I have supported arbitration, \nbecause where there is a difference between those who hired the lawyers \nand those who have been hired, there ought to be a way of resolving it \nso lawyers do not enjoy windfall returns.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion about Florida. There has been the \nsuggestion that law firms down there are going to get $2 billion. I \ntell you, that is outrageous, absolutely outrageous --$2 billion for a \ncase in Florida. But I am not the only one who thinks it is outrageous. \nThe State court in Florida thinks it is outrageous. In fact, they have \nsaid it is unconscionable in the State of Florida, and they have not \napproved it.\n  So why are we substituting our judgment for the judgment of courts in \nthe individual States and the judgment of the attorneys general in the \nvarious States who are the ones who have hired lawyers on a contingency \nbasis? Because that is why we have the problem. We have the problem \nbecause individual attorneys general did not, by themselves, have the \nresources to go take on the tobacco industry. They did not have the \nresources to do that. We all understand, before this series of cases, \nthe tobacco industry had never lost a case and they had the best legal \ntalent in the country.\n  By the way, as I understand it, the proposal of the Senator from \nWashington only applies to plaintiffs' attorneys. It does not apply to \nthe tobacco industry's attorneys. So you have kind of an uneven fight \nhere: The tobacco industry has no limitation, and the plaintiffs' \nlawyers, those who sue on behalf of the victims, are capped. And the \ncaps that apply under the amendment of the Senator from Washington may \nbe way too much. In fact, I think in virtually every case $4,000 an \nhour is way too much; $2,000 an hour for a different set of classes \nbased on the time that they were filed may be way too much; $500 an \nhour for new cases may be too little if the law firm has to put up \nsubstantial resources of its own in order to bring the action and \nsuccessfully take on the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry, \nespecially given the tobacco industry's rate of success.\n  Mr. President, in the task force that I headed for our side, the \nconclusion we came to as the appropriate resolution is not to have us \ntry to determine appropriate legal fees. The Senate of the United \nStates is not equipped, frankly, to reach into the facts, the different \nfact patterns of hundreds of different cases, even thousands of \ndifferent cases across this country, and determine what are the \nappropriate legal fees.\n  I think that is a profound mistake, and it sets a precedent. Are we \ngoing to start to determine the legal fees in cases that involve the \nautomobile industry? Are we going to start to get involved in what the \nlegal fees should be in the medical industry?\n  Boy, I tell you, I do not think that is a road we want to go down, \nbecause I do not think this body is equipped to determine the legal \nfees. I think we may make very serious mistakes, and I can easily see \nunder the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington that we \ncould wind up with a scheme in which lawyers were compensated far more \nthan they should be.\n\n  Now, if we look at what has happened around the country, I think we \nwill see that, in fact, the individual States are responding to these \nchallenges. We are\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\nseeing in State after State that they are not accepting these \noutrageous contingency agreements that were entered into. They are not \naccepting 25 percent contingency agreements. In State after State they \nhave changed what was proposed.\n  In Minnesota, outside counsel agreed to accept 7.5 percent instead of \nthe 25 percent fee as called for in the original contract. In \nMississippi, both the State and their counsel have agreed to submit a \ndecision on fees and expenses to an arbitration panel. In both Texas \nand Florida, where there is a dispute over fees, the attorneys' fees \nand expenses will be decided either through agreement, arbitration, or \ncourt order. In each case, mechanisms are now in place to determine the \namount of the attorneys' fees.\n  In Texas, a State court ruled that a 15 percent contingency fee \ncalled for in the contract between the State attorney general and the \nattorneys was reasonable but refused to award a specific dollar amount. \nIn that State, the Governor has now petitioned the court to reconsider \nits decision and has asked for an evidentiary hearing. The decision is \nnot expected until later this year.\n  In Florida, as I indicated, the State court rejected as \nunconscionable the fee request of the attorneys. Well, good for the \ncourt in Florida; they should have rejected it as unconscionable. But \nthat is where the decision ought to be made. It should not be made here \nin this Chamber where we are not privy to the facts in each of these \ncases and not in the position to determine what are the appropriate \nlegal fees.\n  Let me say further that the Gorton amendment would interfere in \nprivate contracts. That is a very serious matter. Where a State \nattorney general has entered into an agreement with an outside law \nfirm, I think it is highly questionable for the Senate to reach behind \nthat contract and say we know better, we know what the appropriate \nlegal fees should be, and we divide it on this arbitrary basis as is \ncalled for in the Gorton amendment. I do not think I have ever heard \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle call for interference in \nprivate contracts. I do not think that is a precedent that stands much \nscrutiny.\n  I am going to have more to say about this amendment as we go forward. \nI would say that Senator Gorton, I think, has done the most serious job \nof trying to address this vexing question, to try to prevent windfalls \nto attorneys, but I am afraid it fails at least the test that I would \napply for something that can meet the very different standards one sees \nall across the country in the literally thousands of different cases \nwhere legal fees apply.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota finds \nhimself on the horns of a delicious dilemma. He feels there may be \ncases in which the amendment I propose would result in attorneys' fees \nbeing awarded that are too great, and so his answer is to reject the \namendment and allow attorneys' fees in any amount. Attorneys' fees in \none case, in Texas, I believe, have already been approved by the court \nin an amount more than 10 times higher than the highest amount in this \namendment. I am afraid the Senator from North Dakota misreads the \namendment.\n  The heart and soul of the amendment is a set of criteria for \ndetermining reasonable attorneys' fees, listing a wide range of \nfactors, some of which we have discussed here, but leaving the matter \nto the discretion of the court. There is a limitation imposed on the \ndiscretion of the court by the amendment in the amounts that we have \nstated and debated. This is a cap and by no means a floor.\n  The Senator from North Dakota says that the better system is the \nsystem that is included in this bill, a system of arbitration. But, and \nthe current Presiding Officer has read this very carefully, this is \nsome kind of arbitration. This arbitration is to be decided under the \nbill by three arbitrators --one appointed by the plaintiff's trial \nlawyer himself, one appointed by the plaintiff, and a third appointed \nby the first two. The plaintiff has already signed an agreement--the \nplaintiff in most of these major cases is the State--they have signed \nan agreement, in some cases, for a 25-percent contingency fee on \nbillions of dollars' worth of recoveries. Who is going to represent the \npublic interest in this arbitration? No, Mr. President, there isn't \nanyone there to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a quick point?\n  Mr. GORTON. Sure.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think the Senator misspoke himself. The Senator \nindicated in the arbitration panel one would be appointed by the \nplaintiff, one by the plaintiff's lawyer, and then one by the two. I am \nsure the Senator will acknowledge it is one by the defendant, one by \nthe plaintiff, and the two of them determine the third member. Section \n1413 provides how the arbitration panel will work. Obviously, the two \nsides at issue each pick one, and the two of them pick the third. That \nis the standard means of establishing an arbitration panel.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am reading section 1413. It says:\n\n       . . .In any such arbitration, the arbitration panel shall \n     consist of 3 persons, one of whom shall be chosen by the \n     plaintiff, one of whom shall be chosen by the attorney, and \n     one of whom shall be chosen jointly by those 2 arbitrators.\n\n  That is not plaintiff and defendant. That is a fixed deal. In any \nevent, to say that because it is possible that this sets a ceiling, \nthat a $4,000 fee or a $2,000 fee might be too great a ceiling, we \nshould, therefore, have no ceiling at all, we should, therefore, allow \nattorneys' fees that have already been approved in far larger amounts, \nis, I think, a difficult argument to make.\n  The Senator from North Dakota makes it very well. But, in fact, the \nCongress of the United States has set attorneys' fees in all kinds of \ncases. They were discussed a few days ago by the Senator from Alabama \nand by others. There are many forms of litigation against the \ngovernment itself in which we have set attorneys' fees that now, I \nthink, are rather modest with the passage of time.\n  This is not unprecedented by any stretch of the imagination. What is \nunprecedented is the generosity of the proposal that I have put before \nthe Senate. It is not unprecedented from the point of view of whether \nor not we have done it. No, we either have to say that because the \nStates of these attorneys have come to us and have asked us to regulate \ntobacco in every conceivable, possible fashion, because they have asked \nus for a bill--this bill that makes it almost impossible for them to \nlose a case in the future because it totally changes the burden of \nproof--that we can say there is a certain level beyond which the \nconscience just simply doesn't allow attorneys' fees to go, or you have \nto take the position that we can regulate everything with respect to \ntobacco to the minutest degree, but we dare not touch attorneys' fees, \npersonally, I think that is a very, very difficult argument to make.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for just one \nmoment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield if I can have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to yield for a \nquestion in order to regain the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent, so I can get recognition, that \nthe Senator from Minnesota be recognized right after I finish. I will \ntake 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to clear up this confusion about \nthe arbitration panel. On page 438 of the bill it says:\n\n       * * * the arbitration panel shall consist of 3 persons, one \n     of whom shall be chosen by the plaintiff--\n\n  In this case, the State, who has hired the attorney--\n\n     one of whom shall be chosen by the attorney--\n\n  That would be the claimant for the fees--\n\n     and one of whom shall be chosen jointly by those 2 \n     arbitrators.\n\n  That is the standard method of setting up an arbitration panel. \nNothing new, nothing unusual here. That is the way of setting up an \narbitration panel\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nto get a result that is fair to both parties.\n  I say to my colleague from Washington, for us to decide we have \nbetter judgment than the State courts that administer the cases that \nare before them, I think, is a huge mistake. We talk about \nmicromanagement. When we start deciding legal fees in this Senate \nChamber, we are making a mistake. We do need to be worried about \nwindfalls to attorneys; absolutely we do. That is why arbitration \npanels were included in the legislation that came out of the Commerce \nCommittee on a 19-to-1 bipartisan vote. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota has spoken to the \narbitration provision in the legislation. I shall not do so. I just \nwant to present a Minnesota perspective for just a moment.\n  I come from a State where we just went through a very important \ntrial. The lawyers in my State, working with the attorney general, were \nable to unearth 33 million pages of documents--33 million pages of \ndocuments. This was during a discovery process that went from August \n1994 to the end of 1997. Many of those documents have had an enormous \nimpact, not just on the settlement in Minnesota, which was a very \nimportant settlement, but also directly on the debate in the U.S. \nCongress. Thirty-nine thousand pages of those documents were ordered \nproduced by the Minnesota judge and were ultimately subpoenaed by the \nHouse of Representatives and made public on the Internet.\n  What I want to do is speak to the part of this amendment that \nconcerns me the most. I have had some discussion with my colleague from \nAlabama, and I have said to him, ``Why don't you, in fact, not make \nthis retroactive,'' when he had his similar amendments on the floor, \nbecause I don't think we should be taking action here that reaches back \nto the Minnesota settlement, which has already been entered into and \nhas been declared final by the court. We already have an arrangement \nbetween the State and the Attorney General and the lawyers who \nrepresented our State. Congress should not disturb that.\n  I think the amendment of my colleague from the State of Washington \nhas a different weakness and that is its lack of evenhandedness. What I \nwant to see at a bare minimum is to have the same kind of caps or \nlimits put on those attorneys representing the tobacco companies. I say \nto colleagues, when you vote on this amendment, the thing you ought to \nfasten your attention on is that we don't have the same kind of \nceiling, the same kind of caps put on fees that go to lawyers \nrepresenting the tobacco companies. I see nothing here that does that, \nin which case I would argue that we are hardly talking about a level \nplaying field.\n\n  I think the problem with the amendment is that it just simply lacks \nbalance. I cannot support an amendment that puts caps on the fees of \nplaintiffs' attorneys representing consumers and representing the \nattorney general from a State, but at the same time puts no cap at all \non the fees of attorneys hired by tobacco companies or other big \ncorporations with their corporate lawyers working with these companies, \nbut there is no cap on the fees. That just simply makes no sense to me \nfrom a kind of elementary standard of fairness, and that is why I think \nthe amendment is fatally flawed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6364-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6372-S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE NOMINATION OF JAMES HORMEL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I am going to do this with a tremendous \namount of sensitivity, but I just want to take a minute to mention \nthis.\n  There were a number of newspaper articles today which report on the \nmajority leader's comments about homosexuality. I ask unanimous consent \nthey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 16, 1998]\n\n     Lott Says Homosexuality Is a Sin and Compares It to Alcoholism\n\n                          (By Alison Mitchell)\n\n       Washington, June 15--In an interview about his personal \n     beliefs, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, told a \n     conservative talk show host today that homosexuality is a sin \n     and then compared it to such personal problems as alcoholism, \n     kleptomania and ``sex addiction.''\n       The Mississippi Republican made his remarks in a 40-minute \n     taped interview conducted by Armstrong Williams for the \n     America's Voice network, a cable television network. The \n     interview--part of a series on some of the nation's political \n     leaders--was timed for Father's Day and is scheduled for \n     broadcasting over the weekend or next week.\n       Mr. Lott and Mr. Williams explored a range of social topics \n     from Mr. Lott's thoughts on disciplining children (he said \n     that on occasion he used a belt) to his opposition to \n     abortion to his views on the role of men and women in \n     marriage. He described his childhood growing up in \n     Mississippi in the late 1950's and early 1960's as a ``good \n     time for America.''\n       Mr. Lott has made his views on homosexuality known in the \n     past, speaking out in 1996 against a bill, narrowly defeated \n     by the Senate, that would have banned discrimination against \n     homosexuals in the work place. At the time he called the \n     legislation ``part of a larger and more audacious effort to \n     make the public accept behavior that most Americans consider \n     dangerous, unhealthy or just plain wrong.''\n       Asked today by Mr. Williams whether homosexuality is a sin, \n     Mr. Lott replied, ``Yes, it is.'' He added that ``in America \n     right now there's an element that wants to make that \n     alternative life style acceptable.''\n       Mr. Lott said: ``You still love that person and you should \n     not try to mistreat them or treat them as outcasts. You \n     should try to show them a way to deal with that.'' He said \n     his own father had had a problem with alcoholism, adding: \n     ``Others have a sex addiction or are kleptomaniacs. There are \n     all kinds of problems and addictions and difficulties and \n     experiences of this kind that are wrong. But you should try \n     to work with that person to learn to control that problem.''\n       With the investigation of President Clinton's connection to \n     a former White House intern as a backdrop, Mr. Lott also \n     spoke about his marriage to his wife, Tricia. He said he had \n     never been unfaithful in their 34 years of marriage ``because \n     I love her and because I believe that's wrong.''\n       Asked if he was ever tempted, he allowed: ``Sure I was. I'm \n     a human being.'' But he said he took great care to insure \n     that his behavior was beyond reproach. When he travels in his \n     Mississippi district with a woman who works for him as a \n     field worker, he said, ``I would never get in a situation \n     where it was just the two of us in a car.'' He said he took \n     that precaution ``because just the appearance bothered me.''\n       Mr. Lott said his opposition to abortion was taught to him \n     by his mother. He remembered coming home from high school and \n     telling his mother he thought abortion might be acceptable \n     under certain conditions, only to see her drop a dish towel \n     and burst into tears. ``She started crying and said, `If I \n     have raised you to have no moral respect for human life then \n     I have failed,' '' he said.\n       Mr. Lott, who is a Southern Baptist, stepped carefully when \n     asked about the Southern Baptist Convention's declaration \n     that a woman should ``submit herself graciously'' to her \n     husband's leadership. He said that he felt ``very strongly'' \n     about his faith, but said he would speak of marriage roles \n     ``in different terms.'' Spouses, he said, should ``serve each \n     other.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 16, 1998]\n\n           Lott: Gays Need Help ``To Deal With That Problem''\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said yesterday \n     that he believes homosexuality is a sin and that gay people \n     should be assisted in dealing with it ``just like \n     alcohol...or sex addiction...or kleptomaniac.''\n       While taping an interview for ``The Armstrong Williams \n     Show,'' a cable television program, Williams asked Lott if he \n     believed homosexuality is a sin. The senator replied, ``Yeah, \n     it is.''\n       Lott added: ``You should still love that person. You should \n     not try to mistreat them, or treat them as outcasts. You \n     should try to show them a way to deal with that problem, just \n     like alcohol...or sex addiction...or kleptomaniacs.\n       ``There are all kinds of problems, addictions, \n     difficulties, experiences of things that are wrong, but you \n     should try to work with that person to learn to control that \n     problem,'' he said.\n       Lott's comments show ``how the extreme right wing has a \n     stranglehold on the leadership'' of Congress, said Winnie \n     Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights Campaign, \n     the nation's biggest gay political organization, Stachelberg \n     also said Lott is ``out of step'' with scientific studies of \n     the causes of homosexuality.\n       Some groups believe homosexuality is a chosen lifestyle and \n     have searched for a ``cure'' for being gay. Many in the gay \n     community, however, insist that homosexuality is a matter of \n     biology.\n       ``The medical community, the mental health community for 20 \n     years now has\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\n     known homosexuality is not a disorder,'' Stachelberg said.\n       Lott spokeswoman Susan Irby declined to comment on \n     Stachelberg's remarks.\n       Williams, the television program host, said the interview \n     probably will be aired this week.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the majority leader, when asked whether \nor not homosexuality is a sin, stated, ``Yes, it is.'' He added that \n``in America right now there's an element that wants to make that \nalternative lifestyle acceptable.'' Then he went on to say, ``Others \nhave a sex addiction or are kleptomaniacs. There are all kinds of \nproblems and addictions and difficulties and experiences of this kind \nthat are wrong. But you should try to work with that person to learn to \ncontrol that problem.''\n  He also said--to be fair to the majority leader--``You still love \nthat person and you should not try to mistreat them or treat them as \noutcasts. You should try to show them a way to deal with that.'' That \nwas the beginning of the quote. I do not want to take anything out of \ncontext.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about calling homosexuality a sin, \ncomparing it to the problems of alcoholism or other diseases. I am \nconcerned because of the medical evidence. I am concerned because I \nthink that in many ways this statement takes us back quite a ways from \nwhere we are.\n  We do not bash each other here; and there is civility here. That is \nwhat I like best. So let me just simply say, the majority leader is \nentitled to his view and he is entitled to his vote. But I am \nconcerned. I have been on the floor of the Senate week after week \ntalking about the nomination of James Hormel. I really believe that, \ngiven this statement by the majority leader, and given other statements \nthat have been made, the U.S. Senate would be better off if we bring \nthis nomination to the floor.\n  It was literally back in November of last year, November 4, 1997, \nthat Mr. Hormel was voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nby a 16-2 vote. There have been holds on the nomination. We ought to \nbring it to the floor so that we can have an honest discussion. The \nmajority leader is entitled to his opinion and he is entitled to his \nvote, but the rest of us are also entitled to our opinions and we are \nentitled to our votes.\n  I think it is extremely important that this nomination be brought to \nthe floor; that we have an honest discussion. No acrimony whatsoever, \nbut please let us deal with this issue, and let us give Mr. Hormel the \nfairness that he deserves. I will not talk more about him right now. I \nwill not talk about his very distinguished career. But I must say, \ngiven the majority leader's statements, it makes me stronger in my \nbelief that we need to bring this nomination to the floor, and we need \nto have a discussion about this question.\n  It will be a civil discussion. It will be an honest discussion. I \nthink the vast majority of Senators are ready to vote for Mr. Hormel. I \nwill have an amendment that I will put on a bill that will deal with \nthis question, probably the first bill after the tobacco bill. But \nwhere I want to get to is to bring this nomination to the floor. \nOtherwise I worry about a climate that is going to become increasingly \npolarized, increasingly poisonous, and we do not want that to happen. \nWe do not want that to happen.\n  So I am hopeful that the U.S. Senate, in a spirit of civility and \nhonesty with one another, and honesty with Mr. James Hormel, will bring \nthis to the floor.\n  I thank my colleagues for letting me also mention this matter. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nhis legislation, which I am pleased to support.\n  I suppose it is round four in this battle. This is the fourth vote we \nwill have had on it. I think the Senator from Washington has attempted \nin good faith to deal with some of the complaints that have been raised \nabout capping attorneys' fees.\n  Our last vote was at $1,000 an hour. He has come in and said, well, \nif you establish certain things, and you started early, and you worked \nhard on this and are one of the people who really deserve credit for \nthis litigation, you could get up to $4,000--that is up to $4,000. So \nit should not be criticized as a guarantee of $4,000 per hour. I think \nthese judges would decide on that. But he caps it at that amount. For \nother people who were involved less in the case, it would be capped \nlater.\n  And to my good friend, the Senator from Minnesota, he talked about \nthe Minnesota perspective. I believe Minnesota has been at this some \ntime. They worked a number of hours on this case. They would be paid at \nleast $2,000, and I believe up to perhaps $4,000 per hour for their \nwork, depending on how much the judge were to give them. I think that \nis a very generous legal fee. As a matter of fact, it goes beyond what \nI would consider within the mainstream.\n  As a matter of fact, I was just called off the floor a few minutes \nago and met a group of young people from my home State. And I asked \nthem if they thought $4,000 an hour--how would they feel about that to \npay an attorney for doing legal work. And they did not think I was \nserious. They thought it was a joke. Talking about $4,000 an hour--that \nis a lot of money. So I think we have to deal with this.\n  Let me talk briefly about the fact that Senators on the other side \nhave suggested, well, we have an arbitration process. The arbitration \nprocess is not between the people who are paying the fees or the \ndefendants in the litigation. The arbitration process is between the \nplaintiffs, which in this case are the States represented by the \nattorneys general, and their attorneys, the plaintiffs' lawyers, the \nattorneys. And what it says is, if they are unable to agree; that is, \nthe attorney general and the lawyer he hired and who agreed to a \ncertain fee, if those two are unable to agree with respect to any \ndispute that may arise between them regarding the fee agreement--\nregarding the fee agreement--then the matter goes to arbitration, then \nthe matter goes to arbitration. Under the fee agreement, they are \ntalking about a 25 percent, 20 percent, 15 percent contingent fee, \nwhich would enrich these lawyers to an extraordinary degree.\n  What the Senator from Washington has understood--and I think his \nlegislation recognizes--is that a lot of the attorneys in this \nlitigation have done little or no work. A few of these cases were \nstarted early on; a lot of legal work was done; a lot of attorney \ninvestment and time and some personal funds were expended on behalf of \nthis litigation. And that is one thing.\n  But as the time went by, other States joined. Many of them joined in \na matter of weeks or a matter of months before the settlement by the \ntobacco companies was offered. Those lawyers now want to walk in and \nclaim 25 percent of what is being paid in, and they worked only a very \nfew hours on this case.\n  Some of these lawyers, it has been estimated, according to a \nprofessor from Cardozo Law School, are to receive as much as $92,000 \nper hour--$92,000 per hour--unless something is done about it. So I \nthink we have to act now. We have a responsibility to act. And I am \ncertain of that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from Alabama yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly will.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is the Senator from Alabama aware of the fact that the \nU.S. district court of Texas has determined that a legal fee of $2.3 \nbillion would be reasonable?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am aware of that. And I am glad the Senator from \nWashington made that insightful observation.\n  Mr. GORTON. Does not the Senator from Alabama agree that is a matter \nin which we here in the Congress, dealing with this bill, can be \ninterested in saying, no, that is too high?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly do.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to the Florida case, the trial judge found \nit was unconscionable, as I hope this body finds these fees are \nunconscionable. But that case has been reviewed at a higher court and \nthat opinion has been withdrawn.\n  So we don't know yet whether the lawyers in Florida will get $2.8 \nbillion that they request or not. In fact, Mr. Montgomery, the lead \nattorney in the case, said he fully expects to be paid what his fee \nagreement said. He expects to prevail. He says he has a contract.\n  How can we violate contracts? We violate contracts all the time in \nthis body. We are telling the tobacco companies they can't advertise. \nMany of them have advertising contracts extended for years. We are \nchanging the whole way of doing business about tobacco. Everything \nabout the tobacco business is being changed by this legislation. It is \na comprehensive legislation in which we deal with almost every aspect \nof it. One of those aspects ought to be how much these fees should \ncount for.\n  I was in Alabama recently to see one of the finest and biggest \nindustrial announcements in the history of the State and one of the \nlargest in the country. Boeing is going to build a rocket plant near \nDecatur. It is 50 acres under one roof. They told me with great pride \nthat the cost of that building and facility and land and construction \nwould be $450 million. We are talking about attorneys in Florida asking \n$2.8 billion, five or six times that much, five or six times the cost \nof one of the largest industrial announcements in America by one of the \nworld's largest corporations. That is the extent of the fees we are \ntalking about in Alabama. The general fund of the noneducation budget \nis less than $1 billion. These attorneys are asking for more than that.\n  As a matter of fact, a professor from Cardozo Law School estimates \nthat it will make 20 to 25 attorneys in America billionaires. I had my \nstaff check. I believe the Fortune Magazine that rates America's \nrichest people, the world's richest people, listed 60 billionaires in \nthe United States. This litigation, unless we act, could create 20 more \nbillionaires, many of whom have worked less than a year, maybe even \nonly a few months, on the cases with which they are dealing.\n  Now, I am not against a contingent fee. I support that concept. But \nthe attorneys and the attorneys general have come to the Congress and \nasked us to legislate. The plaintiff attorneys have and the attorneys \ngeneral have asked us to comprehensively review this entire process and \nlitigate on it. This is an unusual type of case because we have never \nseen these kind of moneys before and we have never seen these kind of \nfees before.\n  It is perfectly appropriate for us to contain them. As the Senator \nfrom Washington said, we limit fees to $125 an hour in equal access to \njustice cases. Appointed criminal attorneys in Federal court get paid \n$75 an hour. I think $2,000, $4,000 an hour is enough. It will make \nthem rich beyond all imagining, just that alone. If they haven't done \nany work on the case and don't have any hours into the case, they ought \nnot be made any more rich than they are.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In the Senator's previous amendment, didn't the Senator \nhave a cap of $1,000 an hour?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How can this Senator justify supporting an amendment now \nthat goes to $4,000 an hour?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am glad to answer that. First of all, if we don't cap \nit at $4,000 an hour, we are likely to end up as in Texas at $92,000 an \nhour. A judge has approved that fee in Texas. It is going to go \nthrough. So certainly this is better than nothing.\n\n  No. 2, the fee is capped at $4,000 an hour. A judge must consider the \nskill, the expertise, the commitment, and the value of the contribution \nof that attorney. Some flunky in the firm isn't going to be paid $4,000 \nan hour. The lead lawyers, the ones who have demonstrated the greatest \nskill and leadership and effectiveness, would have the opportunity to \nreach that high but no higher.\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\n  So it is certainly a step in the right direction and preferable to \nnothing, although, as you well know, I was very supportive of the \n$1,000-per-hour cap.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I ask the Senator a further question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is it not the case in the Texas matter that there has not \nbeen a dollar paid and there is no final resolution of that matter, \nthat that matter is on appeal, and the Governor has interceded in that \ncase?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. But the suggestion that judges are \ngoing to somehow guarantee that these exorbitant, as you indicated, \nunconscionable fees will not occur is not clear from that case because \nthe judge has, in fact, affirmed that case.\n  The Governor, George Bush of Texas, is doing everything he can to \nresist the payment of those exorbitant fees, but he has not yet \nprevailed. We don't need to have litigation in every State in America. \nWe ought to comprehensively legislate this legislation with all of the \nothers in this case.\n  Mr. CONRAD. One final question I ask of the Senator. Isn't the \nSenator concerned, as I am, that the $4,000-per-hour fee cap that is \nsupposed to be a cap, supposed to be a ceiling, could well turn into a \nfloor, and the fact is that we will see unconscionable attorneys' fees \nunder this amendment?\n  The Senator viewed $1,000 an hour as a limit and now this has $4,000 \nan hour as a limit. Isn't it possible that we will see absolutely \nunconscionable attorneys' fees out of an amendment like this?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me respond with a question. Does the Senator from \nNorth Dakota believe there should be no cap on the attorneys' fees?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from North Dakota believes that the Senate is \nill equipped to reach into the thousands of cases across the country \nand determine what is an appropriate fee. The Senator from North Dakota \nis the author of the arbitration provisions that are in this bill \nbecause I concluded after listening to witnesses on all sides that we \ncould see truly outrageous returns to attorneys, windfall profits for \nattorneys under the cases that are across the country. The best way to \nstop that was arbitration panels. Any time we fix an arbitrary fee \namount, it may be way too much or may turn out to be too little.\n  I must say, I can't imagine any circumstance in which $4,000 an hour \nis too little. I can imagine a circumstance in which, as a previous \namendment had $250 an hour proposed, I can imagine for those firms that \nwent out on their own nickel and took on the tobacco industry, that \nthey faced a very tough circumstance, $250 an hour may be too little.\n  I really am very concerned when we say $4,000 an hour and we put our \nstamp of approval on that. For every case that was filed back before \n1994, we will wind up with a circumstance where people get unjustly \nenriched.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand that, but the point clearly is this is a \ncap of $4,000 per hour. It is not a guarantee of $4,000 per hour. I \npreferred a cap of $1,000 per hour. The Senator from North Dakota \nopposed that. So we raised the figure now. I don't see how anybody can \ncomplain about this cap.\n  As to this arbitration agreement, it either does one of two things: \nIt either violates the contracts and, therefore, the legislation \nwritten by the Senator from North Dakota has, in fact, undertaken to \noverride the fee written agreement between the attorneys general and \ntheir plaintiff lawyers; or it does not.\n  I am afraid, however, that it doesn't do what the Senator from North \nDakota suggests, because the way I read it, the only complaint that can \nbe made is when the attorney general disagrees with the amount of the \nfee with the lawyer he hired. The exact language is:\n\n       With respect to any dispute that may arise between them \n     regarding the fee agreement, the matter shall be submitted to \n     arbitration.\n\n  So, I am not sure that this arbitration agreement has any impact \nwhatever on attorneys' fees. The only thing that would happen is some \njudges may find it unconscionable and just refuse to enforce it. That \nis obvious to us, that many of these agreements are unconscionable and \nought not to be enforced.\n  With regard to the Florida fee where the judge held it to be \nunconscionable, those lawyers have worked a pretty good while on that \ncase. They have done a pretty good amount of work.\n  The lawyers in Mississippi and Texas have put in a lot of work. The \nlawyers in Minnesota have put in a lot of work. But there are quite a \nnumber of States where the attorneys have done almost no work and they \nexpect to receive a billion dollars. A lawyer, Mr. Angelos, who I \nbelieve owns the Baltimore Orioles, had a 25 percent agreement with the \nState of Maryland. After the case collapsed and they agreed to pay the \nmoney--and I don't know how long after he filed the lawsuit, but he \ncertainly wasn't one of the early hard workers on the litigation--he \nagreed to cut his fee in half to 12.5 percent. That was real generous \nof him. As I read that in the newspapers, that was a billion dollars. \nThat 12.5 percent was over a billion dollars. And he has done almost \nnothing.\n  These are fees the likes of which the world has never seen in \nhistory. The amount of work that went into obtaining these fees is \nminuscule in many cases, and as we are going about tobacco legislation, \nwe simply ought not to allow it to happen. I can't say how strongly I \nbelieve that is true. No bill should come out of this Congress that \ndoes not have a realistic cap on attorneys' fees. To do so would be to \ndishonor the taxpayers of this country. And to argue, as some have, \nthat it is being paid by the lawyers or the tobacco companies, and \ntherefore not paid by the citizens of the country, is likewise an \nimproper and unacceptable argument.\n  The truth is that any way you look at it, it is money paid by the \ntobacco companies to settle the lawsuit. It is sort of unwise and \nunhealthy, in my opinion, for it to be structured this way. Well, the \nplaintiff lawyers who are representing the State of Alabama, or the \nState of Mississippi, say: State of Mississippi, you don't have to pay \nmy fee; I will just take my fee over here from the tobacco companies; \nthey will pay it.\n  Well, one of the classic rules of law is that a person who pays your \nfee is the one you have loyalty to. It creates an impermissible \nconflict of interest, in my view, between the attorney and his true \nclient--the State--that he is representing. So sometimes they argue \nthat it doesn't count because it was paid by the tobacco companies. \nThat is bad from an ethical point of view, in my opinion. It is also an \nunjustified argument, because the tobacco company doesn't care whether \nthe money they pay goes to the attorneys' fees or to the State, they \njust want the lawsuit to end, so they will pay some of it over there \nand some over there. They just say, ``Tell me where you want me to pay \nit, State of North Dakota, and I will write the check. Do you want me \nto write a billion dollars to the attorneys? I will do it. Or I will \nwrite you a check for $4 billion. Whatever you say.'' It is just money \nto settle a lawsuit to them. Certainly that billion dollars could have \nbeen put in for health care, tax reductions, and other good things. So \nthat argument, to me, is very unhealthy.\n  In the history of litigation throughout the entire world, we have \nnever seen the kind of enrichment possibilities that exist for \nattorneys as it exists in this case. With regard to the Florida case, \nalthough the trial judge found it unconscionable and he tried his best \nto eliminate it, his opinion has been withdrawn and is not the final \ncourt opinion. The attorney who stands to gain the money still asserts \nhe hopes to get those fees exactly as he was promised. With regard to \nTexas, a judge has approved a $2.3 billion attorney fee already. I \ndon't know if Governor Bush can succeed in turning that around or not. \nHe is doing all he can to do so, as well he should, because when you \nconsider how much Texas could use $2.3 billion, as any State could, he \nought to resist the loss of that revenue for the people of Texas.\n\n  I think the Senator from Washington has worked hard on this \namendment. He has listened to the objections from the other side, and \nhe has sought to draft a piece of legislation that would meet those \nobjections. It pays a little more than I think is necessary, but it \nwould have a significant impact in containing the most unconscionable \nfees that are likely to occur in this matter. I think he has done a \ngood job with it. It certainly does not mandate $4,000-\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\nper-hour fees. A judge has to justify those kinds of fees in a finding. \nThat should mean that young lawyers who may have just done basic \nbackground work, or a little research and other types things, won't be \npaid $4,000; only the very best will.\n  I think it is a good step forward. We will now see who wants to pay \nthese attorneys a legitimate wage for their work. This is a legitimate \nwage for their work. I expect that we would have bipartisan support for \nSenator Gorton's amendment. It is a good amendment. It is a generous \namendment for the trial lawyers. It rewards them to a degree that is \nunheard of for their work. I don't know of any fees I have ever heard \nof at $4,000 per hour. It ought to bring this matter to a conclusion. \nAgain, I don't believe we will have any legislation on tobacco that \ndoes not contain a limitation on attorneys' fees, and that certainly \nrepresents my opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a well-intentioned amendment but \nit is a profound mistake--absolutely profound. The Senator from Alabama \nsaid the courts would have to justify paying the $4,000 an hour \nprovided for in this amendment. We have just provided the \njustification. If you read the amendment, it says, ``The amendment sets \nthe following limits on attorney's fees: $4,000 an hour for actions \nfiled before 12/31/94.''\n  Well, guess what? If you file an action before 12/31/94, you just hit \nthe gusher, you get $4,000 an hour. And the U.S. Senate has said that \nis OK. I don't think the Senate of the United States should say OK to \n$4,000 an hour for every case filed before 12/31/94. How can we \npossibly justify that on the floor of the U.S. Senate?\n  This amendment says that you get $2,000 an hour for any action filed \nbetween 12/31/94 and 4/1/97--$2,000 an hour. Again, you hit the \njackpot. It is almost like playing instant lotto and you are a \nguaranteed winner, because if you filed a case before 12/31/94, you get \n$4,000 an hour, and the U.S. Senate says that is an appropriate fee. \nWell, this Senator is not going to say that is an appropriate fee, and \nthis Senator is not going to say it is an appropriate fee to provide \n$2,000 an hour if you filed any time between 12/31/94 and 4/1/97--\nabsolutely not.\n  The Senator from Washington argued persuasively on the last \namendment, which had a $1,000 cap, that it might be too much or it \nmight be too little. Now we have $4,000. Well, I can guarantee you \nthat, in most cases, that is far too much. Yet, the U.S. Senate will be \non record as saying that is an appropriate legal fee. I don't think it \nis an appropriate legal fee. As one Senator, I am not going to endorse \nthat.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator recognize that the language that he \nquoted starts off and says, ``attorneys' fees as approved by the court \nin such action'' and ``any attorneys' fees shall not exceed the per \nhour rate of . . .'' Then there is a set of criteria for the judge to \nconsider what the hourly fee should be. I suggest that very few will \njustify reaching that rate. But whatever, it will be decided by judges \non a case-by-case basis.\n  As the Senator suggested, he believes that some cases are different. \nThis allows flexibility.\n  Would the Senator not agree with that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No; the Senator would not agree with that, because this \nis the exact criterion that is included in the bill with respect to \nreforming the arbitration panel decisions--the exact same criterion. I \nknow what is going to happen. The courts out there are going to see \nthat the U.S. Senate says that it is appropriate to bill $4,000 an hour \nif your action was filed before 12-31-94. That is what is intended--is \nthe ceiling is going to become a floor. And we are going to see case \nafter case where the attorneys are unjustly enriched at $4,000 an hour.\n  That is exactly what is wrong with this kind of an amendment. It is \narbitrary, it is capricious, it sets a limit that allows for unjust \nenrichment, and it will have the stamp of endorsement of the U.S. \nSenate. That is a profound mistake. We shouldn't be in the business of \ndeciding what the legal fees are in any case. That is not our business. \nThat is overreach. That is the kind of micromanagement that people on \nthe other side of the aisle have warned us against. It is the kind of \nthing that people resent, because they know we can't possibly know the \nfactual matter in each and every case that is before a court in every \njurisdiction in this country. For us to substitute our judgment for \nState judges' determinations of what are the appropriate legal fees in \na case is a profound mistake. We shouldn't do it.\n  I go on to point out in the amendment that the Senator from \nWashington just changed his amendment. The change he made is very \ninteresting. He just sent a modification to the desk that says, upon \npetition by any interested party, the attorneys' fees shall be \ndetermined by the last court in which the action was pending.\n  Those words don't seem to really mean much. But do you know, they \nmean a lot. They mean a lot. What they mean is that in the four cases \nthat have already been resolved where the tobacco industry has agreed \nto pay the attorneys, that now they would be able to come in the back \ndoor and challenge the fees that they already agreed to. That is what \nthis language could do. This little modification was just sent so \nquietly to the desk and received no explanation. ``Any interested \nparty.'' That means Philip Morris might challenge the attorneys' fees \nof the attorneys that brought the case against Philip Morris. That is a \npretty good deal.\n  That is exactly the kind of thing we shouldn't be doing. That is not \nthe kind of thing we should be allowing. That isn't the kind of thing \nthat should be permitted here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who are well intended on the other side, \nto put in a stamp of approval by the U.S. Senate that $4,000 an hour is \nan appropriate legal fee is just a profound mistake. We embarrass this \nChamber, we embarrass this Congress, by putting our stamp of approval \nand say $4,000 an hour is OK. I don't believe the Senator from Alabama \nbelieves $4,000--I mean, I think it is preposterous, and yet we are \nabout to vote seriously on an amendment that says $4,000 an hour is OK. \nI don't think it is OK. I don't think it should be approved.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, here we go again.\n  There are people who hate trial lawyers just intuitively and \ninstinctively. I guess the fact that I used to be one before I was \nelected to the House of Representatives, I kind of take exception to \nthat observation.\n  But I can recall times in my legal practice when people would walk \ninto my office who were literally dirt poor. They didn't have any \nmoney. They had been injured, or they had some claim. And, frankly, the \nonly opportunity they had to go to court was if an attorney said, ``OK, \nwe will take it on a contingency-fee basis. If we can win the case, \nthen you pay a part of the winnings. If we don't win, you don't pay \nanything.'' Contingency fee, trial lawyers--for a lot of people, it is \ntheir only ticket to the courthouse.\n  Who in the world can come up with $50,000 or $100,000 to pay some \nlawyer or some legal firm when they need representation? A lot of \nAmericans just can't do that.\n  So this is really a system of justice which gives the plaintiff a \nticket to the door of the courthouse on a contingent basis: ``If we \nwin, you pay the lawyer. If we lose, the lawyer gets nothing.''\n  Take the case of the tobacco companies. Imagine, if you will, 42 \nState attorneys general who said, ``We want to sue the tobacco \ncompanies, the largest corporations in America, the most politically \npowerful, a group that never loses a lawsuit. How are we going to do \nthat?'' You can't stop the business of representing the attorney \ngeneral of Illinois or California. The only way you can do this is by \ngoing to the private sector, to private attorneys, and saying to them, \n``Will you give us a contingent-fee deal here?'' In other words, ``Will \nyou join the State attorneys general in suing the tobacco companies? \nAnd, if we win--if we win--you will be\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\npaid. If we lose, you won't get anything.'' Contingency fee basis. \nTrial lawyers.\n\n  And imagine the tobacco company executives when finally it dawned on \nthem that 42 States had found these law firms around the country \nwilling to take on the risk, willing to take the gamble. Was it a \ngamble, or was this a sure thing? History tells us it was the biggest \nlegal gamble in the history of America. The tobacco companies had never \nlost a lawsuit--never. Yet, these law firms came forward and said, ``We \nwill help the State attorneys general. We will sign on a contingency-\nfee basis. Win or lose, let's see what happens.'' We know what \nhappened. It ended up that the tobacco companies came to the \nrealization that they couldn't win. They sat down about a year ago with \nthe States' attorneys general and tried to hammer out some kind of an \nagreement. Part of that agreement has to be, ``How are we going to pay \nthese attorneys? We agreed we would pay them for what they were going \nto do if we won.''\n  Now come the tobacco companies and those people who have no use for \ntrial lawyers to the floor of the U.S. Senate and say, ``We want to \nhave a voice in this process. We want to rewrite these agreements. We \nwant to decide what was fair and unfair.''\n  I don't think this is a fundamentally sound amendment. I think we \nshould defeat this amendment. Let me give you one basic reason why we \nshould defeat this amendment: Because the critics of the trial lawyers, \nthe critics of the attorneys who brought these lawsuits against the \ntobacco companies, have done it again, ladies and gentleman. They have \ncome in and said it is an outrage to pay lawyers this amount of money, \nan absolute disgrace, if they are plaintiffs' lawyers, if they are \nlawyers representing people who died of cancer, if they are \nrepresenting people in the State of Illinois who paid out millions of \ndollars in taxes. But did they put any limit whatsoever on the fees \npaid to tobacco company lawyers? Not one word.\n  Take a look at this amendment. It is disgraceful for us to stand up \nhere and say this is a matter of justice, that we are not going to \nallow these attorneys to be paid that amount of money, and to exempt \nthe tobacco companies' lawyers. Make no mistake: In these lawsuits, \nthese law firms representing tobacco companies have been raking in \nmillions and millions and millions of dollars for decades. Now we know, \nbecause of the suit in Minnesota, for example, that there has been an \neffort to hide important documents behind the attorney-client \nprivilege. We know these lawyers have been complicit in this effort. Do \nwe punish them with this amendment? No, no, no, no. Our anger for \nlawyers is reserved only for those lawyers who sue tobacco companies, \nnot for the lawyers who defend tobacco companies.\n  Let me tell you that I think this is fundamentally unfair. It is \nfundamentally unfair for us to step in at this stage in the \nproceedings, not only because of the injustice which it does to the \nlawsuits which have been filed but because if this amendment passes, it \napplies to future lawsuits as well. Who will stand up in the future and \ntackle the billionaire giant tobacco companies with the prospect of \nlimitation of legal fees of this magnitude? Four thousand dollars \nsounds so exceedingly generous until you wonder and speculate what is \nat risk here. How would a law firm decide to dedicate all of its \nresources and all of its time for an entire year or more to try to get \nto trial against the tobacco companies? What a gamble. What a risk. And \nthe people who are pushing this amendment want to make certain that \ncouldn't happen again. They want to close the courthouse doors to make \nsure that people who head up tobacco companies are not going to be \nintimidated by these lawsuits.\n  We would not be here today on the floor of the Senate, we would not \nbe discussing a tobacco bill, if it were not for the initiative of the \nState attorneys general and were it not for the cooperation of these \nprivate attorneys who got involved in the lawsuit.\n  You hear a lot of speculation: ``You know these lawyers get paid \nbillions of dollars. Isn't that too much?'' Yes; I think it is. But \nthat is my judgment. The judgment in the bill says it will be made by \narbitration panels. We will have people sit down and decide what is \nfair. And in States, they have dramatically reduced the attorneys' fees \nthat would have come to these private firms with these judges' \ndecisions and arbitration panels. And that will continue. That is the \nright thing to do. But for us to step up as the U.S. Senate to \nintervene in this debate and say that we know best, to say that the \nfirms that came forward to have the courage to take on the tobacco \ncompanies should now be ignored and their agreements be ignored, their \ncontracts pushed off the table, we know best here in the U.S. Senate, I \nthink it is an outrage. It is an outrage for us, and it is an outrage \nfor those in the future who count on this mechanism, who count on the \nopportunity to go into court and to plead their case in order to find \njustice.\n  How many times in the history of this country have this Congress and \nthe President failed to act and relied on the courts? So many times in \nmy lifetime. I can recall the civil rights struggle. It generally \nstarted in the courts. It wasn't until the important cases in the 1950s \nthat finally Congress could muster the courage to deal with this thorny \nissue. And the same thing is true on tobacco. I have been fighting \nthese tobacco companies as long as I have been in Congress.\n  I have had some victories and I have had some defeats. They are tough \ncustomers, and they have a lot of money. And boy do they have a lot of \nfriends in the House and Senate. They found out there was one group \nthey could not buy, the judicial system. They found out that when \nlawyers could come into court before a jury of peers and argue the case \nabout their deadly product and what they were doing with it, they could \nnot win. A year ago they threw in the towel and said, ``We are ready to \nsettle. We are ready to make big changes in the way we market our \nproduct.''\n  That never would have happened were it not for the judicial system, I \nam sorry to say. And now we have those who resent that system, the \ntobacco companies, critics of trial lawyers, who say, ``Isn't it a \nshame that this happened the way it did. We are going to rewrite \nhistory. We are going to change the terms for these attorneys.''\n  We cannot let them do it because, ladies and gentlemen, we do not \nknow where the next argument is going to be and where the next case \nwill be. These were 42 cases brought on behalf of 42 different States. \nIn my home State of Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan, a Republican, \na man I admire for the courage in filing this lawsuit, stood up for our \ntaxpayers. Michael Moore in Mississippi was the man who initiated that \naction.\n  And now we come to the question, Are we going to close the door in \nthe future to this opportunity? Which will be the group that wants to \ntake on the tobacco companies? How will they muster the resources? How \nwill they put together the lawsuit and the case law to prevail? If this \namendment passes, we are tying their hands. We are saying to them that \nin the future you will not have the same chance as these 42 different \nattorneys general.\n  That is fundamentally unfair. To do this and tie the hands of the \nplaintiffs' attorneys, the attorneys representing the people, while \nsaying that the tobacco lawyers can continue to rake it in, millions of \ndollars deceiving, millions of dollars defending, that is fundamentally \nwrong. I stand in opposition to this amendment.\n  We have an important bill here, a bill that can reduce the number of \ndeaths in America from tobacco. It is a shame that we are diverted now \nin a battle against trial lawyers. This should be a battle against the \ntobacco company tactics that lure our children into a nicotine \naddiction, which for one out of three of them means an early grave. \nThat is what this bill is really about. It is not about lawyers. It is \nabout our kids. I sincerely hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nreally superb presentation. He makes many important points about what \nthis amendment is about. I just want to direct my final remarks to \nthose who may think, as I do, that some lawyers are in line for unjust \nenrichment. I tell you it makes my blood boil to hear\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\nlawyers in Texas may get $2 billion. That is outrageous. That is \nunconscionable. I do not believe it is going to happen. That matter is \non appeal.\n  In Florida, when the lawyers there submitted bills like that, the \ncourt said it was unconscionable and told them to forget it. That is \nwhat every State court ought to do when presented with unconscionable \nclaims by lawyers in these cases.\n  I have to say to my colleagues who are thinking about voting for this \namendment, you are going to have to be able to go back home and justify \nthe Senate of the United States saying $4,000 an hour is OK. I do not \nbelieve it is. I do not believe you can justify going back home and \nsaying, yes, I voted for an amendment that would provide $4,000 an hour \nfor any case filed before 12-31 of 1994. I do not think people in my \nState would think the Senate ought to say, well, $4,000 an hour is OK \nfor every case filed before 12-31 of 1994. Boy, I tell you, the best \nlawyers in my State bill about $150 an hour. And now we would be \nsaying, well, in a tobacco case, if you just happened to file before \nthis magical date of 12-31-94, you get $4,000 an hour. And the Senate \nhas said that is OK. Boy, I tell you, I think that would be a profound \nmistake.\n\n  Let me just say the Senator from Illinois is also correct; there are \ncircumstances where some of the limits are not enough. The $500 an hour \nwhich is provided for in this amendment for cases filed after 6-15 of \n1998 may be too little. If we discover, going through the documents, \nthat there is some new legal theory to take on the tobacco industry but \nwe say to firms across America you are limited to $500 an hour when you \ndo not have any idea whether you are going to win or not and you may \nhave to put millions of dollars into making the case and then the \nSenate, in its wisdom, says you are limited to $500 an hour, that is \nprobably too little. What law firm is going to take the case?\n  And then, as the Senator from Illinois has pointed out, interestingly \nenough, this amendment applies to one set of lawyers, the lawyers for \nthe people who are hurt by these products. The lawyers for the families \nof somebody who has contracted cancer or has lung disease or has heart \ndisease, they are limited but the tobacco industry lawyers are not. And \nthe bizarre thing is the limits that are put on here may well be far \ntoo much. I really cannot see justifying $4,000 an hour. I don't know \nhow that gets justified. And $2,000 an hour if you filed between 12-31-\n94 and 4-1-97; $1,000 an hour for actions filed before 4-1-97 and 6-15-\n98, those are pretty fancy numbers where I come from. So I just think \nthis amendment is a mistake and ought to be rejected by our colleagues.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak, yet again, on \nthe issue of limiting tobacco trial lawyer fees to a reasonable level.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has repeatedly refused to limit the fees to \na reasonable wage. And, now we are forced to consider an amendment to \nallow tobacco trial lawyers to earn as much as $4,000 an hour!\n  But--Mr. President--$4000 an hour is better than the alternative and \nit's about all we have left. We've tried to cap the fees at a \nreasonable level, and that's been rejected. A cap of $4000 an hour is \nour last alternative. If we fail to pass the Gorton amendment, then we \nwill be allowing attorneys to make as much as $88,000 an hour!\n  Let me remind my colleagues of how we got to $4000 an hour. First, we \ntried to limit the fees to $250 an hour--nearly 50 times the minimum \nwage. This attempt was soundly rejected by the Senate. $250 an hour was \nsimply not enough for the trial lawyers.\n  So, Senator Faircloth, Senator Sessions and I got together to regroup \nand try again. We discussed how much is enough for the trial lawyers? \n$500/hour? $750/hour?\n  We debated these amounts--and frankly--it turned our stomachs to \nthink about the federal government approving a bill to give tobacco \ntrial lawyers $500 an hour or $750 an hour. Especially when you \nconsider that the average lawyer in America only earns about $48 an \nhour and the average doctor only earns about $100 an hour.\n  But, we knew that it would be difficult to get the friends of the \ntrial bar to agree to any limit at all. So, we held our noses and \nintroduced a new amendment to cap the lawyer fees at $1000 an hour! \nSurely, $1000 an hour would be considered a fair wage for the trial \nbar.\n  Mr. President, was $1,000 an hour enough for the friends of the trial \nbar? No, absolutely not. They needed much more. They wanted to maintain \nthe status quo. They wanted the Senate to keep the National Trial \nLawyer Enrichment Bill intact.\n  The friends of the trial bar wanted us to continue to allow: lawyers \nin Minnesota to earn $4,500 an hour; lawyers in Florida to earn $7,000 \nan hour--assuming of course that these Florida lawyers worked 24 hours \na day for three-and-a-half years; lawyers in Mississippi to earn \n$10,000 an hour; and lawyers in Texas to earn $88,000 an hour.\n  So, we tried to cap the fees at $1000 an hour and we lost 50-45. We \ngot closer, but still not enough.\n  So Senator Gorton has put together a comprehensive outer-limits \namendment that says--$4,000 an hour is better than $88,000 an hour. \nSurely, we can get 51 Senators to agree to that notion.\n  Now, let me take a minute to address two or three issues raised by \nthe proponents of unlimited billionaire fees for trial lawyers.\n  Billionaire Lawyer Argument No. 1: ``We're just businesspeople, like \nanybody else'':\n  First, Senator Daschle argued a few days ago that the Senate should \nnot limit plaintiff's lawyer fees because ``[a] lawyer is a legal \nbusinessperson.'' So, Senator Daschle is effectively arguing that we \nshould no longer see lawyers as lawyers, but rather we should see them \nas businessmen and venture capitalists--a few good men looking to make \na buck.\n  With all due respect, I could not disagree more. Lawyers are not \nsupposed to be businessmen and businesswoman out to make up a buck. It \nis this type of make-a-buck-at-any-cost mentality that drives so much \nwasteful and frivolous litigation in our society. Too often, litigation \nis about enriching the lawyer, not compensating the client.\n  Mr. President, every first-year law student is taught that he or she \nis not some businessperson out to make a buck. I remember my days in \nlaw school where our professors taught us that we were supposed to be \nfiduciaries--representing the interests of our client, not our own \nselfish, profit-making interests.\n  In fact, legal ethics prohibit attorneys from charging fees that are \nnot ``reasonable.'' As Professor Lester Brickman explained in today's \nWall Street Journal: ``If the standard of reasonableness has any \nmeaning, it is surely violated by fees of tens of thousands of dollars \nan hour?''\n  Moreover, Professor Brickman concluded:\n\n       The public has a compelling interest in preserving legal \n     ethics, including th[e] rule that fees must be reasonable. \n     The higher the fees tort lawyers get, the greater the share \n     they take of injured clients' recoveries. Moreover, the \n     higher the fees, the more tort litigation and the more costs \n     that are imposed on society. The civil justice system, which \n     generates the fees that Mr. Daschle does not want curbed, \n     exists to serve citizens. Lawyers are not businesspeople; \n     they are professionals entrusted with the people's \n     businesses.\n\n  So, Mr. President, every lawyer in America knows that he or she has \nno constitutional right to charge excessive and unreasonable fees. We \nmust pass the Gorton amendment as our last best hope of ensuring that \nthe fees get somewhere near reasonable and rational.\n  Billionaire Lawyer Argument No. 2: ``Private Contracts Can Never Be \nAltered'':\n  Second, the proponents of unlimited lawyer fees argue that the \nfederal government cannot interfere with private contracts in any way, \nshape or form.\n  This argument is absolutely nonsensical. The tobacco bill is full of \nprovisions that may force tobacco companies to abrogate contracts with \nretailers and advertisers--among others. The Supreme Court has made \nclear that ``Congress may set minimum wages, control prices, or create \ncauses of action that did not previously exist.''\n\n  Furthermore, the Court has made clear that private parties may not \npreempt governmental action by simply entering a contract. Can you \nimagine if every time that we passed a new minimum wage law, we \nexempted all employers who have a previous contract\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nwith their employees to pay at a level lower than the new minimum wage? \nCan you imagine the outcry in the Senate if we exempted private parties \nfrom a new minimum wage law whenever those parties had a contract \n``preempting'' Congressional action?\n  I also find it curious that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle argue on the one hand that the right of contract is inviolate and \nabove Congressional action--yet on the other hand, argue that the right \nof contract may be violated by some unknown arbitration panel.\n  So, the friends of plaintiffs bar argue that an unknown arbitration \npanel may modify contracts, but the United States Senate--the elected \nrepresentatives of the people--may not modify fee contracts.\n  Which one is it? Can we adjust these contracts or can we not adjust \ncontracts? Mr. President, we can't have it both ways. We can't say out \nof one side of our mouths that the fees and contracts can be adjusted \nby an arbitration panel, and then say out of the other side of our \nmouth that the fees and contracts are a done deal and may not be \nadjusted by Congressional action.\n  The bill as currently written says that all types of contracts can be \nadjusted by this sweeping federal regulatory bill. In particular, the \nbill says that lawyer fee contracts can be adjusted by an arbitration \npanel.\n  So, frankly, I am tired of hearing that contracts cannot be adjusted \nand that fees cannot be made reasonable. If we are giving the \narbitration panel the ability to adjust contracts and fees, then it is \nperfectly consistent to establish a fee ceiling and a frame of \nreference for adjusting these contracts and fees.\n  Billionaire Lawyer Argument No. 3: ``$4,000 Is Too Generous'':\n  I was amazed this morning to hear those who carry the water for the \ntrial bar arguing that $4,000/hour is too much money for their friends \nto earn. Yes, Mr. President, you heard me right. Some of the friends of \nthe trial bar are now arguing that $4,000 an hour is too much money for \nthe trial bar.\n  So, let me get this straight. $250 an hour is not enough money for \nthe lawyers. But, $4,000 an hour is too much money for the lawyers.\n  What about something in between $250 and $4,000? Oh, say, $1,000 an \nhour. What about $1,000 an hour as a midpoint? Oh wait a minute, the \nSenate rejected that amount to.\n  So $250 an hour is not enough. $4,000 an hour is too much. And, \n$1,000, I suppose, just doesn't feel right.\n  If $4,000 an hour is too high, then what is $88,000 an hour?\n  I'll tell you what $88,000 an hour is--it's how much money we are \ngoing to allow the attorney general to pay the lawyers in Texas if we \ndon't pass the Gorton amendment.\n  We must pass the Gorton amendment. It deals with every possible \npermutation and takes into account any variation in degrees of risk \nassumed by the plaintiffs' lawyers.\n  It provides a cap of $4,000 an hour for all the attorneys who suited \nup and led the fight to kill tobacco in the earliest stages of the war.\n  It provides a cap of $2,000 an hour for those who signed up when the \nwar was coming to a close in the national settlement last spring and \nsummer.\n  It then provides a cap of $1,000 an hour for any lawyer who ran onto \nthe battlefield after the settlement was signed, and a cap of $500 an \nhour for all lawyers who will rush straight to the courthouse as soon \nas we pass this fee cap.\n  Senator Gorton has covered the waterfront here. I hope that we can \npass this amendment as the last best hope for a fee cap.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am shocked that the Senate rejected \ntwo prior attempts to limit these attorneys' fees, and I am amazed that \nwe are here to debate whether a four thousand dollar per hour cap is \nenough for the trial lawyers.\n  Over the past few days, a number of constituents asked me how we \ncould possibly condone paying these lawyers more than 250 dollars per \nhour, which was the rate in my original amendment.\n  Where I come from, Mr. President, 250 dollars is an incredible amount \nof money. That is a weekly wage for a lot of working people. These are \nthe same working people, I might add, whose taxes we are raising to pay \nthese lawyers' fees. This bill is an unparalleled transfer of wealth \nfrom the poor to the super-rich.\n  My constituents were upset about 250 dollar per hour and 1000 per \nhour payments to lawyers, but I explained that the Texas lawyers expect \nto make ninety-two thousand dollars per hour, and my constituents \nenthusiastically agreed that these caps were better than ninety-two \nthousand dollars per hour. The Texas lawyers have already been paid \nninety million dollars and expect more than two-point-two billion \ndollars more.\n  In fact, the Attorney General of Texas is so intent on paying them \ntheir two-point-three billion dollars in fees that he filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Governor because the Governor tried to intervene on behalf \nof the taxpayers who will foot the bill. Yes, the taxpayers, because \nthe Attorney General admitted to the New York Times on May 27 that part \nof the attorneys' fees will come from the Federal Government.\n  It is a betrayal of the American people, the taxpayers, to raise \ntheir taxes to pay lawyers four thousand dollars per hour. That's more \nthan most families make in a month. That is outrageous. Working \nAmericans--people scraping to pay the mortgage--being asked to pay for \nmore luxury houses and yachts for billionaire trial lawyers. It's an \nabuse of the taxpayers. Yes, the taxpayers, that's what the Texas \nAttorney General said.\n  It is important to note that this is a cap, not a flat fee, so few \nlawyers should expect to be paid at the top end of these categories. \nThe amendment limits the number of cases that fall within the top \ncategory to just a handful. That is a critical distinction, Mr. \nPresident, and one that makes this amendment more attractive to those \nof us shocked by these numbers.\n  However, as the Senate rejected my previous two amendments to limit \nfees, I have no alternative but to vote for these higher dollar \nnumbers. These outrageous numbers are testament to the strength of the \nultimate Washington special interest, the special interest most \ninclined to put personal interest above national interest, the trial \nlawyers.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this amendment, but I do so only \nbecause some limitation is better than no limitation on these predatory \nand, I might add, unethical attorneys' fees payments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the Gorton amendment. This \namendment would create a complicated, bureaucratic and arbitrary set of \ncriteria for establishing payments to the plaintiffs' lawyers while \nleaving the fees of the tobacco companies' lawyers without restriction. \nThe amendment would set forth unusually high hourly amounts for \nattorneys' fees which could lead to higher payments. The underlying \nlegislation establishes a preferable process by setting up a three-\nperson arbitration board to resolve disputes regarding the attorneys' \nfees. The board would have a representative of the plaintiff, a \nrepresentative of the attorney, and a third party chosen jointly by \nthose two arbitrators.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, we have an order for \nadjournment at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is to adjourn at 12:30.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that we might extend that for 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Durbin and Senator Conrad have pointed out, \nthe current amendment is not really about saving money for the States. \nThe amendment is one more backhanded attempt to protect the tobacco \nindustry. It is the third amendment offered on attorneys' fees. The \nprior two were rejected by a substantial majority. It is a transparent \neffort to distract attention from the enormous public health issues on \nwhich the American people want us to focus. Let's defeat this amendment \nand turn our attention to stopping youth smoking.\n  The Senate has debated this landmark youth smoking reduction bill for\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\na month. Each of us has had an ample opportunity to state our views. \nThe Senate should commit to vote on final passage this week. We owe it \nto the children who are being entrapped into a life of addiction and \npremature death by the tobacco industry every day.\n  The opponents of this legislation have used every parliamentary tool \nat their disposal to extend the debate and divert attention to an \nunrelated issue. They want to talk about every subject but the impact \nof smoking on the Nation's health. However, the real issue cannot be \nobscured by their verbal smokescreen. It is time for us to move from \ntalking to voting. Each day that the opponents delay final Senate \npassage of the bill, 3,000 more children begin to smoke and a third of \nthese children will die prematurely from lung cancer, emphysema, heart \ndisease, and other smoking-caused illnesses.\n  Each day that we delay, the price of a pack of cigarettes will \ncontinue to be affordable to the Nation's children and more and more of \nthem will take up this deadly habit. And each day that we delay, \ntobacco will continue to target children with billions of dollars in \nadvertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity, \nexcitement, and success for young men and women who start smoking. Each \nday that we delay, millions of nonsmokers will be exposed to secondhand \nsmoke. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, secondhand \nsmoke causes 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the United \nStates--more than all other regulated hazardous air pollutants \ncombined. Secondhand smoke is also responsible for as many as 60 \npercent of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young \nchildren.\n\n  Each day that we delay, tobacco will remain virtually the only \nproduct manufactured for human consumption that is not subject to \nfederal health and safety regulations, despite the fact that it causes \nover 400,000 deaths a year.\n  Preventing this human tragedy should be the Senate's first order of \nbusiness. With so much at stake for so many of our children, it is \ntruly irresponsible for the opponents of this legislation to practice \nthe politics of obstruction. Let the Senate vote.\n  The public supports this bill overwhelmingly, despite the tobacco \nindustry's extravagantly funded campaign of misinformation.\n  A new poll released this morning shows that the American people want \nthe McCain bill to pass by a margin of two to one; 62 percent support \nthe legislation, while only 31 percent oppose it. The American people \ncan see through the tobacco industry's smokescreen, why can't the \nSenate?\n  The same survey shows that the public knows who will be responsible \nif the McCain bill does not pass. By a 2\\1/2\\ to 1 margin, the American \npeople say the Republicans in Congress will be most responsible if the \nbill dies. By a similar margin, voters say they would be more likely to \nvote for a candidate who supported the McCain bill, and less likely to \nvote for a candidate who opposed it.\n  This bill will do an effective job of providing that protection for \nour children. It will save 5 million of today's children from a \nlifetime of addiction and premature death. It contains a series of \nstrong provisions that have withstood repeated attempts to weaken them:\n  It contains a substantial price increase to keep children from \nstarting to smoke.\n  It gives the FDA strong authority to regulate tobacco like the drug \nit is.\n  It has tough restrictions on advertising, to stop tobacco companies \nfrom cynically targeting children.\n  It contains a strong lookback provision that requires large \nadditional payments by tobacco companies if they fail to meet the \ntargets in the bill for reducing youth smoking in the years ahead.\n  It gives no immunity from liability to the tobacco companies for the \nillnesses they have caused.\n  We can reach a reasonable accommodation on how best to protect \ntobacco farmers, and how best to use the revenues obtained from the \ntobacco industry. There is no excuse for further delay. The Senate \nshould pass this bill this week, and send it to the House. Senators who \nrefuse to act will pay a high price for abdicating their \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we postpone \nthe recess for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in an informal discussion with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, each of us has expressed a hope that we may be able \nto vote on my amendment shortly after the recess and perhaps after the \nofficial photograph of the Senate. I will simply summarize arguments \nthat the Presiding Officer has made so eloquently on each of the \namendments on this subject that has been before us and that I made \nearlier.\n  It does seem to me curious that the two opponents of the amendment \nmade dramatically opposite statements in opposing this amendment. The \nSenator from North Dakota said in spite of the clear language of the \namendment, that instead of a ceiling of so many thousands of dollars an \nhour, depending on when the litigation began that is the thrust of my \namendment, that, in fact, it will be considered a floor.\n  One can take that position only by not reading the amendment and all \nthe considerations that are included in it, but he was afraid that it \nwould mean in many cases we would be paying too much.\n  The Senator from Illinois felt it was terrible to limit lawyers even \nto $4,000 an hour, because many of them had made agreements under which \nthey would get more. And indeed, as the Presiding Officer said in \nresponse to a question from me, we already have one example of one set \nof attorneys already being awarded well over $2 billion for \nrepresenting one State, the State of Texas, in litigation of this sort \nand the attorney general of Texas bitterly opposing the attempt by the \nGovernor of Texas to get a more reasonable set of attorneys' fees.\n  We want to end those debates, and the adoption of this amendment will \nend those debates, because it will provide a ceiling, I think a highly \nreasonable ceiling. In fact, I had some of my colleagues tell me \nprivately that they don't like my amendment because it is too much. \nThey can't explain even these amounts. In the abstract, that, of \ncourse, is the case, but as against $2.3 billion, as against many of \nthe contingent fee agreements, one can explain these limitations and \nthey are just that; they are ceilings and not anything else.\n  For those who feel that the sky should be the limit, that no matter \nhow many billions of dollars attorneys have contracted for, no matter \nhow much they have pled with us to pass this legislation, no matter how \nmuch minute regulation they are asking us to impose on every aspect of \nthe tobacco industry--the farmers, the manufacturers, the wholesalers, \nthe retailers--more regulation than the Congress of the United States \nhas ever imposed on any other legal business in history, that, \nnonetheless, one aspect of the contracts between States and other \nplaintiffs and their lawyers should be entirely free of any concern on \nour part whatsoever.\n  Mr. President, I just can't see how anyone can justify this bill, \nhundreds of pages of detailed regulations, and say nothing about \nattorneys' fees other than an arbitration in which the only people \nrepresented are the plaintiffs' lawyers and the plaintiffs who have \nsigned the contracts in the first place. No, that is not balance; that \nis not fair.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I disagreed with his previous \namendment because it seemed to me that there were certain circumstances \nunder which it was too low. I think we ought to do justice to lawyers \nwho have done an extraordinary job, who have in some cases come up with \nnew theories and have been successful with those theories, but I think \nwe have the right to say enough is enough. This amendment, Mr. \nPresident, says enough is enough. And in the future, when tobacco \nlitigation will be very, very easy, a much smaller enough is going to \nbe enough.\n  Probably the long-term result of this amendment would be not \ndissimilar in the total amount of attorneys' fees paid from the \nFaircloth amendment that came so close to adoption late last week. This \namendment, however, would see to it the lion's share of those \nrecoveries would go to the attorneys who actually earned them and not \nthose who have gotten in very late.\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\n  I commend this to my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, as \nbeing reasonable and as being something that should be a part of any \noverall pattern that we pass, and that is to put us at the heart of the \nwhole debate over tobacco. If we can regulate everyone else, we can \nregulate the attorneys. We do it fairly in this amendment, and I trust \nas soon as we come to an agreement on the time it will be voted on, \nthat it will be adopted and we can go on to other important \ndevelopments in this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6373-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to inform the Senate of the reason \nI voted ``present'' on the Gorton amendment related to limits on \nattorneys' fees in tobacco cases.\n  I abstained on this vote because my husband's law firm is co-counsel \nin several lawsuits against tobacco companies filed in California state \ncourt by health and welfare trust funds.\n  The Ethics Committee has advised me that voting on an amendment such \nas this ``would not pose an actual conflict of interest'' under the \nSenate Code of Conduct.\n  However, I decided that this vote could create the appearance of a \nconflict of interest and therefore I abstained by voting ``present.''\n\n\n                         explanation of absence\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to explain \nmy absence during vote number 159 last night. I was returning to \nWashington from Chicago when the airplane I was on was delayed by \nweather problems. While the vote was going on, the plane was in the air \nover the Washington area as we waited for the airport to reopen so that \nwe could land.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted `nay' on the motion to table \nthe Reed amendment to the tobacco bill. I am a cosponsor of the Reed \namendment and I believe it should be part of the final tobacco \nlegislation.\n  The tobacco industry has been targeting kids with its advertisements \nand marketing gimmicks for far too long. The tobacco bill would re-\npromulgate the FDA's regulations, currently on hold, that seek to \nrestrict tobacco advertising and marketing that appeals to children.\n  The Reed amendment adds new teeth to the restrictions by linking each \ntobacco company's tax deduction for advertising expenses to its \ncompliance\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\nwith the regulations. As long as a tobacco company obeys the law and \ncomplies with the FDA regulations, the company can continue to deduct \nits expenses for permissible advertising. But, under the Reed \namendment, if a tobacco company violates these restrictions, the \ncompany's privilege of deducting its advertising expenses for tax \npurposes would be lifted for all of its advertising expenses for the \nyear in which the violation occurred.\n  This amendment, as with the look-back amendment, is about \naccountability. If a tobacco company decides to try to skirt the FDA \nregulations, to keep advertising or marketing in ways that appeal to \nchildren, that company will face not just a regulatory action by the \nloss of its advertising deduction. With this amendment, taxpayers will \nno longer help foot the advertising bill for companies that continue to \nmarket to children. Tobacco companies will no longer get a tax break \nfor advertising expenses if any of the company's advertising violates \nthe FDA's regulations for protecting children.\n  It's a simple amendment with a simple point. Its message is that we \nare serious when we say to the tobacco companies: no more advertising \nto children. This amendment deserves the support of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has been waiting \nvery patiently to propose his amendment. I just want to sum up what we \njust passed here, and I think it is very important.\n  We passed limits on attorneys' fees of $4,000 per hour for actions \nfiled before 12-31-94; $2,000 per hour for actions filed between 12-31-\n94 and 4-1-97; $1,000 per hour for actions filed between 4-1-97 and 6-\n15-98; and $500 per hour for actions filed after 6-15-98.\n  Before the Senator from Washington leaves the floor, I would like to \nthank him for his amendment. I thank him for his persuasive arguments \nin a very close vote. Obviously, it was the effort of the Senator from \nWashington that tilted the vote in favor of this amendment, albeit by \none vote. So I express my appreciation to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I just go on to say, it does not apply to any fees \npaid to attorneys that are defending tobacco companies. It does not \napply to any fees actually remitted and received by an attorney before \n6-15-98, nor to reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses approved \nby a court in such actions.\n  It applies to all actions brought on behalf of a State or political \nsubdivision, the Castano civil actions, and all tobacco actions brought \non behalf of private litigants that are settled or ``finally resolved'' \nafter June 15, 1998.\n  It directs the courts to consider the following factors in \ndetermining an attorney's fee as: likelihood of success; time and labor \ninvested; expenses incurred; novelty of the legal issues involved; \nskill required to prosecute the action; and results obtained.\n  It permits the tobacco companies to petition to reduce fees that they \nhad already agreed to pay to plaintiffs' attorneys in the States that \nhave already settled.\n  Mr. President, I think it is an important amendment. I do believe \nthat my friend from Massachusetts would agree with me that really it is \nas outstanding as the agricultural issue, the farmers issue.\n  We can go through iterations--and there are maybe hundreds of \namendments filed--but except for the agriculture issue, we have pretty \nwell resolved the outstanding issues that are associated with this \nlegislation. And I would like to first express optimism that we can \naddress that issue. I still hope we can reach a compromise between the \ntwo--the LEAF Act and the so-called Lugar Act. But in addition to that, \nI believe that we can invoke cloture and dispense with this bill this \nweek.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say on behalf of my colleagues, that \nwith respect to the last amendment, their vote was a reflection, I \nknow, of grave concerns on our side of the aisle about the Senate \nputting its stamp of approval on a $4,000-per-hour fee.\n  Some may think that is a fee that they are willing to attach \nautomatically based on a date, but I think a lot of people felt very \nstrongly that the independence of the judiciary and its capacity to be \nable to analyze according to the very same standards in the Gorton \namendment--the Gorton amendment borrowed from our bill each of the \ncategories of evaluation that would be applied by the courts. So in \neffect, they are really mandating an outcome which may or may not fit \nfor one case or another case.\n  I know I heard colleague after colleague suggest to me that, as a \nSenator, they did not want to approve of a $4,000-an-hour fee. So that \nis the distinction here. Some were willing to put their approval on it; \nsome were not. But the fact is, the amendment carried by one vote, and \nthat is the will of the Senate.\n  We now find ourselves--I want to express my agreement with the \nSenator from Arizona--we have traveled a 3-week journey, and we have \nwaded through the most difficult issues. The closeness of the votes on \nsome of them clearly indicates the difficulty of trying to come to \nagreement, but nevertheless, the Senate has spoken on those.\n  We have resolved the most significant issues--the liability issue, \nthe question of look-back amendments. The bill was strengthened in \nthose regards. We resolved the marriage penalty. Again, for some, the \nbill was strengthened by providing a certain component of a tax cut and \na drug program. So those are the fundamental components of this \nlegislation--together with an FDA regulatory process that is essential \nto the capacity to deal with tobacco.\n  Therefore, that brings us to the point now where the Senator from \nKentucky is about to tackle the really last tough issue with respect to \nthis legislation. Speaking on behalf of the Senators on our side of the \naisle, there are more than 40 Senators that I know of prepared to vote \nfor this legislation now. More than 40 Senators are prepared to vote to \nend debate now, and more than 40 Senators are prepared to vote for the \nlegislation in order that we can move it to the House and ultimately to \na conference.\n  So the real test before the Senate this week is the test of whether \nor not the members of the Republican Party are going to join those 40 \nto create the critical mass necessary to pass tobacco legislation. If \nwe pass it, it will be because we come together as a Senate. If we fail \nto pass it, it will be because the Republicans decided they did not \nwant to pass it. Given the number of Democrats in our caucus--45--to \nhave more than 40 prepared to vote now on a bill is significant.\n  So that is where we find ourselves. I hope that in the next hours we \nwill resolve the farm issue satisfactorily. To the degree there are any \namendments left on the Democrat side, we are prepared to enter very \nshort time agreements if indeed there will be those amendments. So we \nhave the ability on this side of the aisle to move rapidly; not to tie \nup the Senate in knots, but to pass competent tobacco legislation. And \nit is my fervent hope that in the interests of the last 3\\1/2\\ or 3 \nweeks-plus, and the several years of labor that has been engaged in by \na number of different people in the Senate before this bill ever came \nto the Commerce Committee, that we would be able to do that. I think \nthe Senator from Arizona shares that hope.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say very briefly that what the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Massachusetts have said is exactly on \npoint. We really now have one major outstanding issue, and that is the \nquestion of how tobacco farmers are treated in this legislation. \nHopefully, that could be resolved in a way that would be acceptable to \nboth sides.\n  We understand discussions are under way, and we hope that they could \nbe concluded. But really that is the one major issue left. Then we get \non to a whole series of amendments that many Senators would like to \noffer. I can say for myself I have a number of amendments pending that \nI am willing to\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\nwithhold in the interest of advancing this legislation.\n  I have had lots of colleagues come to me this morning and say they, \ntoo, would be willing to withhold their amendments if that would \nadvance actually reaching conclusion on this bill. We are in the fourth \nweek. We have dealt with contentious issue after contentious issue. Now \nis the time to reach conclusion. I urge our colleagues on both sides, \nif they can, withhold amendments that they have pending so that after \nthe farmer issue is resolved we can move to final passage.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues who have been so \npatient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2707 to Amendment No. 2437\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2707 to amendment No. 2437.\n\n  Mr. FORD. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . INAPPLICABILITY OF TITLE XV.\n\n       The provisions of Title XV shall have no force and effect.\n\n     SEC.   . ASSISTANCE FOR PRODUCERS EXPERIENCING LOSSES OF FARM \n                   INCOME.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, from amounts made available under section 451(d), \n     the Secretary of Agriculture shall use up to $250,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 1999 through 2004 to establish a program \n     to indemnify eligible producers that have experienced, or are \n     experiencing, catastrophic losses in farm income during any \n     of the 1997 through 2004 crop years, as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Gross Income and Payment Limitations.--In carrying out \n     this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, use gross income and payment limitations \n     established for the Disaster Reserve Assistance Program under \n     section 813 of the Agricultural Act of 1970 (7 U.S.C. 1427a).\n       (c) Effect on Other Payments.--None of the payments made \n     under this section shall limit or alter in any manner the \n     payments authorized under section 1021 of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we will discuss this amendment, I am sure, \nat great length. We have here a system for producers who are \nexperiencing farm income loss which we feel is only fair and will help \nfarmers all across the country.\n  Members have heard two of our distinguished colleagues and the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee saying that they hope we can move \nforward with passage of this bill this week. I do, too.\n  I also want to say I have a lot to say about this amendment I have \njust offered because it goes to the heart of this bill for me and for \nmy constituents and it deals directly, it deals most directly, with how \nmy constituents are treated. Very briefly, if the quota is removed, you \nmake the tobacco companies another $1 billion a year. If you remove the \ntobacco quota, the value of the land in Kentucky to my farmers is \nreduced up to $7 billion. A farmer could go to bed tonight having a \nmortgage that was completely covered by the land he owned or had \nmortgaged, and we take the tobacco quota away from him and he wakes up \nthe next morning and he doesn't have enough value for that land to \ncover his mortgage, and his mortgage is called.\n  So I think it is important that we begin to look at the ramifications \nof losing the tobacco program as we know it. We have tried to put into \nthis amendment the transition from where we are today as it relates to \nthe tobacco program to what might come in the future if we reduce \nunderage smoking. I am very much for the reduction of underage smoking. \nLet's put that up front. I have no problem with that. But in the fact \nof reducing teen smoking or underage smoking, it is pretty tough to put \npeople out of business.\n  So we will be discussing this amendment for some time. My colleague \nand friend from Virginia, Senator Robb--and there will be other \nSenators on our side--will be supporting this amendment, and I think \nthere will be some Senators on the other side of the aisle who may want \nto speak, who will be supporting this amendment.\n  What I do under this amendment is to strike title XV, and that is \ndoing away with the tobacco program and using 69 percent of all the \nmoneys in this bill for health programs, for research, and for child \ncare. It is very, very important not only to the farmers of my State \nbut those health groups. We have 24 health groups in this country that \nhave endorsed the LEAF program. The smoke-free kids--there is a letter \non your desk that shows that they support the LEAF Act. ENACT supports \nthe LEAF Act. All farmer organizations, practically, that have some \nlongevity to them support the LEAF Act.\n  Let me summarize the main reasons why title XV must not remain in \nthis bill. Now, title XV is designed, whether on purpose or not, to \nsave tobacco companies $1 billion a year. So you get down and the vote \nultimately will be: Are you going to vote for the farmers? Are you \ngoing to vote for the cigarette manufacturers? Are you going to take $1 \nbillion off the backs of the tobacco farmers and give that saving to \nthe cigarette manufacturers? Make no mistake, title XV forces Senators \nto choose between the tobacco companies and the tobacco farmers. Unless \nwe want to save tobacco companies $1 billion per year at the expense of \nthe tobacco farmer, the motion to strike must be supported.\n  Now, title X, not title XV, is supported overwhelmingly by a majority \nof tobacco farm organizations. I have a list of all those and probably \nwill insert those in the Record or read them later. Title XV is not \nsupported by the public health community. The public health community \nsupports the LEAF Act. They support retaining the program. They support \nkeeping control over the growth of tobacco and the prices high. So, it \nis heartening that the health groups and the tobacco groups have gotten \ntogether and signed the core principles. Those core principles are to \nreduce underage smoking, to keep the tobacco program. All these \nprinciples are out there.\n\n  If this motion passes, the public health programs and health research \nprograms in this bill, if my amendment passes, we save 69 percent of \nall the moneys that would go into the health research and development. \nTitle XV eats up 47 percent of the funds in the bill over the first 3 \nyears. Title XV, known as the Lugar-McConnell amendment, already has an \namendment at the desk, and that amendment says that all the money in \nthis bill, up to 47 percent, will go to that program in the first 3 \nyears. So 40 percent to the States, 47 percent to this program; that is \n87 percent of all the money. Where are you going to get the marriage \npenalty? How are you going to do the drug amendment that Senator \nCoverdell put up?\n  So, we will talk about how title X was developed. I think my \ncolleague from Virginia wishes to make some remarks.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rob Mangas and \nDave Regan be admitted to the floor during debate and vote of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the motion to \nstrike the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana, title XV. I \nhave a very high regard for Senator Lugar. He and I have worked closely \ntogether on the Foreign Relations Committee, and we have fought to open \nforeign markets and to promote free trade. I share his tenacious belief \nin the free market. Harnessing the drive that motivates individuals to \nsucceed yields the benefits of a free market. But government has a role \nin checking the excesses that can flow from an unfettered free market.\n  The market won't educate children. The market won't protect workers. \nThe market won't check monopolies. And the market won't safeguard our \nnatural resources. Left completely unchecked, the free market will \nalways seek the lowest cost, even at the expense of other social goals. \nSo our charge, as policymakers in a capitalist economy, is to allow \nindividuals and entrepreneurs and businesses the freest rein possible \nwhile safeguarding society's other concerns.\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\n  Defining those concerns and implementing those safeguards without \ndestroying the benefits we achieve from the free market is one of the \nmost difficult tasks we face. The Lugar-McConnell provision eliminates \nthe Federal program that limits the amount of tobacco that can be \nproduced in the United States.\n  Arguments advanced for killing the supply-limiting program center on \nthe desire to see a free market in tobacco. Since the argument is to \ncreate a free market, we ought to examine just what benefits we would \ngain from such a system. Economists estimate that going to a system \nallowing unlimited production of tobacco would likely increase the \namount of tobacco grown in the United States by 50 percent.\n  This increased supply would cause the price of tobacco to decrease by \napproximately 30 percent. Without a tobacco program, tobacco could be \ngrown anywhere in the United States, so it is likely that tobacco would \nbe grown in many more States than it is grown in today. That production \nwould migrate from where it exists in many areas today with hilly \nterrain and small farms to larger, flatter farms.\n  So the benefits to be gained from going to a free market would be \ncheaper tobacco, more tobacco production, dislocated communities, and \nunregulated production. The small farmer would not be able to produce \nenough volume at the lower price to make the farming operation \neconomical. Without some certainty as to price, it is unlikely that any \nfinancial institution would extend the credit so necessary for small \nfarming operations to survive. Therefore, if the tobacco program were \nto be wiped away, the only true beneficiaries would be large corporate \nfarms and tobacco companies, because tobacco would then become cheaper.\n  The public health community has increasingly focused on what would \nhappen if we eliminated a program to restrict the amount of tobacco \nproduction in the United States and has concluded that the benefits are \nsimply not worth the costs. They note that it would be the height of \nirony if--in the same bill where we increased the regulation of the \nmanufacture, marketing, advertising and retailing of tobacco--we \nderegulated the production of tobacco, which is why the public health \ncommunity, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American \nHeart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Public \nHealth Association, and the American College of Preventive Medicine all \nsupport retaining a supply-limiting program.\n  In fact, these public health groups, and a number of tobacco grower \nassociations, have been meeting for a number of years, which has \nadmittedly intensified since June 20 of last year, to see whether they \ncould find common ground.\n  I am proud to say that these discussions have been under the auspices \nof the University of Virginia and involved a number of growers from \nVirginia.\n  From these discussions, the groups were able to agree on a set of \ncore principles. The first of these core principles is that a tobacco \nproduction control program, which limits supply and which sets minimum \npurchase prices, is in the best interests of the public health \ncommunity and the tobacco producer community.\n  The public health groups support controls on production because they \ncannot support what would happen without them: Uncontrolled tobacco \nproduction, plummeting tobacco prices, devastated farm families and \nfarming communities, and enormous benefits for the tobacco companies.\n  Despite the opposition of both the grower community and the public \nhealth community, there are those who continue to insist that the \nmarket in tobacco must be unfettered and uncontrolled.\n  The argument for eliminating the supply-limiting program is a \nphilosophical one, focusing on the natural benefits of a free market \nregardless of the consequences. But the aim of a free market system is \nto insure that the consumer efficiently gets the lowest-cost product.\n  We want consumers to be able to get the highest quality, lowest-cost \nproducts, like cotton shirts and cereal, and anything else you can \nthink of.\n  The argument for a free market in cotton, wheat, corn, or any other \ncommodity, is to lower cost to benefit consumers and increase exports. \nThis tobacco legislation, however, is seeking exactly the opposite \ngoal. The very heart of this legislation is to have the Government \ninterfere in the free market by raising prices to reduce consumption.\n  It is highly ironic that some of those calling for a free market for \ntobacco voted a couple of weeks ago to have the Government add the cost \nof $1.50 to the price of a pack of cigarettes. That is not a free \nmarket, Mr. President. In fact, the entire aim of the comprehensive \ntobacco legislation is to increase the cost to consumers, not decrease \nthem.\n  Eliminating a tobacco program to achieve a free market system would \ndestroy existing communities and the livelihood of existing farmers \nwithout realizing the goal of a free market, which is to increase \nefficiency and lower costs to the consumer.\n  There is no other agricultural product that faces this unique \nsituation, where the Government's policy is to increase the costs to \nthe consumer, not decrease them.\n  Tobacco is simply unlike any other commodity covered by the Freedom \nto Farm Act. The Freedom to Farm Act did not authorize the Government \nto run advertisements telling people not to use the farmers' products.\n  The Freedom to Farm Act did not tax cotton shirts, or cereal, or \nethanol to raise the revenues that went to make the payments to \nfarmers. The Freedom to Farm Act did not limit the Government's ability \nto open foreign markets.\n  In short, there are few parallels that can be drawn between the \ncommodities covered by the Freedom to Farm and tobacco, other than that \nthe commodities are all grown by decent, hard-working, dedicated people \nwhose lives are profoundly affected by what we do.\n  Tobacco is also different in another crucial respect, which bears \ndirectly on the question of whether eliminating the tobacco program \nwould in fact produce a free market, which is the stated aim of the \nproponents of the Lugar-McConnell provision.\n  A market that is dominated by a limited number of buyers, by \ndefinition, is not a free market. And that is the situation with \ntobacco. There are four buyers in the marketplace who purchase 98 \npercent of the tobacco produced by our Nation's 124,000 tobacco \nfarmers.\n  The economists, of course, have a name for such a controlled market. \nIt is called an ``oligopsony.'' According to the Encyclopedia of \nEconomics, ``oligopsony exists when a few buyers of a commodity or \nservice deal with a large number of sellers.'' According to this text, \nthis ``situation can lead to tacit collusion among buyers to depress \ntheir buying prices generally at the expense of the sellers who supply \nthem.'' One of the examples they give for an oligopsony is ``markets \nfor leaf tobacco.''\n  Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines oligopsony as ``a market \nsituation in which each of a few buyers exerts a disproportionate \ninfluence on the market.''\n  So that is the market that these farmers would face if they had to \ndeal individually with each of the four major buyers. This would not be \na free market. This would be a market where the buyers would dictate \nthe price to the sellers and reap the rewards.\n  In fact, the USDA estimates that by ``terminating quotas and phasing \nout price supports, cigarette manufacturers and leaf exporters are \nprojected to have windfall gains of about $800 million annually . . . \nThe cigarette manufacturers would continue to receive this windfall \nover time once the price support system is phased out. Over 25 years, \nthis windfall could amount to $20 billion or more.''\n  The money the companies save would be money that formerly went to \ntobacco farmers. Eliminating the program would result in a transfer of \nmoney from farm families to cigarette manufacturers of about $800 \nmillion annually.\n  In the face of all this, why do some still want to eliminate a \nproduction controlling program?\n  One of the arguments I have heard is that tobacco is bad and so the \nGovernment shouldn't be involved in it.\n  Mr. President, this whole bill, however, is about Government \ninvolvement in tobacco. It makes little sense to\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nhave the Government involved in controlling every aspect of cigarette \nmaking and selling except the production of the key ingredient. The \nGovernment is not promoting tobacco, it is restricting it.\n  A supply-limiting program limits supply. That does not promote \ntobacco. The fact that farm families benefit from that restriction, in \nmy view, is not a reason to abolish the program, because without the \nprogram, it is not the public's health that would benefit, it is the \ncompanies'.\n  There are those who advocate reducing the number of tobacco farmers \nin this country. Under the LEAF Act, we provide a voluntary buyout, \nwhich we believe will encourage but not force tobacco farmers to move \nto other pursuits. We believe that is a sounder and much more humane \napproach than the one advocated by proponents of the Lugar-McConnell \nbill which simply pulls the rug out from under farm families after 3 \nyears and forces them to scramble for survival.\n  In fact, the comprehensive legislation we are considering is likely \nto be incentive enough for many farmers to make a transition out of \ntobacco farming. As consumption falls over time, as counteradvertising \nmounts, and as economic development funds start creating infrastructure \nin tobacco communities, there will be migration out of the tobacco \nfields.\n  Tobacco farming is hard work, and while it is more lucrative than \ngrowing other crops, it does not make the average tobacco farmer rich. \nIn fact, the average farm income of a tobacco farmer is less than \n$22,000 a year. If we can create opportunities in tobacco growing \ncommunities for children to pursue other paths, that is what we need to \ndo. But that cannot be done in 3 years, and I believe it would be cruel \nto try.\n  There are those who support the Lugar-McConnell provision because \nthey foresee the death of the tobacco program. Programs, however, do \nnot die of natural causes. They have to be killed. And those who vote \nfor the Lugar-McConnell provision are voting to kill the program. So do \nnot be fooled by those who vote for the Lugar-McConnell provision \nsaying they support the program while voting to kill it.\n  Finally, I strongly oppose the Lugar-McConnell provision because I \nbelieve it holds out false hope. Under the provision, farmer \ncompensation would be paid out over 3 years. Under the LEAF Act, farmer \npayments would be paid out over 10 years. In order to make the payout \nover 3 years, we would have to dedicate over 40 percent of the proceeds \nfrom the legislation to farmers during those first 3 years. That 40 \npercent is more than the share to the States, more than the share to \nmedical research, and more than the share to public health. And when \nyou consider that we have already diverted funds away from these \naccounts, with the addition of the Coverdell amendment and the Gramm \namendment, the addition of a mandatory 3-year buyout under the Lugar-\nMcConnell provision would collapse this bill's budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the numbers. In the first year after \nthis bill is approved, the National Tobacco Trust Fund would receive \ntotal revenues of $14.4 billion. Yet, to make the payout over 3 years, \nas the Lugar-McConnell provision mandates, we would have to spend over \n$17.2 billion in the first year. And that is without spending a single \ndime on medical research or public health programs.\n  Are those who support the Lugar-McConnell provision willing to take \naway money from medical research and public health programs to finance \na 3-year buyout? Are they willing to eliminate the so-called marriage \npenalty tax cut or the antidrug programs offered by Senator Coverdell \nto pay for this plan? Because voting to retain the Lugar-McConnell \nprovision will make it impossible to fund each of these other programs \ncontained in this bill.\n  The LEAF Act, in contrast, recognizes the funding constraints of the \nunderlying legislation and would not take funds away from the other \nprograms contained in this bill. This is not to say that I wouldn't \nvery much like to be able to pay the growers over 3 years, and, in \nfact, a number of us tried to figure a way to get compensation to \ngrowers in less than 10 years. Unfortunately, there were simply too \nmany other competing demands on the funds.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I oppose in the strongest terms \nelimination of controls on the production of tobacco. It would destroy \nsmall family farms, decrease tobacco prices, increase tobacco \nproduction, and transfer wealth from growers to the companies, all \nwithout any discernible benefit to the people.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nmotion made by the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, to strike the \nLugar-McConnell amendment and to support the LEAF Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor to the Ford amendment striking title XV.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me harken how we began June a year \nago and explain my objection to the procedure.\n  With respect to a year ago, what really occurred was that the tobacco \ncompanies were spending a goodly fortune defending class actions and \nindividual causes of action due to tobacco smoking causing certain \ninjury and death.\n  These are very responsible companies. They have very responsible \nboards of directors. Right to the point, they had the urge to try to \nregain credibility for their overall operation. Philip Morris, for \nexample, sells not only tobacco cigarettes but, of course, it is into \nKraft foods and many other allied endeavors. R.J. Reynolds down in \nNorth Carolina is in the Ritz cracker business, plus other different \nbusinesses. They were getting pilloried, so to speak, in the courtrooms \nof America. They were successful. They weren't losing. They had won \nevery case. There was not a jury verdict against a tobacco company. But \nlooking at the bottom line, as good businessmen and operators, they \nwere spending around $500 million to $600 million a year in legal fees.\n  This crowd up here in Washington is worried about trial lawyers. If \nyou really want to get taken to the cleaners, get one of these \ncorporate lawyers. I suggest to the distinguished Chair that if he ever \ngets into trouble, for gosh sakes, don't get General Motors's lawyer or \nIBM's lawyer. You had better get a real lawyer who is used to getting \nin the courtrooms.\n  This crowd sort of works with themselves on billable hours. That is \nthe ailment that has taken over. The billable hours, the defenses, and \nall were costing them about $500 million to $600 million. More than \nanything else, it was depressing their stock.\n  The lawyers themselves had not won any cases. They were moving with \nthe States' attorneys general. So, with the States' attorneys general, \nthey got together. They had been meeting on opposite sides of the table \nin courtrooms all over America. As I understand it, they got together \non an agreed settlement. The agreed settlement would, No. 1, increase \ntaxes.\n  The reason I emphasize this, Mr. President, is if you go home and \nturn on your television or listen to the radio, the ``scoundrel \nCongress'' up here is the one that is trying to increase taxes on poor \nAmerica, middle America, and whatever America. There is no suggestion \nthat this idea came from the tobacco companies, the ones who are paying \nfor the advertising, and in a luxurious amount. But this is the \nreality. The idea of increasing taxes originated with the tobacco \ncompanies themselves, in the so-called Global Tobacco Settlement.\n  I worked with the defense appropriations bill. And that amounts to \n$250 billion. When I heard on TV and then later read in the newspaper \n$368 billion, I still thought it was a mistake--$368 billion. I said, \n``Where in the world would they get all of that money?'' Well, if you \nreasoned out 25 years and so much per year as it goes up, yes, you can \nget to that amount, or get to $1.10, as the present Commerce Committee \nbill now envisions. You get around $500 billion.\n  But the real initiative of raising taxes was by the companies \nthemselves--not the squealing, crying, moaning, and groaning on \nnational TV\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\nabout, ``This terrible Congress is going awry.'' Not so. They came up \nand said, ``All right, we will put this money up, and for you States \nand States' attorneys general, what we will do is, we will pay in a \ngood 40 percent of it to the States to take care of the Medicaid costs, \nthe health costs, and everything, as an incidence, a result, of tobacco \nsmoking and ailments and death that was caused by tobacco smoking.'' So \nthat would take care of the States. The States' attorneys general got \ntogether and agreed on that.\n  Another part of the agreement, of course, was to try to control \ntobacco smoking and discourage young people from smoking. The children, \ninstead of getting Joe Camel, were getting the adverse ads, the \nwarnings, not just on the pack of cigarettes but on national TV--how \ninjurious to health it could be. We found out in the early 1970s that \nthese negative-type ads worked. We tried it before. I don't know \nwhether the price increase would work. They say in downtown London, \nwhere they have a pack of cigarettes at $4.30 and up, it has not worked \nwith respect to deterring children from starting to smoke.\n  But in any event, it was good intent, a good purpose, and a good \nprovision that they would do it, and do it in all honesty and \nsincerity. In fact, to back up their pledge, they hit on the unique \n``look-back provision.'' I had never heard of that before in all the \nyears I have been up here. But they had a look-back provision whereby \nthey said, ``We will measure it each year with the diminution of \ntobacco smoking with respect to children,'' and if they don't comply \nwith a certain percentage decrease each year, they will pay more \nmultimillion-dollar, almost billion dollars, or maybe over a billion \ndollars, in penalties, penalizing themselves.\n  There was not any question about the sincerity of the purpose. They \nhad it all worked out. The White House agreed to it. The health \ncommunity was in conference from time to time on this particular \nagreement. And it was announced. The first thing that hit this Senator \nwhen it was announced was not only the $368 billion, an enormous \namount, but what is in there for the man who is making a living-- \nnamely, the tobacco farmer. When the Pilgrims landed here in the \nearliest of days, they found the Indians, who were smoking tobacco. Are \nwe now going to really have prohibition? No. We tried that once before \nwith alcoholic beverages, and it corrupted the entire society and crime \nwent through the roof. So we learned the hard lesson and repealed that \n18th amendment.\n\n  Certainly with respect to tobacco smoking and everything else of that \nkind, we realize there are certain realistic considerations: One, that \nwe are not going to have an embargo or prohibit the production itself; \ntwo, that when it comes to advertising, there is that First Amendment \nright and we are not going to be able to force-feed--the companies have \nto agree with respect to the limitation on advertising or the agreement \nto negatively advertise against smoking, those kinds of things, and \nthen the allocation of the money to have to come about with respect to \nthe matter of the States, and not only that, but with respect to the \nhealth community. Necessarily, we all want to increase the research out \nat the National Institutes of Health on the injurious effect of tobacco \nsmoking.\n  I have had hearings over 30-some years now with the doctors out there \nat the Cancer Institute, not only on how cancer is caused but how a \npack-a-day smoker can rejuvenate the health of his lungs after 5 years \nand really recover from it if he stops.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that more people have stopped smoking \nthan are smoking today. I repeat: There are more people who have \nstopped smoking than are smoking today. So when they get to the victims \nand the matter of habit forming and addictiveness and everything else, \nthat is a jury question that the jurors of America have never gone \nalong with. They have never gone along with it until this recent \nverdict down here of a little six-man jury in Florida, and we don't \nknow what will happen with that on appeal. But that is a pretty solid \nrecord. We have Senators running up and down knocking over the chairs \nand desks saying, ``Why give this industry immunity?''\n  Well, Mr. President, the jurors of America, far more savvy with \nrespect to the actual facts before them, have given the tobacco \ncompanies immunity--not the distinguished Presiding Officer, not this \nSenator from South Carolina, but over the many, many years, the jurors, \nthe people of America, have given them immunity because for 33 years we \nhave had an advertisement that they are injurious to your health.\n  Now, I looked in that global tobacco settlement, and I said wait a \nminute--something is wrong here. We don't have any provision in there \nfor a large segment of the economy of South Carolina. We have over \n2,000 tobacco farms in South Carolina involving some 40,000 jobs with \nthe warehousemen, the equipment dealers and everything else of that \nkind, with a $1 billion impact on the communities, veritable tobacco \ntowns. If you want to start Tobacco Road, which we have seen in the \nDepression, pass this title XV that the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Ford, wants to strike. I commend his leadership on this \nscore because he has been in the forefront looking out for an important \nsegment of our society and important communities in my State and his \nand in the several surrounding States.\n  How they could get together on an agreement and not even consider \ntobacco farmers is beyond me. But we were told immediately, oh, no, no, \nno, no, don't worry about that; we will take care of the farmers. I \nwondered in October when the distinguished Senator from Indiana put in \nthe Lugar, what he called transition bill, which is a bankruptcy act--\nan elimination bill is what it was because in just a 3-year period bam, \nbam, bam, the farmers would be gone. Nothing for the warehousemen, \nnothing for the fertilizer dealer, nothing for the community with \nrespect to the bank making the loan or the automobile loan, nothing for \nvarious other parts of the society itself, the families to adjust and \ntake care of themselves.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Ford, the LEAF Act was developed when \nwe saw this particular Indiana initiative. I remember recently seeing \nwhere the Attorney General of Indiana, who, incidentally, was in on the \noriginal agreement, said, ``We had no idea of taking care of the \nfarmer.''\n  Well, that is not what they told us. Everybody said, on both sides of \nthe aisle, in a bipartisan fashion, ``Of course, we have got to take \ncare of the farmer,'' and the White House, along with the Congress \nitself, said, ``Yes, we have got to take care of the farmer.''\n  So the LEAF Act was developed in a studied fashion with respect not \nonly to the holder of the particular quota but the actual farmer who \nfarmed the crop. It took care of the warehousemen. It took care of the \nfertilizer and equipment dealer. It took care of the communities. And \nwe put it out at the very beginning of the year as an amendment, the \nLEAF Act.\n  Of course, when the distinguished Senator from Arizona, the chairman \nof our Commerce Committee, came to me, he said, ``Now, the majority \nleader has suggested that our committee put out the tobacco agreement \nas a commerce bill. And I would like it to be bipartisan.'' I told \nSenator McCain I would like it to be bipartisan also, but, of course, \nwe had to take care of the farmer. Well, that is the first time I \nreally began to doubt about this ``take care of the farmer'' because \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee turned to me and he said, \n``No, we can't put that on.'' I was wondering why. That was the first \ntime I had ever heard that nobody wanted to take care of the farmer.\n  When he told me that, I said, ``Well, it's going to be very partisan, \nbecause I am not going to stand by and let this go through committee, \nwithout bringing up this important segment of the economy.'' Yes, we \nare trying to stop little children from smoking. Yes, we are trying to \ntake care of those who have been injured from smoking. Yes, we are \ntrying to get research. And, yes, we are trying to control the \nadvertising. But everybody, from the word go in June of last year, \nsaid, ``We are going to take care of the farmer,'' and the LEAF Act \ndid. The Senator from Arizona said no, he didn't think he could do \nthat. Several days later, he came back and said, ``Yes, you are right, \nwe ought to make it bipartisan, and we will take care of the farmer.''\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\n  As a result, we spent a marathon session with the staffs of all the \nSenators involved on both sides of the aisle in the Commerce Committee, \nthe White House, Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, and the various entities \nagainst children smoking, checking back and forth. There is no question \nthat the distinguished Senator from Arizona did an outstanding job to \nget a bill that we could all agree upon by a vote of 19 to 1. We did \nagree on the tobacco bill, and it included the LEAF Act.\n  As we were ready to bring this bill to the floor, we were given \nnotice that what we ought to do in order to get this bill passed was \nnot to spend too much time with respect to amendments; let's see what \namendments are going to carry immediate and recognizable weight and see \nif we can't agree to put those on now, cut the time involved, because \nthe leader wants to handle this in a couple of days, at the most 3 \ndays, and we have to get together with the White House. We don't want \nto put in a bill without knowing that it will be approved.\n  So we did. We had five sessions with the White House--Senator McCain \nand Senator Mack on that side of the aisle and Senator Kerrey and \nmyself on our side of the aisle. We kept meeting with them, and I kept \nchecking with them to guarantee the LEAF Act was intact. I kept asking \neverybody--not to worry, they told me.\n  We had those five sessions, the last one being in my own office here \nin the Nation's Capital. At 4 o'clock it broke up, and about an hour or \nso later, about 6 o'clock, I heard a rumor about the Lugar bill. I \nsaid, ``Come on, somebody is way off. They might want to put it on, but \nit can't be on our Commerce bill.''\n  They said, ``No; that's what the leader is going to do.''\n  I said, ``How does that occur?''\n  The bill itself, which is title XV, had one hearing, according to the \nbest check I have made on it. It had one hearing last fall and has not \nhad any hearings since that time, has not had any markup, no committee \nreport, no report out of the committee. It was just an individual \nSenator's bill--we all will agree, one of the most respected Senators \nand one of the most powerful in that he is the chairman of our \nAgriculture Committee.\n  I knew if there was any real intent or force behind it or interest, \nthat he long since would have had that bill reported out of his \ncommittee and we could have studied it, and if there had been any \ndifferences with the LEAF Act, they could have been reconciled.\n  But, Mr. President, it was the most dastardly procedure I have ever \nseen when the majority leader stood up and said, ``Oh, no, I'm putting \nthe Lugar bill on your committee bill.''\n  I said, ``You can't do that without the committee.''\n  He said, ``Well, the committee is on here; we have a majority.''\n  I said, ``You can't have a majority without the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona.''\n  The Senator from Arizona and I had traveled together to Florence, SC. \nWe notified every quota holder, every equipment dealer, and we had \naround 2,500 or 3,000 who met in the hockey arena there. We both made \nour little pitches. The Congressmen made their talks. We answered \nquestions for over an hour's time, and we met with the press for over a \nhalf-hour and reaffirmed again and again our support for the LEAF Act. \nWe explained it, why it was there, how it was worded, the difference \nbetween burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco and why we worded \ndifferent things. Because of this effort, and the Senator's sincerity, \nI just couldn't believe anyone could make representations then changing \nthe tobacco bill, putting the bill just summarily on another bill.\n\n  I am not sure that the committee met, but you have to take the \nmajority leader's word. He said they met and that they voted, 11 \nSenators; it was under the rules. That is the procedure that I object \nto. If for no other reason, this ought to be voted down. We ought not \nto sanction this kind of conduct on the working arrangements. Everybody \nis talking about the confrontational nature and how the club is \nbreaking up and how we are just all politics. We have to trust each \nother, Mr. President, and we can't endanger that trust by having an \nunderstanding throughout 10 days of a heated markup, through five \nseparate sessions with the White House, through a gathering of our \ntobacco farmers in our backyard, and being assured again and again in \nexplaining the bill was it, and then to put this up and fix the vote on \nthe other side of the aisle. That is what I understand has occurred.\n  That is my first and foremost reason for opposing the Lugar \namendment. My foremost reason was to take care of the farmers. My \nforemost reason now is to take care of the Senate. If that is the way \nwe are going to conduct business, so be it. We can all play that game, \nwith rule and ruin and trickery and everything else of that kind.\n  Let me show you exactly where we are now and take stock with respect \nto this Lugar amendment.\n  What we have done with this kind of handling of the bill is, we have \nadded on the payments to the States of 40 percent. Of course, that is \n$5.76 billion. We have added on the marriage penalty of $3.1 billion \nand the Coverdell drug provision--that is $2 billion--for a total of \n$10.86 billion. The cost of the Lugar amendment, title XV--to be \nstricken, I hope--is $6.4 billion. That is a sum total of $17.26 \nbillion the first year, whereas a total estimation for the first year \nin the bill we have before us--and I raise it for the Senators to see--\nthis S. 1415 allocates $14.4 billion to the National Tobacco Trust \nFund, but we have already spent $17.26 billion.\n  Unless you strike--I wish this was a session of the Budget Committee, \nbecause we could have a budget point of order. This is totally without \nthe budget, but it has gotten to be a habit where it is getting into \nall committees now. If you go along with title XV, you have then \nexpended $2.86 billion--$2,860,000,000--more than what the bill will \nbring in. Yet, the tobacco companies are talking about how they are \nbeing devastated. They haven't seen anything yet. If they don't adopt \nthis amendment and go forward with ideas on the House side, they will \nlearn just exactly what has happened.\n  But, of course, the tobacco companies said, ``Let the Senator from \nSouth Carolina talk along, because here under Senator Lugar's proposal \nthere's a real winner for us companies,'' because in 1999 Senator \nLugar's plan cuts the price support for tobacco by 25 percent, from \n$1.68 a pound to $1.22 a pound. ``This equates to a savings for us \ntobacco companies''--now I am posturing myself so you will understand \nit. If I am a tobacco company, I love this title XV, because the first \nyear I really make $987 million, just out a billion bucks. So I am a \nbillion bucks to the good with this Lugar amendment.\n  And then in 2000, this proposal cuts the price support by another 10 \npercent, from $1.22 a pound to $1.10 a pound. ``This equates to a \nsavings to us tobacco companies now. We are in business. And we know \nhow to get amendments passed--sneak them on at the last minute. Don't \never debate them. Don't ever have a committee report it out one way or \nthe other. Just forget about the bill last year, but get the majority \nleader to sneak the bill on''--$1.276 billion.\n  And then in the year 2001--a 3-year program--what happens in that \nthird year? This proposal cuts the price support by another 10 percent, \nfrom $1.10 to 99 cents a pound. This equates to a savings by the \ncompany of another $1,543,500,000.\n  So the total savings--total savings, Mr. President--by the tobacco \ncompanies on this title XV, if it is not stricken over the next 3 \nyears, is $3,804,500,000. I did not realize it was that much--\n$3,804,500,000.\n  Of course, that leaves nothing for health care, not a thing for \npublic health, nothing for health research or anything else of that \nkind.\n  To come in with this at the last minute and take all this money is \nlike when they used to organize the insurance companies when I was \nGovernor down there in South Carolina. And they had one company--\nCapital Life was looking for a new slogan, and they finally came up \nwith the winning slogan, after considering all their friends' \nsuggestions. They said, ``Capital Life will surely pay if the small \nprint on the back doesn't take it away.''\n  I know that is exactly what has happened. They said that we are going \nto have all this money to do the various programs--health care, \nresearch, and what-have-you, moneys for the attorneys general, and \neverything else like that--and the tobacco companies, with a last \nminute strike, come up with\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\n$3,804,500,000, and the farmers are left high and dry.\n  If you want to see the Tobacco Road that we had during the days of \nthe Depression, with the dust and the filth and the desperation and the \ndespair, keep the Lugar amendment in here, and not Senator Ford's LEAF \namendment, and we are goners--we are goners. There is no question in my \nmind.\n  Now, there has been some confusion. The tobacco companies, like to \nput the spin that we in the Congress are raising taxes when it was \ntheir idea just a year ago--no Congressman was at the table; no Senator \nwas at the table--it was the tobacco companies at the table that came \nout with this scheme, and now they are putting the twist on that we are \nraising taxes. They are the ones who raised the tax.\n  Now they are trying to put on here the twist that the farmers are \ngoing to be taken care of, and at the last minute put on the Lugar \namendment, fix the vote, and leave them high and dry. I do not like it. \nAnd you can tell by the tone of my voice it should not be liked.\n  I have been around. I have worked with everybody throughout the years \nhere and have had good bipartisan support. We handled the \nTelecommunications Act, got 95 votes for it. I handled Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings on this side of the aisle on 14 votes up and down, and got a \nmajority of the Democrats, over the objection of the leader at that \ntime and the chairman of the Budget Committee. But we got the majority \nof Democrats to support that particular budget initiative.\n  I have had success over the years working in a bipartisan fashion. \nThis is in the most treacherous fashion I can possibly think of, to \ntake a matter that had not completed the hearings--yet to be reported, \nyet to have a vote on, no committee report to read or study, no \nconversation on the contrary--all conversation, all representations: \n``Don't worry, the LEAF Act is fine.'' We go down, even before the \nfarmers, and tell them that, and everything else like that, and then go \nalong at the last minute with this ambush.\n\n  This is ambushing my farmers, Mr. President. And we will have more to \nsay about it. But I think that the Record ought to show exactly what \nhas occurred here. We have a studied bill. We have the tobacco farmers \ntaken care of with respect through the payments that are made now on \nthe average yield for those in flue-cured tobacco, for the quota \nholders, because the existing system is eliminated. What we have is a \nsystem of permits to do away with the quotas. And, incidentally, they \nwanted to argue--and you are going to hear this ad infinitum--that with \nall the other farm programs gone, why should we support this? This is \nthe one crop that has had its production limited. And it is a very \nsensitive crop, and it was here when we landed over 200-some years ago.\n  So we have been handling it over the years in a clean, responsible, \nproductive fashion. And we have created the communities, we have \ncreated the fertilizer dealers, we have created the warehouses and the \nwarehousing, as well as the farmers.\n  So in order to be sure that we do not just turn them over to welfare \nand say that in 2 years they can come and get retraining, we must not \nabandon them. Incidentally, Mr. President, let me talk about that \nretraining just one moment. We had down in my backyard the Oneida \nknitting mills that made nothing but little T-shirts. Anybody could \nmake them, but at one time they had 487 there. The age average was 47 \nyears. They were a very productive company, complying, if you please, \nwith all the requirements--clean air, clean water, Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, safe working place, safe machinery, \nplant closing notice, parental leave, on and on and on --that \nRepublicans and Democrats said before you open up you have to comply \nwith. That goes into the cost of production. So the plant moved to \nMexico, for 58 cents an hour and none of those requirements.\n  So Washington is so keen on how to get things done, they say: \n``Retrain, global economy, global competition. We're moving into the \nage of technology, retrain, skills.''\n  Well, don't tell this Senator about it. I am the author of the \nAdvanced Technology Program. I am the author of the manufacturing \nextension centers known as Hollings Centers. I fought to keep those \nprograms going. I instituted technical colleges and special schools \nback 38 years ago in my own home State. So I am appreciative of \ntechnology and its needs.\n  But assume the 487 are immediately retrained the Washington way \ntomorrow morning, and you have 487 computer operators. Are you going to \nhire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 21-year-old computer \noperator? It is quite obvious, Mr. President, that their community of \nAndrews will be high and dry and out of luck. And that has happened all \nover the U.S. since NAFTA was passed. And we have lost a fell sum of \n24,000 textile and apparel jobs in my State alone. So that next sum, \nwhile we have gotten in the BMWs, the Fujis, the Hoffmann-La Roches, \nand the Hondas--and we are proud of it--the net loss is this, that we \nhave lost 12,400 jobs since NAFTA was passed.\n  Now we are coming up with a very ``wise,'' as they would call it, \n``assault,'' I call it, upon the tobacco farmer to put him out of \nbusiness in a studied fashion over 3 years: take all the money and run \nwith it, devastate the health program and the research program, and the \nseveral States are not going to get their money and everything else. \nAnd yet it is on there and it hasn't been discussed.\n  I see now the distinguished Senator from Indiana is with us and I am \ndelighted to hear from him. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mary Dietrich, \na detailee to the Agriculture Committee from the General Accounting \nOffice, be granted privilege of the floor during the pendency of the \ntobacco farmer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to support a program that will end \ntobacco subsidies, give fair compensation to farmers now rather than \nmany years from now, make an extra $10 billion available for public \nhealth and other worthy purposes, and provide some degree of certainty \nfor tobacco farmers, for agricultural America, with regard to our \npolicies that would pertain with greater fairness to all farmers.\n  Let me simply cite, at the outset my discussion of these issues, what \nI perceive to be the significant differences between the Lugar \namendment, which I favor and which the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky has chosen through his amendment now to strike from the \nbill, and, in fact, the amendment provided by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and others \nwho have supported their point of view.\n  The basic differences come down to, first of all, should the U.S. \nGovernment support tobacco? That is a very fundamental issue. The \ndebate, which now is in its third week on this subject, suggests that \nthe American people are not prepared for their Federal Government to \nsupport a crop, a set of products, which they find injurious to health. \nIndeed, much of our debate has been about how we can protect the health \nof children, how we can pay for the difficulties in health that \ncitizens of all ages have experienced.\n  If it were not for these health issues which are serious for tens of \nmillions of Americans and prospectively for many more, this debate \nwould not be so intense; clearly, the remedy suggested would not be so \nsevere. It really begs understanding of this issue as to how the same \ngovernment that may legislate severely with regard to tobacco, could at \nthe same time decide to support the price of tobacco, to support the \nindustry, the warehousing, the infrastructure, as the current tobacco \nprogram does and has done for almost six decades.\n  That is the first issue. Do we want the U.S. Government to support \ntobacco? And my judgment is we should not support tobacco. The \nlegislation that I have suggested does not give prioritization to \ntobacco. Rather, it says that tobacco, so long as it is a legal crop, \ncan be produced in America on the same terms as corn, wheat, soybeans, \nsame freedom to farm that all other farmers have, same tests of the \nmarket, same tests of efficiency, of production.\n  That, it seems to me, is the only way this can be rationalized, with \nthose in\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\nagricultural America asking, Why special treatment for tobacco? Why \nspecific situations that support that price, to support those farmers? \nThere is no good answer to that. I understand the constituency problems \nof the distinguished Senators who have many tobacco farmers, and I am \ncertainly mindful of approximately 10,000 farms in Indiana, albeit \nsmaller ones than in Kentucky and in North Carolina and some other \nStates, but nevertheless tobacco farmers who are impacted significantly \nby this debate. I have visited with them extensively. They support my \namendment for good reason.\n  Why would they support my amendment if I am prepared to say the \nFederal Government ought not to support tobacco? They do so because the \nLugar amendment provides payment to those who hold tobacco quota, the \ncertificates distributed principally in the 1930s, that allow people in \nthis country to produce tobacco. We are prepared in my amendment to \npurchase those rights in a 3-year period of time.\n\n  My amendment is attractive because the money comes to the tobacco \nfarmers, but even more importantly, to the holders of quota \ncertificates who are frequently elderly people, people no longer \ninvolved in production. They lease and rent the certificates to others. \nThey really have no desire to continue in the tobacco business. On a \none-time basis they can receive capital for pensions, for scholarships, \nmoney in the communities that are impacted--substantial money--and they \ncan receive it quickly in a 3-year period of time. That is why tobacco \ngrowers in most States have indicated through their organizations that \nthey support the Lugar approach.\n  The Senate as a whole has to ask which of the two approaches, the \nFord-Hollings or the Lugar approach, costs more. Clearly, the Ford-\nHollings costs at least $10 billion more than the Lugar approach. It \nhas a great deal more in it in terms of community development for \nStates and localities that have tobacco farmers over the years. It is \nsimply a very different approach which retains the tobacco program and \nsome of the apparatus that has been associated with it over the years.\n  I make that point because in the course of these remarks the \nstatement has been made that somehow or other the Lugar approach will \nsubtract money from health causes or other important objectives of the \nlegislation, but in fact it will subtract $10 billion less than the \nFord-Hollings amendment. There is no getting around that.\n  I simply say, finally, that to argue--I believe almost \ndisingenuously--that health groups would prefer a situation where $10 \nbillion less is left in the general fund of this bill for health or \nanything else is to, I suppose, deny common sense. Many health groups \nperhaps were misled by the thought that in the event we went to \nfreedom-to-farm tobacco, the price of tobacco would go down. The price \nof tobacco probably will go down.\n  We have had testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee and we \nhave had extensive hearings, as a matter of fact, on tobacco issues \nfrom which the Lugar amendment came. Essentially, the testimony was \nthat the price of tobacco might fall by as much as 25 percent, perhaps \nmore, depending upon how competitive American tobacco is in the world \nmarkets, and competitive abilities have been in decline. Most Americans \nare not aware that 40 percent of the tobacco now used in the production \nof American cigarettes comes from abroad, not from here. It comes from \nabroad because of questions of price and quality, normal economic \nquestions. That deterioration of the American tobacco demand has been \ncontinuing at a fairly rapid pace.\n\n  So, Mr. President, let me just state it fairly simply. If a pack of \ncigarettes now costs $2 before this bill, it will cost a great deal \nmore after this bill. Approximately 6 cents of that $2 might be \nattributed to the tobacco in the package. If in fact that goes down by \na quarter, maybe a cent or a cent and a half is at stake. To suggest \nthat somehow this brings either unconscionable profits to tobacco \ncompanies or enormous new demands by young people taking up smoking is, \nI think, to defy both economics and logic in the midst of our raising \nthe price of a pack of cigarettes by at least $1 or $2, or whatever the \nbill finally comes out to be with the overhead and all the economic \ncosts associated.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, health groups for a long time \nhave centered in on the fundamental issue I began with: Should the \nFederal Government be supporting tobacco at all? What kind of a signal \ndoes that give when we give official sponsorship and economic support \nto the price and warehousing and infrastructure of tobacco? I don't \nthink the signal is very good. As a matter of fact, it is so ambiguous \nthat it borders upon hypocrisy. At some stage, we will have to make a \nchoice as to which of these two general thrusts in life we are for--\nhealth or support of tobacco.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, finally, that we are going to have to \ncome to grips with the issue that is posed by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky in his striking of my amendment. I appreciate that. The \nparliamentary situation is that the Ford-Hollings approach and the \nLugar approach are both in the bill. I suggested that one or the other \nof us might, at some point in this debate, move to strike the other, \nand the Senator from Kentucky, my good friend, has decided he would \nmove to strike my situation.\n  So that is the issue before us. Members have to make a choice. I \nsimply say to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, who is on the \nfloor, that it would not be my purpose to delay the choice. My feeling \nis, essentially, by this time, if Members are not aware of the issues, \nthey never will be. My feeling is that we ought to get on with it and \nresolve it. I stated up front that this will not be a long speech and, \nif there are not many more, we might come to a conclusion.\n  Let me say that in defense of what we have been doing in the \nAgriculture Committee, in my own point of view, I rise to affirmatively \nsupport the Lugar approach, which has been moved by the Senator from \nKentucky to be stricken. I believe that it is important to adopt my \napproach, to keep it alive by voting ``no'' on the motion to strike, \nbecause we will end tobacco subsidies, we will end the tobacco program.\n  Mr. President, to be quite frank, this is the major point that I \nmake, the reason I am in this debate. I believe that agricultural \npolicy ought to be based upon supply and demand. I believe that all \nfarmers producing crops in this country ought to be treated equally. We \nhad a revolution in agriculture in 1996 in which we said freedom to \nfarm means that a farmer may decide to plant whatever he or she wants \nto plant on their land, have full control of that, without the Federal \nGovernment dictating how many pounds, how many acres, how many bushels. \nThe only signals would be market signals, and they are now world market \nsignals. They are important to America because agriculture is the thing \nwe do best, and our surplus and balance of trade is the greatest in \nthat area.\n  But freedom to farm also means taking risks. It means there is no \nwarehouse for wheat, or for corn, or for soybeans, no props, no passing \non from one generation to the next the right to grow corn or wheat. We \nreally have to get over that, Mr. President. I understand why it came \nabout in the 1930s because essentially people felt that if you let \nfarmers have freedom, they would inevitably plant too much, they would \ndo too much, they would be too ingenious, and, as a result, supplies \nwould be horrendous, prices would fall, agricultural communities would \nfail. The New Deal policy was one of killing little pigs, knocking out \nrows of corn, to dramatically change the supply and to bring the price \nup. Whatever may have been the rationalization in those days, it was \nconvenient to carry this on for about six more decades.\n\n  Many people in America would still like the idea of being guaranteed \na price for a bushel of whatever they are producing. They would like to \nbe guaranteed that their neighbor could not do more. But at the same \ntime, most farmers in agricultural America resent the Federal \nGovernment's control. They resent the fly-overs, the measurement of \nfields, the endless sign-ups--and rightly so. So we came to a \nrevolution of sorts, Mr. President, and we went to freedom to farm, \nexcept in the area of tobacco, for example, where persons in that \nindustry said that, ``Notwithstanding everything else going on in \nagricultural America, we want to retain the same program we have had.''\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n  Now, Mr. President, my own view is that the program is deteriorating. \nI am not one who would predict the month, the year, or even the decade \nwhere it will finally collapse. I just say that tobacco farmers coming \nto my office from my State, and also from Kentucky, North Carolina, \nGeorgia, and from South Carolina, I have said during the past year, \nalthough we had quota and the right to produce tobacco and to sell it \nand to have a price, we were cut back 10 percent in what we could do. \nFurthermore, they believe they are going to be cut back 15 percent this \ncoming year regardless of what we do on this bill. That is a big cut. \nThat is a deteriorating program. No wonder they were attracted by my \nthought that they might receive $8 per pound for quota, so many of them \ncould get out of the business altogether. Now, a good number said they \nwant to stay in the business, but they realize they are going to have \nto do so on the basis of supply and demand. That is the way the world \nworks--without all the apparatus, the warehousemen, and so forth. That \nis fair enough.\n  My bill provides that you continue right on producing, if you want \nto, and take money for quota, if you had it. If you are renting, fair \nenough, you have a transition of 3 years with some payments in support, \nthe same as do corn farmers, wheat farmers, rice and cotton farmers, in \nthe freedom to farm bill. It is a transition period. I think that is \nimportant, Mr. President. But at least we bring to an end an era that, \nI think, is coming to an end anyway.\n  Now, what if we don't pass the tobacco bill? What if, in fact, the \nidea of the Senator from Kentucky, or mine--either one--is not a part \nof the final picture? That is a real problem for tobacco farmers. It is \na problem that should have been contemplated by the attorneys general \nwhen they were working this situation out last year. But, as a matter \nof fact, at that time they left the whole grower issue aside. That is \nwhy we had hearings in the Agriculture Committee and why Senator Ford \nand others have been working in the Commerce Committee--to say, what do \nwe do about this very important group of people; namely, growers, \nholders of quota, holders of equity property out there in at least 10 \nStates in substantial numbers?\n  Now, Mr. President, my guess is that one or the other of our \namendments may prevail, but I am not confident of that. It could very \nwell be that the Senate will decide they don't want either one. It \ncould be that if we argue this long enough, people will begin to raise \nquestions. What is an acre of tobacco worth? In some cases, 10 times \nwhat an acre of corn might be worth on this same farm, as is the case \nin my home State of Indiana. One reason is because it is a very special \nprivilege. And as Americans take a look at this, they won't like what \nthey have to see.\n\n  In the Agriculture Committee for years, I witnessed--at least during \nthe 21-plus years that I have been a member of the committee--people \nprotecting each other. There were a lot of special deals. People got on \nthe committee often to make certain they protected their deal and their \nfarmers in their State. I understand that. Most did a good job of it. \nNow there are fewer special deals. There really is a very short list of \nsituations that need to be tidied up, and this is one of them.\n  So I come, Mr. President, to the floor to suggest that this is a good \ntime, while there is a general settlement going on, money on the table, \nlots of money. The question has been raised, Does the grower money \nsubtract from health? No. The Senate doesn't want to subtract. They \nsimply provided any sequence of years we wanted. But when Members come \nto the floor and they talk about $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 \nbillion, $600 billion, the $18 billion I am talking about in the Lugar \nbill is a very small part of that money. If people are worried about \nwhether it comes upfront, my advice would be to provide money upfront. \nIf you want to provide more money for health at the same time, do it. \nThis bill is as fluid as any piece of legislation I have ever seen. \nNothing is engraved in stone as to which dollar comes where.\n  All I am saying is if you are serious about tobacco farmers and their \nplight, you give them their money upfront. You do it promptly, and \nthose that want to leave, leave. Those that want to stay, stay, and \nreact like farmers in almost any other sphere, including sometime the \nsame farmers are producing corn as well as tobacco on the same farm.\n  Mr. President, that is the first big issue: The end of the tobacco \nprogram, the end of official U.S. Government sponsorship of all of \nthis.\n  Let me say, secondly, that my plan costs less. One could argue that \nin the course of all of this we have bandied about these hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that perhaps we have lost track altogether as to \nhow money is going to be spent. But I hope not. If there are any \nMembers who are interested in cost, they will vote for an $18 billion \nbill, the Lugar bill, as opposed to a $28 billion Ford bill.\n  In addition, I am advised that the bill of the Senator from Kentucky \nnow includes special relief for problems in North Dakota, or perhaps \nother States that have been afflicted by unusual weather problems. I am \nhopeful that in the course of the debate all of that will be explained. \nBut it is another unusual addition to an already belabored situation.\n  All I am saying is that if you are interested in cost, you will be \nfor the Lugar alternative. It is less. Obviously, Mr. President, the \nmoney gets to the tobacco farmers sooner. If you are a tobacco farmer, \nthe Lugar bill gets money to you more rapidly. Time is money--money \nupfront, money that could be used for capital for other farming, for \npension, for scholarships, for other things that people have a quota \nfor, or who are farmers where that quota can be utilized, and I think \nthat is an important issue.\n  Finally, let's be very clear on the health issues. I go back over \nthat again.\n  The fact is that the health groups of the United States--major \nproponents of this legislation--have analyzed these bills, and some \nhave come out one way and some another. But I would just say simply \nthat the money for health is finally going to be the determination of \nthis Senate in this bill in whatever amounts that we want to provide \nfor.\n  Some have accused the President of the United States for asking for a \nnumber of things in the health area. He cited some in the State of the \nUnion Address, and on this side of the aisle many of us have said we \nought not to be funding the State of the Union Address in the tobacco \nbill. But having said that, we are funding a good number of proposals \nthat the President or the administration and its various Secretaries \nhave made at some point. We do so because the problems of health \nattributed to tobacco have badly afflicted tens of millions of \nAmericans. These problems have created enormous public costs in the \nMedicare Program, Medicaid, and various other ways, and compounded \nblack lung disease and other difficult health problems in our country.\n\n  Mr. President, the logic has been that if we are going to have a \ntobacco bill, there ought to be some compensation to States. In fact, \nsome States have not waited for compensation. Lawsuits have been \nproposed and some have been successful. Thus, the attorneys general \ncame together and said perhaps we can have a comprehensive settlement. \nMany in the Congress found that to be intriguing. It would have been \nhelpful if the President of the United States, last fall, had offered a \nbill as opposed to general guidelines. It might have been helpful, as a \nmatter of fact, if there had been a comprehensive bill here that had \nembraced at least what I know have been seemingly contradictory strains \non occasion. I certainly do not fault the managers of the bill. They \nhave had a difficult time.\n  But we have come now to a point where the one item, one significant \nitem mentioned by everybody that was omitted--namely the growers, the \nfarmers--has to be addressed. I believe it should be addressed. I don't \nbelieve it should be omitted. It is not specifically a health issue, \nand one can argue it competes with health issues. But inequity to \nfarmers in these 10 States, and to tobacco farmers in particular, my \nintent and that of the Senators from Kentucky and South Carolina has \nbeen to take that very seriously. Although we may differ upon the \namounts of money and the continuation of the tobacco program and \nvarious particulars in terms of expenditures in the States for \ncommunity development and other aspects, we do not\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\ndiffer on very serious equity problems for farmers and for holders of \nquota.\n  So we must address that issue. I am simply hopeful that this issue \nwill not be seen as a subtraction or addition to health per se. It is a \nnarrow issue of compensation to farmers and to their communities.\n  I hope the Senate will accept the fact that there is equity in doing \nthat. The so-called narrow version of the tobacco legislation--that \nprinciple--might not be accepted.\n  So we are expanding today what the attorneys general and the State \ngovernments in their wisdom tried to negotiate last year. We are doing \nit so deliberately. Testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee \nsaid essentially the attorneys general, health groups, and everyone \nelse anticipated the Senate at some point would act in behalf of \ngrowers, as we are doing, and, in fact, explicitly or implicitly \nendorsed that activity.\n  Mr. President, I will rest my case for the time simply on the basis \nthat I believe I have outlined why the Lugar approach is the best. \nMembers will have a choice, either shortly or in the long term, \ndepending upon how much debate Members wish to hear or endure on this \nsubject. But I will not stymie progress of the bill. This is an issue \nthat needs to be resolved. Members will have to make an overall \njudgment, I believe, on the bill on the basis of all factors, this one \nincluded.\n  I hope at least in the course of this debate that we eliminate those \nissues that Members want to grasp, want to hear, and will be helpful in \nreaching a conclusion.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Ford's \namendment to strike title XV of the Lugar-McConnell tobacco farming \nprovision and to express my support for the Long-term Economic \nAssistance for Farmers Act, or LEAF Act.\n  First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, the \nchairman, Senator McCain, and ranking member, Senator Hollings, for \ntheir superb leadership of this bill, the principal aim of which is the \nvitally important objective of curbing youth smoking. Also, I would \nlike to extend my sincerest appreciation to Senator Ford for his time \nand energy in crafting a bill that effectively looks out for the \ninterests of the tobacco farmers and their communities' interests, \nwhich were all ignored until he spoke out so forcefully and \neffectively. Senator Ford's integrity and honesty and courage will be \nsorely missed when he leaves this Chamber, and I, like many of my \nSenate colleagues, will deeply miss the opportunity to seek his counsel \non the important issues about which the Senator has tremendous \nknowledge and passion. Certainly there has been no finer, more \nconsistent friend of family tobacco farmers than the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Kentucky. I ask my colleagues to remember this fact \nas we debate on this matter.\n  In my personal review of the tobacco settlement legislation, I have \nhad two main objectives--to prevent our children from smoking and to \nensure that tobacco farmers and their communities are taken care of.\n  Now, I am sure that all of my colleagues are committed to this first \nobjective, but I want to make sure that the second objective of \npromoting and protecting tobacco farmers is actually provided for in \nthis bill. I fully support the LEAF Act and, indeed, was an original \ncosponsor, and I want to state my reasons for favoring the LEAF \napproach over the proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar.\n  First, I do not support Senator Lugar's proposal, because I think it \nprovides for quick termination of the Federal tobacco program. I have a \nconcern about who the actual beneficiaries of this action will be. Is \nit tobacco farmers, is it the taxpayer, or is it the tobacco industry?\n  According to an Agriculture Department analysis, if the tobacco price \nsupport program ends, as it would under the Lugar plan, the price of \nflue-cured tobacco would drop from $1.72 per pound to $1.15 while \nburley tobacco would drop from $1.89 to $1.15. Accordingly, if these \nestimates prove to be accurate, this would save cigarette companies \napproximately $1 billion every year; that is, $1 billion annually, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Considering the fact that the tobacco program is a no-net-cost \nprogram to taxpayers and tobacco farmers will be receiving a 35 percent \nreduction in farm income, I think it is pretty obvious who will be \nbenefiting under Senator Lugar's proposal--the tobacco industry, \nperiod. Then where are we? What have we accomplished? What good will be \nour efforts to eliminate underage smoking by raising the price of \ncigarettes if the tobacco companies receive a $1 billion windfall every \nyear at the expense of tobacco farmers? This is a crucial question that \nI believe must be answered before the Senate contemplates letting the \nLugar proposal remain in the legislation.\n  Second, while it provides more in buyout payments over a shorter \ntimeframe, the Lugar proposal provides for substantially less in \nassistance for farm families and community assistance than the LEAF \nbill. Senator Lugar's proposal eliminates nearly $10 billion in funds \nfor this type of transitional aid. It eliminates funding earmarked to \nprovide higher education opportunities for tobacco farmers and their \nfamilies, for transition payments to tobacco industry workers who lose \njobs, as well as billions of dollars in funds to provide grants to \ncommunities for agricultural and economic development in tobacco-\nproducing counties.\n  I can understand the appeal that a quick buyout for tobacco quota \nmight have for a tobacco farmer, but I am extremely concerned that the \nbuyout proposal included in the Lugar bill is actually nonattainable. \nThe funding level contemplated in Senator Lugar's bill is $18 billion \nover 3 years. At this level, it would require Congress to provide $6 \nbillion a year for this one purpose, which is three times--three \ntimes--the amount available under this bill during this period.\n  So what happens if this money is not fully delivered? I will tell \nyou, Mr. President, what I think could happen. We will have left the \ntobacco farmer and their communities with an unfulfilled promise. In my \nhome State of Georgia, farmers, including those who grow tobacco, have \nexperienced extremely hard times over the last few years and are \nanxious to hear any good news. Then they hear about something called a \nbuyout with large payments over 3 years, and understandably some get \nexcited. But in order to deliver this amount of funds in \nthis timeframe, we would have to cut the amount of funds available for \npublic health programs and research by almost 75 percent.\n\n  Now, I ask you, Mr. President, is this likely? Can we legitimately \nexpect that we are going to eliminate 75 percent of the funding for \ncounteradvertising, child care, NIH research, and cancer clinical \ntrials? Can we honestly believe that these buyout funds will be \navailable? In this Senator's opinion, the answer is clearly no. Let us \nnot make false promises to tobacco farmers and their communities. Let \nus be honest. I implore my colleagues to carefully review the impact of \neach of these proposals as well as our ability to achieve them.\n  I urge you to oppose the proposal offered by Senator Lugar and \nsupport the LEAF Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia for his \neloquent remarks and hope that our colleagues were listening and they \nunderstand well what drives us who are more familiar maybe with the \ntobacco farmer, the small farmer.\n  The distinguished Senator from Indiana laid out how he arrived at \nwhere he is as it relates to his position on the tobacco farmer. It is \nideology with him more than it is fact for the farmer. He just does not \nbelieve that Government ought to help people, and so therefore he \nthinks everybody ought to be out there scratching on their own. And \nmaybe that is the correct way. But I have always thought that \ngovernment is here to serve people, and if it does not serve people, \nthen we do not need government.\n  I guess the Senator from Indiana understands that what he is about to \ndo is just put people out of business. Under the Freedom to Farm Act, \nwe are paying for millions of acres--millions of acres--and under the \ntobacco program there are less than a million total.\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\nUnder the Freedom to Farm Act, the purpose there was to increase \nproduction. What Senator Lugar will do, if his amendment is agreed to, \nwill be to put people out of business.\n  I have sat on a good many front porches, Mr. President; I have been \nin many kitchens having a cup of coffee with the farmer, his wife, and \nfamily; I have been in seven States talking to farmers--as we would \nsay, to the people who put the tobacco on the stick. I think I \nunderstand their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations, and all \nhave been based on history and what they expect the future to bring.\n  I have a statement here from the National Commission on Small Farms. \nThe National Commission on Small Farms said:\n\n       The tobacco program for more than 50 years has cushioned \n     small farmers, African American farmers, new and beginning \n     farmers, by providing them a degree of economic certainty. \n     It's not the tobacco crop for which there is no alternative \n     but the tobacco program itself.\n\n  There is a strange thing in the Lugar amendment that was put on after \nthe committee had met and sent the bill to the floor. The Lugar \namendment does away with the program. That means the tobacco farmer can \ngrow all the tobacco he wants to grow from year 1, but the Lugar \namendment keeps the price support in for 3 years.\n  Now, think about that. Here I am, a farmer growing 10,000 pounds of \ntobacco. They do away with the program. I can grow all the tobacco I \nwant, as we would say at home, fencerow to fencerow. They keep the \ntobacco support program in place for 3 years, and so I grow twice the \namount of tobacco, get the price support, and nobody wants my tobacco, \nso it goes to the so-called pool or into surplus. You do that for 3 \nyears. At the end of 3 years, it is all gone. The pool is lying there \nwith hundreds of millions of pounds of tobacco. Then what happens? The \ngeneral fund will pick up that tab. Oh, there is a provision in here \nthat says we will pay so much to try to offset that, but it doesn't \nwork.\n  And you know something that didn't happen as a result of the Freedom \nto Farm Act that we hear Senator Lugar was a strong supporter of. In my \nState, if we lose the tobacco program, it will reduce the value of the \nfarmland up to $7 billion.\n  If you take the program away from the farmers, you have four \ncompanies that control 98 percent of tobacco, and the farmers don't \nhave a thing to fight with, other than the program. What do you think \nthe price of tobacco is going to do? It is going to decline rapidly, \nand it will make a minimum, under this bill--well, beginning the first \nyear--a minimum average to the tobacco manufacturers of $1 billion a \nyear off the backs of a few farmers. All we are talking about is \n124,000.\n  So the vote comes down to: Are you going to vote to support the \nfarmer, or are you going to support Senator Lugar's bill that gives $1 \nbillion a year to the tobacco manufacturers?\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is pretty tough when you have gone to the \nbank and borrowed money based on the value of your property, your farm, \nand overnight--overnight--the value of your property is reduced several \nhundred dollars per acre because you have lost your tobacco program \nthat is of value.\n  You go to bed tonight with a loan from the bank and your property \nwill cover that loan, and in the morning, you have no program; the \nprice of your property has been reduced and your mortgage is called. \nThis is what I call a taking, Mr. President. We hear a lot about \ntakings around here, about taking property, but you are taking the \nvalue of the land of this small farmer.\n  As we say down in West Kentucky where I come from, ``Something about \nthat ain't right.''\n  What do we do? We hear a lot about the buyout and money upfront and \nthe older people who would like to sell out. Under the LEAF Act, that \noccurs. Anyone who wants to buy out at $8 a pound, the tenant, the \nlessee can sell. They can offer their crop for a buyout, and it will be \ndone. It also says that one quota holder can sell to another quota \nholder. But it also says that if you want to continue under the present \nprogram, you can't.\n  All agricultural economies--and I am sure a lot of folks here \nunderstands it--agribusiness says that it takes 10 to 15 years, and \nleans toward the 15 years, for a community to transform from one \neconomic aspect to the other.\n  We see under Senator Lugar's amendment--which was never voted on by \nthe committee while the hearings were going on or when we had the \nregular markup; it was done here on the Senate floor by checking the \nmajority on the Commerce Committee and the majority leader putting it \nin. I thought I had helped the chairman, Senator Hollings, and others \nget this bill out of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee \nand on to the Senate floor.\n  If you wonder how much money the Lugar amendment will take, they have \nsubmitted an amendment which is at the desk which will take 47 percent \nof all the money. If that amendment to this bill, which is at the desk \nand has not been called up yet, is adopted, I believe it is 47 percent, \nmaybe 48 percent of all the money will go to this one project. If 40 \npercent of the money goes to the States, that is 88 percent of all the \nmoney. What we find is that those health programs that we want to fund \nhave become discretionary. They are not part of the budget process; \nthey are not part of the estimated amount coming in under this bill. \nThey will be discretionary, and they will be subject to appropriations.\n  When you live with these people, having been one of them, having been \na farmer, and you see them every day, it seems a little bit ironic that \nwe are telling them what is good for them, because this year they voted \n97 and 98 percent to keep the program. Yet, we are saying to them, \n``You don't know what you are talking about; you don't know what you \nvoted for; we're going to change it; we're going to do away with that \nprogram that 98 percent of the farmers said they want to keep.''\n\n  We say to them, ``You don't know, we know better than you do,'' and \nthat is what I said earlier. One of the reasons this place isn't liked \nis because we get 98 percent of a group of people who say we want to \nkeep this, and we say, ``No, we know better than you do, so we're going \nto take it away from you.''\n  Oh, you can go out there and get all kinds of polls. You can get the \nfellow who grows 600,000 pounds of tobacco a year, and he sure would \nlike to have 4.8 million. They say under the Lugar bill you can keep \ngrowing. Sure, but at what price?\n  My Agriculture Department estimates that the 65,000 farm families in \nKentucky will be reduced to less than 10 percent. Only the big farmers \ncan contract with the manufacturers who will be getting $1 billion more \na year. Do you want to vote for the farmer, or do you want to vote for \nthe tobacco manufacturers? It comes down to that.\n  Just think, you will be reducing farm values in my State by up to $7 \nbillion. I have heard a lot from the other side of the aisle and some \non this side about property rights. I have talked to my home builders \nand others who worry about takings. Under this one amendment, if this \none amendment is adopted, up to $7 billion in farm value will be lost. \nThat is almost one-third of the farm value in my State. Approximately \n$20 billion is the assessed value of the farm property in Kentucky. So \nwe are reducing the value of that land and the ability of that farmer \nto secure a loan.\n  It doesn't make any difference how much money you give him. Our \naverage is about 3,000 pounds, and you want to pay it over 3 years. \nThat is $24,000. Then, you are going to pay tax on it. Boy, that is \nreally going to be great. Only the large farmers are the ones who have \nthe voice. The small farmer down there working depends on others. But \nHamilton said in these Halls, meaning the House and the Senate, ``The \npeople's voice shall be heard by their immediate representative.'' I am \nthat immediate representative. And I am trying to bring the voice of \nthe small farmer to the attention of my colleagues here in the Senate.\n\n  Is this emotional for me? Of course it is. In my last few months here \nin the Senate, I ought to be over there taking care of constituents, \npacking up my papers, getting them to the university, getting ready to \ngo home and spend some time with my family. But, no; the worst \npolitical question of my career, the toughest one I have ever had, is \nnow in the last 6 months of my service in the U.S. Senate.\n  You sit on the front porch with these farmers. You sit in the kitchen \nand\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\ndrink coffee with them and their families. From back in June of 1997, \nlast year, June 20, the farmers have been on a roller coaster ever \nsince.\n  Let me try to describe a little better where I come from with my LEAF \nAct. Tobacco farmers tried to get in on the negotiations between the \nAttorney General, the tobacco companies, and public health groups. They \nwere not let in the room. They were not even let in the room. I tried \nto find out what was going on. It was private. It was quiet. It was \nclosed. But the White House was there. The health groups were there. \nThe attorneys general were there. The tobacco companies were there. But \nthe ones who are going to get hurt the most were not there. Now we are \ntrying to hurt them even more.\n  The June 20 settlement did not include one dime for the tobacco \nfarmer. But there is $750 million in there for NASCAR and rodeos. And I \ndidn't hear anybody say, ``Take that out.'' No. ``Take it away from the \nfarmer. Don't take it away from NASCAR. Don't take it away from rodeos. \nLet them advertise at rodeos. Let them advertise at NASCAR.''\n  I am for the Winston 500. I do not have any problem with that. But I \nhave not heard a word in here, or from the other side, that they gave \ntoo much to NASCAR, that they gave too much to rodeos. But, boy, you \nsure are taking away from the farmer down there who has labored all his \nlife and has produced a superior product.\n  Alben Barkley, on this floor in 1939, put in the tobacco program. It \ntook him 3 years--1936 through 1939. Alben Barkley was a pretty good \nlegislator. He was a mighty fine Vice President. I think he understood \nhis people as well as anybody. And it hasn't changed. I wish I had the \nability that Alben Barkley had to speak and to convince people that \nwhat I am trying to do is right.\n  But sitting on those front porches, sitting in the kitchens and \ntalking to the farm families, I told them to get to work and come up \nwith something that they felt would be acceptable. And to work they \nwent. They developed a comprehensive plan not just for individual \ntobacco farms but for their communities as well. We have not thought \nabout Russellville or Horse Cave or Glasgow or Springfield or \nCarrollton. They are small farm communities that depend on tobacco. And \ntheir banks depend on tobacco. Their businesses depend on tobacco. \nFifty percent of their income comes from tobacco.\n  The average, in my State, is 25 percent is farm income. There are \nloans because the value of the property is there. The banker \nunderstands as long as the program is there, it gives them financial \nstability.\n  And so last October, after months and weeks of work, we introduced \nthe Long-Term Economic Assistance for Farmers Act, what we call the \nLEAF Act. And, you know, even the night before I introduced that--and \nwe all sat around, made one change--we all shook hands and got up and \nleft, that this is what we are going to support. And it was cosponsored \nby nine tobacco State Senators--myself, Senator Helms, Senator \nFaircloth, Senator McConnell, Senator Hollings, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Frist, Senator Cleland, and Senator Coverdell. All of us agreed \nthat this was in the best interest of the tobacco farmers and the \ncommunities and the welfare of our States.\n\n  Since that time, we have worked hard to broaden our consensus, \nincluding changes sought by Senators Robb and Warner of Virginia and \ntheir tobacco growers. We made those changes. We accepted a broader \nconsensus. This modified version of the LEAF Act is now included in the \nbill before the Senate in title X. Title XV, on the other hand, was \ninserted into the bill at the last minute after we got to the floor. It \nwas never debated in the Commerce Committee. It was never debated \nduring the markup. And all of a sudden here it comes--after we had an \nagreement. And the chairman went and explained the bill to farmers and \nwhat was in it.\n  It provides buyout payments for tobacco farmers who want to leave the \nprogram. And they keep using, against this bill, that, ``You take our \nmoney and you can keep on growing.'' Well, if you keep the program and \nyou sell out, that reduces--you no longer can grow, you don't want to \ngrow. It may be the widow who has the quota. It may be the elderly \ncouple who can no longer perform. But remember this: 69 percent of all \nthe farmers in Kentucky, 69 percent of all the quota holders in \nKentucky, have another job. This is a husband, wife, and family \noperation; 3,000 pounds, 3,100 pounds. Instead of hiring help, they do \nit themselves. And that money is theirs. They buy a major appliance. \nThey paint the house. They get a new truck, pay on the mortgage, help \nsend the kids to school.\n  What are we saying to those families now? ``In 36 months you're \ngone.'' Three thousand pounds is the average. That is $24,000; $8,000 a \nyear. And you are going to pay tax on it. Hasn't anybody said whether \nthere is going to be capital gains or regular taxes? If it is capital \ngains, it is 20 percent. So you take $1,600 out of that right off the \ntop. I have not heard whether it is going to be capital gains or \nregular taxes. Maybe some people who understand the tax program better \nthan I do can come up here and say how great it is going to be, and \nthey will not have to pay any.\n  There are buyout payments for tobacco farmers who want to leave the \nprogram. But under the Lugar amendment, the program is gone. And for 3 \nyears you still pay them so much per pound, and they can grow all they \nwant to. So it costs the taxpayers lots and lots of money, and nothing \nwill go to the farmer, it will go to the pool. And then after the 3 \nyears, there is nothing. And who owns it? Who is going to pay for it? I \nthink I know, and I think the Senator from Indiana knows.\n  It reforms and maintains a tobacco-supplied management program. We \nhave a core principle statement by about 24 health groups and the \ntobacco groups that they support--whatever--to reduce youth smoking. \nBut they also support keeping the program. It maintains a tobacco-\nsupplied management program. Without a tobacco-supplied management \nprogram, the 124,000 tobacco farm families in this country--which their \naverage tobacco growing in various States varies, the amounts--have \nabsolutely no bargaining power to deal with the four largest tobacco \ncorporations.\n  We are getting to a point where everybody is getting down to just a \nsmall group controlling everything. Four tobacco manufacturers control \n98 percent of the tobacco grown in this country. The Senator from \nIndiana says about 40 percent of the tobacco in cigarettes now are \nforeign. I think that is a little high. Of course, if you are for \nsomething it is less, and if you are against something it is higher. I \nfind somewhere in the middle might be about right. We do have GATT and \nGATT limits the amount of tobacco that can be imported into this \ncountry. I know that was about 150,000 metric tons and the tobacco \ncompanies have first choice.\n\n  So when you are going up against the small group of companies that \ncontrol the 98 percent of everything, you don't have much bargaining \npower unless you have a program. So we say as you reduce the quota \nbased on 1995, 1996 and 1997, that we will take the difference in that \nas we transition out into the future. Most agricultural economists say \nthat it takes 10 to 15 years, and closer to 15 years, to transition \ninto a new economic stream.\n  So as we look here at the bill itself we are under what the bill says \nwill go to agriculture. What the Senator from Indiana has to do with \nhis amendment, if passed and accepted, he has to correct the bill to \nsay he will get almost 48 percent of all money for the next 4 years, \nwhere we will only get 16. At the end of 10, we only get 4. Talk about \nsaving money--it costs $10 billion more. The bill is for 25 years. My \namendment is for 25 years. If you want to shorten it some, that is all \nright. If you are willing to talk, I am willing to talk, too, but I am \nnot willing to give up what the farmers have earned.\n  The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids--they have been very active in \nthis--supports a continuation of the tobacco program. They said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Legitimate concerns have been raised that in the absence of \n     some sort of a program, tobacco production may, in fact, \n     increase; that tobacco will be grown in other States that \n     presently do not produce tobacco and the tobacco companies \n     and the tobacco leaf dealer will gain control over the \n     production and move to contract production, keeping tobacco \n     farmers and their communities at risk.\n\n  The Senator from Indiana knows that. He knows that. But no, he wants \nto say here is the money, you get it upfront, you pay your taxes on it, \nyou get\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\nit over 3 years and I will only get 48 percent of all money for the \nnext 3 years. I am not sure he can get that. When you have the marriage \npenalty in here, you have Senator Coverdell and his drugs, vouchers and \nthe veterans --we have done a lot of work here. To do everything but \ntake care of the farmer and to try to stop underage smoking does not \nmake sense. What is going to stop underage smoking in this act?\n  I think you lose control of the production of tobacco under the Lugar \namendment. You have no way of controlling it except by price. When \nprices go down and tobacco companies make $1 billion more a year, you \nwill vote for the farmer; you will vote for the manufacturer. I hope \nyou will vote for that hard-working family, hard-working, God-fearing \nfamily.\n  Under the LEAF Act, it requires that tobacco companies pay all the \nadministrative costs associated with the tobacco program, assuring that \nno general taxpayer funds will be used for the tobacco program. Right \nnow, the only cost to the Federal Government under the tobacco program \nis the administration of the program and the poor old tobacco farmer \nout there pays a deficit budget fee. I doubt if anybody here has ever \nheard of a deficit budget fee paid by a farmer who grows a legitimate \ncrop. Last season they paid in over $30 million, about $32-34 million.\n\n  The tobacco farmer pays a deficit reduction fee before he gets his \ncheck from the warehouse. Think about that now. You have assessed him \nout there about everything you can assess him for and he has paid \neverything but the administrative fee, and now we are willing to take \ncare of that. Somehow or another that poor tobacco farmer down there \nhas been beat on and beat on and beat on. Somebody has got to stand up \nfor him against the big manufacturers.\n  Whether Senator Lugar knows it or not, he is playing into the hands \nof the tobacco manufacturers by saving them $1 billion a year. When you \ntake the controls off, they are then in control of how much tobacco \nthey want and what they will pay for it. If we don't deal with this, if \nwe want to get around GATT, I am sure that will be the next one--they \nwant to increase the amount of imports from 150,000 metric tons to \nwhatever so they can bring foreign tobacco in here that has no control \nover pesticides or anything else, no environmental control and bring \nthose on in, so it will be 100 percent. You are going to get it coming \nup from Mexico, you are going to get it coming down from Canada. I \nunderstand Marlboro Lights in Mexico are around 90 cents. We have tens \nof thousands of cartons of cigarettes being made every month on Indian \nreservations. This is playing into their hands --they don't want to pay \nState taxes. All these things are happening, but there is no control \nunder Senator Lugar's amendment of the growth of tobacco.\n  The LEAF Act, or title X of the bill provides economic development \nfunding to tobacco-growing States which must deal with the impact of \nsettlement legislation. We understand that if this bill ever becomes \nlaw, and the way it is going now and what the House says and Speaker \nGingrich says, we are just flipping our lips here because it isn't \ngoing anywhere when it gets there. We are spinning our wheels. There \nhasn't been anything added to this piece of legislation to stop \nunderage smoking--maybe $1.10. But you get a $185 pair of Nike shoes \nand some kind of jacket with all the designs on it and all that, and $3 \nor $4 for a pack of cigarettes, I don't think it bothers anybody too \nmuch. But then you ruin the farmer. You ruin the farmer.\n  So we try somehow as we reduce the use of tobacco, and hopefully we \ndo, we just try to say to that community--and I can go down community \nafter community and say to them that we are going to try to help you \nwith infrastructure, with economic development, with loans for new \nbusiness, to try to make up for the loss. And it all comes out of the \ntobacco company. It is not a taxpayer fund. It is not coming out of the \ngeneral fund anyhow, but it comes out of the money developed from the \ntobacco companies.\n  One thing I found, that the love of the tobacco farmer or the farmer \nfor his family is hard to improve upon. They are out there in the \ncountry and they get up early, work hard, go to school, come back, work \nhard, study.\n  One thing that a farm family wants is to see that their children have \na good education. If we put him out of business--and 90 percent of \nthem, my university estimates, will be--and there is no income, how do \nthey do it? We keep the program and we say, then, that as the time goes \nby, and in a certain period, in a certain amount, we will give the \ntobacco-growing families who wish to provide our* education assistance \nfor their children. What is wrong with that? I don't see anything wrong \nwith it. Others may. They say, well, you are trying to do too much. \nWell, if you are going to put somebody out of business and that is not \nhis or her choice, something has to be done.\n  Everybody around here voted for NAFTA--I didn't, but most of them \ndid. What do you do about dislocated workers? I had about 25,000 in my \nState in the textile industry, and all of those jobs have gone to \nMexico after NAFTA. What do you do with 25,000 idle workers? Under the \nlaw, you try to train them and get them prepared for another job. That \nis what we said here. We provide assistance for dislocated workers from \ntobacco warehouses, processing and manufacturing facilities, who lose \ntheir jobs as a result of this tobacco legislation. What is wrong with \nthat? We do it every place else. You say you don't want to do it for \nthis industry. Well, not a farmer had a document, not a farmer was in \non the advertising, and not a farmer did anything except try to support \nthe tobacco program.\n  I think that we have developed an approach that looks not just at the \nfarmer, but at the entire community that will be impacted by this \nlegislation. This approach is included in title X of what we call the \nMcCain bill. I can understand the large farmers wanting their money and \nthen being allowed to grow all they want. They will be the only ones \nthat can contract with the manufacturers. They will be the ones that \nwill get the big money and membership on the board of some outfit down \nthere. Not one of them grow less than 200,000 pounds of tobacco a year, \nand so they get anywhere from $1.6 million to around $4.8 million--just \nthose four people. So they will get around maybe $10 million, $11 \nmillion, or $12 million. No wonder. Those four who raised about 1.2 \nmillion pounds are big enough. They are big enough to deal with the \nmanufacturers. But we have just paid them a good deal of money and told \nthem ``you are out on your own.'' They like that. They have money. But \nyou are going to pay it over 3 years, and they are going to have to pay \ntax on it, so it is going to stick them a little bit.\n  Title XV, on the other hand, promises tobacco farmers the same amount \nof money, but over 3 years instead of 9. It would allow for the \nunlimited and largely unregulated production of tobacco. Title XV saves \ntobacco companies $1 billion per year for the next 25 years. Title XV \nrequires somewhere between 46--I wanted to look at the amendment, and I \nam sure the Senator will correct me. It is 46 or 48 percent of all the \nmoney--that is in the amendment at the desk--to pay for the Lugar \namendment in the next 3 years, where under the bill it says it can only \nhave 16 percent. At the end of 9 years, we only get 4 percent. \nSomething about that in the transition, it seems to me, ought to be \ndone.\n  So let's remember that title XV is a billion dollars per year \nwindfall for the tobacco companies. It is $1 billion a year windfall \nfor the tobacco companies. Are you going to vote for the farmer or the \ntobacco companies? I think that question is pretty clear. Each year, \ntobacco companies pay based on the program. Most of the time, they pay \nabove the average. So we take the average and knock 70 cents a pound \noff. That is going in. You can't pay people to grow it, fertilize it, \nfor the equipment and all that, and come out as a small farmer. So \nroughly one-third will be reduced. Over the course of 25 years, the \nLugar amendment saves the tobacco manufacturers a minimum of $25 \nbillion. Do you want to take the manufacturers over the farmers? I hope \nnot.\n  And the Lugar amendment takes away the money that the Leaf Act would \nspend to try to spur economic development, to try to give them \ntechnical advice, to go from one crop to the other, which is not in the \nLugar\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\namendment. It takes away the education. It doesn't even talk about \neducating kids. We are just going to put you out of business and give \nyou some money and let you go on your own. We are going to reduce the \nvalue of your land--in my State, $7 billion. How is that going to \nreflect on the taxes that are paid in the counties and the cities and \nthe State? Are they going to raise taxes on a smaller amount of value? \nYou know, this thing has ripples.\n\n  I don't believe the Senator from Indiana has thought all these \nthrough. If he has, I don't believe he would be this harsh on tobacco \nfarmers. I am sure there would be a rebuttal, but you can't rebut if \nyou take the quota away and it reduces the value of the land. That is a \ntaking. You go to bed with the value of the land, and you wake up and \nthe program is gone; tomorrow the value of your land is gone. They can \nforeclose on you because you don't have enough value to cover your \nmortgage.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FORD. I will be glad to yield. I wondered how long you were going \nto sit there and take all this.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respect the Senator from Kentucky. I wanted to inquire \nof the Senator. The discussion is very important.\n  Mr. FORD. I respect the Senator from Indiana, also.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I wonder if the Senator planned to continue his discussion \nuntil the end of the session, or whether at some point I might seek \nrecognition to speak.\n  Mr. FORD. I will be glad to give the Senator an opportunity to speak \nas long as he doesn't make a motion. When we get to a vote on this, I \nwould like to have some agreement, if we could, as it relates to a \nvote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If the Senator would consider allowing me to speak, I \npledge to the Senator not to make a motion with regard to disposition \nof this bill during today's session.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator's word is as good as gold. I have no problem \nwith that. All I want to do is, after you get through, I imagine I will \nhave something else to say, and then it will probably be dinnertime.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will understand this \nobservation. Clearly, the strongest thing going for the Ford amendment \nis the Senator himself. As he has pointed out, he has long service to \nthe people of Kentucky and his arguments on behalf of farm families \nwith whom he has visited, and clearly all Senators have affection for \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky. It is my hope and had \nbeen my hope that I could persuade him that it is in the best interest \nof these farmers--the people with whom he has visited on the porches, \nwho really have very real needs--and that is true of any tobacco \nfarmers in the communities--and we want to support them.\n  I know they are not as numerous as those in the Senator's State, but \nit is still very important to me. Our argument is really over what the \nfuture holds for them. I come into this business having conducted \nhearings, not claiming extensive knowledge like the Senator from \nKentucky, but nevertheless understanding the predicament, it seems to \nme, of the tobacco program. I believe that it is a deteriorating and \nfailing program. To give any other impression is not to give a very \ngood forecast of the future. I hope the Senator from Kentucky agrees \nwith me that, given that predicament, this particular piece of \ncomprehensive legislation is almost a heaven-sent opportunity and has a \nlot to do with farmers who are tobacco farmers and those in those \ncommunities. I believe that if the opportunity passes, so will the \nopportunity for many of those families. That concerns both of us.\n\n  Let me just say for the record that the Senator from Kentucky \nmentioned that an amendment I had planned to offer at the desk would \nprovide for 46 percent of the farmers' money coming in the first year. \nThat is correct. Let me point out, this is 46 percent of the money \ndedicated to farmers, not 46 percent of all of the money in the bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question at that point?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Certainly.\n  Mr. FORD. Is that 46 percent of 16 percent?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. You only take 8 percent of the tobacco money.\n  Mr. LUGAR. No. The amount of money in the Lugar bill for farmers is \nabout, as I recall, $16 billion or $17 billion. And 46 percent of that \nwould come in the first year.\n  Mr. FORD. Then you have to get the money from somewhere. As I read \nthe amendment, I say to my friend, that would take 46 percent of the \nmoney raised by the tobacco bill. So the States get 40 percent and you \nget 46 percent. That is 86 percent of all the money.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will not argue with the Senator's arithmetic. I suggest \nthere is even a worse predicament; namely, as the Senator has pointed \nout, a marriage penalty, and the drug program. Other things have been \nadded in since we started the argument. My thought--this was at least \nin the working with the health community--was to try to stake out the \nfarmers' claims before various other claims of the health community and \nvarious others that might come along. Clearly, the amounts of money in \nthe amendment of the Senator from Kentucky in this bill will have to be \nexpanded. And in conference they surely will be expanded. It appeared \nto me to stake out the farmers' interest in this way was prudent. The \namendment has not been offered. The Senator has an amendment on the \nfloor to strike my section which is the pending business. So we may \nnever come to that point.\n  Mr. FORD. I hope.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That was my motivation. My general logic still is about \nthe same--that we have a very crowded situation up front. But that is \nnot precluding either one of us from arguing for the farmers' interests \nup front as opposed to downstream, and a long way down the stream in \nthe case of the Senator's amendment.\n  Let me just try to clarify another point that has arisen along the \nway; namely, that the Lugar plan would be of great benefit to cigarette \ncompanies. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky has frequently said, \n``Are you for the companies, or the farmers?'' I am for the farmer. I \nhave made no mistake about that for years. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky will recall that I have been attempting to wrap up the \ntobacco program for many years--it is not a new endeavor--because I \ndon't believe it is good agricultural policy. But leaving that aside, \nthe charge is made that under the Lugar plan the tobacco prices would \ndrop dramatically and the companies would, therefore, make more profit \non each pack of cigarettes. Let me try to address that as carefully as \nI can.\n  Dr. Blake Brown of North Carolina State University, one of the \nNation's most respected tobacco economists, studied what would happen \nif cigarette prices rose $1.50 cents a pack and the tobacco program \nwere ended. As we know, the amendment to raise the price to $1.50 a \npack failed. It is $1.10 a pack. So, to that extent, we have a problem \nwith Dr. Brown's analysis. But, nevertheless, follow me if you will. He \nsaid that prices would not fall as much as opponents of the Lugar \namendment assert. He projected a decline of 20 percent to 25 percent at \naround 35 cents to 40 cents, not the 60 cents or 70 cents claimed by \nsome. Notwithstanding that, he said the price would fall but production \nwould increase.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has made that point--and he is correct, \naccording to Dr. Brown--that, in fact, a more efficient tobacco \nindustry is likely to arise under the Lugar amendment. This should not \nbe surprising.\n  Essentially, the tobacco program now brings about a very inefficient \ntobacco situation in the United States. I am not a proponent of \ntobacco, but I would say freedom to farm would be good for tobacco. In \nessence, the price will fall, more will be produced, exports will \nincrease because price-wise--I would argue quality-wise--and it would \nbe more competitive. Revenue is not simply price; it is price \nmultiplied by volume. As a matter of fact, Dr. Brown estimates the \ntotal dollar value of tobacco sales would fall by just 2.8 percent, or \n$74 million, a year. By contrast, the Commerce Committee bill raises \nabout $500 billion from the tobacco companies.\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is my analysis that, in fact, the tobacco companies \nconceivably have $74 million of economy a year, not a billion a year \nthat the Senator from Kentucky has mentioned. You multiply that by 25--\nI am asserting it is more like $74 million perhaps, and conceivably \nless than that, as a matter of fact.\n  That is a very different ball park to argue the situation one way or \nanother for the tobacco companies. But I would simply say that the \ntobacco companies are more likely to buy American tobacco under this \nsituation. It is unlikely to lead to a GATT crisis, simply because the \nmarket works. One reason the tobacco companies do not buy as much \nAmerican tobacco now is that normally the quality of much of it is not \nvery good. The price of it is abnormally high. They have substituted \npurchases from abroad.\n  There are so many mixed motivations in this bill that some Senators \nmight argue we do not want a more efficient tobacco industry. As a \nmatter of fact, we want to make it as inefficient as possible, as few \nsales as possible of American tobacco, the least rationalization \neconomically of it all. But you can't carry water on both shoulders on \nthis issue.\n  I am suggesting that this is a good time simply to get the \ngovernmental apparatus out of it, which, in my judgment, is not very \nhelpful either to the tobacco farmers, or the tobacco companies, or to \nanybody involved, and clearly it leads to a balance of trade problem \nfor America generally.\n  Let me get into the health and research question again, because some \nSenators may be tempted to support the amendment of the Senator from \nKentucky because they believe that health programs might be disturbed \nin the redistribution of these funds.\n  Let me just point out that the technical details of Senator Ford's \nproposal are important to know. For example, in the amendment that he \nhas presented--and it is part of this bill now--the Ford plan costs \nwill immediately explode by design, because payments are accelerated if \nthe tobacco program ends. These costs could be over $10 billion in a \nsingle year.\n  Why do I mention this? I mention it because I would guess, having \nwitnessed action on the floor for several years, that in some year some \nSenator is going to propose the end of the tobacco program. That may \nnot occur tonight or tomorrow. It could, if the Senate passes my \namendment. But for some reason, because of sentiment for the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky to continue this process, after the \ndistinguished Senator has left the floor and left the Senate, my \nprediction is that some Senator will say this doesn't make sense, for \nthe Federal Government to be prescriptive with regard to tobacco and \nhere we are supporting tobacco in this way by governmental fiat.\n  So at some point in a farm bill, or without a farm bill, my guess is \nthe program will come to an end. The Senator has thought of that and \nsays if that should be the case, immediately payments of all sorts come \nto tobacco farmers. In other words, there is a ticking time bomb there \nto suggest it is very expensive for anybody to try to end the tobacco \nprogram. Members need to understand that. They are buying not only a \ncontinuation of the tobacco program but a rather huge payment, if \nanyone should dare to tamper with the program.\n  The health community people need to understand that. This is not a \nbenign amendment with regard to the health of the American people.\n  Let me point out, Mr. President, that the charge that we will give a \n$1 billion gift to cigarette manufacturers, taking it out of the \nfarmers' pockets, just simply does not hold water. We have cited Dr. \nBrown of North Carolina State before. I cite Dr. Brown again. He \nestimates, as we have suggested, that farmers' total revenue might \ndecline by 15 percent. He said this decline assumed a $1.50-a-pack \nprice, but even at the $1.10 we finally adopted, the increase in their \nloss of revenue could still be severe--maybe not 15 percent but \nsomething in that neighborhood. Keeping the current program means lower \ntotal revenues for American tobacco farmers because noncompetitive U.S. \nprices well encourage a continued uptrend in imports and reduce exports \nwhile domestic demand is stagnant or falling.\n  I made the point, Mr. President, that it is conceivable through \nprotectionist legislation on top of this that Senators might decide to \ntry to keep foreign tobacco out of the country, might try to amend the \nGATT at the World Trade Organization meetings when they come along next \nyear. That would add, I suppose, double jeopardy to the whole \nsituation--Federal sponsorship of tobacco, compounded by protectionist \nlegislation enveloping even that.\n  That does not make sense. This is not the way the world works. It is \nnot the way the policies of this country are headed. Why in the \nparticular instance of tobacco is there a blind spot with regard to the \nsuccessful economic operation of our country including this specific \nindustry? In fact, I would suggest that the families who, under the \nLugar amendment, will be collecting $8 a pound for quota will use that \nmoney, many of them, to make investments and to earn money on them that \nare substantially more sound and more lucrative than the investments \nthey have in tobacco. The tobacco industry is not a winner in terms of \ncurrent investment either as a farmer, warehouseman or a manufacturing \nconcern. It is not a winner because this legislation is in the Chamber \nand the impact of this legislation is going to be very depressing to \ntobacco people wherever they are.\n  The intent of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself is \nto not only cushion that blow for farmers and those communities, but it \nis to provide, upfront and quickly, capital for those farmers to have a \npension or money to invest in other operations, agricultural or \notherwise, or money for scholarships. And I share the enthusiasm of the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky for education of young people in \nthose areas where tobacco is produced, as well as elsewhere. But I \nwould seriously question whether the educational opportunities of those \nstudents are going to be enhanced by continuation of the tobacco \nprogram, a program that will mean less income for their families \nannually as far as the eye can see, from an industry and a general \narea, that of tobacco, in which demand will be depressed, in which \nsales and the amount of quota given annually will be depressed and in \nwhich, one after another, these families will in fact leave the \nbusiness.\n  I am not trying to legislate anyone out of business. I am as \nsensitive as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that in a \ndeteriorating situation people are leaving farming in general, but they \nare leaving tobacco farming in particular because it is particularly \ndepressed and does not have even the liberation of freedom to farm, the \nability to farm or to plant what he wants to maximize his or her \nproduction in this country.\n  If, in fact, we are talking about the health and welfare of tobacco \nfarmers--and that is our intent today--and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky is correct, that we were not at the table when the \nattorneys general of the various States met with the tobacco \ncompanies--and, in fact, testimony before the Agriculture Committee by \nat least one witness was that settlement for growers was deliberately \nleft out. It was, to quote one of them, a deal breaker. Others have \nsaid that all along they expected Congress would act, and, indeed, we \nare attempting to do that.\n\n  Mr. President, if we do not act or if we had not acted by bringing \nthese amendments to the floor, I think it is clear to the tobacco \nfarmers in my State they will be on a losing course with tobacco for \nthe rest of their lives without any recourse or any particular funds.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would suggest as to the critical issue that \nhas been suggested; namely, is there credible evidence that farmers \nwill receive their money, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has \npointed out that certainly my plan looks attractive to farmers who \nanticipate receiving $8 per pound of quota in the first 3 years after \nenactment; that my plan looks attractive to farmers who want to \ncontinue on and receive transition payments comparable to those of \nfreedom to farm for corn and beans and wheat and cotton and rice, and \nmy plan looks attractive, as a matter of fact, to communities that \nreceive at least modest amounts of community development funds. The \nSenator from Kentucky has pointed out the value of these funds.\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\n  I believe my amendment is attractive for all of these reasons, and \nthis is why it is attractive to grower organizations in most States \nthat have a lot of tobacco--a great deal of support, resolutions of \nsupport directly, editorial support in newspapers. It is not because \npeople in those States necessarily favored my desire to end the tobacco \nprogram. It is because they came to a recognition the program is \nending. It will be gone. This is the one opportunity in which some \ncompensation might occur. It is an opportunity not to be missed.\n  Now, if it is to be ceased in terms of the family, the money upfront \nmakes sense. It is very important to understand that and to understand \nwhy that injection of capital and expenditure and buying power into \ntobacco communities is important in the short run. It is important to \nunderstand why, when a conference occurs with the House, if they pass a \nbill, growers need to have a strong position at the table, which our \nbill gives them. I think it is very important, as a matter of fact, to \nthe success of this legislation as a whole that there be a provision \nsuch as the one I have suggested and which the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky has now moved to strike--that my provision be there. It \nis a strong reason for Senators to vote for the overall legislation.\n  I would say correspondingly, if in fact the tobacco program is to \ncontinue on forever, and if the expenditures the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky has pointed out are very generous to his State and a few \nothers are to be a part of that, many Senators will raise the question \nas to why the rest of the United States of America ought to subsidize \nthese few States or these few counties. What equity is there, as a \nmatter of fact, in such a transfer of money over the course of time? \nAnd Americans will clearly ask, Is it not hypocritical to maintain that \nentire apparatus if the point of tobacco legislation is to discourage \nsmoking, discourage consumption, to help improve the health of the \nAmerican people and the desire of young people to become committed to \nsmoking at all.\n  For these reasons, I am hopeful that as Members ponder their \ndecision--and it may be a decision they will have to ponder throughout \nthe evening or will make at some point in the morning, because I have \npledged to the distinguished Senator now to make a motion. I had \nindicated earlier in the afternoon I was perfectly willing for a quick \nvote, and that situation did not materialize.\n  There is no one here stopping progress. I will just simply say, at \nsome point this has to be resolved, and I hope the Senators will \nresolve it in favor of the Lugar amendment, because I believe this is \nthe best course for tobacco farmers, for tobacco communities, and for \nour national policy.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it has been a good debate, and I have \nenjoyed it. I am not learned in debate. Whatever skills I might have \ncome from experience. I have been around here a little longer than the \nSenator from Indiana. This is my 24th year, and I believe this is maybe \nhis 21st or 22nd. Of course, he was mayor of Indianapolis; I believe, \none of the favorite mayors at that time. He said after I leave the \nSenate, the tobacco program is gone. Can you believe one Senator can be \nthat strong? The first thing I learned when I came here was that every \nSenator is independent. Every Senator has one vote. He controls that \nout here and nobody controls him. I just can't believe it, but it is in \nthe Record, and I might cut it out of the Record and frame that \nstatement from a Member of the other side.\n  I was sitting here thinking about the money and how much is \navailable. If the Senator's amendment stays in, this amendment will \nhave to go beyond the 16 percent. But, if you get 46 percent in the \nfirst year, that is where you need 60 percent of the first year's \nmoney. That is $8 billion that you will have to pay out the first year. \nThat is 60 percent. I suggest it will be close to 60 percent in the \nsecond year and the third year. If the Senator wins, he might want to \nchange the percentage on that amendment.\n  The Senator says that public health groups say regulation of tobacco \nwill be less efficient. I believe that is his statement. On the one \nhand, he says funding is not important; on the other hand, he says \nthere is a ticking time bomb of explosion. I don't quite understand \nthat money is not important. He says funding is not important but, on \nthe other hand, there is a ticking time bomb.\n  Senators should know that Senator Lugar is promoting his proposal \nbecause it would increase tobacco production. He said that--increase \ntobacco production, going to make it more efficient, all those good \nthings. But he is promoting the increase in tobacco production.\n  Ask the public health groups what they think about that. Ask a small \nfarmer what he thinks about that: a production increase for big \nfarmers, fine, while the small ones are out of business. I don't \nbelieve the Senator would like it if he was back in his home in \nIndiana, and he has value of land--they talk about the money up front \nand they can make an investment, but when you lose hundreds of dollars \nper acre in value of your farm, I am not sure how well you come out in \nthis, and they put them out of business. At least 90 percent of my \nsmall farmers in Kentucky are gone, and that is a conservative \nestimate, not a liberal estimate, but a conservative estimate.\n  We are getting to the point where it is very difficult for me to \nunderstand, and I think the Senator is having a hard time defending his \nposition when he is wanting to increase the growth of tobacco, reduce \nthe price and save the tobacco companies a billion dollars. I say to \nthe Senator, that is true, and it may be even more than that, because \nfour companies control 98 percent of the growth of tobacco. We have a \nhard time exporting tobacco because other countries are growing it, and \ncompanies have promoted some of that. So we limit it. Like everybody \nelse, we limit it, and it is a pretty large limit on imports, to \n150,000 metric tons or more.\n\n  Somebody has to be thinking through all of this as much as we are, \nand those people who are thinking through this are the health groups \nthat have been fighting so long as it relates to reducing the use of \ntobacco by underage children.\n  Something quite remarkable, I say to the Senator from Indiana, \noccurred on March 16 of this year. Remember that date, March 16. On \nthat day, March 16, 16 tobacco farming groups and 24 public health \ngroups came together to agree on a common set of core principles. You \ntalk about health groups now. Here are 16 tobacco farm groups and 24 \npublic health groups that came together to agree on a common set of \ncore principles to guide the debate--to guide the debate--on tobacco \nlegislation. Both sides and all 40 groups agreed that ``a tobacco \ncontrol program which limits supply and which sets a minimum purchase \nprice is in the best interest of the public health community.''\n  That is a pretty strong statement by the health groups, and in \nconjunction with the tobacco interests. According to the Campaign for \nTobacco-Free Kids in a letter dated May 13, ``those public health \ngroups who signed the core principles remain committed to the \nprinciples outlined in them, including maintenance of a supply limiting \ntobacco program.''\n  What we are doing here is--I believe it is under title IV of the \nbill, and I am sure the Senator knows what title IV is, but that limits \nthe amount of money that can be spent for agricultural purposes under \nthis bill. The LEAF Act is under that limit. The Senator's amendment is \nabout three times or four times over that limit. But we are within that \nlimit. This is approved by the health groups. Instead of cutting them \noff at the knees in 36 months, we give them a little more time to \nphaseout. They can sell out, they can buy out.\n  I have a list of all of the groups that signed the core principles, \nsuch as the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, \nAmericans for Nonsmokers Rights, American College of Chest Physicians, \nAssociation of Schools of Public Health, the Oncology Nursing Society, \nPartnership for Prevention, National Hispanic Medical Association--I \ncan go down all these groups that think keeping the program is the \nright thing to do and saving $18\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\nbillion. I might say to my colleagues, saving $18 billion for the use \nfor research and health care and all these other things.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the public \nhealth groups that signed the core principles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       The following public health groups signed the ``Core \n     Principles'':\n       American Heart Association\n       American Public Health Association\n       American Cancer Society\n       Americans for Nonsmokers Rights\n       American Association for Respiratory Care\n       American College of Cardiology\n       American College of Chest Physicians\n       American School Health Association\n       American College of Preventative Medicine\n       Association of Schools of Public Health\n       Interreligious Coalition on Smoking OR Health\n       Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids\n       Oncology Nursing Society\n       Family Voices\n       Partnership for Prevention\n       National Hispanic Medical Association\n       Coalition for Health and Agriculture Development (KY)\n       Kentucky Action\n       American Cancer Society (KY)\n       American Heart Association (KY)\n       American Lung Association (KY)\n       Kentucky Dental Association (KY)\n       Kentucky Medical Association\n       Kentucky Parent Teachers Association\n       Kentucky Society for Respiratory Care\n       American Heart Association\n       American Lung Association\n       Kentucky Smokeless States Project\n       Albermarle County (VA) Medical Society\n       Virginia Public Health Association\n       Georgia Public Health Association\n\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina wishes to make a statement. And I am more than willing to \nyield to him.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand he needs about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. About 6 or 7.\n  Mr. FORD. Well, that is pretty close. So, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the distinguished President pro tempore be \nrecognized for what time is necessary, and that after he has completed \nhis statement, that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. FORD. I appreciate you being a cosponsor on my LEAF Act, too.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, thank you.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thurmond pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2176 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Again, I wish to thank the able Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I do not know that there are a great deal of additional \nthoughts that we need to discuss. I could go down--one of the things \nthat I want people to understand is that we are not just doing away \nwith the tobacco quota. Oh, we are paying them some money, but the \naverage, I don't think, is going to be much over $20,000, divided by 3 \nyears. And the taxes are paid.\n  Anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the value of Kentucky farmland is \nbased on the tobacco quota. In rural Kentucky, banks will not lend to \nfarmers unless they know the value of their tobacco quota. Real estate \ndoes not sell without disclosing the amount of tobacco quota on a farm. \nYou can't sell a farm without disclosing that. That is an important \nfeature.\n  If you read the real estate section of the Kentucky newspapers, you \nwill see the amount of tobacco quota advertised with the sale of the \nfarmland. So if the program is done away with, then the value of the \nland is reduced anywhere from 15 to 20 percent, and that is up to $7 \nbillion. So we are not only taking away the livelihood, we are also \nreducing the value of the product this farmer has worked all his life \nto hold.\n  There is something here that I believe is fundamental--fairness. And \nunder the Lugar bill, that is not fair. So this will have major, \ndevastating consequences on the tax base in rural Kentucky--all because \nof the hostility of title XV toward the small tobacco farm.\n  The Lugar alternative is really no alternative at all when you look \nat what happens to that tobacco farmer. It gives him a little money, \nand he is out. And we reduce the value of his land. He pays big sums of \ntax on it. If it is 20 percent, fine, but he has to figure some way.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not know what the majority leader or the \nDemocratic leader would like to do. I understand we have a joint \nmeeting tonight, with both sides, beginning at 6:30. We are getting \nreasonably close to that. So in order to find out if it is all right \nwith the Senator from Indiana, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6381-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, today is a very special day for both our \nnation's serving law enforcement officers and myself.\n  At 3:00 this afternoon, Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan and I \nwere at the White House attending a ceremony where the President signed \ninto law the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. The \nenactment of this bill is near and dear to my heart.\n  During the years I served as a Deputy Sheriff in Sacramento County, \nCalifornia, I gained a first-hand understanding of the dangers our law \nenforcement officers face in the line of duty. Our brave men and women \nwearing a badge simply never know what life threatening dangers each \nnew day may bring.

He will be missed.\n  We must do all we can to protect law enforcement officers like Bruce \nVanderJagt.

He will be missed.\n  We must do all we can to protect law enforcement officers like Bruce \nVanderJagt. If even one law enforcement officer's life is saved by a \nbullet proof vest that would not have been available without this law, \nall of our hard work that went into getting this bill through Congress \nand today enacted into law, will have been well worth it.\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6398-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12 noon, a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2888.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 172\n\n       Whereas, our country is strongly committed to equality of \n     opportunity. An important government body working to put this \n     commitment into action is the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (EEOC), the nation's leading civil rights \n     enforcement agency; and\n       Whereas, the EEOC currently has a backlog of 65,000 cases \n     of discrimination to investigate to pursue justice for \n     individual citizens victimized by unfair and illegal \n     practices. The EEOC needs to direct its resources to these \n     individuals, rather than to the pursuit of trying to find new \n     instances of possible problems. It is much more prudent to \n     handle specific cases of discrimination than to direct \n     energies to test employers by using decoy job applicants to \n     look for discriminatory behavior; and\n       Whereas, the administration's recommendation of increased \n     spending for the EEOC is appropriate if the increased funds \n     are targeted to address the backlog of discrimination cases \n     that need to be investigated. The men and women victimized by \n     discrimination deserve the protection of the EEOC and should \n     not be made to wait longer while resources are directed to \n     less productive activities; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, that we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to increase funding to the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission to handle the backlog of individual \n     cases; and be it further\n       Resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-463. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 56\n\n       Whereas overcapitalization of fish harvesting capacity in \n     the Bering Sea has resulted in highly compressed, derby-style \n     fisheries; and\n       Whereas overcapitalized fisheries typically lead to \n     excessive exploitation of a fishery resource, often resulting \n     in a precipitous decrease in the economic yield of the \n     fishery resource; and\n       Whereas the State of Alaska values sustainable fishery \n     management principles, which include minimizing bycatch and \n     waste, maximizing utilization of the fishery resources \n     harvested, minimizing adverse effects of fishing gear on fish \n     habitat, and maximizing economic returns on the public \n     fishery resource for the benefit of Alaska communities and \n     the citizens of the United States on the whole; and\n       Whereas Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska has, with the \n     cosponsorship of Senators Murkowski, Breaux, and Hollings, \n     introduced S. 1221, ``American Fisheries Act''; and\n       Whereas S. 1221 would effectively limit fishing capacity in \n     the Bering Sea fishing fleet through vessel size limitations \n     and ownership requirements; and\n       Whereas S. 1221 would limit the maximum length, tonnage, \n     and shaft horsepower of vessels engaging in domestic \n     fisheries in the United States navigable waters and exclusive \n     economic zone; and\n       Whereas S. 1221 would require that at least 75 percent of \n     the controlling interest of a vessel engaged in the fisheries \n     in the United States navigable waters and exclusive economic \n     zone be owned by citizens of the United States; and\n       Whereas S. 1221 would correct a loophole in the Commercial \n     Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 that \n     allowed vessels that were rebuilt in foreign shipyards to \n     enter the fisheries off Alaska; and\n       Whereas S. 1221 would permanently prohibit federal loan \n     guarantees for any vessel intended for use as a fishing \n     vessel that does not meet size, tonnage, horsepower, and \n     domestic ownership criteria; and\n       Whereas S. 1221 would effectively promote further \n     Americanization of the fisheries of the United States;\n       Be it resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature supports \n     those provisions of S. 1221, the ``American Fisheries Act,'' \n     that would reduce the fishing capacity of the Bering Sea \n     fishing fleet and promote the Americanization of the \n     fisheries of the United States; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests the Congress to pass S. 1221.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable Al \n     Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and President \n     of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Strom Thurmond, President \n     Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Newt Gingrich, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; and to the\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\n     Honorable Ted Stevens and the Honorable Frank Murkowski, U.S. \n     Senators, and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, \n     members of the Alaska delegation in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-464. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 149\n\n       Whereas, in February 1997, the Federal Aviation \n     Administration announced an initiative to demonstrate, \n     validate, and deploy an air traffic management system in \n     response to recommendations made by the White House \n     Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, a plan known as \n     Flight 2000, to accelerate the National Airspace System \n     modernization, and is scheduled for demonstration in the year \n     2000 with deployment in 2005; and\n       Whereas, Flight 2000, a five-year program projected to cost \n     $400,000,000, will employ new technology, advanced \n     communications, navigation, surveillance, and air traffic \n     management capabilities to provide improved safety, security, \n     capacity, and efficiency at affordable costs and will involve \n     the integration of navigation satellites, digital \n     communications, weather processors, cockpit displays, and air \n     traffic control and flight planning tools; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii and Alaska, due to their geographic \n     isolation, fixed quantity of aircraft operating exclusively \n     in their respective areas, and relatively low cost of \n     equipage, have been initially selected as demonstration sites \n     that offer a controlled environment allowing a full scale \n     evaluation involving all classes of aviation operators and \n     all categories of airspace; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii's favorable weather, prominent topographic \n     features, and need for few ground stations for support, offer \n     the simplest, lowest risk, least costly, and safest \n     evaluation site ideally suited to test Flight 2000 for \n     intercity travel for improvement in services to pilots, to \n     evaluate safety benefits and navigation systems reliability; \n     and\n       Whereas, both sites are essential to evaluate different \n     aspects of Flight 2000's total system capabilities; and\n       Whereas, the Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center will \n     also be involved in Flight 2000 in evaluating oceanic \n     airspace operational improvements between Hawaii and the \n     transition to domestic airspace; and\n       Whereas, as a test site, the Federal Aviation \n     Administration will fund the upgrade of Hawaii's air traffic \n     management infrastructure and the test aircraft equipment to \n     provide the necessary communications, navigation, and \n     surveillance equipment including the purchase, installation, \n     and repair of aircraft avionics and multi-functional display \n     equipment; and\n       Whereas, the Flight 2000 plan has been delayed by one year \n     because federal funding did not materialize for fiscal year \n     1998 and there are indications that budget constraints may \n     necessitate reducing the cost of Flight 2000 and placing the \n     project back to its projected schedule by diminishing \n     Hawaii's role as a test site and to conduct the evaluation \n     exclusively in Alaska and in Oakland; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii has a key role in Flight 2000 in \n     accelerating the operational deployment of technology to the \n     rest of the nation and the world, toward increased flight \n     safety and efficiency into the twenty-first century; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii and its citizens virtually depend on air \n     transportation for the State's economic well-being, and \n     Hawaii needs modern and efficient aviation systems to \n     progress and develop its full resource potential; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Nineteenth \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1998, \n     the Senate concurring, that the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation and the U.S. House Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure promote actions to ensure \n     that Hawaii remains a test site in the Flight 2000 \n     demonstration project; and\n       Be it further resolved, That Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation is strongly urged to assist the Federal Aviation \n     Administration and the Senate and House committees in their \n     efforts to promote Hawaii as a test site; and\n       Be it further resolved, That certified copies of this \n     concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation, the U.S. House Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure and Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-465.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 98-1039\n\n       Whereas, In 1997, the United States Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) initiated in Colorado a wilderness \n     reinventory of public lands beginning in western Colorado and \n     including lands in Moffat, Mesa, Rio Blanco, Garfield, \n     Montrose, Eagle, Delta, Fremont, Teller, El Paso, Chaffee, \n     Montezuma, Hinsdale, Pitkin, San Miguel, Dolores, Conejos, \n     and Gunnison counties; and\n       Whereas, To date, six areas in western Colorado have been \n     reinventoried by the BLM for roadless or wilderness \n     designation potential and are being managed to protect the \n     potential, but not necessarily identified, wilderness values \n     as the review process proceeds; and\n       Whereas, By managing lands as de facto wilderness areas, \n     the BLM has determined to hold oil and gas leasing in \n     abeyance and to limit other discretionary multiple uses on \n     such lands until Congress determines whether the areas \n     qualify for wilderness designation under the federal \n     ``Wilderness Act''; and\n       Whereas, Numerous questions have been raised regarding the \n     BLM's authority to reinventory these lands for wilderness \n     designation, and what, if any, meaningful public review has \n     or will occur; and\n       Whereas, All Colorado BLM lands were reviewed under the \n     initial wilderness study process as directed under the \n     wilderness provisions of Section 603 of the federal ``Land \n     Policy Management Act'' (FLPMA) and officially completed in \n     November 1980, and after numerous opportunities for public \n     input and comment, including public hearings, over 800,000 \n     acres were designated Wilderness Study Areas, only then to be \n     managed as wilderness under the interim wilderness management \n     guidelines, with 400,000 acres subsequently recommended to \n     the President for designation as wilderness; and\n       Whereas, Under Section 603 of FLPMA, the BLM completed the \n     wilderness study and made its recommendations to the \n     President in 1991 and the President submitted his \n     recommendations for wilderness to Congress in 1993; and\n       Whereas, The lands currently selected for wilderness \n     reinventory in 1997 were rejected by the BLM in the 1980's as \n     not meeting wilderness criteria; and\n       Whereas, The BLM appears to be reinterpreting its roadless \n     criteria in order to increase the amount of land eligible for \n     consideration for wilderness designation by reevaluating \n     approximately one million acres of land even though such land \n     did not previously meet wilderness criteria and no \n     significant new information has been presented to the BLM on \n     these land issues; and\n       Whereas, The BLM is continuing to reinventory such lands \n     prematurely before Congress has acted on the President's \n     recommendations; and\n       Whereas, The BLM is holding in abeyance multiple use \n     activities on lands included as part of the reinventory \n     resulting in detrimental economic impacts to the citizens of \n     Colorado; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-first \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       That we, the members of the Colorado General Assembly, \n     hereby request:\n       (1) That BLM lands continue to be managed to allow for \n     multiple uses in accordance with existing resource management \n     plans until such time as plan amendments have been lawfully \n     adopted; and\n       (2) That the United States Congress place a moratorium on \n     any further funding to the BLM for the purpose of carrying \n     out such roadless or wilderness reinventories until Congress \n     acts on the President's 1993 recommendations.\n       Be it further resolved.

and\n       Whereas ISTEA gave more flexibility to state and local \n     governments to apply innovative solutions to the \n     transportation problems that they face; and\n       Whereas ISTEA has shifted the focus of the federal surface \n     transportation program toward preservation of highway and \n     transit systems, increased efficiency of existing \n     transportation networks, and integration of transportation \n     modes to enhance efficiency of the transportation system; and\n       Whereas the states and regional and local governments have \n     invested time and energy in making ISTEA work and this \n     investment should not be lost by significantly altering the \n     programs initiated by ISTEA; and\n       Whereas the ISTEA programs can be strengthened by allowing \n     greater flexibility between programs and within programs, by \n     allowing greater flexibility to address maintenance needs, by \n     reducing time-consuming federal reviews, mandates, and \n     sanctions, and by allowing self-certification at the state \n     level; and\n       Whereas the Federal Highway Administration has adopted a \n     regulation requiring that a major investment study be \n     undertaken by metropolitan planning organizations whenever \n     the need for a major metropolitan transportation investment \n     is identified; and\n       Whereas the major investment study requirement overlaps and \n     duplicates planning and project development processes that \n     are already in place under requirements for long-range \n     planning and congestion management systems; and\n       Whereas Congress should retain the critical role of the \n     federal government to help fund highway, bridge, ferry, and \n     transit projects and to focus the national transportation \n     policy on mobility, connectivity, integrity, safety, and \n     economic competitiveness; and\n       Whereas the state of Alaska receives money under ISTEA for \n     construction and improvement of roads, highways, and the \n     marine highway system and for bridge replacement and \n     rehabilitation, state and metropolitan transportation \n     planning, transit programs, highway safety programs, and \n     enforcement of truck and bus safety requirements; and\n       Whereas the state also receives assistance under ISTEA for \n     transportation projects to alleviate air pollution in two \n     areas of the state where air quality does not meet national \n     ambient air quality standards; and\n       Whereas 4,300 miles, or about 32 percent of the total \n     mileage, of roads in the state are eligible for federal \n     assistance under ISTEA; and\n       Whereas the State of Alaska has relied heavily on federal \n     assistance to support construction and improvement of the \n     surface transportation system in the state; and\n       Whereas continued federal assistance is essential to the \n     establishment of the surface transportation system in the \n     state; and\n       Whereas the existing surface transportation system in \n     Alaska needs significant repair and maintenance in order to \n     remain a safe and efficient system; and\n       Whereas surface transportation in Alaska is subject to \n     extreme Arctic and sub-Arctic climate and soil conditions; \n     and\n       Whereas the State of Alaska cannot maintain or expand the \n     surface transportation system in Alaska without continued \n     federal assistance; and\n       Whereas the funding authorizations for federal assistance \n     and transportation programs under ISTEA expired September 30, \n     1997; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     requests the Congress to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) as soon as \n     possible; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     requests the Congress to authorize increased funding for \n     surface transportation projects under ISTEA, if possible, \n     but, in any case, to maintain the current levels of funding \n     available under ISTEA; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     requests the Congress to allow for a portion of the \n     enhancement set aside funds to be used to maintain or improve \n     pioneer access trails and historical roadways;

The \n     Federal Highway Administration rates 313 miles of Hawaii's \n     most important roads in either poor or mediocre condition and \n     judges 51 per cent of our bridges to be deficient; and\n       Whereas, the current level of federal funding for the \n     nation's highway system is inadequate to meet rehabilitation \n     needs, to protect the safety of the traveling public, to \n     begin solving congestion and rural access problems, to \n     conduct adequate transportation research, and to keep the \n     United States competitive in a global economy; and\n       Whereas, the federal highway program is financed by \n     dedicated user fees collected from motorists to improve the \n     highway system and deposited into the federal Highway Trust \n     Fund. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 transferred all federal \n     motor fuel taxes into the Highway Trust Fund but provided no \n     mechanism to ensure the funds are spent; and\n       Whereas, the 1998 congressional budget would constrain \n     federal highway spending well below the level of highway tax \n     receipts, allowing the Highway Trust Fund's cash balance to \n     grow from just over $22 billion today to more than $70 \n     billion by 2003; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii and other states will be prohibited from \n     obligating any federal highway funds after April 30, 1998, \n     unless Congress and the President enact new highway \n     legislation by that date; and\n       Whereas, without federal highway funds, many states will be \n     forced to delay life-saving safety improvements, congestion \n     relief projects, and other road and bridge improvements; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Nineteenth Legislature of the \n     State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1998, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the United States Congress \n     enact legislation reauthorizing the federal highway program \n     by May 1, 1998; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the reauthorization bill should fund the \n     federal highway program at the highest level that the user-\n     financed Highway Trust Fund will support; and be it further\n       Resolved That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-470.

That the Congress of the United States is \n     hereby memorialized to adopt legislation amending 4 U.S.C. \n     sec. 114 to include severance payments and termination \n     payments within the retirement income of a nonresidential \n     individual upon which states may not impose income tax.\n       Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial \n     be sent to the President of the United States Senate, to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     each member of Colorado's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-471. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan, to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n       Whereas, there is a proposal under discussion promoting a \n     new special tax on sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Media \n     reports indicate that environmental groups are advocating a \n     new federal excise tax on these popular vehicles as a means \n     of raising revenue for conservation purposes. The campaign is \n     centered on the need to preserve threatened natural \n     resources; and\n       Whereas, while the need for responsible actions on the \n     environment is inarguable, the link to new taxes on sport \n     utility vehicles is clearly invalid. Contrary to the belief \n     of some, sport utility vehicles are used for off-road driving \n     by only a very small percentage of owners. The image of all \n     of these vehicles damaging the environment through off-road \n     use is inaccurate. The proposed new tax is, instead, unfairly \n     targeted to penalize a certain segment of the market and take \n     advantage of the popularity of SUVs. In Michigan, people \n     using vehicles for off-road purposes already finance outdoors \n     recreation through a licensing program; and\n       Whereas, special purpose taxes that are not based on clear \n     logic and fairness serve to erode public confidence in \n     government. The idea of taxing a certain category of \n     vehicles--used almost entirely in the same manner as \n     automobiles of any size or description--based on \n     misconceptions and inaccuracies is wrong; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to refrain from imposing any special taxes \n     on sport utility vehicles; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-472.

These \n     provisions must be part of the core agreement and must be \n     subject to the same dispute settlement procedures available \n     to other covered issues; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to oppose \n     extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) \n     to other Latin American countries; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\n     States House of Representatives and members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-473.

Clinton pledged on October \n     22, 1997, ``That the United States not assume binding \n     obligations (in Kyoto) unless key developing nations \n     meaningfully participate in this effort''; and\n       Whereas, on July 25, 1997, the United States Senate adopted \n     Senate Resolution No. 98 by a vote of 95-0, expressing the \n     sense of the Senate that ``The United States should not be a \n     signatory to any protocol or other agreement regarding the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change . . .  which would \n     require the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, \n     and which would mandate new commitments to mitigate \n     greenhouse gas emissions for the developed country parties \n     unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates specific \n     scheduled legally binding commitments within the same \n     compliance period to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions for \n     developing country parties.''; and\n       Whereas, developing nations are exempt from greenhouse gas \n     emission limitation requirements in the FCCC, and refused in \n     the Kyoto negotiations to accept any new commitments for \n     greenhouse gas emission limitations through the Kyoto \n     Protocol; and\n       Whereas, emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon \n     dioxide are caused primarily by the combustion of oil, coal, \n     and natural gas fuels by industries, automobiles, homes, and \n     other use of energy; and\n       Whereas, the United States relies on carbon-based fossil \n     fuels for more than ninety percent of its total energy \n     supply; and\n       Whereas, achieving the emission reductions proposed by the \n     Kyoto Protocol would require an approximately thirty-eight \n     percent reduction in projected United States carbon emissions \n     during the period 2008 to 2012; and\n       Whereas, developing counties exempt from emission \n     limitations under the Kyoto Protocol are expected to increase \n     their rates of fossil fuel use over the next two decades, and \n     to surpass the United States and other industrialized \n     countries in total emissions of greenhouse gases; and\n       Whereas, studies prepared by the economic forecasting group \n     WEFA, Inc., estimate that legally binding requirements for \n     the reduction of United States greenhouse gases below 1990 \n     emission levels would result in the loss of more than 29,500 \n     Colorado jobs, with the unemployment rate approaching five \n     percent in 2010, while subjecting Colorado's citizens to \n     higher energy, housing, medical, and food costs that would \n     reduce Colorado tax revenue by $420 million; and\n       Whereas, the failure to provide for commitments by \n     developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol creates an unfair \n     competitive imbalance between industrial and developing \n     nations, potentially leading to the transfer of jobs and \n     industrial development from the United States to developing \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, increased emissions of greenhouse gases by \n     developing countries would offset any environmental benefits \n     associated with emissions reductions achieved by the United \n     States and by other industrial nations; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-first General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That we, the members of the General Assembly, strongly \n     urge the President of the United States not to sign the Kyoto \n     Protocol to the FCCC;\n       (2) That, if the President does sign the Kyoto Protocol, we \n     strongly urge the United States Senate not to ratify the \n     treaty; and\n       (3) That we request that no federal or state agency take \n     any action to initiate strategies\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n     to reduce greenhouse gases as required by the Kyoto Protocol \n     until it is revised to include specific scheduled commitments \n     for developing countries to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions \n     within the same compliance period required for developed \n     countries.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     Colorado's delegation in the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-476.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the temporary increase in unemployment tax; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n            legislation to repeal temporary unemployment tax\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to repeal \nthe ``temporary'' 0.2 percent Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) surtax.\n  The ``temporary'' surtax was enacted by Congress in 1976 to repay the \ngeneral fund of the Treasury for funds borrowed by the unemployment \ntrust fund. While the borrowings were repaid in 1987, Congress has \ncontinued to extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill.\n  Since 1987, Congress has used extension of the surtax to help pay for \ntax packages. In fact, the surtax was most recently extended to help \npay for the 1997 tax bill.\n  This is unfair to small business which has been told repeatedly that \nthe surtax was temporary and would be\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nrepealed when it was no longer needed to finance the unemployment tax \nsystem.\n  The reason for the FUTA surtax no longer exists. The economy is \nexperiencing the highest level of employment in decades, and all state \nunemployment funds have surpluses.\n  It is inappropriate for the government to continue to raise surplus \nunemployment taxes and use those surpluses for purposes totally \nunrelated to the unemployment tax system.\n  The FUTA surtax hits small businesses hardest because they are often \nlabor intensive. Any payroll tax is added directly to the employer's \npayroll costs, and payroll taxes must be paid whether the business has \na profit or loss.\n  Mr. President, prior to my election to the House of Representatives \nin 1990, I ran a small business. I am well aware of payroll taxes and \nthe burden that they can place on a business.\n  The unemployment surtax was in place when I ran my small business.\n  I suspect that my view of the surtax is similar to the view of most \nsmall business owners. It is one thing to have a surtax when \nunemployment is high. It is totally unjustified when unemployment is at \nthe lowest level in three decades.\n  What really upsets small business owners is the fact that the \ngovernment is breaking its commitment that the surtax would be \ntemporary. This is not the way the federal government should do \nbusiness.\n  Repeal of the 0.2 percent surtax will reduce the tax burden on \nemployers and workers by $6 billion over the next five years.\n  Lower payroll taxes mean higher wages for workers. While the employer \nappears to fully pay the unemployment surtax and other payroll taxes, \nthe economic evidence is strong that the cost of payroll taxes is \npassed on to workers in form of lower wages.\n  Consistent tax relief will help to ensure that our economy remains \nthe strongest and most competitive in the world. Low taxes reduce \nunemployment and help ensure that future surtaxes are unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord along with several charts showing the level of State \nUnemployment System Reserves from 1991-1997.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to provide \nfor research and development of assistance technology and universally \ndesigned technology, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n   ASSISTIVE AND UNIVERSALLY DESIGNED TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENT ACT FOR \n                     INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which will \nimprove assistive and universally designed technology research and \ndevelopment and increase access to this technology for all Americans \nwith disabilities.\n\n  Assistive and universally designed technology provides a disabled \nindividual the means to function better in the workplace or the home. \nAssistive and universally designed technology is technology that aids \nthe millions of Americans with physical or mental disabilities. For \nexample, assistive technology can mean a computer that can be used by \nan individual with Cerebral Palsy, a hearing aid for an aging \nindividual or enhanced voice recognition for someone with Multiple \nSclerosis, while universally designed technology can mean closed \ncaptioning for the deaf or for patrons in crowded restaurants and \naccessability ramps for individuals in wheelchairs or mothers with \nstrollers.\n  A year ago my office was approached by a small business owner and \nMissouri's United Cerebral Palsy asking for support for testing of a \nbreakthrough in Voice Recognition technology. During my search to find \nan appropriate place for funding for this voice recognition technology, \nmy staff and I became familiar with the overall government efforts in \nthis area.\n  There are many significant problems in the federal government's \nefforts in assistive technology research and development. My finding's \nwere validated by a recent report from the National Academy of \nSciences' Institute of Medicine, ``Enabling America: Assessing the Role \nof Rehabilitation Science and Engineering,'' which stressed that the \nfederal government's efforts in this area are lacking awareness, \nfunding, and coordination.\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n  My distinguished colleague in the House, Congresswoman Connie \nMorella, Chairwoman of the House Science's Subcommittee on Technology, \njoins me today in introducing the Assistive and Universally Designed \nTechnology Improvement Act for Individuals with Disabilities.\n  The Act provides federally supported incentives in all areas of \nassistive and universally designed technology, including need \nidentification, research and development, product evaluation, \ntechnology transfer, and commercialization. These incentives achieve \nthe goal of improving the quality, functional capability, distribution, \nand affordability of this essential technology.\n  This legislation does several things.\n  First, the bill includes an improved peer review process at the \nNational Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation (NIDRR) at \nthe Department of Education. This provision requires standing peer \nreview panels and clarifies the evaluation of applications for funding \nof assistive and universally designed technology. These improvements \nprovide more assistive and universally designed technology products to \nthe marketplace, increase small business involvement in research and \ndevelopment, and assure research and development efforts cover all \ndisability groups including persons with physical and mental \ndisabilities as well as the aging and rural technology users.\n  Second, the legislation augments technology transfer through \nimproving the role of the Interagency Committee on Disability Research \n(ICDR) by increasing its authority, accountability and ability to \ncoordinate. Provisions are included for increased usage of the Federal \nlabs to improve coordination with all Federal agencies involved in \nassistive and universally designed technology research and development \nand for providing public and private sector partnerships for assistive \nand universally designed technology research and development.\n\n  Third, to increase the market for assistive technology, the bill \nclarifies Title III of the Tech Act for the Microloan program. This \nmicroloan program assists disabled persons in obtaining assistive and \nuniversally designed technology.\n  Fourth, funds are authorized for the Interagency Committee on \nDisability Research to hire staff and for operating costs associated \nwith issuing surveys and reports. Additionally, $10 million in funds \nare authorized for the National Institute on Disability Research and \nRehabilitation to provide for assistive and universally designed \ntechnology research and development.\n  Finally, to increase access to assistive and universally designed \ntechnology, tax incentives are included to provide businesses a tax \ncredit for the development of assistive technology, to expand the \narchitectural and transportation barrier removal deduction to include \ncommunication barriers, and to expand the work opportunity credit to \ninclude expenses incurred in the acquisition of technology to \nfacilitate the employment of any individual with a disability.\n  These tax incentives and micro loans will assist individuals with \ndisabilities to obtain assistive and universally designed technology in \norder to improve their quality of life, to secure and maintain \nemployment, and to assist small businesses in complying with Americans \nwith Disabilities Act requirements, which in effect, results in \nlessened financial burdens on society.\n  As technology increasingly plays a role in the lives of all persons \nin the United States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of \ngovernment, in the fostering of communication, in the transforming of \nemployment, and in the provision of education, it also greatly impacts \nthe lives of the more than 50 million individuals with disabilities in \nthe United States.\n  An agenda, including support for universal design, represents the \nonly effective means for guaranteeing the benefits of technology to all \npersons in the United States, regardless of disability or age, in \naddition to assuring for United States industry the continued growth in \nmarkets that will warrant continued high levels of innovation and \nresearch.\n  This legislation has the support of many organizations, including: \nThe Missouri Assistive Technology Advisory Council, the United Cerebral \nPalsy Association, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive \nTechnology Society of North America, the National Easter Seal Society, \nand the Association of Tech Act Projects.\n  The bill also has broad bipartisan and bicameral support. My \ncolleagues, Senator Jeffords, Senator Harkin, Senator Grassley, and \nCongresswoman Connie Morella have been very helpful in my efforts to \nimprove the role of the federal government in assistive and universally \ndesigned technology.\n  Let me conclude by taking special note of the help of the National \nand Missouri United Cerebral Palsy, as well as the Missouri Assistive \nTechnology Project, the Federal Laboratory Consortium, and the numerous \nassistive and universally designed technology and disability community \nadvocate organizations, for their assistance in developing and \nadvocating this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, the amendment I \nsubmit today, and letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assistive and Universally \n     Designed Technology Improvement Act for Individuals with \n     Disabilities''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The area of assistive technology is greatly overlooked \n     by the Federal Government and the private sector. While \n     assistive technology's importance spans age and disability \n     classifications, assistive technology does not maintain the \n     recognition in the Federal Government necessary to provide \n     important assistance for research and development programs or \n     to individuals with disabilities. The private sector lacks \n     adequate incentives to produce assistive technology, and end-\n     users lack adequate resources to acquire assistive \n     technology.\n       (2) As technology has come to play an increasingly \n     important role in the lives of all persons in the United \n     States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of \n     government, in the fostering of communication, in the conduct \n     of commerce, in the transformation of employment, and in the \n     provision of education, technology's impact upon the lives of \n     the more than 50,000,000 individuals with disabilities in the \n     United States has been comparable to technology's impact upon \n     the remainder of our Nation's citizens. No development in \n     mainstream technology can be imagined that will not have \n     profound implications for individuals with disabilities.\n       (3) In a technological environment, the line of demarcation \n     between assistive and mainstream technology becomes ever more \n     difficult to draw, and the decisions made by the designers of \n     mainstream equipment and services will increasingly determine \n     whether and to what extent the equipment and services can be \n     accessed and used by individuals with disabilities.\n       (4) A commitment to assistive technology, while remaining \n     important, cannot alone ensure access to technology and \n     communications networks by individuals with disabilities. An \n     agenda, including support for universal design, represents \n     the only effective means for guaranteeing the benefits of \n     technology to all persons in the United States, regardless of \n     disability or age, and for assuring for United States \n     industry the continued growth in markets that will warrant \n     continued high levels of innovation and research.\n       (5) The Federal Government needs to make improvements to \n     peer review processes that affect assistive technology \n     research and development.\n       (6) There are insufficient links between federally funded \n     assistive technology research and development programs and \n     the private sector entities responsible for translating \n     research and development into significant new products in the \n     marketplace for end-users.\n       (7) The Federal Government does not provide assistive \n     technology that is universally designed and targets older and \n     rural assistive technology end-users.\n       (8) The Federal Government does not coordinate all Federal \n     assistive technology research and development.\n       (9) Small businesses, which provide many innovative ideas \n     for assistive technology and provide the vast majority of \n     research and development efforts that lead to viable \n     commercial assistive technology products, are not utilized in \n     Federal assistive technology research and development efforts \n     to the extent that small businesses may play a key role in \n     assistive technology research and development. In addition, \n     small businesses lack access to the resources of the Federal \n     laboratories and would benefit from partnerships with the \n     Federal laboratories.\n       (10) Many more individuals with disabilities could secure \n     and maintain employment and move from income supports to \n     competitive work if given the ability to purchase assistive \n     technology. Tax incentives for businesses to purchase \n     assistive technology for\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\n     their employees, and micro loans for individuals to purchase \n     assistive technology, help individuals with disabilities \n     improve their quality of life. Such incentives and loans lead \n     to more productive lives, while lessening the financial \n     burdens on society.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to safeguard the privacy of certain identification \nrecords and name checks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   firearms owner privacy act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Firearms Owner \nPrivacy Act of 1998. This bill is aimed at safeguarding the privacy of \nlaw-abiding citizens who choose to purchase firearms and therefore \nundergo the instant background check mandated by the Brady Act.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System (NICS) is scheduled to go online on November \n30, 1998. After that date, federally-licensed firearms dealers are \nrequired to contact NICS before they sell any handgun or long gun, so \nthat a records check can be performed to determine whether the \npurchaser is prohibited by law from receiving the firearm.\n  A unique identification number will be assigned by the NICS to each \nsearch request in order to identify the transaction. That number is to \nbe kept by the dealer. However, if the sale is approved--that is, if \nthe purchaser is not disqualified from purchasing the firearm--all \nother records pertaining to that sale are to be destroyed.\n  This only makes sense. The Brady Act was never aimed at generating \nrecords concerning legal firearms sales. It was promoted as a law \nenforcement tool--a tool to prevent illegal gun sales and prosecute \nconvicted felons or other disqualified persons who attempt to obtain \nfirearms illegally.\n  More important, Senators who participated in the debate on the Brady \nbill will remember the concerns that were raised about the federal \ngovernment retaining records of approved, legal transactions. Simply \nput, keeping those records is tantamount to registering firearms--\nsomething that is far from acceptable to most Americans, not to mention \nmost members of Congress and certainly to this Senator. The federal \ngovernment has no legitimate reason for keeping track of which \nAmericans own guns. On the contrary, history teaches us that gun \nregistration schemes have been used to pave the way for gun \nconfiscation. It is not unreasonable for citizens to be skeptical of \nthe government's self-restraint--indeed, that is why our Founders built \nchecks and balances into our system of government in the first place.\n  In fashioning the Brady Act, Congress did not rely on government \npromises not to compile information on law-abiding gun purchasers. \nInstead, the law expressly prohibits the federal government from using \nNICS to establish any system for registering firearms, firearm owners, \nor transactions involving firearms. It also prevents a de facto \nregistration system by specifically prohibiting the federal government \nfrom recording or keeping the records generated by the instant \nbackground check.\n  Again and again during debate on this measure, members of the House \nand Senate raised concerns about the privacy interests of law-abiding \ncitizens. Again and again, we were assured that these prohibitions \nwould prevent the Brady Act from establishing or promoting any kind of \ngun registration for law-abiding citizens. Clearly, one of the keys to \npassing the Brady bill was the absolute assurance that the privacy of \nlaw-abiding citizens would be respected, and records of their firearms \ntransactions would be destroyed.\n  It is worth noting that since enactment of the Brady law, the concern \nover its potential for promoting gun registration has continued to \nboil. Like many of our colleagues, I continue to hear from people in my \nstate and around the nation who do not believe this Administration--no \nfriend to law-abiding gun owners--can resist the opportunity to mis-use \nand abuse the records generated during these background checks.\n  Mr. President, the Administration just turned up the heat on those \nboiling fears. Now that we are within months of putting NICS on line, \nfederal agencies are beginning to release the details of how the system \nis expected to work. My telephones are beginning to ring as firearms \ndealers, gun collectors, and sportspeople have an opportunity to read \nthe fine print. Among the proposals that concern them the most is that \nthe agency operating NICS intends to keep records of approved firearms \ntransactions for eighteen months.\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\n  That's right. The federal government proposes to keep records of \nlegal, approved transactions for a year and a half.\n  The agency has explained that it needs to keep the records for \nauditing purposes, to make sure the system is working properly and not \nbeing abused. Mr. President, why in the world do they need a year and a \nhalf for that purpose? Furthermore, the longer these records sit \naround, the more potential there is for abuse. How can the agency \njustify allowing its own administrative convenience to outweigh the \nserious privacy and civil liberties concerns raised against retaining \nsuch records?\n  Let's not forget that under the current, interim system, records of \nan approved transaction are destroyed within twenty days. The NICS \nsystem is supposed to speed up the entire background check process so \nthat the average contact will take minutes. Even if additional time is \nrequired because of problems with the check, the transaction is allowed \nto go forward within a mere three days, if the dealer does not receive \na disapproval. The acceleration in every other part of the NICS system \nmakes this records retention proposal even more incredible.\n  I am wholly unconvinced that the agency has any legitimate purpose \nfor retaining the records of lawful purchases by qualified citizens as \nit has proposed. The bill I am introducing today, the Firearms Owner \nPrivacy Act of 1998, simply reinforces the decision that this Congress \noriginally made on this critical issue. It would require information \ngenerated by the system on approved, lawful purchases to be destroyed \nwithin twenty-four hours. An individual who knowingly retained or \ntransferred that information after that time would face criminal \npenalties of up to $250,000 or up to ten years' imprisonment.\n  My bill also deals with transactions that are disapproved because a \nwould-be purchaser is prohibited by federal or state law from receiving \na firearm. For those transactions, the bill would permit the agency to \nretain the records for five years. If a criminal prosecution has been \ncommenced against the purchaser, there would be no restriction at all \non the agency's retention of the records. These provisions are aimed at \ninsuring that if our law enforcement agencies intend to pursue a \ndisapproved sale, they have ample opportunity to do so. However, the \nusefulness of these records past five years is very questionable.\n  Mr. President, I believe my bill imposes reasonable, workable limits \nthat conform to Congressional intent. If someone knows a legitimate \nreason why the federal government should keep these records longer than \nmy bill allows, I am certainly willing to listen to their arguments. To \ndate, however, the explanations from the Administration have been \nunpersuasive at best.\n  Let me point out that a similar effort to limit the retention of \nthese records is underway in the other body, headed by Representative \nBob Barr. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to protect \nthe privacy and civil liberties of law-abiding citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Firearms Owner Privacy Act \nof 1998 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend sections 3345 through 3349 of title 5, \nUnited States Code (commonly referred to as the ``Vacancies Act'' to \nclarify statutory requirements relating to vacancies in and \nappointments to certain Federal offices, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  federal vacancies reform act of 1998\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and a bipartisan \ngroup of senators, I introduce today the Federal Vacancies Reform Act \nof 1998. This legislation is needed to preserve one of the Senate's \nmost important powers: the duty to advise and consent on presidential \nnominees.\n\n  The Framers of the Constitution established a procedure for the \nappointment of all government officers: they were to be nominated by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate, unless Congress decided that \nthe appointment of specified inferior officers was to be made by the \nPresident alone, the courts, or by department heads. The First \nCongress, however, recognized that vacancies would arise in executive \npositions, and enacted legislation providing for officials to \ntemporarily exercise the powers of an office even without Senate \nconfirmation. The law was adopted essentially in its current form in \n1868, and was last amended in 1988. As amended, the first assistant or \nanother Senate-confirmed individual can serve for 120 days after the \nvacancy, and, in addition, may serve beyond those 120 days if the \nPresident submits a nomination for that office to the Senate within \nthose 120 days.\n  Unfortunately, the Vacancies Act is honored more in the breach than \nin the observance. For the past 25 years, administrations of both \nparties have claimed that the Justice Department is exempt from the \nVacancies Act. And since the Reagan Administration, other departments, \nat the behest of the Justice Department, make the same argument, \npurportedly based on the authority of the heads of each of the \nexecutive departments to delegate their authority to other department \npersonnel. Following this argument to its logical end, none of the \ndepartments is bound by the Vacancies Act, so that the act is a dead \nletter.\n  Certainly, this Administration has conducted itself as if the \nVacancies Act applies to none of the departments. Each department has \nat least one temporary officer who has served more\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\nthan 120 days before any nomination was sent to the Senate. Of the 320 \nexecutive department advise and consent positions, 64 are held by \ntemporary officials. Of the 64, 43 have served longer than 120 days \nbefore any nomination was submitted to the Congress. The Commerce \nDepartment is the worst offender in number and in degree. For instance, \nthe acting head of the Census Bureau is neither the first assistant nor \na person who has been confirmed by the Senate, a mind-boggling \nviolation of the law. Nor has a nomination been made, although the \nprior Census chief announced her departure more than five months ago.\n  The government's important functions should be carried out by \npermanent officials. That means that the President must submit \nnominations and the Senate needs to provide its advice and consent. \nThis administration seems not to want to subject its appointees to such \nscrutiny. Acting on that desire is unconstitutional and a violation of \nthe Vacancies Act as well. The Appointments Clause is not a technical \nnicety. As the Supreme Court has stated, the Appointments Clause is \ndesigned to keep the Executive and Legislative Branches within their \nappropriate spheres, so as to better preserve individual liberty.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee recently held an oversight hearing \non the Vacancies Act. In that hearing, it became apparent that the \nAdministration was regularly acting in violation of the law, but faced \nno consequence for its actions. The Committee also heard testimony from \nSenators Byrd and Thurmond, who had each introduced bills designed to \nensure compliance with the Vacancies Act through clarifying the scope \nof agencies covered and providing an enforcement mechanism. Our \ncolleagues owe a debt of gratitude to Senators Byrd and Thurmond for \nraising these important issues and offering solutions to address them.\n  I have found the approaches in the Byrd and Thurmond bills to have \ncontributed importantly to the drafting of the legislation I introduce \ntoday. It is extremely important to ensure that the Vacancy Act period \nrun from the date of the vacancy, to clarify that it covers all \ndepartments, and to impose a sanction for noncompliance. Subsequent to \nthe introduction of the Byrd and Thurmond bills, the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision \non the meaning of the Vacancies Act, approving the four year service of \nan acting head of the Office of Thrift Supervision as appointed by the \ndeparting head of the agency. Overruling several portions of that \ndecision have become a priority.\n  The legislation I introduce today provides that in the event of a \nvacancy in a position in an executive agency requiring the advice and \nconsent of the Senate, the officer's first assistant is allowed to \nperform the functions and duties of the office on an acting basis, for \nup to 150 days. Under current law, the period is 120 days, but the \nvicissitudes of the modern vetting process appear to require that the \ntime be lengthened, to my regret. Alternatively, the President may \ndirect another person who has already received Senate confirmation to \nserve as the acting official for 150 days. To prevent these \nrestrictions from being gamed, the bill provides that the acting \nofficer must have been the first assistant for 180 of the 365 days \npreceding the vacancy.\n  The length of temporary service can be extended beyond the 150 days \nif the President submits a nomination to the Senate for the vacant \nposition. If the nomination is withdrawn, or if the Senate rejects or \nreturns it, the acting official can serve only for 150 days after that \nevent.\n  The bill makes clear that the Vacancies Act applies to all offices in \nexecutive agencies for which appointment is required to be made by the \nPresident by and with the advice and consent of the President. \nNonetheless, we do not write on a clean slate. There are a number of \nlaws already on the books that provide a process by which persons can \nserve as acting officers when particular offices are vacant. In most \ninstances, these officials can serve until a successor is confirmed, \nwithout regard to the Vacancies Act. The bill preserves those specific \nstatutes, but, to clearly reject the position of the Justice \nDepartment, it expressly repudiates the contention that a law \nauthorizing the head of a department to delegate or reassign duties \namong other officers is a statute that provides for the temporary \nfilling of a specific office. For the future, Congress will have to \nexpressly provide that it is superseding the Vacancies Act if it wishes \nto override the Vacancies Act as to the temporary filling of advise and \nconsent provisions.\n\n  The bill also establishes a second enforcement mechanism. If a \nnominee is not submitted to the Senate within 150 days of the vacancy, \nthen the office is vacant until a nominee is submitted. While the \nroutine functions of the office would be allowed to continue, those \nfunctions and duties that are specified to be performed by that \nofficial could only be performed by the head of the department. In \nfact, no specified duty of the officeholder that existed by regulation \nfor the 180 days preceding the vacancy could be diminished in an effort \nto avoid the bill's vacant office provisions. However, if the President \nsubmits a nomination at any point after the 150 days, the acting \nofficer would again be allowed to serve while the nomination was \npending in the Senate, until confirmation, or until 150 days after the \nrejection, withdrawal, or return of the nomination. Actions taken by \nany acting official in violation of these provisions would be of no \neffect, and no one would be permitted to ratify the actions of the \nacting official that were taken in violation of the vacant office \nprovisions.\n  Enforcement is further enhanced by requiring each executive agency to \nreport to the Comptroller General the existence of vacancies, the names \nof persons serving as acting officers and when such service began, the \nname of any nominee and when such nomination was submitted to the \nSenate, and the final disposition of the nomination. The Comptroller \nGeneral will then notify the Congress, the President, and the Office of \nPersonnel Management when the 150 day limitations have been reached.\n  Mr. President, the Framers established a system for appointing \nimportant officials in which the President and the Senate would each \nplay a role. Not only did the Framers wish to ensure that more than one \nperson's wisdom was brought to the appointment process, but that the \nPresident, in selecting nominees, would be aware that they would face \nscrutiny. When a vacancy occurs in such an office, it is important to \nestablish a process that permits the routine operation of the \ngovernment to continue, but that will not allow the evasion of the \nSenate's constitutional authority to advise and consent to nominations. \nI am pleased that a number of my colleagues are joining with me to \nformulate a structure that will achieve these ends. I look forward to \nthe Senate's passage of this legislation in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This legislation is essential to help \npreserve and strengthen the advice and consent role of the Senate as \nmandated in the Constitution.\n  One of the greatest fears of the Founders was the accumulation of too \nmuch power in one source, and the separation of powers among the three \nbranches of Government is one of the keys to the success of our great \ndemocratic government. An excellent example of the separation of powers \nis the requirement in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution that \nthe President receive the advice and consent of the Senate for the \nappointment of officers of the United States. As Chief Justice \nRehnquist wrote for the Supreme Court a few years ago, ``The Clause is \na bulwark against one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of \nanother branch.''\n  The Vacancies Act is central to the Appointments Clause because it \nplaces limits on the amount of time that the President can appoint \nsomeone to an advice and consent position in an acting capacity without \nsending a nomination to the Senate. However, for many years, the \nexecutive branch has failed to comply with the letter of the law. The \nVacancies Act has no method of enforcement, so the executive branch \njust ignores it. When confronted with the act, the Attorney General \nmakes very weak legal arrangements about its inapplicability. This is \nwhat the Attorney General did over one year ago when I raised the \nVacancies Act at an oversight hearing. At the time, almost all of the \ntop positions at the Justice Department were being filled in an acting \ncapacity. I exchanged letters with her about the Vacancies Act, and \ndetailed the fallacy in her argument. It was to no avail.\n  I became convinced that legislation to rewrite the vacancies law and \nprovide some remedy for violating it was the only way to get the \nexecutive branch to properly respect the advice and consent role of the \nSenate. Senator Lott and I introduced legislation earlier this year, \nand I testified about it before the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I detailed for the Committee some prominent examples of how the Act \nwas being ignored. President Clinton allowed the Criminal Division of \nthe Justice Department to languish for over two and one half years \nbefore making an appointment. The Government had an Acting Solicitor \nGeneral for an entire term of the Supreme Court. Most recently, the \nPresident installed an Acting Chief of the Civil Rights Division in \nblatant disregard of the Judiciary Committee's decision not to support \nhis controversial choice.\n  However, let me be clear. This bill is not about any one President or \nany one nominee. It is about preserving the institutional role of the \nSenate. A Republican President has no more right to ignore the \nappointments process than a Democrat President.\n  Today, Senator Thompson, Senator Byrd, Senator Lot, and I are \nintroducing a bipartisan bill to address the problem. It gives the \nPresident 150 days to send a nomination rather than the current 120 \ndays. If he does not comply, the office must remain vacant and the \nactions of any person acting in that office after that time are null \nand void, until a nominee is forwarded to the Senate. The bill also \nclarifies the application of the Vacancies Act to reject the Attorney \nGeneral's flawed interpretation.\n  Mr. President, we must act to preserve the advice and consent role of \nthe Senate. As the Supreme Court has stated, ``The structural interests \nprotected by the Appointments Clause are not those of any one branch of \nGovernment but of the entire Republic.'' Reforming the vacancies law is \nessential in this regard. Let us reaffirm the separation of powers for \nthe sake of the Senate and the entire Republic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 2177. A bill to express the sense of the Congress that the \nPresident should award a Presidential unit citation to the final crew \nof the U.S.S. Indianapolis, which was sunk on July 30, 1945; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n           presidential unit citation to the uss indianapolis\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Sense of \nthe Congress bill which calls upon the President to award a \nPresidential Unit Citation to the final crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis \n(CA-35) that recognizes the courage, fortitude, and heroism displayed \nby the crew in the face of tremendous hardship and adversity after \ntheir ship was torpedoed and sunk on July 30, 1945.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and D'Amato):\n  S. 2178. A bill to amend the National Housing Act to authorize the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to insure mortgages for the \nacquisition, construction, or substantial rehabilitation of child care \nand development facilities and to establish the Children's Development \nCommission to certify such facilities for such insurance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 Children's Development Commission Act\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Children's \nDevelopment Commission Act. I am pleased to be joined in this by my \nfriend, Senator D'Amato. He brings to this endeavor a deep \nunderstanding of the nation's capital markets and a deep concern for \nthe well being of this country's children. In the House of \nRepresentatives, Representatives Maloney and Baker have already \nintroduced a companion measure, H.R. 3637.\n  Our legislation is designed to address the credit market's failure to \nprovide sufficient long term financing for the building and renovation \nof child care centers, after-school care programs, infant care, and \nfamily child care homes. Because the profit margin in such centers is \nvery low, and the perceived risk is great, lenders are often unwilling \nto lend to child care operations. This is true despite the fact that an \noverwhelming number of studies show a shortage in the supply of quality \nchild care--especially in urban areas, in low income areas, and for \ncertain types of care (infant care, school age care, off-hour care).\n  The Children's Development Commission Act creates a loan guarantee \nprogram through HUD to provide insurance to lenders willing to put up \nmoney for child care center mortgages, leases, or renovations. The \nprogram is modeled closely on the successful Section 232 HUD program \nthat provides mortgage insurance for elder-care facilities.\n  The bill also creates a ``Children's Development Commission'' or \n``Kiddie Mac'' which: (1) certifies child care development facilities \neligible for guaranteed financing; (2) establishes the standards \nnecessary to make such certification; (3) makes small purpose loans to \nchild care facilities for reconstruction and renovation; (4) develops a \nplan to offer low cost liability and fire insurance to child care \nproviders; and (5) creates a research foundation to support research \ninto child care supply issues, fund pilot programs for improving child \ncare, and publishes material for those interested in getting mortgage \ninsurance through HUD.\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\n  Congress will make one $10 million appropriation to fund the Kiddie \nMac's incorporation and its micro-loan program; after that, a stock \noffering will fund Kiddie Mac until its financial activities and fee \ncollection make it self-financing.\n  The need, and the will, to take this sort of step to increase the \nsupply of quality child care is evident. When I ran for Congress in \n1988, I talked about the importance of child care. At best, I received \na polite smile of interest, and then the discussion would move on to \nthe pressing issues of the day--the environment, the budget deficit, \nhealth care.\n  Today, child care is being discussed earnestly at dinner tables \nacross the nation and in Committee rooms all over the Capitol. Almost \neveryone has a personal story about trying to secure good child care, \nabout trying to help an employee find good child care, about the \nterrible shortage of quality child care in their town or city.\n  We have always talked about the necessities of life as being food, \nclothing and shelter. I think it is time we add a fourth--quality child \ncare. It is necessary to give our children the strong start they need. \nIt is necessary if we are going to take advantage of the tremendous \nability to learn in the first three years of life.\n  And quality child care is necessary in order for the growing number \nof families in which both parents work, for the growing number of \nsingle parent families to be able to earn a living, and for businesses \nthat want to attract and retain productive, happy employees.\n  Unfortunately, by every measure and in every state, quality child \ncare is in short supply. And in most areas of the country, the sweeping \nwelfare reform we passed last year has exacerbated existing shortages. \nIn my State of Wisconsin, the State's welfare reform plan will generate \nthe need for 8000 new child care slots in Milwaukee Country alone. And \nin New York City, by the year 2001, there will be 30,000 more children \nwho need child care than there are child care spaces for them.\n  The shortage is not just one of child care slots, but of quality \nchild care slots. One major study showed that seven out of ten child \ncare centers provide mediocre care, while one in eight is so inadequate \nthat the health and safety of the children are threatened. Another \nsurvey found that more than half of parents with children in child care \nworry weekly about whether their children are well-served in their \ncurrent arrangements.\n  Kiddie Mac will help address these shortfalls in several ways. It \nwill lower the costs of those setting up child care facilities, home \nchild care, or pre-schools. By guaranteeing child care facility \nmortgages and leases, Kiddie Mac lowers the start-up costs to \nfacilities allowing them to pass the savings on to teachers in the form \nof higher salaries and parents in the form of lower fees. Kiddie Mac \nwill also provide loan guarantees to facilities that want to upgrade \nand providing micro-loans for small repairs related to licensing. This \nwill allow existing centers and homes, even very small ones, to bring \ntheir facilities up to--and beyond--code.\n  Kiddie Mac is a market-based, small-government approach to moving \ncapital toward a very wise investment in quality child care. Kiddie \nMac's services will be available to any organization who can show they \nwill provide quality child care: businesses, non-profits, churches or \nsynagogues, family home providers, or after-school programs. Decisions \nas to how much and how the care will be provided are left where they \nbelong: with the local providers, with local communities, and with the \nparents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nChildren's Development Act be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Development \n     Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The need for quality nursery schools, both full-time \n     and part-time child care centers and after-school programs, \n     after school programs, neighborhood-run mothers-day-out \n     programs, and family child care providers has grown among \n     working parents, and parents who stay at home, who want their \n     children to have access to early childhood education.\n       (2) All parents should have access to safe, stimulating, \n     and educational early childhood education programs for their \n     children, whether such programs are carried out in a child \n     care center, a part-time nursery school (including a nursery \n     school operated by a religious organization), or a certified \n     child care provider's home.\n       (3) The number of available enrollment opportunities for \n     children to receive quality child care services is not \n     meeting the demand for such services.\n       (4) In 1995 there were about 21,000,000 children less than \n     6 years of age, of whom 31 percent were participating in \n     center-based child care services and 14 percent were \n     receiving child care in homes. Between 1992 and 2005 the \n     participation of women 24 to 54 years of age in the labor \n     force is projected to increase from 75 percent to 83 percent.\n       (5) In States that have set up a mechanism to provide \n     capital improvements for child care facilities, the demand \n     for services of such facilities still has not been met.\n       (6) The United States is behind other western, \n     industrialized countries when it comes to providing child \n     care services. In France, almost 100 percent of all children \n     3 to 5 years of age attend nursery school. In Germany this \n     number is 65 to 70 percent. In Japan 90 percent of such \n     children attend some form of preschool care. In all of these \n     countries early childhood care has proven to increase \n     children's development and performance.\n\n     SEC. 3. INSURANCE FOR MORTGAGES ON NEW AND REHABILITATED \n                   CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES.\n\n       Title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1707 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\n     ``mortgage insurance for child care and development facilities\n\n       ``Sec. 257.

Mr. President, today I cosponsor the Children's \nDevelopment Commission Act of 1998. I commend my friend and respected \ncolleague, Senator Herb Kohl for introducing this critical piece of \nlegislation which addresses a serious problem facing American families \ntoday--the shortage of affordable, quality child care.\n  America is facing a shortage of quality child care which is \napproaching crisis levels. This shortage bears most heavily on working \nfamilies, including young working single mothers. Every day more than 5 \nmillion children under age 13 are left unattended after school. The \nparents of these children deserve meaningful, affordable child care \noptions.\n  The high cost of child care impacts directly on families, affecting \ntheir ability to pay the rent or mortgage, to put food on the table or \nto save for their children's education. The lack of decent, high \nquality child care also impedes the development of critical learning \nskills these children will need in order to succeed later in life. \nSocial and medical research continues to stress the importance of the \nfirst three years of development on a child's well-being and ability to \nlearn.\n  In New York, the average cost of day care is over $6,000 per year--\nand many families end up paying nearly $10,000 per year. Many families \nare unable to locate quality child care at all, as evidenced by the \nlong waiting lists at existing centers. In New York City, approximately \n28,000 families are on waiting lists for assistance under the Child \nCare Development Block Grant Program.\n  Mr. President, as more families make the difficult transition from \nwelfare to work, waiting lists for affordable care and assistance will \nlikely increase significantly. As a result of welfare reform, by the \nyear 2002, there may be as many as 135,000 additional infants and \ntoddlers in New York who will need affordable quality child care.\n  These high costs and the overall shortage of quality care are found \nin all areas of my home State--cutting across urban and rural \nboundaries. The New York Human Services Administration estimates that \nmore than two-thirds of children in the Morrisania section of the Bronx \nand more than seventy percent of children in the Brownsville section of \nBrooklyn are in need of child care.\n  This shortage extends to rural areas of New York as well--for \nexample, in Allegany, Hamilton, Washington and Yates counties there are \nno registered programs for school age children. Twenty of my State's \nsixty two counties have three or fewer registered school-age programs.\n  The Child Care Development Commission Act will employ a number of \ncost-effective strategies to increase the availability and \naffordability of child care throughout the nation.\n  First, the legislation would reduce lender risk by creating a new \ninsurance authority within the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Using this new \nauthority, FHA will provide loan guarantees for child care facilities. \nThis will in turn spur the provision of private capital for the \nconstruction of new child care centers, the improvement of existing \nfacilities and the cost of purchasing and installing fire safety \nequipment.\n  Second, the Act will create a new streamlined Commission--known \ninformally as ``Kiddie Mac.'' The Commission will provide reasonable \nlow-cost ``micro-loans'' for the renovation and improvement of existing \nfacilities. In addition, the Commission will certify that facilities \nreceiving FHA insurance meet state and local standards, such as \nlicensing and child safety requirements.\n  Mr. President, The Children's Development Commission Act is an \nimportant step in ensuring that child care facilities can gain access \nto private market credit. Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Richard \nBaker have introduced companion legislation (H.R. 3637) in the House of \nRepresentatives. They deserve our praise for their diligence in \naddressing this issue.\n  The Children's Development Commission Act makes an investment in our \nchildren, an investment in our families and an investment in our \nfuture. I look forward to working with my Senate and House colleagues \nfor its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN:\n  S. 2179. A bill to amend the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct to clarify the conditions under which export controls may be \nimposed on agricultural products; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         SELECTIVE AGRICULTURE EMBARGO PROHIBITION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, in January 1980, President Jimmy \nCarter terminated U.S. shipments of wheat and corn to the Soviet Union \nin retaliation against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The effect \nof this embargo on the USSR was limited, but the impact on American \nfarmers was severe, cutting off the market for 17 million tons of U.S. \ngrain and prompting the Soviets to reduce long term reliance on U.S. \nfarm exports.\n  This action unfairly singled out the agriculture community to \nshoulder the burden of U.S. foreign policy. Congress quickly responded \nby limiting the President's power to impose restrictions on agriculture \nexports. The Export Administration Act, the principal export control \nstatute of the era, was amended to include provisions to prohibit the \nPresident from imposing export controls on farm commodities for more \nthan sixty days without Congressional approval.\n  The Export Administration Act expired August 20, 1994, however, and \nconsequently, the legal protections that prevent the singling out of \nagriculture exports are no longer in place.\n  The current statutory vehicle that allows the President to impose \neconomic sanctions is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, \nalso known by its acronym, IEEPA. The IEEPA allows the President to \nemploy a wide range of sanctions against countries determined to be a \nthreat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, or economy. If the \nPresident chooses to act under IEEPA, he can then declare a national \nemergency, and then is required to report to Congress explaining his \nactions. Sanctions authorized under IEEPA can continue until the \nPresident decides to terminate the emergency, or unless Congress acts \nto terminate it by joint resolution.\n  The President enjoys almost unlimited authority under IEEPA. The \nstatute requires the President to consult with Congress on his actions, \nbut this consultation is discretionary, not mandatory. Most \nimportantly, nothing in IEEPA prevents a President from targeting \nAmerican agriculture as a tool for sanctions or embargos against a \nforeign nation.\n  My bill, the Selective Agriculture Embargo Prohibition Act, simply \nrestores the protection against selective embargos that farmers enjoyed \nbefore the EAA was allowed to lapse. Under the provisions of my bill, a \nPresident who imposes an embargo on agriculture commodities, using the \nauthority provided by IEEPA, must report this action immediately to \nCongress. The President also must set forth the reasons, in detail, for \nthis action, and specify the period of time, which may not exceed one \nyear, that the agriculture export controls are proposed to be in \neffect.\n  My bill allows Congress 60 days after receiving the report to adopt a \njoint resolution approving the agriculture exports controls. If \nCongress fails to adopt that resolution within 60 days, then the \ncontrols shall cease to be effective upon the expiration of the 60 \ndays.\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\n  Entering and expanding into foreign markets is not a simple task. It \nrequires years of extensive work to nurture business relationships, \nfoster consumer confidence and trust, and establish the procedures for \neffective sales. Destroying foreign markets, by comparison, can occur \nswiftly and easily, wreaking long-lasting and largely irreparable \ndamage on American industries that have invested the time and money to \nbuild a strong consumer base overseas. Those foreign purchasers who \ncannot rely on American imports will then turn to other sources--our \nforeign competitors--and shut out American products for good.\n  That kind of damage was precisely the effect of the 1980 embargo on \nU.S. agriculture. And given the almost logarithmic increases in U.S. \nfarm exports over the past decade, any sanction or embargo that targets \nagriculture today would have even greater devastating and permanent \neffects on the U.S. farm economy. We must ensure that this sort of \nmistake is never repeated.\n  There will be critics who argue that my legislation ties the hands of \nthe President. This is not the case. My bill simply ensures that we do \nnot embargo agriculture commodities unless both the President and the \nCongress are in full agreement. My bill ensures that adequate \nsafeguards are in place so that farm families do not unfairly shoulder \nthe burden of American foreign policy.\n  This legislation is very similar to the restrictions enacted three \ntimes by Congress during consideration of the Export Enhancement Act \nand later signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. This is a \nbipartisan bill is also good trade policy, good farm policy, and good \neconomic policy. I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of \nthis bill in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Selective Agriculture \n     Embargo Prohibition Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT CONTROLS.\n\n       The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 208 as section 209; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 207 the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 208.

A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to clarify liability under that \nAct for certain recycling transactions; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n               the superfund recycling equity act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenate Minority Leader Daschle, in introducing legislation which \nremoves an unintended yet troublesome legal obstacle to recycling.\n  It is not a widely known fact that Superfund is biased against \nrecycling. I am confident that the authors of the statute did not \nintend to favor new materials over those that have been recycled, but \nwe now live with this unintended consequence.\n  Mr. President, our bill corrects current law and encourages \nrecycling. It simply recognizes that recycling is not disposal and that \nrecyclables are not wastes. Common sense tells us that recycling \nsomething is not the same as disposing of it.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, those who sell materials for recycling \nare being pulled into Superfund cleanups because, under the law, \nselling recyclable materials is equivalent to ``arranging for \ndisposal.'' Our bill waives Superfund liability for those who are \nlegitimately recycling these goods. Clearly, recycling is not \ndisposal--it is the opposite.\n  The Superfund Recycling Equity Act is necessary to correct \nSuperfund's fundamental bias against recycled materials. Under current \nlaw, recyclable materials, such as paper, glass, plastic, metals and \ntextiles cannot be competitive with new materials. This bill will help \nlevel the playing field between the use of recycled goods and \ncompetitive virgin raw materials. Currently, suppliers of virgin raw \nmaterials face no Superfund liability for contamination caused by their \ncustomer. This bill would provide the same waiver to those who sell \nrecyclable materials.\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill also contains protections to ensure that \nsham recyclers are unable to benefit from this exemption. In order for \nrecyclers to be relieved of Superfund liability, they must act in an \nenvironmentally sound manner and sell their product to manufacturers \nwith environmentally responsible business practices. Considering that \nmost recyclers are currently operating in a reasonable and conscience \nmanner, this should be an easy test.\n  Mr. President, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act is the product of \nlengthy negotiations between the federal and state governments, the \nenvironmental community and the scrap recycling industry. These \nnegotiations have resulted in a bill that I believe to be both \nenvironmentally and fiscally sound.\n  Americans nationwide have embraced the benefits of recycling. We know \nthat increased recycling means the more efficient use of our natural \nresources. By removing the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, \nwe will encourage more recycling.\n  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will lend their \nsupport to this targeted and much-needed reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Superfund Recycling Equity \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the reuse and recycling of scrap material in \n     furtherance of the goals of waste minimization and natural \n     resource conservation while protecting human health and the \n     environment;\n       (2) to create greater equity in the statutory treatment of \n     recycled versus virgin materials; and\n       (3) to remove the disincentives and impediments to \n     recycling created as an unintended consequence of the 1980 \n     Superfund liability provisions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

There is broad agreement that more should \nbe done to establish a climate in which businesses are encouraged to \nrecycle scrap materials in an environmentally sound manner. We should \nmake every effort to expand the responsible and beneficial use and \nreuse of this waste as soon as possible.\n  While I remain hopeful that bipartisan negotiators will be able to \nwork out differences on broad-based Superfund reform, it appears \nunlikely that Congress will achieve that goal this year. That is \nparticularly unfortunate, because there are many elements of Superfund \nreform for which there is agreement and for which we should move \nforward as expeditiously as possible, including establishing greater \nincentives for brownfields redevelopment, and providing liability \nrelief to deserving municipalities and small businesses.\n  There are a number of important Superfund issues on which there \ncontinues to be significant disagreement. Despite the fact that \nresolution of these issues is unlikely in the near-term, we should not \nallow ourselves to adjourn this year without making a strong effort to \nenact those reforms on which there is broad agreement.\n  Therefore, I am very pleased that Senator Lott has taken the \ninitiative to move forward with this important element of Superfund \nreform. With enactment of this legislation, we will foster additional \nscrap recycling in America, thereby reducing the stream of waste \nmaterials now sent to landfills and other solid waste management \nfacilities. By doing so, we will help to eliminate the fears of many \nbusinesses of potential Superfund liabilities even if they pursue \nlegitimate means to recycle scrap materials. By clarifying the \nliability rules for recycling transactions under Superfund, this \nlegislation will place recyclers on a more even playing field compared \nwith those who produce goods using virgin materials.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this timely \nlegislation with Senator Lott. This is an important step in providing \nmeaningful reform and clarification to the Superfund law and I \nencourage all my colleagues to support this effort to promote scrap \nrecycling as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6405-3", "month": "06", "year":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     systematically controls the flow of information to the \n     Chinese people.\n       (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power \n     is a higher priority than economic development by announcing \n     in January 1996 that its official news agency Xinhua, will \n     supervise wire services selling economic information, \n     including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters \n     Business, and in announcing in February of 1996 the ``Interim \n     Internet Management Rules'', which have the effect of \n     censoring computer networks.\n       (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all \n     organizations that engage in business activities related to \n     international computer networking must now apply for a \n     license, increasing still further government control over \n     access to the Internet.\n       (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a \n     surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China, \n     provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the \n     Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of \n     in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news \n     about the United States and its policies.\n       (5) Radio Free Asia currently broadcasts only 5 hours a day \n     in the Mandarin dialect and 2 hours a day in Tibetan.\n       (6) Voice of America currently broadcasts only 10 hours a \n     day in Mandarin and 3 \\1/2\\ hours a day in Tibetan.\n       (7) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America should develop 24-\n     hour-a-day service in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tibetan, as \n     well as further broadcasting capability in the dialects \n     spoken in the People's Republic of China.\n       (8) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward \n     continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China \n     in multiple languages, have the capability to immediately \n     establish 24-hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation \n     by staggering the hours of Radio Free Asia and Voice of \n     America.\n       (9) Simultaneous broadcasting on Voice of America radio and \n     Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also \n     important and needed capabilities.\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words on the \nsubject of telemarketing fraud. In particular, I will discuss the \nseverity of telemarketing fraud, the House and Senate telemarketing \nfraud bills, and the United States Sentencing Commission's recently \nproposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines.\n  At the outset, I would like to commend Representative Goodlatte for \nhis sponsorship of H.R. 1847 and for his leadership in combating \ntelemarketing fraud.\n\n\n                Telemarketing Fraud is a Serious Problem\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to describe the \nseverity of the problem of telemarketing fraud. According to Maryland \nAttorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr., telemarketing fraud is probably \nthe fastest growing illegal activity in this country. Senior citizens \nappear to be the most vulnerable to chicanery of this kind. Fred \nSchulte, an investigating editor for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel \nand an expert on telemarketing fraud, has pointed out that senior \ncitizens are often too polite or too lonely not to listen to the voice \non the other end of the line. As one telemarketing con man who has \nworked all over the country put it: ``People are so lonely, so tired of \nlife, they can't wait for the phone to ring. It's worth the $300 to \n$400 to them to think that they got a friend. That's what you play \non.''\n  These criminals prey on the vulnerable of our society. In one case, \nNevada authorities arrested a Las Vegas telemarketer on a charge of \nattempted theft. The telemarketer was accused of trying to persuade a \n92-year-old Kansas man who had been fraudulently declared the winner of \n$100,000 to send $1,900 by Western Union in advance to\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\ncollect his prize. Another example: a Maine company showed real \ntelemarketing creativity. For $250, the so-called Consumer Advocate \nGroup offered to help consumers recover money lost to fraudulent \ntelemarketers--but it provided no services, according to Wisconsin \nAttorney General James Doyle, who sued the Maine firm plus four other \ntelemarketers.\n  In 1996, more than 400 individuals were arrested by law-enforcement \nofficials working on Operation Senior Sentinel. Retired law-enforcement \nofficers and volunteers, recruited by AARP, went undercover to record \nsales pitches from dishonest telemarketers. Volunteers from the 2-year-\nlong Operation Senior Sentinel discovered various telemarketing \nschemes. Some people were victimized by phony charities or investment \nschemes. Others were taken in by so-called premium promotions in which \npeople were guaranteed one of four or five valuable prizes but were \ninduced to buy an overpriced product in exchange for a cheap prize. One \nof the most vicious scams preyed on those who had already lost money. \nSome telemarketers charged a substantial fee to recover money for those \nwho had been victimized previously--and proceeded to renege on the \npromised assistance. By the time the dust settled, it took the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, the FTC, a dozen U.S. attorneys and state \nattorneys general, the Postal Service, the IRS, and the Secret Service \nto arrest over 400 telemarketers in five states, including my home \nstate of Arizona.\n\n  Clearly telemarketing fraud is on the rise. It is estimated that \neight out of ten households are targets for telemarketing scams that \nbilk us of up to $40 billion annually. There are many seniors in my \nstate and across the country who must be protected against this type of \nfraudulent activity. According to Attorney General Reno, it is not \nuncommon for senior citizens to receive as many as five or more high-\npressure phone calls a day. Mr. President, malicious criminal activity \nlike this must be punished appropriately.\n\n\n                   The House- and Senate-Passed Bills\n\n  The House and the Senate have passed bills which direct the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to increase penalties for those who purposefully \ndefraud vulnerable members of our society. The House bill, which passed \nby a voice vote, increases sentences by four levels for general \ntelemarketing fraud, and by eight levels if the telemarketing fraud \neither victimized ten or more persons over age 55 or targeted persons \nover age 55.\n  The Senate-passed bill, which was approved unanimously, requires the \nSentencing Commission to ``provide for substantially increased \npenalties'' for those convicted of telemarketing fraud offenses. I \nrepeat: ``substantially increased penalties.'' This language was \ncarefully chosen; a two level increase is not substantial. The Senate-\npassed bill also requires the Commission to ``provide an additional \nappropriate sentencing enhancement if the offense involved \nsophisticated means, including but not limited to sophisticated \nconcealment efforts, such as perpetrating the offense from outside the \nUnited States.'' Further, the Senate-passed bill requires the \nCommission to provide an additional appropriate sentencing enhancement \nfor cases in which a large number of vulnerable victims . . . are \naffected by a fraudulent scheme or schemes.'' These provisions were \ncarefully crafted to ensure that those perpetrating telemarketing scams \nwould be severely punished.\n\n\n           The Sentencing Commission's Proposed Enhancements\n\n  The United States Sentencing Commission recently issued an amendment \nthat would increase by two offense levels--the smallest possible \nincrease--the penalties for fraud offenses that use mass-marketing to \ncarry out fraud. The amendment would also provide a two level \nenhancement in the fraud guideline if (i) the defendant relocated, or \nparticipated in relocating, a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction \nto evade law enforcement or regulatory officials; (ii) a substantial \npart of a fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United \nStates; or (iii) the offense otherwise involved sophisticated \nconcealment.\n  These proposed amendments are a step in the right direction, but the \nstep is too small. In addition to these enhancements, the Sentencing \nCommission should, as the Senate-passed bill says, substantially \nincrease the penalties for telemarketing fraud.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Telemarketing fraud is a serious problem. The Sentencing Guidelines \nshould reflect this but they do not. From the House- and Senate-passed \nbills, it should have been clear to the Sentencing Commission that \nCongress wanted significant increases in the guidelines, not the minor \nones included in the Commission's proposed amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6426-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS RETIRING PRESIDENT, BECKY CAIN\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I rise to today in honor of the tenth \nanniversary of the founding of Greenwich School Age Child Care in my \nhome state of Connecticut.\n  As you know, child care has been a top legislative priority for me \nduring my tenure in the Senate. After numerous hearings, debates, \nforums, and even passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n(CCDBG) Act that I authored in 1990, I know that our country's working \nfamilies continue to struggle with the issue of child care. Thousands \nof low-income children are\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\non waiting lists for affordable child care, and much of what is \navailable is of poor quality. Every day, parents face tough decisions \nabout how their children will be cared for when they can't be with \nthem.\n  Ten years ago, in response to the child care needs expressed by the \ncommunity, Greenwich School Age Child Care was created by a small, \ndedicated group of parents who understood the importance of safe, high \nquality child care services. At that time, there were no available \nservices for before- and after-school child care within the community's \nschools. Since that time, the effort has grown from one school-age \nchild care program in North Mianus Elementary School, to programs in \nall 10 public elementary schools. All of these programs accept children \nin grades kindergarten through fifth grade, in most instances offer \nboth before- and after-school programs, and are open for the entire \nschool year. This enables working parents to leave their child at 7:30 \na.m. and return up to 6:00 p.m., knowing that their child will receive \nhealthy snacks and loving care in a stimulating environment right in \nthe school.\n  I share the belief of Greenwich School Age Child Care that quality \nchild care should be available to all low income and disadvantaged \nfamilies who need it. Greenwich School Age Child Care is to be \ncommended for their innovative efforts to make available quality child \ncare affordable. The scholarship fund they established through the \nBoard of Education, private donations, and CCDBG dollars is critical \nfor low-income families who otherwise could not afford a safe and \neducational environment for their children.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Greenwich School Age Child Care \nadvisory board. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that their \ninvestment in quality child care pays off many times over, in terms of \nboth the employment productivity of parents and the safety and well-\nbeing of children. I congratulate Greenwich School Age Child Care on \nthe huge success of their first ten years, and wish them continued, \nlong lasting success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6427-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONSUMERS REAP THE BENEFITS OF OPEN COMPETITION\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the economist Milton Friedman \nonce wrote: `Underlying most arguments against a free market is a lack \nof belief in freedom itself.' Demonstrating its belief in freedom the \n104th Congress passed the pro-competition Telecommunications Act of \n1996. The Hudson Institute has recently released a study of the cable \nindustry since the new law has taken effect. The study has found what \nthose of us that believe in a free market have always known: consumers \nreap the benefits of open competition. I submit it for the Record a \ncopy of the executive summary for review. It is a pleasure to deliver \nfurther affirmation of the free market system.\n  The material follows:\n\n Executive Summary--The Role of Competition and Regulation in Today's \n                            Cable TV Market\n\n       In late 1997 and early 1998, concerns have been raised \n     among regulators, members of Congress, and consumer groups \n     regarding cable television rates. This study analyzes the \n     rationale for new efforts by the FCC to limit rates or impose \n     other regulations on the cable television industry in \n     response to such concerns. It examines the historical record \n     of cable regulation, takes a new look at the state of \n     competition for multichannel video programming, reviews the \n     important capital investment in new digital services by the \n     industry, and assesses the possible impact of new price \n     controls on competition in the wider telecommunications \n     market, including Internet access, telephony, and video \n     programming.\n       The study finds that, despite current market share of \n     around 85.6 percent (falling to around 75 percent by 2002); \n     dynamic services offered by Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), \n     broadcast television, and other multichannel video delivery \n     systems provide substantial and growing competition for cable \n     television. More than 65 percent of households can receive \n     six or more broadcast channels with a suitable antenna. For \n     many households, DBS offers greater levels of service at \n     prices comparable to, or lower than, cable's. DBS appears to \n     provide a good substitute for cable even after accounting for \n     up-front equipment costs. Competing cable systems (overbuilds \n     and Satellite Master Antenna TV) have become cost-effective \n     and are growing rapidly, especially in the Midwest and \n     Northeast.\n       The study also finds that past cable regulation, especially \n     rate controls, provided little or no benefit to consumers, \n     and in fact harmed consumers by inducing lower quality of \n     service. On the other hand, periods of less regulation, such \n     as the years between 1984 and 1990, stimulated production of \n     greater quality and wider choice of programming for \n     consumers, produced steady increases in demand for cable, and \n     produced net consumer welfare gains of $3 billion to $6.5 \n     billion per year.\n       Finally, the evidence shows that the cable industry is in \n     the midst of investing up to $28 billion to improve its \n     infrastructure, including over $1 billion per year to convert \n     to interactive digital services. The entry of cable firms \n     into new businesses such as telephony, Internet, and digital \n     video is improving consumer choice and reducing prices for \n     these services, especially to residential customers; spurring \n     a competitive response from the telephone industry to upgrade \n     its data transmission capabilities; and giving a boost to the \n     introduction of digital television and to competition in the \n     Internet business. An imposition of rate controls similar to \n     those of 1993 and 1994 would undermine the financial basis \n     for the cable industry to enter these new businesses in the \n     near term, and hence weaken competition in the wider \n     telecommunications market place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6428-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LUCILLE SMITH WATKINS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \nto recognize an outstanding teacher, mentor, and West Virginian--Ms. \nLucille Smith Watkins. For almost 50 years, Lucille has taught at Logan \nCounty Elementary School with unmatched enthusiasm. At 73, she is still \nfiercely committed to teaching and harbors no intention of quitting, \nsaying ``I like getting up and going to teach every day. The children \nseem to do real well. When I feel like I'm not helping them anymore, \nI'll retire.''\n  Lucille credits her family for instilling an early appreciation and \nlove for education--influenced by the sacrifices and efforts that they \nexerted in order to make higher education a possibility for herself and \nher six brothers and sisters. Her early love of education blossomed \ninto a consuming lifelong passion of service to the school as she has \noften found herself cooking and buying groceries for the school along \nwith teaching.\n  Her outstanding commitment to teaching hasn't gone unnoticed in the \nstate. On May 5, she received the very first Lucille Smith Watkins \nAward, an award in her honor presented annually by her school to the \ncounty's outstanding educator. On May 8, she won the Mary L. Williams \nblack educator award during a West Virginia Education Association \nconference in Charleston. Yet, these awards and honors cannot match her \nsmiles and pride for the achievements of her students. Beaming with \nprice about her student's recent Young Writer's Award and her students' \ntrophy for perfect attendance in her classroom, Lucille is a testament \nto her own love of teaching, and most importantly her love of her \nstudents.\n  There is no better way to make a profoundly lasting impact upon the \nfuture than through nurturing the mind of a young child. Lucille is a \nrefreshing example of the strength and endurance of one woman's attempt \nto make a difference. Speaking for the citizens of West Virginia, I am \nproud to have such an outstanding woman in our state and challenge \nothers to strive to affect and mold the lives of children as \nsuccessfully as she has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6428-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6428-S6429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. HERMAN C. WRICE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding drug and crime fighting efforts of Mr. Herman C. Wrice.\n  Mr. Wrice, once called the ``John Wayne of Philadelphia'' by \nPresident Bush, is one of today's most effective non-violent community \nactivists. His grassroots approach to cracking down on drugs and crime \nhas been successful in cities, towns, and Indian reservations across \nthe country. Herman's career as a social activist began in the late \n1960's after a personal tragedy; his wife, Jean, was caught in gang \ncrossfire at a local supermarket.\n  Mr. Wrice's organization, Turn Around America, unites ordinary \ncitizens and police who are determined to take back their \nneighborhoods. They organize street marches and all-night vigils at \nidentified drug houses to separate drug dealers from their customers.\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n This partnership depends on trust, cooperation, and mutual respect. \nCitizen efforts enhance, but do not replace, law enforcement efforts. I \nam pleased to say that Turn Around America has yielded impressive \nresults. In neighborhoods where demonstrations have taken place, crack \nhouses have closed. Children play in parks that were once littered with \ndrug paraphernalia. The number of drug-related arrests have risen, \nseveral of which were directly linked to citizen involvement. Even \nveteran police officers have been inspired by Herman's anti-drug \ncrusade.\n  Mr. Wrice's relentless efforts to fight crime and violence have \nreceived wide-spread attention. Villanova University honored him with \nan honorary doctorate degree for his activism. His programs have been \ndescribed in many publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the \nNew York Times, Readers Digest, Policy Review, and Philadelphia \nMagazine. Mr. Wrice and his anti-crime program were even featured on 60 \nMinutes. This exposure led to requests for training from over 200 \ncities and towns across the country. In 1994, Herman was one of six \nactivists to receive an America's Award for Courage during special \nceremonies at the Kennedy Center. The following year, he was named a \nJoin Together Fellow by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. On a local \nlevel, Herman has been a two-time recipient of the Mayor's Outstanding \nCitizen Award, and a three time honoree as the Junior Chamber's \nOutstanding Young Man of the Year. Finally, he has received the Freedom \nFoundation's Citizenship Award, the NAACP Unsung Hero's Award, and was \nnamed the Citizen Crime Commission's Crime Fighter of the Year.\n  Mr. President, Herman C. Wrice is a man with a purpose. He has \ndedicated his life to community service, and he has made a difference. \nHe has worked to make the streets safe for neighborhood children, and \nhe has raised 17 of his own--11 of whom were adopted. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Wrice and in extending the \nSenate's best wishes to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6428-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6429-S6431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE CHICAGO BULLS ON WINNING THE 1998 NBA CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 249 \nintroduced earlier today by Senators Moseley-Braun and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The resolution (S.Res. 249) to congratulate the Chicago \n     Bulls on winning the 1998 National Basketball Association \n     Championship.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  MS. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \ntoday to join the citizens of the city of Chicago and the entire state \nof Illinois, as well as Bulls fans around the world, in congratulating \nthe Chicago Bulls for winning a sixth National Basketball Association \nchampionship. The Bulls defeated the Utah Jazz 87-86 in game six of the \nfinals this past Sunday in Salt Lake City.\n  One of the true joys of my life over the last several years has been \nto watch Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Phil Jackson and the rest of \nthe Bulls continually define excellence in team basketball. Considered \nby some to have been underdogs in this year's series against the Utah \nJazz, the Bulls persevered and wrote yet another fantastic chapter in \none of the greatest stories in professional sports.\n  Without a doubt, the Bulls' repeat-3peat would not have been possible \nwithout the star performance of Michael Jordan. His play throughout the \nseason defined what it means to be a champion, and his 45 points and \nlast-second winning shot on Sunday night ensured that his team remained \nchampions. Once again, Michael Jordan has defined excellence. Once \nagain, he has defined competitiveness and leadership. Once again, he \nand all of the Bulls have shown us that hard work, teamwork, talent and \ndesire will produce victory.\n  Complementing Michael Jordan this year, as he has so skillfully done \nfor each of the Bulls' championships, was forward Scottie Pippen. \nDespite being injured for much of the first half of the season and \nsuffering with a severely strained back in game six, Scottie Pippen \ndemonstrated through his outstanding offensive and defensive play that \nhe too has the heart of a champion.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize the flamboyant and \ntalented play of Dennis Rodman. Like Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, \nDennis Rodman has been a key reason for the Bulls' success. His \nharshest critics cannot take away his five NBA championships, two with \nthe Detroit Pistons and three with the Bulls, or his seven consecutive \nNBA rebounding titles.\n  I would also like to highlight the accomplishments of Toni Kukoc, \nwhose play often provided the boost to take the Bulls to victory. He \nwas always there with a big shot when one was most needed. Ron Harper \nis another player who made many invaluable contributions during the \nBulls' championship run. His defensive play throughout the playoffs \nshut down many of the league's best point guards.\n  Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Randy Brown, Scott Burrell, Bill Wennington, \nJud Buechler and Dickey Simpkins all played important roles in the \nBulls' championship drive. Their contributions further demonstrated \nPhil Jackson's masterful coaching skills. His intelligent, deliberative \nand team-oriented approach to the game allowed his players to transcend \nthe individual and operate as a unit.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate Jerry Reinsdorf and \nJerry Krause for once again fielding an NBA championship team. This is \nan outstanding victory in which they can take great pride.\n  In congratulating the Bulls for winning a sixth NBA title in eight \nyears, I also want to compliment the Utah Jazz for their spirited play \nand sportsmanship. This Jazz team gave the Bulls their toughest \nchallenge in any of their six championships. Karl Malone and John \nStockton are both certainly Hall of Fame players.\n  Mr. President, the state of Illinois can also take special pride in \nthe accomplishments of the Utah Jazz because the coach of the Jazz, \nJerry Sloan, is a product of our state. The McLeansboro native not only \nhails from Illinois, but also had a storied career with the Bulls. I \nwould like to thank Jerry Sloan and his team for a thrilling finals \nseries.\n  I have one last thought, Mr. President, and in expressing it, I \nbelieve that I speak for Bulls fans everywhere: Let there be seven!\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nspectacular team that has propelled itself into the upper echelon of \nbasketball history, the Chicago Bulls. Add a new name to the history \nbooks of the National Basketball Association; the Boston Celtics of the \n1960s, the Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s, and undeniably, the Chicago \nBulls of the 1990s.\n  On Sunday, as I watched Game Six with basketball fans and Bulls \nfollowers around the world, I was privileged to witness another \nincredible performance by Michael Jordan and the entire Bulls team. For \nthe sixth time in eight years, in a victory for the ages, the Chicago \nBulls are the champions of the National Basketball Association. It is \nwith great honor, pleasure, and pride that I salute and congratulate \nthe entire Chicago Bulls organization.\n  As a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times noted, ``We live in the \nright city at the right time.'' It is simple yet so true. No other team \nin any sport has been able to show the dominance and consistency that \nthe Bulls have shown. The people of Chicago and Illinois have a special \nsource of pride in the Chicago Bulls and especially in Michael Jordan. \nThis wonderful championship and the five spectacular ones before it are \nall keepsakes in the hearts and minds of Chicagoans. I know personally \nthat days, weeks, and years from now I will be recounting where I was \nwhen the Bulls achieved the ``Six-Pack,'' and I will be doing it with \ngreat pride. My grandson Alex, who recently turned two years old, is \nnot quite old enough to realize what the Bulls have accomplished. But \nmake no mistake about it, in the years to come I know he will have a \nproud grandfather recounting the almost mythical tales of Michael \nJordan and telling of the amazing dynasty that they created.\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\n  Michael Jordan. What more can possibly be said about him? There are \nsimply no longer any more adjectives to describe his spectacular feats \nand clutch performances. Super-human? Possibly. The best to ever plan \nthe game of basketball? Positively. In the pivotal Game Six, in a most \nunfriendly arena, Michael Jordan took his team and the people of ``the \ncity of big shoulders,'' put them all directly on his shoulders and \ncarried them all to the NBA's promised land, the world championship. \nJordan, the ambassador of the game of basketball to the world, \naccomplished what no other player has been able to do. With his \nunprecedented tenth scoring title and sixth Finals Most Valuable Player \naward, Jordan has shown the impact he has on the game. But I'm sure \nthat all of the personal accolades are secondary when it comes to the \nteam and to being champions. The true champion puts his team and their \nsuccess above all and Jordan has done that time and time again.\n  None of us will forget the courageous performance given by an injured \nScottie Pippen. With an injury that would have had anyone else \nbedridden, he played as well as he possibly could. But more \nimportantly, he provided the emotional lift that the team needed. \nAgain, another example of how being there for your team and your fellow \nplayers is ingrained in the hearts of these players, in the hearts of \nchampions.\n  And of course, the man who keeps it all together and running like a \nwell tuned machine, Phil Jackson. With a combination of years of \nbasketball experience as a player and as a coach, his special \nrelationship with Jordan, Pippen, and the entire team, and a touch of \nhis Zen philosophy, Jackson has been able to lead this team to the apex \nof the National Basketball Association despite all of the distractions \nand injuries.\n  Surely we cannot overlook the contributions of the rest of the team--\nDennis Rodman, Ron Harper, Luc Longley, Toni Kukoc, the ``supporting \ncast'' as they are called. But they are more than that. They are each a \ncritical piece of a puzzle that when fully assembled presents us with \nan impressive and spectacular sight: Six golden, shinning, championship \ntrophies. Each clutch three point basket by Steve Kerr and Judd \nBuechler, each suffocating defensive stop by Scott Burrell and Randy \nBrown, each rebound from Bill Wennington and Dickey Simpkins are \nessential pieces of the big picture.\n  We should also acknowledge the impressive job that owner Jerry \nReinsdorf has done with this organization from the time he took over as \nowner, and the sportsmanship and leadership that the Bulls organization \nhas shown through the years.\n  I could go on and on, but I would like to switch tracks and commend \nthe Utah Jazz for a wonderful and exciting series. The Jazz \norganization and the fans of Salt Lake City were worthy opponents in \nthis battle and did not go quietly into the night. They made the Bulls \ngive every ounce of heart and determination to win this sixth \nchampionship. You could not have asked for more from the Utah Jazz. The \nUtah fans were the extra player on the bench ready to give their team a \nneeded push. I'm sure that their biggest fan, my colleague Senator \nOrrin Hatch, provided the loudest cheers of all. Unfortunately, there \ncan only be one champion. But in my eyes, and the eyes of all \nbasketball fans, Karl Malone, John Stockton, and the entire team earned \nour respect and admiration. They too are champions and I commend them \nand wish them the best of luck in returning to the NBA Finals.\n  As the city of Chicago celebrates another taste of excellence and \nprepares for another mid-June party in Grant Park, we can only hope \nthat this is not the last we see from this team. But if it was our last \nopportunity to be graced with the performance of Michael Jordan, \nScottie Pippen, and Phil Jackson, the core and heart of this team, then \nwe could not have asked for anything more. They continually gave this \ncity and fans everywhere joy, pride, a glimpse at what it is like to be \nthe best at what you do and to accomplish the ultimate goal. The \nChicago Bulls have given millions of fans the chance to live \nvicariously through them. When the Bulls are champions, the entire city \nof Chicago and all Bulls fans are also champions. When Jordan steals \nthe ball and makes the game winning shot with five seconds to go, we \nall make that shot. The Bulls give us hope and pride and the chance to \nbe champions. I salute them for bringing so much to the city of \nChicago, and to basketball fans everywhere.\n  The breath-taking performances that Michael Jordan has graced us with \nand the six hard-fought championships that the entire team has brought \nto the city are truly ``unbelieve-a-bull.'' Without question, being \nsuccessful in all six of their championship endeavors, they were \n``unstop-a-bull.'' And their place in history and in the hearts of \neveryone in Chicago and the world is absolutely ``undeni-a-bull.'' I \nsalute the Chicago Bulls on a wonderful season, and a heart-stopping \nchampionship. If this was Michael Jordan's last game then it could not \nhave been scripted any better. It was a fitting, almost storybook \nending in which the man who got us there also brought us back \nvictorious. As coach Phil Jackson put it, ``it has been a wonderful \nride.'' Indeed it has been. Congratulations to the city of Chicago and \nthe World Champion Chicago Bulls.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I must comment, in my own congratulations \nto the Chicago Bulls, with the observation that our Indiana Pacers \nextended the Bulls to seven games, as the Chair will remember. We are \ndelighted that such a great season occurred in the NBA, and a very \nworthy team, including, obviously, the Utah Jazz, the ultimate \nsurvivors. We congratulate the Bulls on their sixth triumph in 8 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be agreed to en \nbloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear in the Record in the appropriate \nplace, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For \nthe sixth time in eight years, in a victory for the ages, the Chicago \nBulls are the champions of the National Basketball Association. It is \nwith great honor, pleasure, and pride that I salute and congratulate \nthe entire Chicago Bulls organization.\n  As a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times noted, ``We live in the \nright city at the right time.'' It is simple yet so true. No other team \nin any sport has been able to show the dominance and consistency that \nthe Bulls have shown. The people of Chicago and Illinois have a special \nsource of pride in the Chicago Bulls and especially in Michael Jordan. \nThis wonderful championship and the five spectacular ones before it are \nall keepsakes in the hearts and minds of Chicagoans. I know personally \nthat days, weeks, and years from now I will be recounting where I was \nwhen the Bulls achieved the ``Six-Pack,'' and I will be doing it with \ngreat pride. My grandson Alex, who recently turned two years old, is \nnot quite old enough to realize what the Bulls have accomplished. But \nmake no mistake about it, in the years to come I know he will have a \nproud grandfather recounting the almost mythical tales of Michael \nJordan and telling of the amazing dynasty that they created.\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\n  Michael Jordan. What more can possibly be said about him? There are \nsimply no longer any more adjectives to describe his spectacular feats \nand clutch performances. Super-human? Possibly. The best to ever plan \nthe game of basketball? Positively. In the pivotal Game Six, in a most \nunfriendly arena, Michael Jordan took his team and the people of ``the \ncity of big shoulders,'' put them all directly on his shoulders and \ncarried them all to the NBA's promised land, the world championship. \nJordan, the ambassador of the game of basketball to the world, \naccomplished what no other player has been able to do. With his \nunprecedented tenth scoring title and sixth Finals Most Valuable Player \naward, Jordan has shown the impact he has on the game. But I'm sure \nthat all of the personal accolades are secondary when it comes to the \nteam and to being champions. The true champion puts his team and their \nsuccess above all and Jordan has done that time and time again.\n  None of us will forget the courageous performance given by an injured \nScottie Pippen. With an injury that would have had anyone else \nbedridden, he played as well as he possibly could. But more \nimportantly, he provided the emotional lift that the team needed. \nAgain, another example of how being there for your team and your fellow \nplayers is ingrained in the hearts of these players, in the hearts of \nchampions.\n  And of course, the man who keeps it all together and running like a \nwell tuned machine, Phil Jackson. With a combination of years of \nbasketball experience as a player and as a coach, his special \nrelationship with Jordan, Pippen, and the entire team, and a touch of \nhis Zen philosophy, Jackson has been able to lead this team to the apex \nof the National Basketball Association despite all of the distractions \nand injuries.\n  Surely we cannot overlook the contributions of the rest of the team--\nDennis Rodman, Ron Harper, Luc Longley, Toni Kukoc, the ``supporting \ncast'' as they are called. But they are more than that. They are each a \ncritical piece of a puzzle that when fully assembled presents us with \nan impressive and spectacular sight: Six golden, shinning, championship \ntrophies. Each clutch three point basket by Steve Kerr and Judd \nBuechler, each suffocating defensive stop by Scott Burrell and Randy \nBrown, each rebound from Bill Wennington and Dickey Simpkins are \nessential pieces of the big picture.\n  We should also acknowledge the impressive job that owner Jerry \nReinsdorf has done with this organization from the time he took over as \nowner, and the sportsmanship and leadership that the Bulls organization \nhas shown through the years.\n  I could go on and on, but I would like to switch tracks and commend \nthe Utah Jazz for a wonderful and exciting series. The Jazz \norganization and the fans of Salt Lake City were worthy opponents in \nthis battle and did not go quietly into the night. They made the Bulls \ngive every ounce of heart and determination to win this sixth \nchampionship. You could not have asked for more from the Utah Jazz. The \nUtah fans were the extra player on the bench ready to give their team a \nneeded push. I'm sure that their biggest fan, my colleague Senator \nOrrin Hatch, provided the loudest cheers of all. Unfortunately, there \ncan only be one champion. But in my eyes, and the eyes of all \nbasketball fans, Karl Malone, John Stockton, and the entire team earned \nour respect and admiration. They too are champions and I commend them \nand wish them the best of luck in returning to the NBA Finals.\n  As the city of Chicago celebrates another taste of excellence and \nprepares for another mid-June party in Grant Park, we can only hope \nthat this is not the last we see from this team. But if it was our last \nopportunity to be graced with the performance of Michael Jordan, \nScottie Pippen, and Phil Jackson, the core and heart of this team, then \nwe could not have asked for anything more. They continually gave this \ncity and fans everywhere joy, pride, a glimpse at what it is like to be \nthe best at what you do and to accomplish the ultimate goal. The \nChicago Bulls have given millions of fans the chance to live \nvicariously through them. When the Bulls are champions, the entire city \nof Chicago and all Bulls fans are also champions. When Jordan steals \nthe ball and makes the game winning shot with five seconds to go, we \nall make that shot. The Bulls give us hope and pride and the chance to \nbe champions. I salute them for bringing so much to the city of \nChicago, and to basketball fans everywhere.\n  The breath-taking performances that Michael Jordan has graced us with \nand the six hard-fought championships that the entire team has brought \nto the city are truly ``unbelieve-a-bull.'' Without question, being \nsuccessful in all six of their championship endeavors, they were \n``unstop-a-bull.'' And their place in history and in the hearts of \neveryone in Chicago and the world is absolutely ``undeni-a-bull.'' I \nsalute the Chicago Bulls on a wonderful season, and a heart-stopping \nchampionship. If this was Michael Jordan's last game then it could not \nhave been scripted any better. It was a fitting, almost storybook \nending in which the man who got us there also brought us back \nvictorious. As coach Phil Jackson put it, ``it has been a wonderful \nride.'' Indeed it has been. Congratulations to the city of Chicago and \nthe World Champion Chicago Bulls.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I must comment, in my own congratulations \nto the Chicago Bulls, with the observation that our Indiana Pacers \nextended the Bulls to seven games, as the Chair will remember. We are \ndelighted that such a great season occurred in the NBA, and a very \nworthy team, including, obviously, the Utah Jazz, the ultimate \nsurvivors. We congratulate the Bulls on their sixth triumph in 8 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be agreed to en \nbloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear in the Record in the appropriate \nplace, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 249) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 249\n\n       Whereas the Chicago Bulls, despite injuries to Scottie \n     Pippen and Luc Longley, went 62-20 and tied for the best \n     regular season record in the National Basketball Association;\n       Whereas the Bulls battled through the playoffs, sweeping \n     the New Jersey Nets and defeating the Charlotte Hornets in 5 \n     games, before beating the Indiana Pacers in 7 games to return \n     to the NBA Finals for the third straight year;\n       Whereas the Bulls displayed stifling defense throughout the \n     playoffs before beating the Utah Jazz to repeat the 3-peat \n     and win their third consecutive NBA championship, their sixth \n     in the last 8 years;\n       Whereas head coach Phil Jackson and the entire coaching \n     staff skillfully led the Bulls through an injury riddled 62-\n     win season and a 15-6 playoff run;\n       Whereas Michael Jordan won his fifth most valuable player \n     award, and he, along with Scottie Pippen, were again named to \n     the NBA's ``All-Defensive First Team'';\n       Whereas Michael Jordan won his record tenth scoring title \n     and was named the NBA Finals most valuable player for the \n     sixth time in 6 appearances in the finals;\n       Whereas Scottie Pippen again exhibited his outstanding \n     offensive and defensive versatility, proving himself to be \n     one of the best all-around players in the NBA;\n       Whereas the quickness, tireless defensive effort, and \n     athleticism of the colorful Dennis Rodman, who won his \n     seventh straight rebounding title, keyed a strong Bulls front \n     line;\n       Whereas Toni Kukoc displayed his awesome variety of \n     offensive skills in both assisting on, and hitting, several \n     big shots when the Bulls needed them most;\n       Whereas veteran guard Ron Harper, in shutting down many of \n     the league's top point guards throughout the playoffs, \n     demonstrated the defensive skills that have made him a \n     cornerstone of the league's best defense;\n       Whereas center Luc Longley frustrated many of the all-star \n     caliber centers that he faced while at times providing a much \n     needed scoring lift;\n       Whereas Steve Kerr buried several 3-pointers when the Bulls \n     needed them most;\n       Whereas the outstanding play of Jud Buechler, Scott \n     Burrell, and Bill Wennington and the tenacious defense of \n     Randy Brown, each of whom came off the bench to provide \n     valuable contributions, were an important part of each Bulls \n     victory; and\n       Whereas the contributions of Dickey Simpkins and rookies \n     Rusty LaRue and Keith Booth, both on the court and in \n     practice, again demonstrated the total devotion of Bulls \n     personnel to the team concept that has made the Bulls one of \n     the great sports dynasties of modern times: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the Chicago Bulls \n     on winning the 1998 National Basketball Association \n     championship.\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/16/senate-section/article/S6429-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        ORDERS FOR JUNE 17, 1998\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. and begin a period of \nmorning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill, with a Ford \namendment pending regarding the tobacco farmers.

We have morning business from 9:30 \nto 10:30. I didn't hear the Senator. Are we out at 10:30 in recess?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The unanimous consent agreement was, following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill with \nthe Ford amendment pending regarding tobacco farmers.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend that we can do it a little bit later. I \nthought when we first talked, there would be a hiatus until whatever \ntime the conference was over. Apparently, now the conference will not \noccur.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding is that the conference of the Republicans \nwill occur at 10:30, and the leader will make a decision in the morning \nwith regard to any further motions in relation to that time.\n  Mr. FORD. I thought at the time you and I could have an agreement, as \nthe two managers here, to make a decision on when we would have that \nvote, or some time prior that we have a chance to say a few words.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will be guided by the leaders.\n  Mr. FORD. Just to be sure that the two leaders understand what we \nwant then.\n  Mr. LUGAR. In any event, I am hopeful of attending the meeting at \n10:30. I will miss the Senator during that period.\n  Mr. FORD. I wish I could be a little fly on the wall and listen to \nit, but I won't be able to do that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I understand.
