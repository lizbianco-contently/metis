Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 22, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 22) to express the sense of \n     the Congress concerning the application by the Attorney \n     General for the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 \n     Presidential election campaign.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to speak on Senate Joint \nResolution 22 which expresses the sense of the Congress that the \nAttorney General should apply for the appointment of an independent \ncounsel to investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 \nPresidential election campaign.\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\n  Under Federal law, the Attorney General may apply to the special \ndivision of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for appointment \nof an independent counsel whenever, after completion of a preliminary \ninvestigation, she finds that a conflict of interest exists or when she \nfinds evidence that a specific category of individuals within the \nexecutive branch may have violated Federal law. The appointment of an \nindependent counsel is a serious matter and one which the Attorney \nGeneral should only initiate when necessary. That is why I, and many \nothers, had refrained from joining the assortment of calls for Attorney \nGeneral Reno to appoint an independent counsel in connection with the \n1996 Presidential campaign.\n  Yet, yesterday, all 10 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee felt \nthe time had come to request such an appointment. We sent a letter to \nthe Attorney General, as authorized by the independent counsel statute, \nrequesting that she make an application for an independent counsel. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of our letter to the Attorney General \nbe printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. We did that with due deliberation, without any desire to \nhurt anybody and without any desire to do other than to help the \nAttorney General make this decision.\n  I must confess to a degree of frustration with the Independent \nCounsel Act. Did I appreciate having to send our letter? Certainly not. \nHowever, the law sets forth a specific process by which Congress is to \nrequest that the Attorney General begin the process by which an \nindependent counsel is appointed, and this process requires the \nJudiciary Committee to make what the other party will inevitably \ncharacterize as partisan charges in order to trigger the Attorney \nGeneral's responsibilities. In order for Congress to trigger the most \npreliminary steps for the Department of Justice to take to consider the \nneed for an independent counsel, the law essentially provides that the \nparty not in control of the executive branch make specific charges when \nand if the Attorney General fails to act on her own. I would have \npreferred to have had the Attorney General seek an independent counsel \non her own. But she has not done so. At the very least, I would have \npreferred that she conduct a preliminary investigation on her own. But \nshe has refused to do even this. I would have preferred to have \nrequested that she seek an independent counsel without having to set \nforth, in such a public manner as the law requires, the specific and \ncredible evidence which warrants such an appointment. But in order for \nus to require the Attorney General to take certain minimal steps toward \ninvestigating whether an independent counsel is warranted, we were \nrequired by law to send our letter. In short, the Independent Counsel \nAct is the law of the land and, notwithstanding its relative flaws, we \non the Judiciary Committee have an obligation to abide by it.\n  At last week's Judiciary Committee executive business meeting, I had \nhoped to vote on a resolution expressing the committee's sense that an \nindependent counsel should be appointed, and directing that I draft and \ncirculate a letter requesting that the Attorney General apply for such \nan appointment. I had been led to believe that a committee vote on a \nresolution calling for an independent counsel would have broad \nbipartisan support. Yet, my colleague, Senator Leahy--the committee's \nranking member--indicated that, in light of the short notice they \nreceived about the proposed resolution, he and his colleagues wished to \nhold the resolution over until the committee's next business meeting. I \nreadily acceded to their request.\n  It was not an unreasonable request. And besides, I was asked to begin \nthis process just an evening before myself, and I had not had the \nopportunity to discuss it with Senator Leahy. So there was absolutely \nno offense. It was something I was willing to do and readily did \nbecause I thought it was a reasonable, decent request.\n  Without getting into the details of our ensuing discussions, it \nbecame clear that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to \nformulate a resolution on which both sides of the aisle could agree. \nFurthermore, I felt it was best to avoid a prolonged discussion of this \nmatter in committee given that it was unlikely consensus could be \nreached. Accordingly, I decided to proceed directly to drafting and \ncirculating a letter to the Attorney General as I had originally \nplanned. The letter went through a number of variations. We tried to \nplease people, we tried to resolve problems, and I think we \nhave. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach agreement with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle because we could not reach \nagreement on whether the committee should actually request the \nappointment of an independent counsel. Accordingly, I circulated a \nletter to all members of the committee and a majority of the \ncommittee's members signed on.\n\n  I remain persuaded that the appointment of an independent counsel is \nboth called for under the independent counsel statute and responsive to \nthe views of most Americans, who would like to be assured that these \nvery serious allegations are investigated in a fair and thorough way, \nand without any real or apparent conflict of interest.\n  I am hopeful that Attorney General Reno, for whom I continue to have \ngreat respect, will appreciate the concerns set forth in our letter, \nand will agree that an independent counsel should be appointed \nforthwith to investigate these matters.\n  Recent developments have, I believe, made clear that a thorough \nJustice Department investigation into possible fundraising violations \nin connection with the 1996 Presidential campaign will raise an \ninherent conflict of interest, and certainly raises at least the \nappearance of such a conflict, and that the appointment of an \nindependent counsel is therefore required to ensure public confidence \nin the integrity of our electoral process and system of justice.\n  Madam President, recent revelations have demonstrated how the DNC \nwas, as the New York Times wrote, ``virtually a subsidiary of the White \nHouse.'' That was on February 27, 1997, just a few weeks back. Without \nrestating the points covered in our letter and without questioning in \nthe slightest the integrity, professionalism or independence of the \nAttorney General or the individuals conducting the present Justice \nDepartment fundraising investigation, the fact that the Department's \ninvestigation will inescapably take it to the highest levels of the \nexecutive branch presents an inherent conflict of interest calling for \nthe appointment of an independent counsel under title 28 United States \nCode section 591(c)(1).\n  Further, the answer to whether criminal wrongdoing has occurred will \nof necessity turn on the resolution of disputed factual, legal, and \nstate of mind determinations. In particular, I would note that there \nremains the significant factual question of the extent to which the \nallegedly improper fundraising activity was, in fact, directed toward \nbenefiting Federal campaigns, especially when some of this activity \nwas, by admission, paid for by the Clinton-Gore campaign. Because the \ninquiry necessary to make these determinations will inescapably involve \nhigh level executive branch officials, they should, I believe, be left \nto an independent counsel in order to avoid a real or apparent conflict \nof interest. Moreover, where individuals covered by the independent \ncounsel statute are involved, as they plainly were here, see title 28 \nUnited States Code section 591(b), the Ethics in Government Act \nrequires that these inquiries be conducted by an independent counsel.\n  In any event, both prudence and the American people's ability to have \nconfidence that the investigation remains free of a conflict of \ninterest, warrants the appointment of an independent counsel.\n  More importantly, the emerging story regarding the possibility that \nforeign contributions were funneled into U.S. election coffers to \ninfluence U.S. foreign policy further highlights the conflict of \ninterest the Attorney General's ongoing investigation inescapably \nconfronts. I delivered a floor speech earlier in the week spelling out \nmy concerns, so I will not restate them here. They are detailed in the \nletter which I have placed in the Record. It is clear, however, that \nthese issues cannot be properly investigated without a conflict of \ninterest, since investigating\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nmost of these questions will require inquiring into the knowledge and/\nor conduct of individuals at the highest levels of the executive \nbranch. Moreover, several of the principal figures in this \ninvestigation, including the Riadys and the Lippo Group and Charlie \nTrie, reportedly have longstanding ties to our President.\n  Indeed, the conflicts at issue here are precisely the sort of \ninherent conflict[s] of interest to which the Attorney General \ntestified during Senate hearings in 1993 on the reenactment of the \nIndependent Counsel Act. Avoiding an actual or perceived conflict of \ninterest was the basis, not just for the application for the \nappointment of an independent counsel to investigate James McDougal, \nbut also for the recent requests to extend that counsel's jurisdiction \nto include the investigations of Anthony Marceca and Bernard Nussbaum. \nAs the Attorney General herself testified, applying for an independent \ncounsel, and our request that she make such application, in no way \ndetracts from the integrity and independence of the Attorney General or \nthe career prosecutors presently investigating these allegations.\n  A final point should be made. Some of my Democrat colleagues have \nwritten to the Attorney General urging her, should she decide to apply \nfor an independent counsel, to request an independent counsel who will \ninvestigate the full scope of fundraising irregularities. They argue \nthat she should avoid partisanship by instructing the independent \ncounsel to investigate Republicans who have skirted the spirit of the \nlaw. I appreciate what my colleagues are trying to do, and their \nloyalty to their political party is duly noted by me. But, as I \ndiscussed a moment ago, the appointment of an independent counsel is a \nvery serious matter and partisan proportionality should not even be the \nslightest consideration. Would these Senators have sent this letter had \nthe majority not sent our letter to the Attorney General? I think we \nall know the answer to that question.\n  Furthermore, they fail to even suggest that the Republican activities \nto which they refer independently warrant an independent counsel. \nAccordingly, I expect the Attorney General, who is a woman of \nintegrity, will give their letter the consideration it deserves.\n  In closing, Attorney General Reno has appointed four independent \ncounsels to date. It is the sense of the majority of the members of the \nJudiciary Committee that the need to avoid even the appearance of a \nconflict of interest, and thereby to ensure the public's confidence in \nour system of justice, requires an independent counsel in connection \nwith the 1996 Presidential campaign. Should the Senate vote on Senate \nJoint Resolution 22, I will be voting in support of the resolution, and \nI think rightly so.\n  I call upon my friends on the other side of the aisle to consider \nvoting for it as well. Voting that the Attorney General appoint an \nindependent counsel in this case appears to me to be the right thing to \ndo. Keep in mind, I have held off making this request for a lengthy \nperiod of time, knowing my constitutional duty and our constitutional \nduties here, because I wanted the Attorney General to have enough time, \nand those who are working with her who are people, I believe, of \nsubstance and integrity, to investigate and look into this and resolve \nthese matters. But as these matters have accumulated, as the \nallegations have mounted up, as newspaper upon newspaper has written \nabout them, it is clear that there is at least an appearance of a \nconflict of interest, and, therefore, it left us with no alternative \nother than to request this, even though, to repeat, I wish no one any \nharm. I certainly hope that these allegations are untrue, I hope they \ncan be proven to be untrue, and my prayers will be in that regard.\n  Having said all of that, I do hope that the Attorney General will \ntake the necessary step to apply for the appointment of an independent \ncounsel and that one will be appointed. Then perhaps we can resolve \nthese matters once and for all in an independent, reasonable way that I \nthink will be for the benefit of everybody.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: This letter serves as a formal \n     request, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(1), that you apply \n     for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     possible fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign. The purpose of this letter is not to \n     provide an exhaustive list of the particular allegations \n     that, we believe, warrant further investigation. Indeed, \n     since the Department of Justice has been conducting an \n     extensive investigation into fundraising irregularities for \n     several months now, you presumably have far greater knowledge \n     than do we of the various matters that are being, and will \n     need to be, investigated, and we presume that your judgment \n     as to the necessity of an independent counsel is based on all \n     of the information before you. Rather, the purpose of this \n     letter is to articulate why we believe this investigation \n     should be conducted by an independent counsel. As you know, \n     the Senate Committee on the Judiciary has, to date, refrained \n     from joining the assortment of other individuals who have \n     called upon you to initiate an independent counsel \n     appointment. Recent developments over the past few weeks, \n     however, have persuaded us that such an appointment is now \n     necessary.\n       When you appeared before the Senate in 1993 when we were \n     considering reenactment of the Independent Counsel statute, \n     you stated\n       ``there is an inherent conflict of interest whenever senior \n     Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the \n     Department of Justice and its appointed head, the Attorney \n     General. The Attorney General serves as the pleasure of the \n     President. Recognition of this conflict does not belittle or \n     demean the impressive professionalism of the Department's \n     career prosecutors, nor does it question the integrity of the \n     Attorney General and his or her political appointees. \n     Instead, it recognizes the importance of public confidence in \n     our system of justice, and the destructive effect in a free \n     democracy of public cynicism.''\n       You further testified that--\n       ``It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system and you cannot do that when there is \n     conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, \n     in effect, the chief prosecutor. * * * The Independent \n     Counsel Act was designed to avoid even the appearance of \n     impropriety in the consideration of allegations of misconduct \n     by high-level Executive Branch officials and to prevent * * * \n     the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly-placed Executive officials.''\n       We believe, that, in light of recent developments, a \n     thorough Justice Department investigation into possible \n     fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign will raise an inherent conflict of \n     interest, and that the appointment of an independent counsel \n     is therefore required to ensure public confidence in the \n     integrity of our electoral process and system of justice.\n       First, recent revelations have demonstrated how officials \n     at the highest level of the White House were involved in \n     formulating, coordinating and implementing the DNC's \n     fundraising efforts for the 1996 presidential campaign. \n     Recent press reports, the files released by Mr. Ickes, and \n     public statements by very high ranking present and former \n     Clinton Administration officials indicate how extensively the \n     Administration was involved in planning, coordinating, and \n     implementing DNC fundraising strategy and activities. All \n     this has led The New York Times to a conclusion which we find \n     hard to challenge; namely, that ``the latest documentation \n     shows clearly that the Democratic National Committee was \n     virtually a subsidiary of the White House. Not only was \n     [President] Clinton overseeing its fund-raising efforts, not \n     only was he immersed in its ad campaigns, but D.N.C. \n     employees were installed at the White House, using White \n     House visitors' lists and communicating constantly with \n     [President] Clinton's policy advisers.'' The New York Times, \n     February 27, 1997. As a consequence, we believe that a \n     thorough investigation of all but the most trivial potential \n     campaign fundraising improprieties necessarily includes an \n     inquiry into the possible knowledge and/or complicity of very \n     senior white House officials in these improprieties. We \n     believe that, without questioning in the slightest the \n     integrity, professionalism or independence of the Attorney \n     General or the individuals conducting the present Justice \n     Department fundraising investigation, the fact that the \n     Department's investigation will inescapably take it to the \n     highest levels of the Executive Branch presents an inherent \n     conflict of interest calling for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(c).\n       Moreover, these revelations raise new questions of possible \n     wrongdoing by senior White House officials themselves, \n     including but not limited to whether federal officials may \n     have illegally solicited and/or received contributions on \n     federal property; whether specific solicitations were ever \n     made by federal officials at the numerous White House \n     overnights, coffees, and other similar events, and whether \n     these events themselves, often characterized in White House \n     and DNC memoranda as ``fundraising'' events, constituted \n     improper ``solications'' on federal\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\n     property; whether government property and employees may \n     have been used illegally to further campaign interests; \n     and whether the close coordination by the White House over \n     the raising and spending of ``soft''--and purportedly \n     independent--DNC funds violated federal election laws, \n     and/or had the legal effect of rendering those funds \n     subject to campaign finance limitations they otherwise \n     would not be subject to. It seems to us that, even \n     accepting the narrow constructions of some of the \n     governing statutes that have been suggested--which are not \n     necessarily the constructions an independent counsel would \n     render--the answer to whether criminal wrongdoing has \n     occurred will of necessity turn on the resolution of \n     disputed factual, legal, and state of mind determinations. \n     Because the inquiry necessary to make these determinations \n     will inescapably involve high level Executive Branch \n     officials, we believe they should be left to an \n     independent counsel in order to avoid a real or apparent \n     conflict of interest. Moreover, where individuals covered \n     by the independent counsel statute are involved, as they \n     plainly were here, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(b), the Ethics \n     in Government Act requires that these inquiries be \n     conducted by an independent counsel. Whether the Act \n     simply permits or requires the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, however, we believe that prudence and \n     the American people's ability to have confidence that the \n     investigation remains free of a conflict of interest, \n     requires it.\n       Second, the emerging story regarding the possibility that \n     foreign contributions were funneled into U.S. election \n     coffers to influence U.S. foreign policy further highlights \n     the conflict of interest your ongoing investigation \n     inescapably confronts. A March 9, 1997, Washington Post \n     article quoted ``U.S. government officials--presumably \n     familiar with the Department's ongoing investigation--as \n     stating that investigators have obtained `` `conclusive \n     evidence' '' that Chinese government funds were funneled into \n     the United States last year,'' and quoted one official as \n     stating that ``there is no question that money was \n     laundered.'' This article reported that U.S. officials \n     described a plan by China ``to spend nearly $2 million to buy \n     influence not only in Congress but also within the Clinton \n     Administration.'' If the FBI truly is investigating these \n     allegations, as is reported, and this investigation extends \n     to high level Executive Branch officials, it raises an \n     inherent conflict of interest.\n       Moreover, a closer look at the activities and associations \n     of some of the particular individuals who are reported to be \n     the principal figures in the ongoing investigation further \n     illustrates why this investigation ultimately must involve \n     high levels of the Executive Branch. Especially troubling is \n     the information revealed to date regarding the Riady family \n     and their associate, Mr. John Huang, but serious questions \n     are also raised by the activities and associations of Mr. \n     Charles Yah Lin Trie, Ms. Pauline Kanalanchak, and Mr. Johnny \n     Chung, among others. Taken together, these reported events \n     raise a host of serious questions warranting further \n     investigation: To what extent were illegal contributions from \n     foreign sources, in particular China, being funneled into the \n     United States, and with whose knowledge and involvement? To \n     what extent was U.S. policy influenced by these \n     contributions, and with whose knowledge and/or involvement? \n     To what extent were the decisions to hire Huang at the \n     Commerce Department, to support most-favored-nation status \n     for China and Chinese accession to the World Trade \n     Organization, or to normalize relations with Vietnam, \n     influenced by contributions, and with whose knowledge and/\n     or involvement? To what extent was the standard NSC \n     screening process for admission to the White House waived \n     or modified so as to permit special access to large donors \n     and their guests where it would ordinarily be denied, and \n     with whose knowledge and/or involvement? To what extent \n     was John Huang placed at the DNC to raise money in \n     exchange for past and future favors, and with whose \n     knowledge and/or investment?\n       It is evident that these questions cannot be properly \n     investigated without a conflict of interest, since \n     investigating most of these questions will require inquiring \n     into the knowledge and/or conduct of individuals at the \n     highest levels of the Executive Branch. Moreover, several of \n     the principal figures in this investigation, including the \n     Riadys and the Lippo Group and Charlie Trie, reportedly have \n     longstanding ties to President Clinton.\n       Indeed, the conflicts at issue here are precisely the sort \n     of ``inherent conflict[s] of interest'' to which you \n     testified during Senate hearings in 1993 on the re-enactment \n     of the Independent Counsel Act. Avoiding an actual or \n     perceived conflict of interest was the basis not just for \n     your application for the appointment of an independent \n     counsel to investigate James McDougal, but also for your \n     recent requests to extend that counsel's jurisdiction to \n     include investigations of Anthony Marceca and Bernard \n     Nussbaum. The same concern warrants your application for an \n     independent counsel here, where public confidence can be \n     assured only by the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate any alleged wrongdoing in connection with DNC, \n     Clinton Administration, and Clinton/Gore Campaign fundraising \n     during the 1994-1996 election cycle. As you yourself \n     testified, applying for an independent counsel, and our \n     request that you make such an application, in no way detracts \n     from the integrity and independence of the Attorney General \n     or the career prosecutors presently investigating these \n     allegations.\n       Pursuant to the statute, please report back to the \n     Committee within 30 days whether you have begun or will begin \n     a preliminary investigation, identifying all of the \n     allegations you are presently investigating or as to which \n     you have received information, and indicating whether you \n     believe each of these allegations are based on specific \n     information from credible sources, and either pertain to a \n     covered individual or present a conflict of interest. Please \n     also provide your reasons for those determinations. See 28 \n     U.S.C. 592(g)(2). In the event you conduct a preliminary \n     investigation, but do not apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, or apply for an independent counsel but \n     only with respect to some of the various allegations on which \n     you have received information, please identify all those \n     allegations which in your view do not warrant appointment of \n     an independent counsel, and explain your view whether those \n     allegations warrant further investigation, pertain to a \n     covered individual, and/or present a conflict of interest \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(3).\n           Sincerely,\n         Orrin G. Hatch, Charles E. Grassley, John Ashcroft, \n           Spencer Abraham, Mike DeWine, Strom Thurmond, Arlen \n           Specter, Jon Kyl, Fred Thompson, Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAMS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the first comment this morning is that \neverybody wishes the President well in his upcoming surgery. It is \nalmost like those in some of the terrorist groups that go out and \nkneecap somebody and then send flowers to them in the hospital. I am \nnot suggesting that there is hypocrisy in it, but I am waiting for all \nof the requests for special counsel and for some of my friends on the \nother side to ask for a resolution to spend money to send Senators in \nsurgical gowns out to Bethesda to make sure the President really is out \nthere having an operation.\n  It has reached that kind of a level around here. For some of my \ncolleagues, if President Clinton were to walk across the water to save \nsomebody from drowning, the headline in their statement would be, ``It \nproves he can't swim.''\n  When I hear some of the statements being made, I am reminded of a \nwhat a former Republican President--who, incidentally, was one of the \nbest fundraisers I have ever known--said, ``Well, there you go again.''\n  Some in the Congress simply cannot avoid the temptation to jump the \ngun, draw the most negative possible inferences, and take every \nopportunity to discredit those who serve in the Government, and, as one \nwho has served for years in law enforcement, they also take every \npossibility to discredit those who serve in law enforcement, and demand \nyet another costly, time-consuming, largely unaccountable and \npotentially destructive independent counsel investigation so long as it \nis limited to only investigating a Democratic President.\n\n  Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of \njustice. I think it is a kind of partisan effort at political spin. It \ncomes at the end of a week during which the Senate rejected the \nmajority leader's version of a resolution to restrict the Governmental \nAffairs Committee investigation. That resolution, before it passed, was \naltered during our floor debate to include examination of improper as \nwell as illegal fundraising activities and finally to include such \nactivities in congressional as well as the Presidential campaign. It \nthen passed 99 to nothing.\n  The joint resolution before us is a similarly ill-conceived effort. \nIt was introduced before the Rules Committee or the Senate moved to \nconsider, amend and reamend the funding resolution for the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. It was introduced before the Judiciary Committee met \non a committee resolution on March 6. It was introduced before the \nRepublican and Democratic members of the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees sent letters to the Attorney General. Those letters are the \ncongressional actions contemplated by the independent counsel law. This \nresolution is not.\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\n  In fact, this resolution, if it were introduced as a bill rather than \nmerely a sense of the Senate resolution and then passed as a law, would \nnot pass constitutional muster.\n  It is very, very easy to stand here and say go out and look at the \nPresident; do not look at anything we do. Whatever you do, do not look \nat the House or Senate Members of Congress. But let us go after the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, what we are saying is that our regular law enforcement \nagencies cannot do the job. We in Congress can. That is a laugh. As I \nsaid, I spent nearly 9 years in law enforcement. I know that the \nAttorney General and the others in law enforcement here have the \nindependence to do what needs to be done. But I also know that it is \nthe height of hypocrisy to say look at them; do not look at us.\n  The American people, the public, want more than anything else real \ncampaign reform. The Republican leadership of the House and Senate \ncould bring campaign reform measures to the floor today and ask us to \nhave votes on them. Instead, they want to spend days and days and days \nbashing the President. Even while he is lying in the hospital in \nBethesda for surgery, they will spend days bashing him, hoping that \nnobody will notice the tens of thousands of dollars we will spend in \nthis Chamber in this debate and the printing costs of it all. They are \nhoping that maybe the American public will not ask the question: If you \nhave all that time and money and effort to spend, why not debate real \ncampaign finance reform and vote on it--campaign finance reform that \nwould apply not just to the President and Vice President but would \napply to every Democrat, Republican and Independent in the House and \nSenate and every Democrat and Republican and every Independent who \nmight challenge an incumbent.\n  The fact is that if you took a poll today and asked the American \npublic, do you want real campaign finance reform, the response would be \na resounding yes. I hope the America public will ask the Republican \nleadership of the Senate and the Republican leadership of the House, \nbecause they are the ones responsible for setting the legislative \nagenda, when are you going to bring campaign finance reform to the \nfloor? The President has said he will sign the bill. Unlike the last \nstrong, tough campaign finance reform bill that was passed by the House \nand Senate and went to the White House for signature and was vetoed by \nthe former President, this President has said he will sign such a bill.\n  It is going to be easy during the vacation set up in a week for the \nHouse and Senate, for Members to go home and give wonderful speeches \nand say we are in favor of campaign finance reform. We are all in \nfavor, just like we are in favor of God and motherhood. But I hope \npeople ask, but have you voted on it? When are you going to vote on it? \nBring it up and have a vote on real campaign finance reform.\n\n  Now, some Members will vote against it and some Members will vote for \nit. But at least the American public will know how their Member of the \nHouse and their Senators voted. That is all we are asking.\n  I understand and I have great respect for some Senators who do not \nwant to vote for a campaign finance reform bill, even those who oppose \ncampaign finance reform legislation. I do not question their motives. \nLet them vote against it. But I also respect those such as Senator \nFeingold and Senator McCain who have brought forward a campaign finance \nreform bill, and they ought to have a vote on it. That is all I am \nasking. Stop the smokescreens of Friday afternoon talks about \ninvestigating the President. I am sure they will pause at some point to \nwish him well during his surgery this afternoon and then they will go \nright back to bashing him.\n  Why not say here, Mr. President, we will actually do what we are \nhired to do, what we are elected to do, what we are paid to do. We will \npass a campaign finance reform law.\n  In fact, while we are at it, maybe we ought to pass the chemical \nweapons treaty.\n  While we are at it, maybe we ought to pass a budget. My good friends \non the other side of the aisle criticize the President's budget. Well, \nthey have a majority of the votes in the House and Senate to pass their \nown. In fact, the law requires them to do it shortly after the \nvacation. Let us see if they will pass one.\n  It occurs to me the kind of votes necessary to pass a budget are the \nkind of votes that might cause some political pain on the right and the \nleft, and maybe that is why we do not actually vote on those kinds of \nthings. It occurs to me that if we passed a bill on campaign finance \nreform, it would actually cause some pain, especially for those of us \nwho are incumbents, and maybe that is why the leadership will not bring \nthat bill to the floor. It occurs to me that the reason these \nresolutions about investigations are very carefully aimed at the \nPresident and exclude any consideration of possible improper activity \non the part of Members of Congress is that maybe--maybe--some who are \nsupporting them want to make sure no gaze of a special prosecutor is \ndirected at activities of Members of Congress.\n  There are only 100 people at any one time who are given the \nopportunity to be in the Senate. I do not question the fact that you \nhave to have some partisan motivations to get elected in the first \nplace. But when you are here and take an oath of office, an oath to \nuphold the Constitution, to represent the whole country and to uphold \nthe Constitution of the United States, let us not have partisan games \nthat are more reflective of somebody running for some minor county \noffice somewhere. We are supposed to be reflecting the interests of all \nof the United States. We are supposed to be reflecting the interests of \nall people. What we do as the Senate should reflect the conscience of \nthe United States. The Senate should be, and at times has been, the \nconscience of this great country. But, when we engage in partisan games \naimed at sliming the President, but at the same time protecting every \nsingle thing we do, that is not representing the conscience of the \nUnited States. That is not rising to the level of what the U.S. Senate \nshould be.\n\n  If Members want to investigate the President on fundraising \nactivities, then be honest enough to say we will apply the same \nsearchlight, the same magnifying glass, the same standards to \nourselves. Do not give a hypocritical image of the U.S. Senate to the \nAmerican people by saying we will go after the President but we will \nmake sure that nobody looks at us, nobody asks us if any of us had done \nthe exact same things we are asking the President not to do. That is \nnot showing the kind of respect we should have for this Senate, for \nthis body, for the precedents we establish here.\n  This resolution before us is not authorized by the independent \ncounsel law. If it were a separate bill, it would not pass \nconstitutional muster. It is an inappropriate effort to pressure the \nAttorney General to prejudge these matters. It would pervert the \nindependent counsel process under the law. The independent counsel law \nwas designed to protect the independence of investigatory and \nprosecutorial decisions, including those of the Attorney General. This \nresolution would say that Congress does not want the Attorney General \nto be independent. The resolution says that we want to step in and tell \nher what to do and how to do it. The independent counsel law was passed \nto ensure that investigative and prosecutorial decisions are made \nwithout regard to political pressure, but this action by the Senate \nwould subvert that purpose by subjecting the critical initial decisions \nabout invoking the law to just such political pressure.\n  We are saying to the Attorney General, do not you use any of your \njudgment. We will tell you what you have to think. When I was a \nprosecutor, I know what I would have told any legislative body that \ntold me how to exercise my prosecutorial discretion. It is not \nCongress' place to determine whether and when to bring criminal \ncharges. As a former prosecutor, I say this body is ill-suited to that \npurpose. The administration of justice is ill-served by efforts to \nintimidate a prosecutor to begin a case, just as it would be ill-served \nby the legislature trying to intimidate a prosecutor to end a case.\n  This resolution will serve only to undermine the investigation that \nthe Attorney General now has underway. It will undercut the independent \ncounsel law and I believe it further erodes public confidence in \nGovernment's ability\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nto do its job. We ought to do our job and let the Attorney General do \nhers.\n  Part of our job would be to pass campaign finance reform. But you see \nabsolutely no effort by the Republican leadership to bring such a bill \nto the floor for a vote. Part of our job would be to vote up or down on \nthe chemical weapons treaty, but you see no effort on the part of the \nRepublican leadership to bring that to a vote. Part of our job would be \nto pass a budget, vote it up or down, but you see no effort on the part \nof the Republican leadership to bring that to a vote on the floor. What \nthis resolution does is take the Senate down another detour, away from \nthe critical work that we should be doing and is being left undone.\n  I have been here 22 years. I have been proud to work with Republicans \nand Democrats on major legislation. On the floor of the Senate during \nlast year's Presidential election, I took the floor of the Senate to \npraise the former Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole. I praised him \nduring the height of the Presidential election year, saying he is a man \nI had worked with closely for bipartisan solutions on farm bills, on \nhunger issues, on school lunch, school breakfasts, and the Women, \nInfants, and Children Programs. We forged a bipartisan consensus, just \nas I have been proud to do with so many other Members on the Republican \nside, and just as so many real leaders in the Republican Party have \ndone as they have worked with Members of the Democrat side to form a \nbipartisan consensus on issues that are most important to the United \nStates of America.\n  Unfortunately, when you have things like this resolution, which are \nso blatantly partisan, where little effort is made to bring about a \nbipartisan resolution, we find ourselves going further away from the \nkind of bipartisan approach to the Nation's problems that we heard so \nmuch about when this session was beginning.\n\n  It is almost as though some go out and have a pollster ask, ``What do \nyou American people want of us?'' They will get back from the pollster \nthat the people want us to work together, they want us to have \nbipartisan solutions, they want us to show more civility, they want us \nto work together in the interests of the country. So what do these \nwell-informed legislators proceed to do? They go on the Sunday talk \nshows and have weekend press conferences and say that it is a new day, \nthat there is an effort for bipartisan consensus. They say what they \nthink the people want to hear.\n  But do we see a bipartisan effort on a budget resolution? No. Do we \nsee a bipartisan effort on a chemical weapons treaty? No. Do we see a \nbipartisan effort to confirm Federal judges?\n  There has not been one single judge confirmed yet this Congress. You \nknow, there is a heck of a lot more effort given to somehow influencing \nthe appointment of an independent counsel or special prosecutor, by \nthis body, than there is to considering and confirming Federal judges. \nNot one single Federal judge has been confirmed by this Congress. Not \none court of appeals judge was confirmed in the last session of \nCongress. The Chief Justice of the United States, a conservative \nRepublican, appointed first by one Republican President as a member of \nthe Supreme Court and subsequently by another Republican President as \nChief Justice, has said we have reached a crisis situation. There are \nnearly 100 vacancies in our Federal courts. Justice is not only \ndelayed, justice is denied to American people--all American people, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  Everybody knows it is a crisis. But this Senate, with all the talk \nabout bipartisanship, has not confirmed one single Federal judge. In \nfact, I think there is only one scheduled for consideration by the \nSenate. At this rate--I am 56 years old--through normal attrition and \nall, if we keep on at this rate, when I am 156, instead of 100 \nvacancies we will have 300 or 400 vacancies.\n  This is not the way to show any kind of bipartisan consensus. If we \nspend one-tenth as much of an effort at confirming Federal judges that \nwe are supposed to, that we are paid to do, that we are elected to do \nwe might begin to fulfill our responsibilities. If we spend one-tenth \nthe effort on confirming judges that we spend on cranking up more and \nmore multimillion dollar investigations of the President, we might \naccomplish something. But, obviously, that is not intended in this new \nera of bipartisanship.\n  We spent the first 2 months of this year debating a proposed \nconstitutional amendment that is unnecessary, unsound, and unwise, but \na bumper-sticker approach to the problems of budget deficits and the \nneed to balance our Federal budget. We have not spent 38 seconds on \nthis floor actually debating a real budget. We have not spent 21 \nseconds; we haven't spent a nanosecond. We spent 2 months talking about \nsomething that might take effect in the next century. But we have not \nspent 2 seconds debating something that will take effect this year.\n\n  Mr. President, I fear for the Senate. I am proud of the Senate. I am \nproud of being here for 22 years. I am proud of serving with great \nRepublican leaders and great Democratic leaders. I am proud of serving \nwith men and women from both the Republican and Democratic side whom I \nconsider true national leaders.\n  What makes me proud is they have come together for the best interest \nof the United States, not leaving behind their party allegiances, but \nbeing first and foremost Americans and U.S. Senators and doing what is \nbest for the country. I do not see that happening now, Mr. President. \nIt fills this Senator with a great deal of sorrow.\n  This is not the way we do things in my State. In my State, we will \nfight for our elections. Some win, some lose. Then we come together as \nRepublicans and Democrats for what is best for Vermont. We, U.S. \nSenators, 100 of us having a chance to represent more than 250 million \nAmericans, ought to do what is best for this country. A quarter of a \nbillion Americans expect the 100 men and women of this body to do that, \nand we are not bringing together the bipartisan consensus we used to \nand that we need to achieve.\n  I talked about the bumper-sticker sloganeering of the constitutional \namendment. It failed here. In the House, they have not even had a \ncommittee markup. The Republican Party decided not to do that. For \nwhatever their reasons are, I hope now, after spending months on that \nill-fated effort, we can actually debate and pass a budget. I tell my \nfriends on the other side of the center aisle that if they really want \nto work on a bipartisan budget, we can. For that matter, they do not \nhave to ask for a single Democratic vote. There are enough Republicans \nin the House and Senate to pass a budget, as the law requires, by April \n15, if they really want to.\n  Mr. President, I have talked about judicial vacancies. Twenty-five \npercent of the current vacancies have persisted for more than 18 \nmonths. A quarter of the judicial vacancies in this country have been \nthere for a year and a half. This is justice delayed, this is justice \ndenied, this is wrong.\n  I have served here twice in the majority and twice in the minority. I \nhave served here when the President of the United States was President \nGerald Ford, then President Carter, then President Reagan, then \nPresident Bush, and now President Clinton. Never in my memory, under \nRepublican Presidents or Democratic Presidents, with Republican Senates \nor Democratic Senates, never has the leadership of this body ever \nallowed a situation when judicial vacancies would exist in this number \nfor this long. Never.\n  Republican leaders like Howard Baker or Bob Dole or Hugh Scott, \nDemocratic leaders like Mike Mansfield or Bob Byrd or George Mitchell \nor Tom Daschle never countenanced such a thing. Never would these great \nleaders have done this. Never have they allowed the Federal judiciary \nto get in such an abysmal state, when the Chief Justice has to say it \nis a crisis, when the Chief Justice says: ``It is hoped that the \nAdministration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling \njudicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration \nof justice.'' And yet, we have to tell him today that we are not doing \nit, we are not doing our job.\n  A little over a year ago, the Republican majority of the House and \nSenate closed down the whole Government, for days on end, weeks on end, \nto make a political point. The political point is that they wasted \nhundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money \nand the American public found out the Speaker of the House, at\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\none point, had to go out the back door of Air Force One--obviously, the \nkind of affront that they felt justified wasting hundreds of millions \nof dollars of taxpayers' money.\n  They were making a political point and the Government was closed \ndown. Some say billions of dollars were wasted. It was an enormous \ninconvenience to the American taxpaying public who were wondering what \nwas going on.\n\n  Having had this failed experience of closing down the executive \nbranch of Government, it appears they now want to close down the \njudicial branch of Government. This is the kind of capricious meanness \nthat you see in a schoolboy plucking the wings off a fly. This is \nbeneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate. This is beneath the dignity of \nbeing a U.S. Senator. This is beneath the dignity of our Constitution. \nThis is wrong. This has never been done. It was never done under the \nleadership of Senator Baker and Senator Dole, under the leadership of \nSenator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, or Senator Daschle. \nI doubt if it was ever done under the leadership of those who came \nbefore them.\n  The Senate is not fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. It is \ninterfering with the President's authority to appoint Federal judges. \nIt is hampering the third, coequal branch of our Government.\n  The Republicans controlling the 104th Congress shut down the \nexecutive branch, this Congress they seem intent on shutting down the \njudicial branch for political gain. It is a scandal in the making. It \nis high time for the Senate to do its duty to consider and confirm \njudges to the vacancies that have persisted for so long.\n  Instead, they bring to the Senate floor this resolution and say, \n``Hey, Mr. President, I hope you enjoy your time in Bethesda. Turn on \nC-SPAN. We're going to stand here and bash you for a day or two or \nthree.''\n  I suggest this: If you want to do that--if the leadership figures \nthat the only thing to do, because they cannot pass a budget, cannot \nratify a treaty, cannot pass anything else that might significantly \nimprove the lives of the American people--if, instead, they want to use \nthis Senate to bash the President, could we have maybe an hour every \nday to do the people's business? Maybe an hour a day? For 10 hours, \nthey can bash the President and 1 hour each day we could actually \ndebate their budget resolution, if they had a budget resolution. For 10 \nhours a day, bash the President, an hour a day actually consider and \nconfirm Federal judges.\n  It is getting a little ridiculous. Do people know that we get paid \n$133,000 a year, and we have not had 1 second of debate on the budget \nresolution that the Republican leadership of the Senate and the House \nare supposed to bring before us for a vote? Do they know that we get \npaid $133,000 a year, but if you want to litigate a case in a Federal \ncourt, you probably cannot get before a Federal judge because of the \nvacancies that our inaction is perpetuating?\n  Do they know how much it is costing to do the bashing per page of the \nCongressional Record? Maybe it is a sort of full-employment opportunity \nfor printers. As a printer's son, maybe I ought to be happy, but I do \nnot think this is what my father would think was the best thing for \nthis body to do.\n  So, Mr. President, some of this could be humorous if it were not for \nthe enormous cost to the taxpayers, if it were not for the fact that we \nare not doing what we are supposed to do, if it were not for the fact \nthat the kind of bipartisanship that has always made me proud to be a \nMember of the U.S. Senate has broken down more than I have ever seen \nbefore. Maybe it would be funny if so many people were not hurt.\n  The Attorney General will look into any issues that there may be at \nthe White House. She will report back to us, as she is required to do. \nWe can look at that report and we can determine whether we agree with \nit or not. But as a former prosecutor, I must tell you, I find it very \noffensive to tell a prosecutor, ``Here is what you must do and must not \ndo. Here are the conclusions you must reach and must not reach.''\n  That is basically what this resolution is saying and it is also \nsaying: ``Oh, by the way--by the way--there's one thing thou shalt not \ndo. Thou shalt not ask any question of a Member of Congress. We, the \nRepublicans, who control the majority in the Congress, are saying, thou \nshalt not ask questions of us, what we might have done in \nfundraising.'' I will guarantee you, Mr. President, when we bring up an \nalternative resolution which calls on the Attorney General to look at \nMembers of Congress, that in lockstep the Republican majority will vote \nthat down. A herd of elephants will trample that into the dust.\n  Why is that? They say, go investigate the President. We have already \nspent $30, $40 million investigating the President and found nothing \nthat says he has done anything wrong. We have already spent about $30, \n$40 million on a special prosecutor, who also goes out and gives \nspeeches to organizations that seek to defeat the President. We spent \n$30, $40 million on a special prosecutor who has clients whose PAC's \nhave worked very hard to defeat the President. We spent $30, $40 \nmillion on a special prosecutor who would not recognize a conflict of \ninterest if it hit him up alongside the head.\n  Now they say, ``Let's just go after the President some more, but, \nplease, make sure you understand what we are saying: Don't touch us.'' \nIt reminds me of the tax debate where the distinguished former chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and one of the real giants of the Senate, \nRussell Long, in debate said, ``The kind of taxes we want are, don't \ntax me, don't tax thee; tax the man behind the tree.'' Well, in this \ncase, my good friends on the Republican side want to hide behind that \ntree and say, ``Investigate everybody on the other side of the tree. \nDon't look at us.''\n  I would like to think, Mr. President, this is because all the Members \nwho are going to vote against any investigation of the Senate or the \nHouse, all the Members who want to block that, are as pure as Caesar's \nwife. I would like to follow that analogy, Mr. President, but I could \nnot do it with a straight face.\n  It is really very blatant what is going on here. The majority does \nnot want to have a vote on a budget. The majority does not want to have \na vote on a chemical weapons treaty. Lord knows, the majority does not \nwant to do anything significant in filling the 100 vacancies now \npersisting in the Federal courts. And those vacancies will grow just \nthrough the normal retirements, deaths, and so forth. But let them \npound the President.\n  Oh, I would not be surprised if at some point in here we will \nprobably have a resolution calling for the President's speedy recovery \nfrom the surgery this afternoon, but they will just pound the heck out \nof him in the meantime.\n  You know, Mr. President, I am not sure anybody is fooled by this. If \nit was just a silly partisan exercise, it would be one thing. At most, \nit would be an embarrassment to the U.S. Senate. But it goes beyond \nthat. Because now we find that not only--not only--has there been an \nunprecedented attack on the Constitution by blocking Federal judges, \nbut now the other shoe has dropped. We have heard from Members in the \nother body that they want the impeachment of judges. If they disagree \nwith their decision, they want them impeached.\n\n  I say to my friends on the other side who are calling for \nimpeachments, they should take the time--I was going to say to \n``reread'' a history book, but I think that might be presupposing to \nsay ``reread'' one--but go and read a history book. And I cannot say \n``reread'' the Constitution, because that also presupposes they read \nit. Read the Constitution.\n  This Nation, the greatest democracy that history has ever known, the \nmost powerful nation on Earth and still remaining a democracy, is here \nbecause of the independence of the three branches of Government: The \nlegislative, the executive, and the judiciary.\n  Mr. President, everywhere I go in this country and throughout the \nworld I find such enormous respect for our independent Federal \njudiciary. Look at some of the countries that are seeking democracy. \nOne of the biggest problems they have is that they have never had an \nindependent judiciary. We pride ourselves on our independent judiciary. \nBut for us to say, ``I disagreed with a decision, impeach him,'' it is \nlike Alice in Wonderland, the queen saying, ``Off\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nwith their heads, off with their heads.'' It is that silly.\n  There are, after all, appellate courts. I have tried cases. I have \nwon some and I have lost some. I have known I could always appeal. That \nis what you do. If a judge rules differently than you like, appeal the \ndecision. Do not say ``Oh, we'll impeach them.'' What kind of respect \ndo you think there will be for our Federal courts if that could be \ndone?\n  This makes me think, Mr. President, of those who had billboards out \n``Impeach the Supreme Court'' because the Court ruled against \nsegregation. It was wrong then for those who wanted to violate the \nindependence of our courts because the courts dared point their finger \nat the sin and the stain of segregation. It was just as wrong then as \nit is today.\n  If my friends on the other side persist in destroying the \nindependence of our Federal judiciary, what kind of a legacy do they \nleave their children and their children's children?\n  My children will live most of their lives in the next century. I \nthink to myself every day, what kind of a century will we give to them \nif, after 200 years of building up the greatest democracy history has \never known, we start with this piece and this piece, tearing down what \nmade it a great democracy, tearing down the Constitution, tearing down \nthe independent judiciary, and, yes, Mr. President, tearing down the \nSenate and tearing down the House by our own statements and by our own \nactions? That is wrong.\n  Mr. President, before this gets any further out of control, I pray \nthat Republicans and Democrats will start coming back together as we \ndid under the great leaders with whom I have had a privilege to serve--\nSenator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell and now Senator \nDaschle, and on the other side, Senator Baker and Senator Dole. These \nwere men who were willing to fight for their partisan beliefs but who \nknew that there were some issues where the American people have to be \nheard first and foremost and that we needed to come together.\n  I pray that our Members might pause here today--at least let the \nPresident of the United States go to surgery this afternoon without us \ntrying to tear him apart--and ask ourselves, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, what are we doing to the Senate? What are we doing to the House? \nWhat are we doing to our Federal Judiciary? What are we doing to the \nprotection of our Constitution when we say judges should be impeached \nnot for high crimes and misdemeanors, as the Constitution speaks of, \nbut because we disagree with them?\n  If anybody has ever tried cases, and I have tried a lot of cases, you \nwill find judges to disagree with. The other side might be delighted. \nThe next week the judge may agree with you and the other side is angry. \nThat is the way it works. I tried a lot of cases in the appellate court \nand I have tried a lot of cases in trial courts. However, sometimes I \ndisagreed with a determination.\n  Mr. President, when I began this statement there were no other \nSenators on the floor seeking recognition. I now see my distinguished \ncolleague from Rhode Island and will suspend my remarks at this point \nto allow him an opportunity to be heard.\n  I do ask unanimous consent that a copy of the March 13 letter to the \nAttorney General that is signed by seven Democrats serving on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record. It has been quoted \nalready today, but out of context, so I feel compelled to include the \ncomplete letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States.\n     U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: We expect that certain \n     Republican members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary \n     have forwarded to you a letter, purportedly pursuant to 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(1), that you apply for the appointment of \n     an independent counsel to investigate ``possible fundraising \n     improprieties in connection with the 1996 presidential \n     campaign.'' We will leave it to you to evaluate and respond \n     to that letter in accordance with your statutory \n     responsibilities to determine whether grounds to investigate \n     were furnished in that letter. Rather than provide specific \n     information and credible sources the Republican letter \n     appears to us to be a political document that strings \n     together a series of negative inferences, unanswered \n     questions and damning conclusions.\n       We, the undersigned members of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, are concerned about illegal and improper \n     fundraising and spending practices in Federal election \n     campaigns and the need for campaign finance reform. Whereas \n     press accounts and reported allegations of improper \n     fundraising in Federal campaigns undermine public confidence \n     in the integrity of our electoral process, we want to do all \n     that we can to restore public confidence and get to the \n     bottom of such alleged wrongdoing as soon as possible.\n       Should you determine that an application for appointment of \n     an independent counsel is appropriate, we request that your \n     application avoid partisanship and include the full scope of \n     fundraising irregularities. The written request from our \n     Republican colleagues focuses entirely on allegations of \n     fundraising irregularities by the 1996 Clinton/Gore \n     Presidential Campaign and by the Clinton Administration, with \n     a primary focus on two areas: first, whether senior White \n     House officials and other Executive Branch officials \n     ``improperly solicited and/or received contributions on \n     federal property''; and second, whether foreign contributions \n     ``were funneled into U.S. election offers to influence U.S. \n     foreign policy.''\n       In addition to the areas outlined by our Republican \n     colleagues, we request that you also examine additional \n     items. First, revelations in the press have been rampant \n     about Republican campaign fundraising improprieties, \n     including soliciting contributions on federal government \n     property. Other Republican fundraising activities also raise \n     significant questions about the appearance of conflicts of \n     interest and whether any quid-pro-quo is involved in \n     legislative activities. Additional revelations raise \n     questions about how Republicans have in some instances \n     violated campaign finance laws and in other instances skirted \n     the spirit, if not the letter of the law, by using not-for-\n     profit organizations to funnel money for use in campaigns \n     without the reporting requirements and limitations that apply \n     to formal campaign committees. Second, we are concerned about \n     the possibility that foreign governments are seeking to \n     influence our domestic and foreign policy through campaign \n     contributions, including to congressional candidates for \n     federal office.\n       We understand that you have already formed a Task Force of \n     experienced prosecutors from within the Public Integrity \n     Section of the Criminal Division to investigate whether \n     criminal conduct took place in 1996 federal election \n     campaigns and that the Task Force is already well underway in \n     its investigation. We further understand that over thirty \n     special agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have \n     been assigned to work on this investigation. Indeed, the \n     press has reported that this Task Force has already served \n     subpoenas and presented testimony to a grand jury. We \n     appreciate your pressing forward without delay and credit \n     your past statements that you are continuing to evaluate \n     whether you need apply for the appointment of an independent \n     counsel. We also appreciate that appointment of an \n     independent counsel is not always a panacea. We believe that \n     the cost and delay of independent counsels have not always \n     been justified, that they have not been accountable and that \n     the judicial panel responsible for appointing such an \n     independent counsel in these circumstances may well have its \n     own conflict of interest. Most importably, we understand that \n     were you to shift your approach at this point in order to \n     conduct a preliminary investigation under the independent \n     counsel law, you would have no authority to convene grand \n     juries or issue subpoenas. Thus, the work being done by the \n     current Task Force would have to cease abruptly and the \n     matter would go forward with less authority and fewer \n     investigative powers and options.\n       The decision to invoke the independent counsel process in a \n     particular matter rests with you and not with the United \n     States Congress or any member or members thereof. You have \n     demonstrated your willingness to invoke the independent \n     counsel law in the past and we have the utmost confidence \n     that you will invoke the law again, if and when the legal \n     standards have been met in a particular matter. These \n     standards are clearly set forth in the independent counsel \n     statute. You must invoke the independent counsel process when \n     there is specific information from a credible source that a \n     crime may have been committed by enumerated ``covered \n     persons'', under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(a). You may exercise your \n     discretion to invoke this process when there is specific \n     information from a credible source that a crime may have been \n     committed by any other person and where the Justice \n     Department has a personal, financial or political conflict of \n     interest, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(c)(1); or when there is \n     specific information from a credible source that a crime may \n     have been committed by a member of Congress and where it \n     would be in the public interest to do so, under 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 591(c)(2).\n       Partisan requests for invocation of the independent counsel \n     process give the appearance of attempting politically to \n     influence a decision by the Attorney General whether to \n     invoke the independent counsel process in a particular \n     matter. To our mind, this will result in further undermining \n     the public confidence's in the integrity of government, the \n     independent counsel process and in the criminal justice \n     system as a whole. Consequently, we urge you to exercise your \n     best\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n     professional judgment, without regard to political pressures \n     and in accordance with the standards of the law and the \n     established policies of the Department of Justice, to \n     determine whether the independent counsel process should be \n     invoked, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(a) or (c), to \n     investigate allegations of criminal misconduct by any \n     government official, member of Congress or other person in \n     connection with the 1996 federal election campaigns.\n       Only this week the Senate authorized the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee to begin its investigation into illegal and \n     improper fundraising activities in the 1996 federal election \n     campaigns. We are sure that you, as well as we, will monitor \n     that investigation and those hearings closely to determine \n     whether grounds for application for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel arise.\n       In conclusion, please report back to the Committee, \n     identify the allegations you are presently investigating, and \n     indicate whether you have begun or will begin a preliminary \n     investigation as limited by the independent counsel law, \n     indicate whether you believe these allegations to which we \n     have referred are based on specific information from credible \n     sources, and indicate whether these matters present a \n     conflict of interest with respect to a covered person or, \n     with respect to members of Congress, whether it would be in \n     the public interest to apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel. Please also provide your reasons for \n     those determinations. In the event you conduct a preliminary \n     investigation, but do not apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, or apply for an independent counsel, but \n     only with respect to some of the various allegations on which \n     you have received or developed information, please identify \n     all those allegations which in your view do not warrant \n     appointment of an independent counsel, and explain your view \n     whether those allegations warrant further investigation, \n     pertain to a covered individual, present a conflict of \n     interest or with respect to members of Congress, why the \n     public interest is served by proceeding in the manner that \n     you have chosen.\n           Sincerely,\n     Herb Kohl,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Richard J. Durbin,\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Robert Torricelli,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record, not introduced, but printed in the Record, a copy of a \njoint resolution which is very close to one that will be introduced by \nthis side as an amendment during this debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, a follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. --\n\n       Whereas the independent counsel law was created to restore \n     public confidence in the criminal justice system after the \n     abuses of the Watergate scandal;\n       Whereas the decision on whether to invoke the independent \n     counsel process in a particular matter rests by \n     constitutional necessity with the Attorney General and not \n     with the United States Congress;\n       Whereas the law provides, in section 591(a) of title 28, \n     United States Code, that the Attorney General must invoke the \n     independent counsel process where there is specific \n     information from a credible source that a crime may have been \n     committed by a covered person;\n       Whereas the law provides, in section 591(c)(1) of title 28, \n     United States Code, that the Attorney General may invoke the \n     independent counsel process where there is specific \n     information from a credible source that a crime may have been \n     committed by any other person and where the Justice \n     Department has a personal, financial, or political conflict \n     of interest;\n       Whereas the law provides, in section 591(c)(2) of title 28, \n     United States Code, that the Attorney General may invoke the \n     independent counsel process where there is specific \n     information from a credible source that a crime may have been \n     committed by a Member of Congress and where it would be in \n     the public interest to do so;\n       Whereas the Attorney General has invoked the independent \n     counsel law in the past, and has stated that she will invoke \n     the law again if and when the legal standards have been met \n     in a particular matter;\n       Whereas the independent counsel law was never intended to \n     be used in a partisan manner, and such a misuse of the law \n     would damage public confidence in the criminal justice \n     system; and\n       Whereas it would be unprecedented and inappropriate for the \n     Congress to cast a vote which would have the appearance of \n     attempting to politically influence a decision by the \n     Attorney General on whether to invoke the independent counsel \n     process in a particular manner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is \n     the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should \n     exercise her best professional judgment, without regard to \n     political pressures and in accordance with the standards of \n     the law and the established policies of the Department of \n     Justice, to determine whether the independent counsel process \n     should be invoked, pursuant to section 591(a) or (c), to \n     investigate allegations of criminal misconduct by any \n     government official, Member of Congress, or other person in \n     connection with any presidential or congressional election \n     campaign.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the resolution that is before us, and is the \nquestion of whether or not there ought to be an independent counsel.\n  Let me suggest here that there are three or four other items I want \nto talk about later. I am also interested in talking about the \ninvestigation that will be moving forward now as a result of last \nweek's vote; the Federal Election Commission and some idea on a piece \nof legislation I will introduce with regard to that, and then the \nproposed McCain-Feingold legislation. I presume this has been somewhat \nconfusing to someone watching this out there, with all these various \nresolutions and debates going on. But they are issues all related to \nthe same subject matter.\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly say, with regard to the resolution \nbefore us, as someone who appreciates the role of having a statute \ndealing with independent counsel, I, for one, along with others--and I \nam not alone in this regard--have expressed some reservations and \nconcerns about the independent counsel route generally, putting aside \nany specific matters. I was one who voted against establishing an \nindependent counsel in the case of former President Bush when there \nwere allegations raised involving Iran and Iran-Contra. I felt that \nthose motivations were purely political. There were those in my party, \nprincipally in my party, who pushed a resolution, and I felt it was \nunwarranted. If felt it was politically motivated, and voted against \nit.\n  I felt that the independent counsel's Iran-Contra investigation went \non way too long. It went on for years and cost an incredible amount of \nmoney.\n  So I am leery of this general approach because of how it is self-\nsustaining and goes on indefinitely. The passage of the statute was to \ntry and do something to take politics out of this a bit, to set some \nvery clear guidelines so we would not be involved in partisan debate \nover whether or not there ought to be an independent counsel.\n  Obviously, Members are going to express themselves on the issue, and \nI understand that. But with the independent counsel law we tried to \nremove the political debate in deciding these issues. I urge my \ncolleagues in this matter to allow the Attorney General to make her \ndecision. She is about as independent as any Attorney General we have \nhad and certainly has not been intimidated by invoking the independent \ncounsel statute in the past, as expressed by the Senator from Vermont.\n  I want to express the worrisome feelings I have about this. We have \nseen independent counsel investigations go on way too long. They are \nself-fulfilling. Today, we have the Justice Department, the FBI looking \nat the matter that is the subject of the request that an independent \ncounsel become involved.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I today join the majority of members of the \nJudiciary Committee in calling on the Attorney General to begin the \nprocess for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \npossible violations of Federal law in connection with fundraising and \nother activities during the 1996 Presidential election campaign.\n  The independent counsel statute--28 United States Code section 591 \nand following--provides that the Attorney General shall conduct a \npreliminary investigation, which is defined as ``such matters as the \nAttorney General considers appropriate in order to make a \ndetermination, whether further investigation is warranted, with respect \nto each potential violation, or allegation of a violation, of criminal \nlaw, when she receives information sufficient to constitute grounds to \ninvestigate'' whether certain persons violated any Federal criminal law \nother than a class B or C misdemeanor. These persons include:\n  First, President and Vice President;\n  Second, persons working in the Executive Office of the President paid \nat or above level II;\n  Third, chairman and treasurer of the President's reelection \ncommittee, or any officer of the reelection committee exercising \nauthority at the national level during the President's term.\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n  The test of the sufficiency of the information received is whether or \nnot it is specific and credible. The Attorney General has 30 days to \nreview this information to make the determination. This is a very low \nthreshold test. The only way she can avoid a preliminary investigation \nis to determine that the information is not credible or not specific. \nIf she finds she is unable to determine within 30 days if the \ninformation is credible and specific, she still has to begin the \ninvestigation.\n  Further, if the Attorney General determines that an investigation or \nprosecution by the Department of Justice of any other person may result \nin a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest, the \nAttorney General may conduct a preliminary investigation. Although this \nwould seem to be more discretionary than the shall language otherwise \nin the statute, Attorney General Reno understands the importance and \nthe necessity of the independence of the investigation into such \nmatters. As she testified before the Judiciary Committee in 1993 when \nthat committee was considering reenactment of the independent counsel \nstatute:\n\n       There is an inherent conflict of interest whenever senior \n     Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the \n     Department of Justice and its appointed head, the Attorney \n     General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the \n     President. Recognition of this conflict does not belittle or \n     demean the impressive professionalism of the Department's \n     career prosecutors, nor does it question the integrity of the \n     Attorney General and his or her political appointees. \n     Instead, it recognizes the importance of public confidence \n     in our system of justice, and the destructive effect in a \n     free democracy of public cynicism.''\n\n  She further testified:\n\n       It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system and you cannot do that when there is \n     conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, \n     in effect, the chief prosecutor . . . The Independent Counsel \n     Act was designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety \n     in the consideration of allegations of misconduct by high-\n     level Executive Branch officials and to prevent . . . the \n     actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly-placed Executive officials.\n\n  Despite the fact that high-level executive department officials and \nother covered persons have been implicated in possible violations of \nFederal law, the Attorney General seems to have ignored her own \nwarnings about the appearance of a conflict of interest or impropriety \nand has chosen not to initiate the procedure leading to the appointment \non her own. In light of this decision, it is left to the Senate, \nthrough the action of its Judiciary Committee, to pursue the \nappointment of an independent counsel.\n  This action has been initiated by written request to the Attorney \nGeneral. Under the independent counsel statute, the Attorney General \nhas 30 days after receipt of the request to report if the preliminary \ninvestigation has begun--and the date it began--or that it will not \nbegin. She must give her reasons for either beginning or choosing not \nto begin the investigation.\n  I am confident that Attorney General Reno will heed her own words in \nher testimony before the Judiciary Committee and seek to avoid even the \nappearance of impropriety in this investigation.\n  There is sufficient specific and credible evidence now to initiate \nthe process now. To do otherwise or to delay action will call the \nAttorney General's decisionmaking process into question. That is \nspecifically the effect that must be avoided here. There should be no \nappearance of impropriety in the decision of whether to appoint an \nindependent counsel and I am confident, upon consideration, the \nAttorney General will see the wisdom in expediting the decision to ask \nfor the appointment of such independent counsel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there are two items I will address this \nmorning. I will not be long. I know the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island is waiting to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2299-6", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2308-S2309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT: COMPELLING INTEREST STATEMENT\n\n  Mr. COATS. This coming Wednesday, Mr. President, March 19, the \nSupreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on the \nconstitutionality of the Communications Decency Act. This act was \npassed by this Senate in the last Congress by an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote of 84-16. The previous Senator talked of cooperation \nbetween parties, and there certainly was a significant degree of \ncooperation on this issue. We worked on a bipartisan basis, securing 84 \nvotes for its passage. Eventually, Congress passed the act as part of \nthe historic telecommunications reform legislation.\n  The Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress by an \noverwhelming, bipartisan margin, and signed by the President, simply \nextends the principle that exists in every other medium of \ncommunication in our society, a principle which has been repeatedly \nupheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court.\n  Stated simply, this principle holds that it is the responsibility of \nthe person who provides material deemed pornographic, that it is that \nperson's responsibility to restrict access by minors to that material. \nThe foundation of the principle is articulated clearly in the case New \nYork versus Ferber, and I quote from that case: ``It is evident beyond \nthe need for elaboration that the State's interest in `safeguarding the \nphysical and psychological well-being of a minor' is compelling.'' Let \nme repeat that judicial decision again, New York versus Ferber. ``It is \nevident beyond the need for elaboration that the State's interest in \n`safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor' is \ncompelling.''\n  This principle of compelling interest is the basis on which the \nCommunications Decency Act was constructed. That is why we believe it \nis constitutional and the Court will hold it so after it hears the \narguments next Wednesday. There is a long history of court decisions \nwhich recognize the interest of the State in safeguarding the \npsychological and physical well-being of minors. Mr. President, I have \na copy of a brief in support of the Communications Decency Act. It was \nfiled by a number of organizations: Enough is Enough, the Salvation \nArmy, the National Political Congress of Black Women, the National \nCouncil of Catholic Women, Victims Assistance Legal Organization, \nChildhelp USA, Legal Pad Enterprises, Inc., Focus on the Family, the \nNational Coalition for the Preservation of Family, Children and Family, \nCitizens for Family Friendly Libraries, Computer Power Corp., Help Us \nRegain the Children Organization--I am just reading some of these \nhere--Mothers Against Sexual Abuse, National Association of \nEvangelicals, One Voice/American Coalition for Abuse Awareness, \nReligious Alliance Against Pornography, Lenore J. Weitzman, Ph.D., and \nso forth, a whole series of groups that have filed this brief. I \ncommend these organizations for their leadership. I will be drawing on \nsome of their comments in the brief during my remarks.\n  Mr. President, it is now beyond question that exposure to pornography \nharms children. A child's sexual development occurs gradually \nthroughout childhood. Exposure to pornography, particularly the type of \nhard-core pornography currently available on the Internet, distorts the \nnatural sexual development of children. Essentially, pornography shapes \nchildren's sexual perspective by providing them distorted information \non sexual activity. The type of information provided by pornography \ndoes not provide children with a normal sexual perspective.\n  As stated in the brief, pornography portrays unhealthy or antisocial \nkinds of sexual activity such as sadomasochism, abuse, and humiliation \nof females, involvement of children, incest, voyeurism, bestiality, \ntorture, objectification and is readily available on the Internet.\n  The Communications Decency Act is designed, as I said, to employ the \nsame restrictions that are currently employed, and have been held \nconstitutional, in every other medium of communication.\n  Why do we need these protections? Let me quote Ann Burgess, professor \nof nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, when she states that \nchildren generally do not have a natural sexual\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\ncapacity until the ages of 10 or 12, but pornography unnaturally \naccelerates that development. By short-circuiting the normal \ndevelopment process and supplying misinformation about their own \nsexuality, pornography leaves children confused, changed, and damaged.\n  Mr. President, this is not what the Congress wants. This is not what \nthe American people want. We expressed that in our debate and in our \nvote in the last Congress. Surely we have not come to a point in our \nsociety where we find it tolerable that any pornographer with a \ncomputer and a modem can crawl inside our children's minds and distort \nand corrupt their sexual development?\n  As if the psychological threat of pornography doesn't present a \nsufficient compelling interest, there is also a significant physical \nthreat. As I have stated, pornography develops in children a distorted \nsexual perspective. It encourages irresponsible, dehumanized sexual \nbehavior, conduct that presents a genuine physical threat to children. \nIn the United States today, about one in four sexually active teenagers \nacquire a sexually transmitted disease every year, resulting in 3 \nmillion sexually transmitted disease cases. Infectious syphilis rates \nhave more than doubled among teenagers since the mideighties. One \nmillion American teenage girls become pregnant each year. A report \nentitled ``Exposure to Pornography, Character and Sexual Deviance,'' \nconcluded that as more and more children become exposed not only to \nsoft-core pornography, but also to explicit deviant sexual material, \nsociety's youth will learn an extremely dangerous message: Sex without \nresponsibility is acceptable.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that early exposure to pornography \npresents a disturbing psychological threat to children and a disturbing \nphysical threat. However, there is a darker and even more ominous \nthreat, for research has established a direct link between exposure and \nconsumption of pornography and sexual assault, rape, and molesting of \nchildren.\n  As stated in a publication called, ``Aggressive Erotica and Violence \nAgainst Women,'' virtually all lab studies established a causal link \nbetween violent pornography and the commission of violence. This \nrelationship is not seriously debated any longer in the research \ncommunity. What is more, pedophiles will often use pornographic \nmaterial to desensitize children to sexual activity, breaking down \ntheir resistance in order to sexually exploit them.\n  A study by Victor Cline found that child molesters often use \npornography to seduce their prey, to lower the inhibitions of the \nvictim, and as an instruction manual. Further, a W.L. Marshal study \nfound that ``87 percent of female child molesters and 77 percent of \nmale child molesters studied admitted to regular use of hard-core \npornography.''\n  Mr. President, all you have to do is pick up the telephone and call \nthe FBI, ask their child exploitation task force about the volume of \nover-the-Internet attempts to seduce, abuse, and lure children into \npornography and sexual exploitation.\n  I could go on and on, Mr. President, citing these studies, but there \nis really no need to do that. The evidence is clear. The compelling \ninterest of the Government in restricting children's access to \npornography is beyond credible dispute, both morally and legally.\n  The Communications Decency Act is a narrowly tailored law, designed \nto protect children from the pornography that is so widely available \nand easily accessed on the Internet. As I have said, it is a simple \nextension of the constitutional restrictions on such material that \nexist today in every other communications medium in our society.\n  The Communications Decency Act provides for the prosecution of those \nwho utilize an interactive computer device to send indecent material to \na child or uses an interactive computer device to display indecent \nmaterial in a manner easily accessible to a child.\n  In addition, the Communications Decency Act encourages blocking \nsoftware and other technologies by providing good-faith defenses \ndesigned to protect the good Samaritan attempting to block or screen \npornographic material.\n  However, ultimately, it preserves the constitutionally established \nprinciple that pornography should be walled off from our children. To \noverturn the Communications Decency Act would represent a fundamental \nshift in paradigm, throwing our children into a hostile sea of \npornography that threatens their psychological and physical well-being. \nI am confident that the Court will not be so callous with the basic \nwell-being of our children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of organizations \nin support of this brief to the Supreme Court in the case of Janet \nReno, et al. versus American Civil Liberties Union, et al. be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Brief Amici Curiae of Enough Is Enough, the Salvation Army, \n     National Political Congress of Black Women, Inc., the \n     National Council of Catholic Women, Victims' Assistance Legal \n     Organization, Childhelp USA, Legal Pad Enterprises, Inc., \n     Focus on the Family, the National Coalition for the \n     Protection of Children and Families (and other amici . . . ) \n     in support of appellants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2308-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2309-S2311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CPI ADJUSTMENT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to call the attention of the Senate \nto an article that appeared in the March 13 edition of the Washington \nPost, headlined, ``President Won't Back CPI Panel.'' This article \ndiscusses President Clinton's decision to not go forward with \nestablishing an independent panel to examine the cost-of-living \nadjustments for Social Security and other Federal benefits. I think \nthat is an unfortunate development because, clearly, there is \nbipartisan support for that effort. Members of both the Republican and \nDemocrat Parties are on record and have made public statements saying \nthat they believe this effort ought to go forward, whether it is an \neffort undertaken by a commission, or whether it is something that we \nengage in ourselves or ask the executive branch to do by Executive \norder.\n  Clearly, we are faced with a situation where we have to step forward, \nto lead, to address one of the most fundamental of all structural \nreforms necessary to curb the unchecked growth of entitlements.\n  Beginning with his State of the Union Address, the President has been \ntelling the Congress and the American public of his desire to sit down \nand work out a solution to the coming entitlement crisis, and we have \nresponded on our side by saying that we are willing to do this. In \nfact, in our budget last year, we recommended and voted for doing this. \nBut now it seems obvious that, for some reason, the administration, the \nPresident and his party--and, frankly, a number of interest groups who \nhave so much influence among those who oppose entitlement reform--plan \nto return to the same kind of rhetoric on Medicare and Social Security, \nand the same political tactics that serve to undermine the very health \nof the programs that they purport to protect.\n  Well, we don't have to go very far, Mr. President, to find out what \nthe intention of the President and his party is in this regard, thanks \nto a former assistant to the President, Mr. Harold Ickes. In a pile of \ndocuments that Mr. Ickes recently submitted to the House committee \ninvestigating illegal activities at the White House, there was a \nrevealing memo.\n  Rich Lowry, of the New Republic, recently reported that a February \n1995 memo that Mr. Ickes sent to the President included ``a proposed \ndirect mail appeal to be sent by the Democratic National Committee over \n[the chairman's] signature, focusing on the Republican proposal to \nrecalculate the inflation rate, thereby reducing COLA payments on \nSocial Security benefits.''\n  The memo then goes on to provide a draft of the proposed letter \ngiving some insight into the scare tactics that have been the signature \nof the DNC, the President, and organizations like the AARP, which \nrefers to the CPI fix as ``a cowardly, back-door political gimmick to \ntake tens of billions of dollars out of the pockets of senior \ncitizens.''\n  This is familiar verbiage and familiar rhetoric. We have seen it now \nin campaign after campaign over the last decade. We heard it in last \nyear's Medicare reform debate.\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\n  The letter goes on to say, ``If the Republicans can force the Federal \nGovernment to lower its estimate of inflation, then they can \ndramatically reduce the cost-of-living-adjustments received by every \nSocial Security recipient in America.''\n  I ask, where is the bipartisanship in this statement? It is hardly a \nreference to what the President has been saying in terms of sitting \ndown and working together to address a very real problem. And it is \nhardly an indication of how we had hoped to move forward addressing \nsome of the serious problems in the Medicare trust fund and the Social \nSecurity system. One has to question how serious the President, and his \nparty, really are about meaningful entitlement reform if they intend to \ncontinue to frighten seniors rather than honestly addressing the \nproblem.\n  Mr. Ickes' proposed fundraising letter goes on to state, ``We cannot \nremain silent while the new Congress finances another round of tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest Americans by reducing the hard-earned benefits \nreceived by older Americans.'' The letter provides a preprepared \npetition to be sent to the then majority leader, Bob Dole, and Speaker \nNewt Gingrich saying, ``I am outraged at the Republican plan to use \nphony inflation estimates to reduce the Social Security COLA's of \nAmerica's senior citizens.''\n  So the question here is, Is the President of the United States \nwilling to step apart from the recommendations and rhetoric of his own \nparty? Is he willing to step forward and provide leadership, as I think \nany President should, particularly when not facing reelection, on one \nof the most fundamental problems that we have as a nation and agree to \na bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare \nfor the long run? In President Clinton's State of the Union Address to \nthe Congress, the President said, ``We must agree to a bipartisan \nprocess to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long \nrun . . .'' And Republicans, who had just been hammered to death over \nproposing that very same concept a year before, said, ``Well, the \nproblem is big enough that you are right. We ought to do that. Even \nthough we may have a right to feel pretty bitter about how that effort \nwas used against us electorally, we think it is important enough for \nthis Nation that we ought to go ahead. So we will reach out in a \nbipartisan fashion.''\n  So it is extremely disappointing to read here--I hope it is wrong but \nI think it is correct--that the President has abandoned his efforts at \nproviding leadership for structural reforms within the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds. But the President is not alone in his cynical \nattempt to scare our senior citizens.\n  I want to conclude my remarks by addressing another institution that \nhas undermined our ability to accomplish what everybody knows we need \nto accomplish. No group has played a more destructive nor a more \ndeceptive role in entitlement reform than the American Association of \nRetired Persons, known as the AARP. We know the AARP is that wonderful \norganization that only charges I think $8 to join once you reach the \nage of 50. I must admit I was a little shocked when I got my first \nmailing from the AARP. I think I was 45 when the first mailing came \nsaying you are approaching senility here, and you had better join our \ngroup. I said, ``I am not old enough for this. I thought retirement was \n65 and over.'' But the AARP has wisely, from a financial standpoint, \nreached down and convinced people that at the age of 50 and lower they \ncan take advantage of the benefits offered to the AARP. I am not ready \nto concede that I am ready for those benefits, although they are pretty \nattractive. For that 8 bucks you get access to all kinds of things.\n\n  But the problem is that on the issue most fundamental to the future \nof this country and to the future of senior citizens--Medicare and \nSocial Security--the AARP takes a totally disingenuous, plays a totally \ndeceptive role, a destructive role in terms of our ability to try to \npreserve those trust funds for future users and future beneficiaries.\n  We know that a train wreck is coming on entitlements. How do we know \nthat? We know that because the board of trustees that included, at the \ntime, three members of the President's Cabinet told us that this train \nwreck was coming. They told us that there is an urgent problem that we \nneed to address on a bipartisan basis. And they told us that we cannot \nbe prey to the political ranting and raving of self-serving \norganizations like the AARP. Robert Rubin, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Robert Reich, then Secretary of Labor, Donna Shalala, \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Shirley \nChater, the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Acting Principal \nDeputy Commissioner of Social Security, told us, ``Folks, there is a \ntrain wreck coming. You have your head in the sand. You are letting \npolitical demagoguery deter you from doing what you have to do. If you \nwant to preserve Social Security, if you want to preserve Medicare and \nthe benefits in Medicare, you have to get hold of this out-of-control \nentitlement process.'' We all know that.\n  Medicare part A is scheduled to be bankrupt--bankrupt--by the year \n2002. The Social Security trust fund will begin running a deficit at \n2013 and collapse by 2029.\n  That is not political rhetoric. Those are the conclusions of a \ndistinguished panel of trustees that studied the system. And it comes \nout of this administration. It is not a group of Republican \nconservatives trying to kneecap the Social Security system. These are \nresponsible people appointed by the President to serve on this panel. \nThey are his own people. Yet, we go careening from election to election \ntotally ignoring these warnings, knowing that somebody is going to have \nto pay an enormous price in the future, knowing that we are undermining \nthe very system that we say we are trying to preserve.\n  And the group that is most responsible for putting pressure on us, \npolitically demagoging this issue, is the American Association of \nRetired Persons. They continue to tell their members that there is \nnothing wrong with Social Security, that there is nothing wrong with \nMedicare, that there is no crisis. They continue to press Congress to \nblock any solution. The AARP, the second-largest nonprofit organization \nin America, second only to the Catholic church, has a staff of 1,700 \npeople funded by the dues of 33 million members along with $191 million \nin profits earned through the sale of insurance policies, mutual funds, \nmail-order pharmaceuticals, automobile rentals, automobile club \nmemberships, Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and hotel room discount \npackages, and so forth. That is OK. I am glad they are in that \nbusiness. I am glad they are providing those benefits to the seniors. \nTheir expressed purpose is to serve the needs and interests of our \nNation's elderly.\n  But, Mr. President, the only thing we hear up here from the AARP, \nother than requests for membership dues, is, if we dare even speak \nabout addressing the problems of Medicare and Social Security, they are \ngoing to go after us politically.\n  Now we have this looming disaster with Medicare and Social Security. \nOnce again, the AARP is joining hands with those who oppose the system \nto terrorize our Nation's seniors.\n  In a recent Insight magazine article, Horace Deets, the AARP's \nexecutive director, is quoted as saying: ``Social Security has worked \nwell for 60 years, and there is no reason to believe that it is on the \nverge of bankruptcy . . . Social Security continues to work efficiently \nand effectively . . . Social Security does work.'' Where has Mr. Deets \nbeen? What does this man read? Has he read the trustees' report? Has he \nread this impressive document that has looked into this on an \nactuarially sound basis? Has he read the recommendations and \nconclusions that the whole thing is to come a cropper, that the very \npeople he represents are going to be hurt badly unless we do something \nnow, that we are heading for a train wreck?\n\n  I think maybe Mr. Deets should spend less time trying to collect dues \nfrom people and take a little time to read the trustees report on the \nfuture of Social Security and join us in a responsible effort which the \ntrustees say will hurt less if we do it now, but is going to hurt \ngreatly if we wait until later.\n  We cannot afford to wait. We cannot afford to pretend there is \nnothing wrong when everybody knows that is not the case. The changes we \nmake\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nnow could be phased in over a period of time and would have minimal \nimpact. But if we wait and follow Mr. Deets' advice, keep our head in \nthe sand and pretend that there is no problem, it is going to come as a \ngreat shock and a great surprise to the 33 million people who rely on \ntheir AARP mailings when they find out that their own organization has \nled them down a blind ally, their own organization has sold them out, \nsold out to a political process that goes against the very best \ninterests of their members.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed by the action of the President. I am \ndisappointed but not surprised. As a recent Washington Post editorial \nstated, you believe this White House ``at your peril.'' With the AARP \ndriving the politics and the decisions of the President and his party, \nI am sure we can anticipate even more fear mongering on entitlement \nreform. But ultimately we are going to have to find solutions to these \nproblems. I fear that this difficult process will be made even more \ncomplicated by an unprincipled and a timid administration and a \ndeceitful and self-serving American Association of Retired Persons.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute to one \nof the U.S. Senate's most revered and remarkable Members. I speak of \nour senior Senator and our friend from Kentucky, Wendell Ford.\n  Mr. President, I should note on a personal level I was a law student \nin Kentucky when Wendell Ford was Governor of the State of Kentucky, \nand I developed a fondness and affection for him from afar as a student \nin that State at the University of Louisville many years ago. I had an \nopportunity to watch this man preside over State government in the \nState of Kentucky. He did a remarkable job. In those days I never \nthought, as I was sitting there as a student, that one day I would be \nserving in the U.S. Senate with him and calling him my colleague and my \nfriend. It is with bittersweet emotions and sensations here that I rise \nto recognize, as others already have, that Wendell Ford, as we all \nknow, has announced he will not seek reelection in 1998 and will be \nretiring from the U.S. Senate.\n  I say bittersweet because on the one hand I am confident that our \nfriend Wendell Ford and his lovely wife Jean will enjoy some years of \nretirement, away from the hectic life of public service. So I am glad \nfor him and glad for his wife and for his family. Obviously, on another \nlevel, I think all of us would agree, regardless of political \npersuasion or ideology, that we have come to develop a deep and sincere \naffection for Wendell Ford. He will be truly missed in this body.\n  Just this past Monday, as of course we all know, Senator Ford \nannounced his intention to retire from the U.S. Senate at the end of \nthis term, concluding what I think has been one of the most remarkable \nand distinguished careers in the history of Kentucky. Wendell Ford \nserved his fellow Kentuckians for the past 30 years, first in the State \nsenate of that State, then in the Governors Mansion, as I have already \nmentioned, and finally here in the U.S. Senate, where he has been a \nMember for the past 22 years. By the time he completes his term in \n1999, Wendell Ford will be the longest serving U.S. Senator in the \nhistory of the State of Kentucky.\n  Throughout my tenure as U.S. Senator, it has been my great honor to \nserve alongside this remarkable man. He has brought integrity and \nhonesty and a wonderful sense of humor to a body that is far too often \ndevoid of such characteristics. Although narrow and snappy sound bites \nand polished television appearances seem to garner the most attention \nin Washington, Wendell Ford stands in sharp contrast. As long as I have \nknown him, Wendell Ford never saw a television camera he didn't want to \nsimply walk past. As always, he is more interested in working behind \nthe scenes, crafting legislation, seeking coalitions, seeking \ncompromises. This is the essence of making the Senate function as a \nbody that requires that we get along and work together to seek \nsolutions that Americans look for.\n  Certainly Wendell Ford is capable of being outspoken and passionate \nand as resolute as any Member of this body, but he has also understood \nthere is a time for politics and a time for legislating and the two \nshall rarely intertwine, in his view. Throughout his career, he \nremained true to the people and places of his beloved Kentucky. Few \nSenators fought harder for their States than Wendell has. As a Member \nof the subcommittee on aviation issues, he helped bring two \ninternational airports to Louisville and northern Kentucky. During the \ndebate in the last Congress on the telecommunications bill, Senator \nFord sought to ensure that the interests of rural communities all \nacross America, such as those in his home State, would receive the \nattention that they deserve. On a national level as well, he has been a \nleader in aviation, energy, campaign finance issues, and his efforts \nhave been instrumental in expanding airport improvement programs and \nother critical civil and Federal aviation issues.\n  As chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing, Senator Ford has \nhelped cut millions of dollars in Government printing costs. What is \nmore, he has spearheaded greater use of recycled paper by the Federal \nGovernment. These issues don't always get as much attention as they \nshould, but certainly, as all of us appreciate as we try to reduce the \ncost of Federal Government to make it more efficient, things like \nbringing down the costs of printing, which is voluminous at Federal \nGovernment level, and to also see that recycled paper is used, are no \nsmall efforts indeed.\n\n  I know the major issue for many Americans, of course, was Wendell \nFord's effort to spearhead motor voter registration, which has made it \npossible for millions of Americans to become enfranchised. He certainly \nwill be remembered for years to come for those efforts as well.\n  I know that bill had a special significance for Wendell Ford because \nit gave him a chance to appear on MTV's Rock The Vote. Wendell Ford is \ncertainly an MTV kind of Senator. As most of us would appreciate, I say \nthat with a sense of humor, to all who know and love him.\n  Most of all, I think Wendell Ford has brought a sense of quiet \ndignity and forthrightness to this Chamber. Always, he kept his word, \nnever betrayed a confidence, and I doubt there is a Member of this \nChamber who will not miss his presence.\n  It is worth noting, the other day an editorial in the Lexington \nHerald-Leader, I think, summed up the feelings all of us would have \nwith the announcement that Wendell Ford will not be with us at the end \nof this Congress. Let me quote that editorial. It said:\n\n       We have known people who have disagreed with Wendell Ford. \n     We have seen people get mad at Wendell Ford. We have even \n     heard of people who wish Wendell Ford would finally lose an \n     election. We have never heard of anyone, however, who doesn't \n     like the senior Senator from Kentucky.\n\n  Certainly if that is true in the State of Kentucky, it is true in the \nU.S. Senate as well. We will miss him and we wish him and his wife, \nJean, the very best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2311-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2311-S2315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in his recent announcement that our friend \nfrom Kentucky, Wendell Ford, will retire at the end of the term, he \nsaid something very instructive and most of us may recall it. It was \nonly a few days ago. Those who love and know the Senator knows he never \nfails to be instructive in his uniquely witty way. The Senator from \nKentucky said one major\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\nreason he was not running again was because he did not want to spend \nthe next 2 years raising $100,000 a week. Those were his words, \n$100,000 a week to raise the necessary dollars to run for reelection in \nKentucky.\n  With that statement, Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky \ncaptured, I think, with crystal clarity, the essence of this debate \nover campaign finance reform. I think most of us would agree there is \njust too much money in our political system, and it takes far too much \nmoney for the average American to be a part of the political system. So \nI rise this afternoon to speak about campaign finance reform and what I \nbelieve we must do to fix our campaign finance system.\n  As my colleagues know, I just completed a 2-year term as the general \nchairman of the Democratic National Committee. I did not ask for that \njob, but, nonetheless, I am very proud to have been asked to serve in \nthat capacity, an honor bestowed on two other Members in recent years. \nThe former majority leader, Bob Dole, served as general chairman of the \nRepublican National Committee, and Paul Laxalt served as general \nchairman of the Republican National Committee.\n  My tenure as general chairman brings a unique perspective to campaign \nfinance reform. I wish to speak briefly about the Hollings campaign \nfinance reform constitutional amendment and the McCain-Feingold finance \nreform bill that is pending before this body.\n  I will also, as I said earlier, speak about the role of the Federal \nElection Commission in our campaign finance system and will introduce a \nbill shortly that I think will strengthen the FEC and enable it to do \nthe job with which it has been charged by the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, we have been speaking over the last few days about \namending the Constitution, and, like most of my colleagues, I am \nextraordinarily wary of constitutional amendments. I believe, as I \nthink most do, that our Constitution is a sacred organic document that \nhas guided our lawmakers and this Nation and protected our rights \nsuccessfully, by and large, for the past 200 years.\n  The citizens of this Nation have found it necessary to amend the \nConstitution only 27 times in over 200 years, 17 times since the Bill \nof Rights was written, and they have been wise, I think, in that \nrestraint. But more than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in what \nI believe to be a flawed decision by that Court, the Buckley versus \nValeo decision, that very simply, money equals political speech.\n  I have never quite seen the logic in that decision. I believe that \nthe poor woman next door who can only make a very small or no \ncontribution at all has just as much right to be heard as someone who \ncan make a sizable contribution, and, yet, obviously the voices have \ndifferent weight. So I do not believe we ought to necessarily assume \nbecause people can or cannot make a contribution that their voices are \ngoing to be heard with the same volume and intensity.\n  I am not alone in this assessment that the Buckley decision is \nflawed. Fifty prominent constitutional scholars led by Ronald Dworkin, \nand 24 attorneys general, believe the Buckley decision was simply \nwrong.\n  So, while money floods endlessly in our election system, the voice of \nthe average American too often is drowned out. My fear is democracy \nwill be the victim. I repeat, I am extremely wary of amending the \nConstitution, much less the first amendment, but I have come to the \nconclusion that there is simply too much money in the system and that \nour campaign finance troubles are so great that I think an amendment is \nwarranted in this case. Therefore, I am lending my name as a cosponsor \nand will be supporting the constitutional amendment when it comes for a \nvote before this body.\n\n  But I think we must also be realistic. The fact is that this \namendment is going to fail. There are not enough votes to carry it. I \nknow that, and I think the Senator from South Carolina does as well. \nThe process of passing this amendment would be a long and arduous one, \nif it is ever passed, and I understand that as well.\n  We simply cannot, however, let our democracy languish, in my view, in \nthe current campaign finance system any longer, much less until we are \nable to pass a constitutional amendment, which makes clear everyone has \na right to be heard regardless of how much money they have, how deep \ntheir pockets are. That is why I am a strong supporter of the McCain-\nFeingold legislation that has been the subject of much discussion over \nthe past several months.\n  One of the McCain-Feingold's great advantages is that it is written \nwith the Supreme Court's Buckley versus Valeo decision, in mind. Trying \nto avoid the assertions that have been made by many, and I believe with \ngood reason, they are concerned whether or not this bill would actually \npass constitutional muster. But I think Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold have gone out of their way to try and craft this bill in such \na way as to answer those concerns that have been raised by legitimate \nscholars of the Constitution and legitimate scholars of the Buckley \nversus Valeo decision.\n  The bill acknowledges, as I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, the \nconstitutional constraints laid out in Buckley, and it tries to fashion \na workable solution to most of our campaign finance problems, including \nthe soft money issue, within those constraints.\n  Since the opening gavel of the 105th Congress, the Senate and the \nHouse, and much of Washington--of course the media--have spent \ncountless hours discussing the fundraising practices that have been \nraised during the 1996 elections. Finally, a couple of days ago, the \nSenate finalized the budget and scope of the investigation into most of \nthese alleged improprieties.\n  It will be an investigation that will examine aspects of both \nPresidential and congressional elections, performed with a reasonable \namount of money, in my view, and within a reasonable amount of time.\n  Mr. President, you may recall, and others may recall, that I \nabstained during those votes. I did so not because I did not support \nthe investigation. On the contrary, I do support the investigation. I \nthink it is necessary. Rather, as I explained before the Rules \nCommittee last week, I did abstain in order to avoid any question about \nthe motives that I might have in casting votes on various matters that \ncould have come up.\n  As it turned out, we had only a couple of votes, and they were \ncarried unanimously in this Chamber. I could not have anticipated that, \ngiven the division during the consideration of the resolution in the \nRules Committee and prior to the consideration of it when it came to \nthe floor of the Senate. I did not want my motives to be impugned or \nsecond-guessed and decided, having served as the general chairman of \nthe Democratic National Committee, I would abstain on the votes \naffecting that investigation and that committee's work.\n  I am glad, as I said earlier, that an agreement has been reached \nunanimously, and I hope it will get us to the bottom of all of the \nalleged misdeeds that have been raised by everyone in this process, \nRepublicans, Democrats, and others.\n  That said, I think it is clear that while Americans want us to find \nout what happened in 1996, it is just as clear that they are also \nasking us to fix a system that led to the alleged problems that \noccurred in 1996. Indeed, Americans have been urging us for quite some \ntime to fix our campaign finance system, and I do not think we need to \nwait much longer or go through lengthy hearings to analyze the various \nproposals and ideas that have been suggested.\n  We need not wait for an investigation. We do not have to wait for the \nconclusion of a debate on a constitutional amendment. The McCain-\nFeingold legislation, I think, is the way we can do that, and I believe \nwe should do it now. Indeed, the questions raised during the last \nelection about campaign finance spending serve, I think, to highlight \nthe critical importance of the need for immediate legislative action.\n  Over the past 10 years, Mr. President, this Congress has spent a \ngreat deal of time looking at our campaign finance laws. Let me share \nwith you a litany of how much we have accumulated in terms of testimony \nand ideas that have come forward.\n  The Congress has produced in 10 years 6,742 pages of congressional \nhearings on campaign finance reform.\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\n There have been 3,361 speeches that have been given on the floor of \nthis body on campaign finance reform. There has been over 1,000 pages \nof committee reports on campaign finance reform. There have been 113 \nvotes in the U.S. Senate on campaign finance reform. We have heard from \n522 witnesses before the U.S. Senate on campaign finance reform. And we \nhave had one bipartisan commission established to examine campaign \nfinance reform and make suggestions. And yet, at the conclusion of all \nof that, Mr. President, we are no better off today than we were 10 \nyears ago on this issue.\n  So while I am certain there will be additional hearings this year, I \nwould urge those who may be interested in examining various ideas--I am \nquite confident the bulk of the speech and documents and hearings and \ntestimony already accumulated, the amount of evidence, I think, would \nprovide us with the basis for crafting legislation and answering the \nquestions that have been raised.\n  Survey after survey of Americans in this country indicates that \npeople believe our campaign system is in desperate need of reform. What \nis worse, the same surveys indicate that the American people's lack of \nfaith in the campaign system is translating itself--this may be the \nmost serious problem aside from the issue of campaign contributions and \ndonations--the most serious problem may not be that, as bad as that is, \nbut the lack of faith, the declining level of faith that the American \npeople have in our democratic institutions. For that is at the very \nheart of what is at stake here.\n  Some of our colleagues who oppose reform have said we need more, not \nless, money in politics. Well, Mr. President, we have gotten more. \nThere is no question about it--a fourfold increase in campaign finance \ndonations in just the past 8 years, from $220 million raised by both \nparties in 1988, to $881 million raised in 1996, a 73-percent increase \nover 4 years ago--a 73-percent increase in political costs since 1992. \nWhile wages rose 13 percent and education costs rose 17 percent during \nthat same period of time, the cost and expenditures of campaigns rose \n73 percent.\n  And what has all that money done? How has it paid off? One might \nassume, well, if we spent more money and more people are involved \ntoday, more people are participating, maybe it is worth it. That \nassumption is clearly wrong.\n  Last November, Mr. President, only 49 percent of the eligible \npopulation in the United States of America bothered to vote in a \nPresidential election. That is the lowest turnout since the 1920's, \nmore than 70 years ago. So while the dollar volume has increased, the \namount of ads have risen, and proliferation about people's points of \nview have certainly grown tremendously, we are watching an inverse \nreaction and fewer and fewer people seem to be participating in the \nprocess.\n  While there is a great deal of attention, obviously, in the media and \nhere on Capitol Hill on the Democratic Party's efforts to raise \ncampaign funds, I think it is important that we try to put this issue \nin perspective.\n  First of all, let me say at the outset, Mr. President, I think that \nmy party, the Democratic Party, made a huge error in 1993 when \nPresident Clinton was inaugurated into office. The Democrats were in \nthe majority in the U.S. Senate. We were in the majority in the House \nof Representatives. We should have passed, in my view, campaign finance \nreform, and we did not. I think those who wish to take us to task on \nthat issue are right in doing so. We made a mistake. And we missed an \nopportunity.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, the mistake should not be \ncompounded, in my view, by letting the succeeding Congresses go on \nwithout trying to come to terms with this issue. And if nothing else \ncomes out of the great attention to what happened in 1996, then maybe, \njust maybe, that as a result of the attention being paid to what \nhappened, we might finally get an opportunity here to come together and \npass some meaningful campaign finance reform.\n\n  But, Mr. President, I cannot resist in pointing out as well that when \nit comes to the question of dollars raised in these efforts, of course, \nin the last cycle our friends on the Republican side raised $549 \nmillion compared to the $332 million raised by the Democratic Party.\n  Second, of course, Democrats have long supported reform. Many \nRepublicans do as well. In fact, the lead cosponsor of the bill that I \nmentioned earlier, the McCain-Feingold, is a Republican. For those who \nmay not be familiar with our colleague from Arizona, John McCain is a \nRepublican, and Russ Feingold is a Democrat from Wisconsin. And yet \ndespite that, in the previous Congress we had 46 out of 47 Democrats \nsupport John McCain's bill along with Russ Feingold. But it failed to \nmuster the necessary votes to break a filibuster.\n  We had a majority of people here that were willing to at least bring \nthe McCain-Feingold bill to the floor, but you need, of course, a \nsupermajority to break a filibuster. We never could produce the \nsupermajority even to bring the bill up so the people could offer their \nideas and suggestions on how they might modify or amend the McCain-\nFeingold proposal.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved in these issues for some time, \ngoing back to 1979 when some of the first proposals were offered on \nlimiting political action committees. I count about 6 proposals that \nhave come up in the past 10 years or so, mostly in the mid-1980's, \nwhich I supported and was anxious to see come to a vote.\n  I am a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold bill and was when it was \nfirst introduced in 1995.\n  Let me quickly say about the McCain-Feingold bill, Mr. President, \nthis is hardly what I would call a perfect piece of legislation. I have \nnever seen one of those anyway, and this certainly does not fall into \nthat category either. And there are areas, clearly, where I think some \nchanges may be necessary.\n  But, in my view, Mr. President, it represents the best place to \nbegin. If our standard is going to be that we will not bring up \nlegislation unless it is perfect, then we would never bring up any \nlegislation. And so, McCain-Feingold, I think, ought to be the proper \nvehicle. It is the one that has garnered the most attention and \nsupport, and, as I said earlier, it does try to track very carefully \nthe concerns that were raised by the Buckley versus Valeo decision.\n  It is clear, I think, if we were truly and effectively to clean up \nour campaigns, we must provide the appropriate agency, however, with \nthe tools to do so.\n  Mr. President, we must give, in my view, the Federal Election \nCommission the power to promptly and effectively enforce the laws. It \nhas been suggested that we do not need new laws; we just need to make \nthe present ones work. There is some legitimacy in that. It is not \nentirely wrong.\n  We need also, I argue, to be able to enforce the laws that today \nprohibit certain activities. But I think one thing that was said over \nand over again last fall and this winter is, the very agency we created \nand charged with being the cop on the beat when it comes to campaign \nfinance reform is basically a toothless tiger. We created an agency and \nthen deprived it of the tools and the resources necessary to do the \nvery policing that ought to be done to help try and avoid some of the \nproblems that some have suggested have occurred, in this past campaign.\n  Over the past few years, the sheer number of cases, Mr. President, \nthat the FEC has dealt with is growing, and the growing complexity of \ncampaign laws and a series of counterproductive court cases are making \nit increasingly difficult for the Federal Election Commission to \nfulfill, in my view, its watchdog role in a timely and effective \nmanner.\n  I sat through the testimony of the FEC before the Rules Committee a \nfew weeks ago, Mr. President. I was shocked to learn, for instance, the \ntremendous backlog in the caseload at the Federal Election Commission \nand the sharp increase in the activity that the Federal Election \nCommission has been asked to oversee.\n\n  At the end of December, the FEC had a total caseload of 361 cases. \nBecause of reductions in staff, only 112 of those cases are active, \ncompared to 160 active cases in 1995.\n  And the case filed in October, I might point out, by the Democratic \nNational Committee, in which the Democratic National Committee asked \nthe FEC to investigate its campaign fundraising in\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nthe 1996 elections--I might point out, even before the election had \noccurred--I discovered has not even begun yet. Here we are in the \nmiddle of March, and a request was made in October to look at \nallegations involving the Democratic National Committee has not even \nbegun. That was prior to the election, and they have not even begun to \nlook at the issues because they lack enough staff to do so.\n  Here is the body and the organization, the agency, as I said earlier, \nthat is the cop on the beat, and they have not even begun to look at \nthe questions that were raised last fall.\n  Add to that heavy 1996 workload of regular cases, Mr. President: In \n1996, the FEC was asked to examine 33 percent more complaints than it \ndid in 1994.\n  Congressional spending in 1996 general elections was $626.4 million--\njust the congressional elections here--$626.4 million. That was an \nincrease of about 7 percent since 1994 levels, 2 years earlier. It was \nthe FEC that had to oversee this spending.\n  And an unprecedented $2.5 billion in financial activity was reported \nto the Commission in 1996.\n  In my view, Mr. President, a restructuring and strengthening of the \nFederal Election Commission is long overdue. That is why today, Mr. \nPresident, I will be introducing Federal Election Commission \nimprovement legislation.\n  I have not written an aggressive or radical proposal to overhaul the \nFEC. Rather, this bill stands as a modest effort to give the FEC the \nresources and the authority it needs to properly enforce our campaign \nfinance laws.\n  Because, Mr. President, I so strongly support the FEC improvement \nprovisions in the McCain-Feingold bill, the proposed legislation I will \noffer shortly simply repeats them. I also add a few other provisions of \nmy own.\n  I have heard numerous colleagues say over and over again, campaign \nfinance reform is not the issue in 1997.\n  It is the illegalities of 1996 that many say must be the issue. Yet, \nat the same time as they make that assertion, we hear that they are \nagainst funding and providing the authority to the very agency that \nshould be the first one to uncover and punish any wrongdoing.\n  If we are serious about enforcing the law, Mr. President, then the \nbill I introduce today deserves serious and, I hope, favorable \nconsideration by my colleagues. The Federal Election Commission has \nbeen called a toothless tiger, and it is; an ineffectual agency, and it \nis; a monument to congressional paralysis, and it is. It is time to \nchange it.\n  My bill authorizes full funding for the FEC, including a $1.7 million \nsupplemental fiscal year 1997 appropriation to enable the Commission to \nhandle this increased workload that I have enumerated.\n  And to satisfy our friends who have said that we must try and get as \nmuch reporting and disclosure as soon as possible, this legislation \nalso requires electronic filing. Increased disclosure is the magic \nelixir, some have suggested, so by mandating electronic filing at the \nFederal Election Commission for all Federal candidates' reports, we \nwould ensure that disclosure reports are available in a timely fashion. \nToo often the reports become available weeks and months after the \nelection is all over with. Electronic filing would allow you to know \ninstantaneously exactly where the campaign contributions are coming \nfrom prior to an election, on a timely basis during a campaign. Today \nthe technology exists to do it. This legislation would require, \nmandate, electronic filing by all candidates for Federal office.\n  Furthermore, the legislation would allow the FEC to establish \nstandard fines for minor reporting violations and conduct random \ncampaign audits. That had been stopped and prohibited. Nothing, I \nthink, would have a more salutary effect on campaigns than to know that \nyou could be the subject of a random audit at any time. This, I think, \nwould help strengthen the FEC's ability to report to the Congress on \nthe kinds of practices that ought to give us concern, and possibly the \nsubject of further reform.\n  I think we must acknowledge, Mr. President, that the Federal \nElections Commission was charged with the responsibility of enforcing \nour election laws, and that part of the reason our election system is \nso out of control is that Congress, in my view, has refused over the \nyears to provide the FEC with the ability and the tools to carry out \nthe duties that we have charged them with performing.\n  As we rush to establish Federal investigations into election law \nviolations, let us not forget we do have an Agency balanced with \nDemocrats and Republicans that is charged with the very responsibility \nwe have just taken upon ourselves.\n  In my view, Mr. President, the FEC must be given the ability to do \nits job, and that is the goal of the legislation I will be proposing.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, by adding that genuine campaign finance \nreform will not occur it we do not elevate the issue above \npartisanship. It is not a Democratic or Republican issue. As I \nmentioned earlier before the Presiding Officer arrived in the Chamber, \nI think the Democrats made a huge error in 1993 and 1994 when we had an \nopportunity to do something about campaign finance reform. The \nPresiding Officer was a Member of the House of Representatives in those \nyears, and so we are properly criticized, in my view, for not acting.\n  Having said that, I do not think we need to necessarily perpetuate \nthat by not stepping forward in these coming weeks and try to take \nsteps to strengthen the FEC, pass McCain-Feingold with whatever \namendments people want to offer, and try to provide some framework. I \nthink there are issues which we will find great unanimity of support, \ngiven the chance for expression here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nobviously while going forward with the investigation, and to allow the \nJustice Department and others to do the work, of course, which they are \ncharged with doing. All of these efforts, if done properly and well, I \nthink, can at the end of the day, provide us with a different system \nthan we presently have.\n\n  So the future Wendell Fords of this body who, when they consider \nwhether or not they ought to seek reelection, as he announced in his \nstatement, would not look at the prospect in March, as many as 18, 20 \nmonths before election day, of raising, as he felt he would have to do, \n$100,000 a week for 80 weeks in order to be a viable candidate for a \nState the size of Kentucky--not to mention, of course what it costs in \nother States like my colleague from Pennsylvania, or California, New \nYork, Florida, Illinois, or Ohio. In large States with huge \npopulations, these numbers become astronomical. If it is going to take \nthat on the part of individual candidates, then, I think, obviously the \nresults speak for themselves.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. I am going to \nsend to the desk and ask that this bill be reported to the appropriate \ncommittee to strengthen the Federal Election Committee so it can do its \njob. I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be referred to the appropriate \ncommittee.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had come to the Senate Chamber to speak \non the resolution on the independent counsel but on my way I noted the \nmorning press have comments to make in advance of that. However, before \nmy distinguished colleague from Connecticut leaves, I agree with him on \nsome of what he has said. I will not go into the parts where I disagree \nwith him. It would take too long.\n  When he talks about the Federal Election Commission, strengthening \nthe Federal Election Commission, funding adequately the Federal \nElection Commission, I think that is something that ought to be done. \nThe Federal Election Commission needs to be able to pursue alleged \nelection violations. They have very broad powers and we have heard very \nlittle from them. It may be that their investigations are yet \nincomplete. But it also may be that if they had sufficient \ninvestigative resources they might have done more already.\n  We do not need to await the results of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, on which I serve. We are just getting started with the \nfunding authorization. Nor do we need to await the results of the \npublic integrity section, the FBI or their investigations, nor do\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nwe need to wait to see what will happen with the independent counsel, \nas I will address in a few moments.\n  We have a Federal Election Commission, and were they strong enough \nthey could have acted already on these very, very important matters.\n  Mr. DODD. I made the point last October when the allegations arose \nabout the Democratic National Committee, Don Fowler, who is the chair \nof the DNC, and myself, asked the FEC to immediately conduct an \ninvestigation into these allegations.\n  The FEC came before the Rules Committee a couple of weeks ago to \npresent its budget, as they do on an annual basis. I asked them how the \ninvestigation was going. This was now March. I was stunned to have them \nreport they have not even begun to look at this.\n  So here is a request made 6 months ago on, obviously, a very serious \nmatter, and they have not even begun to work on it. The reason, they \nsay, is the caseload is backed up so much on them and there has been a \nreduction in their staff allocations. Now, obviously, more probing \nabout that may be necessary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Did the Senator make a suggestion that they might look \nupon the current matters on a priority basis? I had not known of the \nrequest which was made, obviously. It is surprising to me that in light \nof the pressing public policy on current matters that they would not \naddress them but would be addressing other matters.\n  Mr. DODD. That is a good point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is a matter of prioritizing. We have a hemorrhaging \nsystem. There is blood on the floor and there is blood coming out of \nthe patient. I would think as a matter of priority they would at least \naddress that and try to give some first aid. I do not know what they \nhave found, and I do not know the specifics upon what injunctive relief \nthey might seek, but they have attorneys that might look at the current \nsystem and act now.\n  They are a constituted agency and they have conducted criminal \ninvestigations. They could work this in the civil field. It comes as a \nsurprise to me when a Senator of your standing, Senator Dodd, makes \nthat suggestion to them, and months go by without any response to it.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague, Mr. President, for his observations. \nI do not think I asked that question because I think I was so stunned \nby the response, I assumed things were moving along. I do not know how \nthey determine--of course, it is a bipartisan Commission--how they \ndetermine what basis they look at matters, but I do not disagree.\n  My colleague has been generous in his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2311-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2315-S2316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A TRAGEDY IN JORDAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I came to address the subject of \nindependent counsel and, en route, I picked up the morning newspapers. \nI am horrified by what has occurred in Jordan. The headline is blaring: \n``Jordan Soldier Kills Seven Israeli Schoolgirls.''\n  The lead report from the Philadelphia Inquirer is:\n\n       A group of Israeli schoolgirls was standing on Peace Island \n     yesterday, overlooking the Jordan River and fields of wild \n     yellow flowers, when a Jordanian soldier opened fire with an \n     assault rifle, killing seven students. Six other pupils were \n     wounded, as girls dove into the bushes and screamed for help.\n\n  After seizing a comrade's M-16 rifle, the soldier fired from an \nobservation tower, then descended and chased the screaming junior high \nschool girls down a hill firing wildly.\n  According to a report in the Washington Post, Rosa Himi, a teacher of \nthe Orthodox Jewish school in Beit Shemesh, near Jerusalem, that the 51 \nstudents attended said:\n\n       At the beginning, Jordanian soldiers didn't overpower him \n     and didn't do anything. . .. They even pushed one of our \n     teachers and wouldn't let him near the injured girls to care \n     for them. It is only when he failed to put his second \n     [ammunition] clip in the gun that the other soldiers took \n     him.\n\n  It is really a very shocking turn of events, Mr. President, in \ncircumstances where one would almost think we were beyond the point of \nbeing shocked. There is a sequence of violence that has occurred--\ncandidly, with both sides--like the event at the tomb of Abraham some \ntime ago, where an Israeli fired on people. I suggest that it really \nrequires a new level of sober examination as to what is going on in the \nMideast and what the so-called ``leaders'' in the Mideast are doing \nwhich is really inflammatory. King Hussein had sent a letter to Prime \nMinister Netanyahu, saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu was engaged in \nthe deliberate humiliation of Arabs and was accumulating tragic \naccidents leading to bloodshed and disaster brought about by fear and \ndespair. There have already been suggestions from a number of quarters \nthat King Hussein was inciting a riot by those inflammatory statements.\n  I think it is inappropriate to join that chorus. But I do think that \nKing Hussein and others have to tone down the rhetoric and have to be a \nlot more thoughtful than they have been. I know King Hussein--not well, \nbut I have had occasion to talk to him when he has been in Washington. \nI talked to him when I have visited in Jordan. I do believe that King \nHussein is sincere in his efforts for peace.\n  The morning press comments about the Crown Prince of Jordan coming to \nthe scene and that he was stricken with remorse and grief, as King \nHussein's statements issued after this tragedy reflected his own view. \nBut what is happening in the Mideast requires that there be more \nrestraint by people like King Hussein. That, of course, is easy to say \nafter the fact. But I think it has to be said.\n  We are now seeing a conference in Gaza, sponsored by the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization and Chairman Arafat, where the United States \nhas agreed to participate and Israel has been excluded. I joined a \nlarge group of Senators in writing to President Clinton yesterday, \nurging the President to change his policy on that. In my judgment, and \nin the judgment of many of my colleagues far beyond this Chamber, there \nis a strong view that there ought not to be a conference where Israel \nis excluded. There will be no peace process in the Mideast to which \nIsrael is not a party. For Chairman Arafat to convene a group of \nrepresentatives of nations of the world to meet and talk about the \npeace process, which will inevitably involve charges of impropriety by \nIsrael because they appear in the international media daily, without \nhaving Israel as a party to that process and allowing Israel an \nopportunity to reply, it seems to me to be absolutely inexcusable.\n  We ought not to be saying that parties in interest, like the \nPalestinians and the PLO, ought to be gathering international strength \nto attack, impugn, or otherwise move against a party to the peace \nprocess. If there is going to be peace, it is going to have to be \nworked out between the Palestinians and the Israelis. To have this kind \nof conference compounds the tragedy in Jordan, and I do hope, yet, that \nthe administration will rethink what it has undertaken to do.\n\n  I know that a good many of these issues come before the Congress, \ncome before the Senate, come before the Appropriations Committee, on \nwhich I serve, and before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, where we \nare asked to appropriate money. We are now about to be asked to \nappropriate additional funds. The Congress does not have the power that \nthe President has to conduct foreign affairs, although we do have \nconsiderable power in the appropriations process, the power of the \npurse. We are looking at requests for aid to Jordan. In fiscal year \n1997, we gave Jordan $67.1 million. In fiscal year 1998, the President \nhas made a request for $74.2 million, an increase of $7.1 million. \nJordan is also asking for an additional $250 million in funding per \nyear over the next 5 years. I have already been lobbied, individually, \nabout supporting that increase in funding for Jordan.\n  The initial reaction that I had goes back to Jordan's conduct during \nthe gulf war, where I and many others in this body, many other \nAmericans, and many others around the world were very unhappy--to use a \nvery mild term--with what Jordan did in aiding and abetting Iraq and \nIraq's President, Saddam Hussein. They were complicitous in helping \nIraq in that war, where American lives were laid on the line and \nAmerican lives were lost.\n  A GAO report in February 1992 found specifically that Jordan gave \nIraq access to American technology, that Jordan shared intelligence \nfrom the American-led coalition. When that happened, it seemed to me \nthat there were strong reasons not to continue to give\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nforeign aid to Jordan. Jordan was giving aid and comfort to Saddam \nHussein at a time of international crisis and war--a war which was \nauthorized on this floor in debate that I very well remember back on \nJanuary 10, 11, and 12, 1991--where notice had been given by the U.N. \nresolution that a war would be started on January 15.\n  So, speaking for myself on the Appropriations Subcommittee--and we \nmake the first cut on aid, and that usually stands up with what the \nAppropriations Subcommittee does--I have grave reservations about aid \nto Jordan, and certainly about increasing aid to Jordan. And now to \nfind the sequence of events in Jordan as to what has happened, and it \nfollows in sequence, King Hussein's statement, I think that we have to \nbe very reflective as to what aid and what American dollars we are \ngoing to give to Jordan.\n  One of the press reports contains a notation that a woman identified \nas the mother of the individual who fired the shots said that her son \nis mentally ill. Now, I don't know whether that is true or not, but I \ndo know that if there is an indication of that, it requires an \ninvestigation and a determination by Jordanian officials, and perhaps \nby an international group, as to why you have somebody identified as \nbeing mentally ill in a situation to acquire the firepower which led to \nthis tragedy. Those are all questions, Mr. President, that I think need \nto be answered.\n  When we look at the appropriations process, a commitment has been \nmade by the United States to give some $500 million to Palestinian \nauthorities. Senator Shelby and I offered a resolution which requires \nas a precondition to that funding that the Palestinians do two specific \nthings: No. 1, change their charter which calls for the destruction of \nIsrael and exercise efforts to stop terrorists. And I think, Mr. \nPresident, there is good reason to believe that the Palestinians have \nnot fulfilled those requirements. What the Palestinians did was have a \nconvention and say that everything in their charter inconsistent with \nthe declarations of September 13, 1993--when Chairman Arafat was \nhonored at the White House--would be null and void. But that is a long \nway from picking up the charter and specifically rejecting provisions \nof the charter which call for the destruction of Israel. This is \nsomething which Senator Shelby and I discussed with Chairman Arafat in \nJanuary 1996. This is something that Senator Brown and I discussed with \nChairman Arafat in Gaza in August 1995. And this is something which a \ngroup of Senators, including this Senator, discussed with Chairman \nArafat downstairs in the Capitol last week.\n  When these matters are called to Chairman Arafat's attention, he \nbrushes them aside. He pooh-poohs them. He says, ``Well, we have \nalready done all that needs to be done.'' And the reality is that they \nhave not done what the Specter-Shelby amendment calls for.\n  When it comes to the issue of fighting terrorism, I think again there \nhas been insufficient action. There are terrorists who have been \nidentified by Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authorities who have \nnot been turned over to Israel. I personally took a list of those which \nI had obtained and verified. I discussed them with Chairman Arafat. He \nhad one excuse after another why that was not done. There are weapons \nin Palestinian-controlled territory which are supposed to have been \nidentified and turned over. And that has not been done.\n  The President has certified that there has been sufficient compliance \nwith the Specter-Shelby amendment. The President can make a \ncertification. There is nothing that the U.S. Senate can do about that \nshort of the appropriations process. But these are issues which I \nintend to bring to the subcommittee when we take a look at the moneys \nwe appropriate this year.\n  The President has great authority, but he cannot appropriate money. \nHe can veto appropriations bills, but he cannot appropriate money. That \nhas to come from the Congress. That has to come from the House and from \nthe Senate. When it comes to the funding for Jordan, or when it comes \nto the funding for the Palestinians, and we see them holding this \nmeeting this weekend, the President may think that is fine. If he \nthinks that is fine, he can send a U.S. representative. But if the \nappropriators disagree with him, if the Congress disagrees with him, we \ndon't have to appropriate money. That has to be taken into account by \nthe President when he sets U.S. foreign policy.\n  So I make those comments. It is really very, very sad what has gone \non, for the bloodshed of these seven girls and for the bloodshed which \npreviously has occurred. I believe that we need some sober leadership \nto defuse the situation and to understand that there are very, very \ndifficult problems facing the parties there. When Prime Minister \nNetanyahu takes steps that he has to withdraw a certain percentage from \nthe West Bank, and he does so after a closely contested vote in the \nIsraeli Parliament and the Israeli Cabinet, that is about as far as he \ncan go. When those actions are rejected by Chairman Arafat, and \nChairman Arafat gets aid and comfort from the President who criticizes \nwhat Israel did and from King Hussein who criticizes what Israel did, \nthen I suggest that those matters really have to be worked out by the \nparties, and not by long-distance advice from the United States, or \neven short-distance advice from Jordan. But we had better tone down the \nrhetoric.\n  We had President Mubarak this week in Washington. He met downstairs \nin the Foreign Relations room. President Mubarak gave some good advice \nto those of us who were listening. It is worth repeating. President \nMubarak said that the rhetoric ought to be toned down about Jerusalem. \nYou have declarations by the Palestinians that Jerusalem is the \ninviolate capital of the Palestinians and that the Palestinians are \ngoing to assert and succeed in that. And you have rhetoric at a high \nlevel by the Israelis saying that Jerusalem will be undivided and will \nnot be a matter for Palestinian influence.\n  What President Mubarak was saying is, let's stop the rhetoric. Let's \nstop the declarations which incite people in the area. Let's tone down \nthat rhetoric. And I think that is very good advice, indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2315-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2316-S2317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  APPOINTMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF \n                          ILLEGAL FUNDRAISING\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see my colleague, Senator Dorgan, on \nthe floor waiting to speak. So I shall not take too long in commenting \non the resolution calling for independent counsel, Senate Joint \nResolution 22. But I came here to speak on this subject, and I think \nthe time is past for independent counsel.\n  Independent counsel should be appointed where there is credible \nevidence that there had been criminal violations. You don't have to \nprove the case. Credible evidence is really a statement of prima facie \nwhich takes the case from the grand jury and on a fair evaluation as to \nwhat has occurred and what has been made public. It is my legal \njudgment, having some experience in the field, having been district \nattorney for Philadelphia for 8 years, and having served on the \nJudiciary Committee for many years, that we have long since passed that \npoint.\n  It is not a partisan issue. It is not just Republican Senators who \nare saying that. The same call has come on the other side of the aisle \nfrom Democrats. You have ranking officials who have been involved in \nfundraising in religious institutions which raise violations of Federal \nlaw in a fairly clear-cut manner. You have, again, ranking officials \nwho have engaged in campaign practices. Dick Morris was cited by the \nPresident himself as having identified the commercials. We know the \nPresident is bound not to accept additional money when there is Federal \nfinancing, which there was. And millions of dollars were raised, again, \non both sides. Those moneys were used to further the President's \ncampaign in 1995.\n  There is an issue about advocacy as opposed to the candidates \nthemselves. But that line, I think, has been crossed. Certainly, there \nis credible evidence which warrants an investigation.\n  The day before yesterday the Judiciary Committee dealt with a \nresolution on this subject. Yesterday, a letter was circulated, which I \nsigned, which was sent to the Attorney General requiring an answer \nwithin 30 days. She does not have to agree with the letter which was \nsent, but she does have to respond.\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n  Mr. President, we know what has been in the public media. We know \nthat an investigation has been conducted by the Public Integrity \nSection and by the FBI. The question is raised as to what that \ninvestigation has disclosed, which is known to the Attorney General. I \nbelieve we ought to have an answer from the Attorney General based upon \nwhat has been presented to her from the public record, and an inquiry \nas to what she knows from the confidential record that she is privy to.\n  When the grand jury investigates, those matters are secret. When the \nFBI investigates, those matters are not made available to the Judiciary \nCommittee. But we have presented a substantial body of material, and I \nbelieve we are entitled to an answer not only as to that, but a \ncertification, in effect, from the Attorney General as to what she may \nknow beyond what is in the public record, because that investigation \nhas been going on for a long time, and she is privy to what has \noccurred with the investigation of the FBI and with the investigation \nof the grand jury. I think we are entitled to a response on that basis. \nBut there is sufficient material on the record.\n  It is my hope that we will not have a filibuster on this resolution \nbut we will be able to take it to a vote. As Senator Dodd said at some \nlength about the filibuster against the McCain-Feingold bill, I broke \nparty ranks, as did a number of Republicans, in voting for cloture on \nthat matter. I am not satisfied with the McCain-Feingold bill, which I \nhave not cosponsored. But I do believe the matter ought to come to the \nfloor and that we ought to offer amendments. We ought to see if a \nmajority of the U.S. Senate is willing to pass campaign finance reform.\n  Similarly, on this resolution calling for independent counsel, I \nthink we ought to have a determination up or down as to whether a \nmajority of Senators agree with the letter which we sent over to the \nAttorney General calling for independent counsel.\n  I thank the Chair for sitting on this Friday afternoon when most of \nour colleagues have left town, and I will soon be returning to \nPennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a good many issues that come to \nthe floor of the Senate that cause debate between Republicans and \nDemocrats. Some are partisan, some cause great rancor, but there is one \nissue that ought not ever be a partisan debate. That is the issue of \ncrime and how we in our country address it.\n  I come to the floor today to speak about legislation I will formally \nintroduce on Monday on behalf of myself and a Republican colleague, \nSenator Craig, from Idaho. We have joined together to offer a piece of \nlegislation that we introduced in the last Congress. I think this bill \nmakes a great deal of sense, and I hope the Congress will consider it \nfavorably in this session. As a way of describing the legislation, I \nwant to address why I think legislation in this area is necessary to \ndeal with the issue of crime.\n  There are a lot of things in this country we can point to that \nsuggest our country is headed in the right direction. Our economy is \ngrowing. Some would like it to grow faster, but it is growing. We are \nnot in a recession. You can point to some pretty good things in our \neducation system. Not many people are getting on airplanes and leaving \nour country to go to college somewhere else. If you want to go to a \nworld class university, largely you would want to be in the United \nStates to do that. If you want to get good health care, you do not get \non an airplane to go elsewhere. The best health care available in the \nworld is available in most cases in this county. After doubling our use \nof energy in the last 20 years, America has cleaner air and cleaner \nwater than we had 20 years ago.\n  So you can point to a number of things in this country that give \ncause for great optimism. But in the area of crime, I at least, and I \nthink a lot of my colleagues and the American people, have a nagging \nfeeling about the lack of safety and security in our country, that \nsomething we are doing is not working, that we seem to be on the wrong \npath. I know that some people point to crime statistics and say violent \ncrime has declined. But when violent crime spikes way up and then drops \nmarginally, violent crime is far too high in this country.\n  Here is a crime clock. One major criminal offense occurs every 2 \nseconds in our country, one violent crime every 18 seconds, one murder \nin America every 24 minutes, one forcible rape every 5 minutes in our \ncountry, one robbery every 54 seconds, one aggravated assault every 29 \nseconds. You cannot as a citizen of this country review what is \nhappening on our streets and in our neighborhoods and believe we are on \nthe right track with respect to crime.\n  This morning I read a piece in the Washington Post that described \nsome of the concerns I have expressed before in this Chamber. It says, \n``Inmates' Early Freedom Rankles Many in Florida.''\n  This article says: ``Frank O'Neal got the news that his brother's \nmurderer was being given an early release from prison when his son read \nit in the Tuesday edition of the local newspaper. All around the State \nof Florida, O'Neal's experience was repeated as corrections officials \nunexpectedly granted early release to 300 murderers, rapists, robbers, \nand other violent inmates.''\n  Florida required prison officials to grant inmates 20 days off for \ngood behavior, 20 days off for every 30 days that they served without \nregard to their crimes on the outside or their behavior on the inside. \nAs a result, 200 additional inmates will be released next Monday, and \n2,700 prisoners will eventually be set free early under this approach.\n  The fellow that Mr. O'Neal heard about yesterday was a man named \nGarcia. He stabbed William O'Neal, the brother of Frank O'Neal, 36 \ntimes. William O'Neal was a grocery store manager--stabbed 36 times \nbefore this fellow then stole a TV set and VCR and left him dead. Now, \nGarcia has been granted early release.\n  I have talked about early release previously. Some of the things I \nhave talked about have convinced me that the system itself is a system \nwhich just does not work.\n  A couple of weeks ago there was a District of Columbia police officer \nwho was murdered in Prince Georges County, MD. His name was Oliver \nWendell Smith, Jr. He was shot three times in the back of the head \noutside of his apartment. His wallet, pistol, and badge were stolen.\n  All three men now charged with this murder have long criminal \nrecords. One of them was free on bond on drugs and weapons charges and \nanother was on pretrial release for burglary and assaulting another \npolice officer. I have their records in this paper given to me by the \npolice department at my request. These are people who should not have \nbeen on the streets to murder a policeman. These are people who should \nhave been in prison. We knew who they were, but our country said go \nahead to the streets. In Florida, 2,700 criminals will go to the \nstreets.\n  I talked last year about the Jonathan Hall case. A man named James \n``Buck'' Murray was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for \nthe murder of Jonathan Hall. Jonathan Hall was a 13-year-old boy from \nthis area who was stabbed about 58 times and then left for dead in an \nicy pond. But when they found his body, he had grass and dirt between \nhis fingers because he obviously had not immediately died from all \nthose stab wounds. He, laying in that icy pond, had tried to pull \nhimself out of the pond but died before he could.\n  Now, let me tell you about the guy who murdered him. James ``Buck'' \nMurray, in 1970, was sent to 20 years in prison for slashing the throat \nof a cab driver, stealing a cab and leaving the driver for dead. While \nin a Virginia\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nprison, 3 years later, he abducted a young woman while on work release. \nHe was then convicted of kidnaping and sentenced to 5 more years in \nprison. In 1991, he was convicted of murdering a fellow prisoner and \nsentenced to another 10 years behind bars, and in 1994, he was set free \non mandatory parole with accumulated good time credits. A 13-year-old \nboy is dead because James ``Buck'' Murray, whom we knew to be a \nmurderer, was put back on the street to live in Jonathan's \nneighborhood.\n  I also have talked about Bettina Pruckmayr in this Chamber. Bettina \nwas 26 years old, by all accounts a wonderful, bright young woman, an \nattorney who came to the Washington, DC, area to work. On December 16, \na year and a half ago, she was abducted in a carjacking and driven to \nan ATM machine in Washington, DC, and then fatally stabbed. Authorities \ncharged 38-year-old Leo Gonzalez Wright with the murder. He was linked \nto that crime through a bank security photo taken at the ATM machine. \nHe was stopped apparently in a stolen Mustang some days afterward. Mr. \nWright should not have been on the streets. He was previously sentenced \nto 5 to 15 years for armed robbery, sentenced to 15 to 45 years to life \nfor murder, released on parole, then served 16 years on a 20-year \nminimum sentence even though his actual sentence was 20 to 60 years.\n  I want to show my colleagues a chart about why these criminals are \ngetting out of prison. It does not take Sherlock Holmes or Dick Tracy \nto figure out who is going to murder the next victim in our country. \nThe average time spent in prison for committing a murder in America is \njust over 7 years. The average murderer spends 34 percent of their \nsentence in prison, and then is released early.\n  Kidnaping? The average kidnaper spends only 40 percent of his or her \ntime behind bars and is released early. Robbery? It is 39 percent.\n  There is not a Member of the Senate whose life has not been touched \nby violent crime. My mother was killed in a manslaughter incident. I \nsuspect that those of us who have personally been touched by violent \ncrime never quite view violent crime the same way. For a family to \nreceive a call, as have the families of those I have just described, to \nbe told that their loved one is now dead in circumstances where you \nknow that death should have been and could have been prevented, leaves \nan understanding something must change.\n  I want to show my colleagues something that I hope will shock the \ndaylights out of everybody. We have, right now in prisons in America, \n4,820 people serving in prison in our country for murders they \ncommitted while they were on parole, having been released early for \nanother offense. In other words, our Government released murderers \nearly, to say, ``You are done with your sentence because we give you \ntime off for good behavior, so go back to the streets. We need to give \nyou `good time' for good behavior because if we do not give you that we \ncannot manage you in prison.'' So the prison authorities give a carrot \nof getting out early to violent offenders so they can better manage \nthem in prison, and then the question is: Who manages them when they \nhit the sidewalk? Who manages them when they are in the neighborhood? \nWho manages them on a dark block when they are prepared to commit \nanother murder? These 4,820 families of murder victims have every right \nto ask this Government, to ask every State government, every judge, \nevery State legislator, and, yes, the U.S. Congress, how dare you do \nthis? By what right do you have the opportunity to turn out murderers \nand rapists and robbers back to our streets?\n  The question is, what do we do about it? Can we, should we, will we \ndo something about it? I hope so. Mr. President, 4,820 people are in \nprison for having committed murders when they should have been in \nprison, 3,890 rapists committed rapes when they should have been in \nprison, and the list goes on.\n  What do we do? My proposal is very simple. By far, most of criminal \njustice is handled at the State and we do not control it. I understand \nthat these decisions are made by State governments and by State \ncriminal justice systems. But we have a connection to it by virtue of a \nwide range of resources that we provide to State criminal justice \nsystems.\n  I propose that we say to State that we want you to do the following, \nand the amount of resources that we provide to your criminal justice \nsystem depends on your doing it. We want you to decide that there is a \ndifference in the requirement to incarcerate violent versus nonviolent \noffenders. We want you to separate offenders, nonviolent and violent, \nand for violent offenders we want everyone in this country to get a \nvery simple message: If you commit a violent offense and you are \nsentenced to prison, prison is your address until the end of your term. \nNo parole, no good time, no nothing. Your prison cell is your address \nuntil the end of your sentence. That is what I hope will happen across \nthis country.\n  Until we get to that point, we are going to have stories as appeared \nin the Washington Post this morning--2,700 murderers, rapists, robbers, \nand other violent criminals will be released early because they have \nearned good time while in prison. Our country must decide to send a \nmessage to all Americans: If you commit a violent crime, you are going \nto serve your time in prison, and there is no excuse and there is no \nway out and there is no early out. You are going to serve your time in \nprison.\n  I have previously introduced legislation that also says to every \nState government in our country that if they had a violent prisoner \nbehind bars and then decided that, because it is too costly to keep the \nviolent prisoner there, he or she will be released early to Main \nStreet, to the sidewalk, to the side street--if that particular \nprisoner then commits another crime while out on early release, that \nState government has no immunity from lawsuits from the victims. That \nState government has a responsibility to keep that violent criminal off \nthe streets. If it chooses to put that violent criminal back on the \nstreets early, and that violent criminal commits a crime, the State who \nput the violent criminal back on the streets should have responsibility \nto the victims.\n  I must say, while I feel passionate about this issue because my \nfamily has experienced the tragedy of violent crime, I am blessed to \ncome from a State that does not have as much violent crime as many. \nNorth Dakota is a wonderful State in which to live. Oh, it is a little \ncold sometimes in the winter. Yes, it snowed yesterday, it is blowing a \nlittle today. But it is a wonderful State with wonderful people and it \nis blessed with a lower crime rate than some areas of the country. But \nwe are not immune. There is no State geographical border or boundary \nthat says violent crime stops here.\n  There used to be a wonderful woman named Donna Martz who would bring \nbus tours to Washington, DC. The tours would come here and come to the \nfront steps of the Capitol and they would always ask us, because they \nwere from North Dakota, to take a picture with them on the steps, and \nour congressional delegation would be delighted to do that. Donna was a \nwonderful and remarkable woman. On a Sunday morning, in a motel parking \nlot in Bismarck, ND, a quiet Sunday morning in a relatively crime free \ncity, Donna Martz was abducted, kidnaped, put in the trunk of a car and \ndriven through five or six States for a good number of days. She was \nlater discovered, dead, shot to death in the desert in the southwest \npart of our country.\n  From a motel parking lot on a quiet Sunday morning as Donna prepared \nto drive to her home north of Bismarck, she was instead kidnaped, put \nin the trunk of a car, taken on a ride of terror and brutally murdered.\n  By whom? By a couple of folks from Pennsylvania. Strangers to the \ncriminal justice system? Oh, no. People we knew were violent and just \ncouldn't keep in jail. Time after time after time, you look at these \nstatistics and understand that this is not some mysterious disease for \nwhich there is not a cure. We understand what is happening and we ought \nto understand how to respond to it. If we cannot send a message across \nthis country that those who commit violent crimes need to spend their \nentire sentence in prison--and I might say to judges around this \ncountry, I am also a little tired of the sentences that are handed out. \nI am a little tired of the slap on the wrist. I want violent criminals \nto be treated appropriately by judges. People who\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nare inherently violent and commit violent crimes ought to go to jail \nand spend a long time in jail with a sentence that is appropriate to \nthat.\n  It is unforgivable in this country that the average murderer, the \naverage person convicted of murder, is spending only 7 years in prison. \nThat is unforgivable that our criminal justice system allows that to \nhappen.\n  Again, we know what to do about that if we have the will. My friend, \nSenator Craig from Idaho, and I will introduce on Monday this \nlegislation, and I hope very much that my colleagues will join us in \nsaying this very simple message to all the States and all the people \ninvolved in the criminal justice system: Distinguish between violent \nand nonviolent offenders in our criminal justice system and say to \nevery American, if you commit a violent crime, understand that you are \ngoing to spend all of your time in jail until the day that your \nsentence ends, and you are not going to get an hour off early. There is \nno good time, no parole, no help, no hope.\n  How do we do that? We do that through the resources we send to State \nand local governments that reward those States that adopt that \nprovision, and, hopefully, State by State by State, we can develop a \nnational policy that says to all Americans that we have begun to draw \nthe line on violent crime, that we have sent a message to everyone who \ncommits a violent crime that things have changed.\n  Mr. President, I hope, having given this long presentation, that some \nin the Congress will cosponsor, perhaps even the Presiding Officer, \nhaving listened at length, will cosponsor legislation of this type, \nand, one by one by one, we will achieve enough cosponsors on a \nbipartisan basis to this bill offered by a Democrat and a Republican. \nOne by one by one, we will cosponsor, vote, and create a new law that \ndoes something good for this country.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2317-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Harry Truman once said, ``It is amazing \nwhat we can accomplish if we don't care who gets the credit.''\n  That kind of selfless leadership is not found much in Washington \nanymore. But it is the essence of my great friend, Wendell Ford.\n  Earlier this week, Senator Ford announced he would not seek a fifth \nterm in this body.\n  For me, the news is bittersweet. I know how much Senator Ford looks \nforward to spending more time with his wife Jean and their family. I \nknow how much he misses Kentucky, how much he simply just wants to go \nfishing with his grandchildren.\n  But I also know how much I will miss him and how much the Senate will \nmiss him.\n  It is one of the traditions of this Senate that we carve our names \ninside our desks. Carved inside Senator Ford's desk is the name of one \nof this body's towering giants, Senator Henry Clay, ``the Great \nCompromiser.''\n  It is fitting that Wendell Ford and Henry Clay should share the same \ndesk--not just because they are both sons of Kentucky, but because they \nboth understand that democracy requires compromise.\n  We can never compromise on principle. But we can--and we must--be \nwilling to negotiate details if we are to accomplish anything of \nconsequence.\n  That is one of many lessons I learned from Wendell Ford.\n  It is ironic that Wendell Ford comes from Kentucky, home of the great \nracehorses, because he is not a racehorse; he is a workhorse.\n  He has served the people of his State for more than 32 years as State \nsenator, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and now for the last 22 years \nas U.S. Senator. But he has always remained a public servant.\n  When he announced his decision not to seek reelection, Senator Ford \nsaid he loves this Senate as much as life itself.\n  The reason he loves it, though, is not because of the power or the \nglamour; those things have never really interested Wendell Ford. He \nloves this institution because of the history that has been made here \nand because of the potential that exists here.\n  The potential to help people.\n  To make the promise of America a reality for every American.\n  To include those who have been left out.\n  That is why Wendell Ford loves this Senate.\n  His great pride is not that he has sat with Presidents, but that he \ncan sit and talk with friends at every creek and in every holler in \nKentucky, and that Kentucky is better and, frankly, America is better \nbecause of his efforts.\n  He is truly a leader among leaders. We need more people like Wendell \nFord in the U.S. Senate today.\n  During his years here, Senator Ford has distinguished himself as a \nleader in areas from energy to aviation to election reform.\n  As chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, he \nhelped reduce Senate committee spending.\n  He has been a long and persistent advocate of a 2-year Federal budget \nto help this body look beyond the immediate and plan better for our \nfuture.\n  He was the chief force behind the creation of an independent Federal \nAviation Administration.\n  He was a prime sponsor of the motor voter registration bill which has \nbrought millions of new Americans into the electoral process.\n  He was the chief sponsor, in 1990, of a Democratic campaign finance \nreform package, and I fully expect him to spend the next year and a \nhalf working to make bipartisan finance in campaigns a reality.\n  As Democratic whip since 1990, Wendell Ford found yet another way to \nserve his caucus and his country. Whenever there has been a need, he \nhas stood ready to fill it. Every Democrat --indeed, every Member of \nthe Senate--has his or her own story to tell about how Wendell Ford has \nmade a powerful and positive contribution to this institution and to \nthe Nation.\n  On a personal note, let me say that Wendell has been a very special \nfriend to my wife Linda and me. He has been a constant source of \nwisdom, of strength and perspective. I must say, I could not possibly \nexpress the gratitude that I feel for the great blessing that that \nfriendship has meant to me now over all these years.\n  Years from now, when we are all gone from here, a new Senator will \nopen the desk now occupied by Senator Ford and see his name carved \nthere. He or she will be reminded not just of what this Senate was, but \nwhat it can be. As he looks at the names of Henry Clay and Wendell \nFord, and recognizes the greatness that that desk represents now, not \ncaring much about who gets the accomplishment credit but just who gets \nthe work done, they, as we, will thank Wendell Ford for his \ncontribution, for his vision, for his commitment to public service, and \nfor his friendship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide \ncongressional authorization for restrictions on receipt of out-of-State \nmunicipal solid waste and for State control over transportation of \nmunicipal solid waste; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n        THE STATE AND LOCAL INTERSTATE WASTE CONTROL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State and Local \nInterstate Waste Control Act of 1997. This bill will give our cities \nand States the authority they need to stop imports of trash coming from \nother States.\n  We have been working on this issue for 7 years. We have explored all \noptions. We have held hearings, debated the issues. The Senate has \npassed interstate waste bills in each of the last four Congresses. It \nis time we put this issue behind us.\n  Anyone who has kept up with New York State's decision to close the \nFreshkils landfill knows why we must act and why we must act now. As my \ncolleagues may be aware, the Freshkils landfill on Staten Island, which \ntakes all of New York City's garbage, is closing.\n  What does that mean? That means 13,000 tons of garbage a day, almost \n5 million tons a year, need a new home. It is hard to visualize how \nmuch garbage that is. What does it mean? It means about 1,200 trucks of \ngarbage a day coming out of New York City, every one of them packed to \nthe brim. Or, in other words, a convoy of trash trucks 12 miles long, \n365 days a year--imagine that, a convoy of trash trucks 12 miles long \neach of 365 days a year coming out of New York City. That is what that \nmeans with the closure of Freshkils landfill on Staten Island because \nthat garbage has to go someplace. Soon it will not go to Staten Island. \nWhere is it going to go?\n  We have no idea where these trucks will go. One thing is clear. New \nYork will have virtually no way to get rid of its trash when Freshkils \ndoes close in the year 2001. The entire State of New York can take only \nabout 1,200 tons of New York City's trash each day and that means the \nrest, over 4 million tons a year, must go out of State.\n  What's worse, as far as I know, New York has not taken any steps to \nbuild or to grant permits to new in-State landfills. I guess it is far \neasier to send trash out of State than to fight the not-in-my-backyard \nopponents blocking new landfills and incinerators in New York State.\n  I do not want to single out New York. Many other great cities have \nsimilar troubles. Trash disposal is tough. But many States have taken \nthe old adage ``it is better to give than to receive'' to the extreme. \nWhen it comes to trash, there is just too much giving and too much \nreceiving, especially when those receiving the trash have no choice.\n  The fact is every city should take care of its own trash if possible. \nNo city should be able to simply dump the problem on its neighbors. Yet \nthat is precisely what could happen. Why? That is because today no \nState or town can stop shipments of garbage from other States. They do \nnot have the authority.\n  A few years ago, Miles City, MT, my home State, faced the prospect of \nbecoming a dumping ground for Minneapolis, MN, trash. The 5,000 \ncitizens of Miles City had no say at all in whether a mega-fill \nlandfill could go up in their backyards to take care of garbage from a \ncity nearly 800 miles away in another State.\n  That is wrong. It is clearly wrong. It is unfair. Every town in \nAmerica should have the right to say no. But today they do not have \nthat right. And why is that? Every time a State law restricting out-of-\nState garbage imports has come up, they have been challenged in the \ncourts. The courts have\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\noverturned those State laws based on the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. So we need a national law to preserve this basic part of \nself-determination, that is, the right to decide whether or not a \ncommunity wants to accept out-of-State garbage.\n  The bill I introduce today strikes a balance that will work for every \ncommunity, for every State. It is very similar to the bill the Senate \nand House nearly passed about 3 years ago. The cornerstone of my bill \nis the new authority it gives to all States and communities to restrict \nmunicipal solid waste imports.\n  First, every Governor may freeze future imports of garbage at the \nlevel his or her State received in 1993.\n  Second, the bill makes it illegal to ship any new imports of \nmunicipal waste unless the local community specifically wants it.\n  Third, to reduce pressure on local communities, my bill gives large \nimporting States like Pennsylvania and Ohio the right to lower their \nimports.\n  Finally, some communities have built regional landfills and we \nrespect those agreements as well.\n  My bill is about returning decisionmaking back to the people, giving \npeople in importing States what should be their birthright, a chance to \ndetermine their own destiny.\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary of my bill, along with the text of \nthe bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to encourage \nrecycling of waste tires and abate tire dumps and tire stockpiles, and \nfor other purposs; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     THE WASTE TIRE RECYCLING, ABATEMENT, AND DISPOSAL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Waste Tire \nRecycling, Abatement, and Disposal Act of 1997. This is really a \nreintroduction of legislation I first offered in 1991 to address a very \nserious environmental hazard.\n  What is that hazard I am talking about? It is the very real threat \nposed by improper disposal and stockpiling of used tires. \nUnfortunately, the threat posed by improper management of used, scrap \ntires is as great or greater than when I first introduced this \nlegislation some 6 years ago.\n  The scope of the waste tire problem is enormous. Americans generate \napproximately--think of this--250 million scrap tires per year. That is \na tire per person in the United States of America that is disposed of. \nOver time, approximately 3 billion--not million, 3 billion--of these \ntires have accumulated in the surface stockpiles throughout our \ncountry.\n  These used tires pose real threats to the health and welfare of \ncommunities. They are places where water is collected, thus mosquitoes \nbreed, some of them encephalitis-carrying mosquitoes. They provide a \nhome for rodents. They are bad news.\n  The threats proposed by piles of tires are great also. Few things are \nworse as far as fires go than to have a pile of rubber tires catch on \nfire. These can start from lightning or they can start from acts of \nvandalism. Burning tire piles produce a dense toxic smoke and also \nproduce the oil byproducts that have gone into the making of the tires, \nand thus we have toxic hydrocarbon compounds. The hydrocarbons so \nreleased can soil the air, can soil the soil and, more important, can \ncontaminate surface water and ground water. Often the piles of tires \nand the fires that result can burn for months and cost millions of \ndollars to attempt to extinguish. Putting out the fire may just be the \ntip of the iceberg as there have been released enough toxic substances \nthat, as I say, go into the ground water and cause tremendous problems.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, the threat from tire piles is not just \nan abstraction. Smithfield, RI, is the reluctant host of a tire dump \nthat reportedly is the second largest in the United States. Estimates \nof the size vary, but the so-called Davis tire pile is thought by our \nDepartment of Environmental Management to contain 10 million scrapped \ntires. This tire pile is close to our reservoir. It is only 4 miles \nfrom the principal source of drinking water in our State, the Scituate \nReservoir. A major fire at the site could foul the reservoir through a \nfallout from dense soot and by contamination of the ground water \naquifers.\n  Nationwide, waste tires are still accumulating in large stockpiles. \nWhy?\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\n What happens? Where is the end of this? Well, why have the tire piles \ngrown? There are several reasons.\n  First, landfills are reluctant to accept scrap tires.\n  Second, the nature of modern steel-belted radial tires makes it very \ndifficult to recycle these into new ones. Once upon a time, old tires \nwere retreaded, as we all know. You cannot do that with radial tires.\n  The third reason is that the other markets for the beneficial reuse \nof this material have been slow to emerge. Scrap tires have some value. \nThey contain a lot of Btu's, more Btu's per pound than most grades of \ncoal and can be burned to produce electricity. Many folks operating \ntire dumps are hoping for higher energy prices so that there will be a \nwindfall for these scrapped tires. However, there is significant \nopposition to new waste combustion facilities across our country. There \nis a reluctance to have these waste combustion facilities in one's \ncommunity. So combustion seems now a less likely option to solve the \ntire problem.\n\n  And finally, where there are beneficial uses for scrap tires, the \nprocessors like what they call clean tires, ones that do not have dirt \nor rocks or gravel in them.\n  The waste tire management program that is contained in my legislation \nhas three purposes. What am I trying to do? First, to assure that scrap \ntires are managed in a way that reduces the risk of fires and spread of \ndisease.\n  Second, the bill would require the elimination of waste tire dumps \nwithin 4 years after enactment. It requires that the 3 billion tires in \nstockpiles across our country be recycled or burned or shredded or \nburied by the end of the year 2006.\n  And finally, the management program is intended to encourage markets \nfor recycled material from tires.\n  Now, all of this would take place as an amendment to the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act, so-called RCRA, with which we are \nfamiliar in this body and is already legislation for the Nation. The \ntraditional partnership program between EPA and RCRA through the States \nwill lead to implementation of this program. In other words, it is a \npartnership between EPA and the States. The bill encourages States to \nadopt a program to safely manage existing tire piles. The bill \nauthorizes grants to States to develop and implement State programs to \nmanage these piles of tires.\n  The bill will limit disease and fire problems. The fire threat will \nbe reduced by including specifications for the size and spacing of \nthese tire piles into smaller, more manageable units, separate them out \nso that if a fire does start, it does not spread to the entire dump of \ntires. It also requires provisions that waste tire dumps like the Davis \nsite in my State are closed and the scrap tires shredded and recycled \nand safely disposed of within 4 years of enactment. So this could take \nplace as soon as the year 2001. Other scrap tire stockpiles that are \noperating legally under a State permit will have until the year 2006, \nas I mentioned.\n  So all this is accomplished by imposing a 50-cent tax per tire, truck \nand passenger, on those manufactured or imported into the United \nStates. It just applies to new tires. I want to inform my colleagues \nthat this legislation, once enacted, will solve several solid waste \nmanagement problems. So I urge my colleagues to join in the support of \nthis.\n  As I noted earlier, Rhode Island is host to a site with approximately \n10 million of these tires. It has been called the most serious \nenvironmental threat to our State. Even after some 250,000 have been \nremoved in order to get at a Superfund site that is underneath these \ntires, a toxic waste disposal site that was then subsequently covered \nover by these tires, and even after the State removed some 1.2 million \nmore tires, there still will be 8 million tires left in this Davis \nsite. The threat posed by that is a very real one to my State, as I \npreviously pointed out. So I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation. It can prevent environmental disasters \nfrom taking place. As chairman of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, I will exert every effort to see that these bills become \nlaw.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut. He is very familiar with this because they have somewhat \nthe same problem, perhaps not in the same magnitude as we have in our \nState, and they have a tire-shredding program in Oxford, CT.\n  So, Mr. President, I send to the desk two bills to accomplish my \ngoal. One includes the tax, the other includes the cleanup efforts. \nAccompanying this is a summary of these bills.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the chairman of the committee leaves \nthe floor, I have been listening to his statement. I do not know how \nmany others you have as cosponsors, but I would like to be listed as \none.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are delighted.\n  Mr. DODD. This is one of the most serious problems we face, not only \nwhen there is stockpiling, but in other areas. I think most Americans, \nwhen they go by and see ponds drained down, know that one of the things \nthat always show up is tires. It is a real pollution problem, beyond \njust the collection in one site.\n  I think the Senator from Rhode Island has offered a very creative and \nworthwhile suggestion that all of America will benefit from, so I \ncommend him for the effort.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will ask that the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill and a summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Waste Tire Recycling, \n     Abatement, and Disposal Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States generates approximately 250,000,000 \n     waste tires each year with over 3,000,000,000 waste tires \n     stored or dumped in aboveground piles across the United \n     States;\n       (2) current waste tire collection and disposal practices \n     present a substantial threat to human health and the \n     environment;\n       (3) waste tire piles are a breeding habitat for disease-\n     carrying mosquitoes, rodents, and other pests and may be \n     ignited causing potentially catastrophic fires;\n       (4) there are substantial opportunities for recycling and \n     reuse of waste tires and tire-derived products, including \n     tire retreading, asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber, \n     rubber products, and fuel;\n       (5) although several States have established waste tire \n     recycling programs and disposal requirements to protect human \n     health and the environment, the efforts of individual States \n     are often frustrated by the lack of comparable programs in \n     neighboring States; and\n       (6) additional financial resources are necessary to \n     encourage waste tire recycling and proper disposal and the \n     abatement of existing waste tire dumps.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Any State can apply to run a program which meets \n     guidance. State programs must require permits for haulers, \n     collectors and processors. States must collect fees of at \n     least 50 cents for each new tire sold and use revenue to \n     manage programs. States must have a plan providing for the \n     abatement of all tire stockpiles. States must inspect sites \n     before permits are granted. Tire collectors must show \n     financial responsibility for abatement of tires stored (a \n     bond in the amount of approximately $1 per tire allowed to be \n     stored under permit). Permits must contain abatement \n     schedules assuring that all tire piles are abated by year \n     2006. States must have authority to order abatement of tire \n     piles. A tipping fee of $1 per tire is also to be charged to \n     vehicle owner upon removal of used tire.\n       EPA Program: EPA is to establish program for each state \n     which does not have one by the date three years after \n     enactment. EPA's program would be identical to a State \n     program.\n       Abatement Authority: EPA is given authority to order the \n     abatement of a tire pile. EPA also is given authority to \n     cleanup a tire pile and recover costs from the owner of the \n     site.\n       Public Lands: The head of each federal agency owning land \n     on which a tire stockpile is located is to develop an \n     abatement plan.\n       Enforcement: EPA is given enforcement authority equivalent \n     to that available under subtitle C of RCRA to take action \n     against any person violating these new provisions.\n       Section 4 requires EPA to publish a federal procurement \n     guideline for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber not \n     later than December 31, 1999.\n       Section 5 includes conforming amendments to RCRA.\n\n\n                       summary of tax amendments\n\n       Section 1 imposes a federal tax of 50 cents per tire on the \n     sale of new tires. The tax\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\n     would collect approximately $120 million per year and extends \n     for a period of five years.\n       Section 2 creates a trust fund to receive the revenues from \n     the new federal tire tax. The trust fund could be used to: \n     (1) make grants to the states; (2) establish shredding \n     capacity for newly removed tires; (3) abate tire piles on \n     federal lands; (4) purchase asphalt pavement containing \n     recycled rubber for federal projects; (5) finance abatement \n     at orphan tire collection sites; and (6) conduct research on \n     tire recycling technologies.\n       By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Leahy, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 447. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to give further \nassurance to the right of victims of crime to attend and observe the \ntrials of those accused of the crime, and for other purposes; read \ntwice and placed on the calendar.\n\n\n             THE VICTIMS' RIGHTS CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing and their families, as well as other victims of \ncrime, to introduce the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997. The \npurpose of this legislation is to clarify the rights of victims of \ncrime to attend and observe the trials of the accused and testify at \nthe sentencing hearing. I want to express my sincere thanks to Senators \nHatch, Leahy, Inhofe, Grassley, and Kennedy for their hard work in \ncrafting this bipartisan legislation.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have worked to ensure victims of \ncrime have equal standing under the law with those who have violated \nthe public trust. Progress has been made. The Victims' Bill of Rights, \napproved by Congress in 1990, guarantees that victims of crime may be \npresent at public court proceedings, providing that a victim's \nattendance does not materially affect his or her testimony. In 1996, as \npart of the antiterrorism Bill, I included a provision based on my \nCrime Victim Restitution Act, which entitles victims of crime to \nreceive full financial compensation directly from the criminal in the \nform of mandatory restitution.\n  Too often, however, the rights of victims are sacrificed or \nforgotten. The Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997 clarifies the \nintent of Congress with respect to the rights of victims to be present \nat trial and be heard during the sentencing phase of the proceedings. \nThis piece of legislation further demonstrates the bipartisan will of \nCongress to protect the rights of victims, as well as the accused.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victims' Rights \n     Clarification Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RIGHTS OF VICTIMS TO ATTEND AND OBSERVE TRIAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Rights of victims to attend and observe trial.--Chapter \n     223 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 3510. Rights of victims to attend and observe trial\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any statute, rule, or \n     other provision of law, in any trial of a defendant accused \n     of an offense, a United States district court shall not order \n     the exclusion of any victim of the offense from the trial on \n     the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing phase of \n     the proceedings--\n       ``(1) make a victim impact statement or present any victim \n     impact information in relation to the sentence to be imposed \n     on the defendant; or\n       ``(2) testify as to the effect of the offense on the victim \n     or the family of the victim.\n       ``(b) Definition of Victim.--In this section, the term \n     `victim' has the same meaning as in section 503(e)(2) of the \n     Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     10607(e)(2)).''.\n       (2) Clearical amendment.--The analysis for chapter 223 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n``3510. Rights of victims to attend and observe trial.''.\n\n       (b) Admissibility of Certain Evidence.--Section 3593(c) of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after \n     ``misleading the jury.'' the following: ``For purposes of the \n     preceding sentence, the fact that a victim (as that term is \n     defined in section 503(e)(2) of the Victims' Rights and \n     Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10607(e)(2))) attended or \n     observed the trial in accordance with applicable statutes, \n     rules, or other provisions of law, shall not be construed to \n     create a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or \n     misleading the jury.''.\n       (c) Effect on Pending Cases.--The amendments made by this \n     section shall apply in any case that is pending on the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join as an original cosponsor of the \nVictims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997.\n  One of the most important rights that we can safeguard for crime \nvictims is the right to be heard in connection with sentencing \ndecisions for the perpetrators of the crimes that changed their lives. \nWhen I was privileged to serve as State's attorney for Chittenden \nCounty, I tried to inform crime victims of the status of cases and to \ninvolve them, not only as witnesses at trial, but during the sentencing \nproceedings as well. Lawyers call this a right of allocution. To \nvictims, it is a right to be heard. A similarly important right for \nvictims is the right to witness the trial of the accused.\n  Congress has addressed a victims' right of allocution and right to \nwitness trials several times in recent years. In 1990, Congress passed \nthe Victims' Rights and Restitution Act, commonly known as the victims \nbill of rights. This legislation expressly provides that crime victims \nshall have the right to be present at all public court proceedings \nrelated to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by \nthe victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other \ntestimony at trial.\n  In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, \nCongress included several provisions granting victims the right of \nattendance at trials and allocution in sentencing hearings. For \ninstance, the legislation provides for a specific right of allocution \nby amending rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, thereby \nrequiring Federal judges at the sentencing for a crime of violence or \nsexual assault to address the victim personally if the victim is \npresent at sentencing and to determine if the victim wishes to make a \nstatement or presentation. The legislation also authorizes courts to \nhear victim impact testimony at capital sentencing proceedings, and \nrequires courts to determine if the victim wishes to make a statement \nor present any information in relation to the sentence.\n  Finally, last year, Congress enacted the Televised Proceedings for \nCrime Victims Act as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act of 1996. Responding to the difficulties created for victims \nof the Oklahoma City bombing when the trial was moved to Denver, the \nstatute was designed to provide a closed circuit feed back to the \nvictims and their families in Oklahoma City.\n  The Supreme Court has also ruled that victim impact statements are \npermissible in death penalty cases. In the 1991 case Payne versus \nTennessee, the Supreme Court said that a sentencing jury in a capital \ncase may consider victim impact evidence relating to the victim's \npersonal characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on the \nvictim's family. The Court made clear that it is an affront to the \ncivilized members of the human race to say that at sentencing in a \ncapital case, a parade of witnesses may praise the background, \ncharacter, and good deeds of the defendant, but nothing may be said \nthat bears upon the character of, or the harm imposed upon, the \nvictims.\n\n  Although Congress and the Supreme Court has made progress over the \nlast 20 years in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have more \nto do, especially with regards to a victim's right of allocation and \nright to witness trials. Although I spoke of the need to do more with \nregards to these issues last year when Congress enacted the Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act, this need was highlighted by the recent \ndistrict and appellate court rulings on motions in the Oklahoma City \nbombing cases. The courts ruled that the victims are categorically \nexcluded from both watching the trial and providing victim impact \nstatements. Thus the victims are faced with the excruciating dilemma of \nhaving to choose between attending the trial and testifying at the \nsentencing proceedings. If they sit outside the courtroom during the \ntrial, they may never learn the details of how the justice system \nresponded to this horrible crime. On the other hand, if they attend the \ntrial, they will never be able to tell the jury the full extent of the \nsuffering the crime has caused to them and to their families.\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\n  The law as it is, has been written by Congress and interpreted by the \nSupreme Court does not thrust this painful choice upon the victims. \nHowever, the recent district and appellate court rulings on motions \nreveal the need to clarify existing law. In this regard, let me specify \nwhat the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 would and would not \ndo.\n  The law would:\n  Clarify that a court shall not exclude a victim from witnessing a \ntrial on the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing phase of \nthe proceedings, make a victim impact statement.\n  Clarify that a court shall not prohibit a victim from making a victim \nimpact statement solely because the victim had witnessed the trial.\n  Just as importantly, the law would not:\n  Eliminate a judge's discretion to exclude a victim's testimony that \ncreates unfair prejudice, confuses the issues, or misleads the jury.\n  Attempt to strip a defendant of his or her constitutional rights.\n  Overturn any final judicial rulings.\n  The defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case have argued to the \ncourt that, despite the victims' rights laws, the court has the \nresponsibility to safeguard against any identifiable risk that emotion \ncould overwhelm reason when the victims provide their victim impact \ntestimony. According to the defendants, the only way that the court can \nmeet this responsibility is to provide the victims with the Hobson's \nchoice of witnessing the trial or providing victim impact statements. \nHowever, to paraphrase Justice O'Connor's eloquent statement in the \nPayne versus Tennessee case, the possibility that evidence may in some \ncases be unduly inflammatory does not justify a prophylactic, \nconstitutionally based rule that this evidence may never be admitted.\n  It is for this reason that I am joining my cosponsors to clarify what \nrights victims in this country should and do have. There is more that \nneeds to be done in this regard, but with this bipartisan legislation, \nwe are taking an important and timely step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2320-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 28\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 28, a bill to \namend title 17, United States Code, with respect to certain exemptions \nfrom copyright, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 101\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Wyden] was added as a cosponsor of S. 101, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide for the training of health \nprofessions students with respect to the identification and referral of \nvictims of domestic violence.\n\n\n                                 S. 139\n\n  At the request of Mr. Faircloth, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats] was added as a cosponsor of S. 139, a bill to amend titles \nII and XVIII of the Social Security Act to prohibit the use of Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds for certain expenditures relating to \nunion representatives at the Social Security Administration and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n                                 S. 235\n\n  At the request of Ms. Moseley-Braun, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Dodd] was added as a cosponsor of S. 235, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage economic \ndevelopment through the creation of additional empowerment zones and \nenterprise communities and to encourage the cleanup of contaminated \nbrownfield sites.\n\n\n                                 S. 317\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 317, a bill to reauthorize \nand amend the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992.\n\n\n                                 S. 370\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 370, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for increased Medicare \nreimbursement for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists to \nincrease the delivery of health services in health professional \nshortage areas, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 371\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 371, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for increased Medicare \nreimbursement for physician assistants, to increase the delivery of \nhealth services in health professional shortage areas, and for other \npurposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2331-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Energy \nCommittee voted to approve the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, S. \n104, which would establish the construction of an interim facility to \nstore spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste produced by the \nelectric industry and by the military.\n  As a member of the Energy Committee, I voted against S. 104 for two \nreasons. First, I think today's markup of this legislation was \npremature. Only 2 days ago the Senate voted to confirm the new head of \nthe Energy Department, Secretary Federico Pena. Clearly Mr. Pena hasn't \nhad an opportunity to fully examine this complex issue. He will need \nsome additional time to study S. 104 and offer his views and \nrecommendations about it. Second, I still have some concerns about \nwhether this bill will facilitate or frustrate getting approval for a \npermanent disposal site of our Nation's spent nuclear fuel.\n  Having said this, I want my colleagues to understand that I think \nthat this is an issue that needs immediate attention. The \nadministration and Congress must sit down to negotiate a final solution \nto this problem as soon as possible. I hope some compromise can be \nreached that will allow me to vote for this legislation on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2331-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2331-S2332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMERICAN INDIAN TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe American Indian Transportation Improvement Act introduced by \nSenator Domenici. I am an original cosponsor of this bill because I \nfeel strongly that the BIA and other Federal agencies must prioritize \nprograms which develop infrastructure on reservations, and that the \nCongress must match those commitments with adequate funding. I know \nfirst hand the desperate need for road improvement and repair on South \nDakota's Indian reservations, and I believe increased funding for road \ninfrastructure must be a national priority.\n  There are nine federally recognized tribes in South Dakota, whose \nmembers collectively make up one of the largest Native American \npopulations in any State. At the same time, South Dakota has 3 of the \n10 poorest counties in the Nation, all of which are within reservation \nboundaries. Unemployment on these extremely rural reservations averages \nabove 50 percent. Yet economic depression on rural Indian reservations \nis not unique to my State. I strongly believe that road infrastructure \nis an integral and most basic component to economic development for \nIndian and non-Indian communities alike.\n  Senator Domenici's initiative increases funding for reservation roads \nthrough the existing Indian Reservation Roads [IRR] Program. This \nprogram returns a portion of the gasoline tax, paid by every Indian who \nbuys gasoline, to Indian tribes for the design and construction of BIA \nroads. This bill also expands opportunities under the IRR Program and \nrelated ISTEA programs to improve the transportation system on our \nNation's Indian reservations, including bridge construction, transit \nsystems, highway enhancements, scenic byways, and Indian technical \ncenters.\n  In South Dakota, BIA proposed funding for 1997 is 24 percent lower \nthan 1996. Yet abysmal road conditions continue to worsen. There are \nnearly 8,000 miles of roads in my State, 1,156 miles of which are on \nreservations. Of these roads, 80 percent are in need of complete \nreplacement. Another 10 percent\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\nare in need of significant repair. Only 10 percent of all the roads on \nSouth Dakota reservations are rated in good condition. Road statistics \nlike these are repeated in state after state, and I believe immediate \naction must be taken.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill for a \nnumber of reasons, the most serious of which is health and safety. From \n1992 to 1996, the death rate on South Dakota reservation roads was \nthree times as high as the rate on non-reservation roads. Children who \nride buses to school are put at great risk as these buses travel over \ndilapidated road infrastructure, while ambulances and other emergency \nvehicles have to be routed around otherwise direct routes to and from \nemergency situations because of road conditions. The extra moments, \neven hours added to these emergency runs put human life in jeopardy. No \ncommunity in this country should be forced to travel on roads as \ndamaged and dangerous as those on reservations in my State.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that my colleague has \nrecognized the national need to improve roads in Indian country. \nSenator Domenici has developed this legislation in close consultation \nwith Indian leaders, and I am hopeful that the Senate will move the \nAmerican Indian Transportation Improvement Act forward as quickly as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2331-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SUSAN HOECHSTETTER\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSusan Nan Hoechstetter, a social worker with whom I have been \nprivileged to work with for many years. Throughout her 13 years of \nemployment with National Association of Social Workers [NASW], Sue \nHoechstetter tenaciously promoted the social work profession and \nadvocated for social policy that recognizes the responsible role of \ngovernment in assisting individuals, families, and communities to work \ntogether and address their common needs.\n  When Sue first began representing the interests of social workers \nbefore the U.S. Congress, very few Federal statutes directly \nacknowledged the significant role of professional social workers in \nproviding health, mental health, and counseling services. Now, however, \nthrough Sue's able leadership, all Federal insurance programs that \nauthorize the provision of mental health care services, including \nMedicare, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, and the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, \nrecognize the ability of clinical social workers to independently \ndiagnose and treat mental illness. Additionally, clinical social \nworkers are now identified as health professionals through title VII of \nthe Public Health Service Act, and school social workers are \nacknowledged as key members of the pupil services team through various \neducational programs.\n  During Sue Hoechstetter's tenure, the National Association of Social \nWorkers also provided leadership in promoting progressive social \npolicy. Family and medical leave, health care reform, improved staffing \nand training in the child welfare system, and the development of \nFederal managed care standards are just a few of the proactive policies \nthat NASW advocated under her direction.\n  In recent years, Sue and the association have devoted considerable \nenergy in an attempt to preserve the entitlement for children under the \nAid to Families with Dependent Children Program, as well as to preserve \nthe financial and program integrity of the Medicaid and Medicare \nPrograms.\n  Sue Hoechstetter has never represented a high-powered firm, has never \nenjoyed the luxury of having a host of assistants to support her work, \nand has never received great financial reward for her efforts. I \nsuspect that Sue would not recognize an alligator shoe if she saw one. \nYet, I believe it is absolutely essential that Sue Hoechstetter and \nothers who share Sue's values continue their work educating the \nCongress. Our representative form of government requires the active \nengagement of competing interests in the formulation of Federal policy, \nand I am very glad that professionals like Sue Hoechstetter promote \nsocial policies that support the common good and help people in need \nparticipate in the process.\n  I am deeply saddened that Sue will no longer be representing the \ninterests of the National Association of Social Workers. Her \ncontribution to the association has been considerable. However, I am \nvery pleased that Sue will continue to pursue her interests in \nincreasing citizen participation in the political process. I wish her \nthe very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2332-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATIONS TO THE REGENT-NEW ENGLAND BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to commend \nLinda J. Morgan, the Chair of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board \n[STB], for her leadership in facilitating the discussions that have led \nto a possible settlement among the three major eastern rail carriers \nthat would end the bitter, long, and costly merger fight between the \nNorfolk Southern, CSX, and Conrail Railroads. For months the Nation has \nwitnessed the spectacle of these three giants trying to gain an \nadvantage over each other and access to almost 4 billion dollars' worth \nof annual rail freight. This merger fight was shaping up to be a battle \ncosting millions of dollars with no end in sight. And certainly there \nwas no guarantee that the American consumer would be better at the end \nof the struggle than they were at its beginning.\n  Ms. Morgan's service to this Nation is two fold. First, there was her \nsimple, and very wise, suggestion to the parties that a settlement \nbetween the parties ending this fight would probably be preferable to \nhaving the Government step in and end the fight. Second, there was her \nastute suggestion that gaining rail competition in the Northeast should \nbe an important goal in any final decision by the STB, which must \napprove any merger.\n  It is important to note that many interested parties appreciated her \ncandor and attention to the people's welfare. State agencies in the \nNortheast had urged a negotiated solution that would encourage more \ncompetition. Certainly, shippers have long seen the need for more \ncompetition in moving cargo through the largest North American consumer \nmarkets. The Journal of Commerce was moved to editorialize on [March 6, \n1997] that the agreement spurred by Chairman Morgan's comment ``makes \ngood business sense'' and that ``Ms. Morgan showed a deft touch, \nhinting at regulators' views without compromising her objectivity about \na case that hadn't yet been filed.''\n  Let me close by saying that Linda Morgan's deft touch has given \nconsumers and shippers some hope that they will come out ahead after \nany merger. It's a view that was articulated in The Journal of \nCommerce: ``The deal * * * will provide effective rail freight \ncompetition into New York * * * (and) offers more competitive service \nin other cities--among them Baltimore, Philadelphia, Wilmington and \nPittsburgh * * *'' I offer my thanks to Ms. Morgan, a fine example of a \ndedicated and effective public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2332-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\n\n\n           DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nBoxer as a cosponsor of the Domestic Violence Identification and \nReferral Act. With the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in the \n1994 crime bill, Congress addressed the need to educate law \nenforcement, judges, and prosecutors about how to deal with situations \nof domestic violence. However, in this important piece of legislation, \nCongress overlooked a major resource in the battle against domestic \nviolence--our health care professionals. Doctors, nurses, and others in \nhealth professions are often the first to see the effects of battering \nand are often in the best position to stop the cycle of violence before \nit goes any further.\n  While domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women, many \ndoctors, and nurses are unaware or unsure of the symptoms, treatment, \nand means of preventing domestic violence. In 1992, a Surgeon General's \nreport cited a study showing 35 percent of the women who visit hospital \nemergency rooms were there because of ongoing abuse. Additionally, the \nstudy found that only 5 percent of the abused women were actually \nidentified as such. A 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation [JAMA] determined that little had changed since the earlier \nstudy and that doctors still failed to identify women who were injured \nas a result of domestic violence.\n  In a June 17, 1992, issue of the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation Dr. Richard F. Jones III, the then-president of the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], related how \nfor years he had missed the obvious signs of physical abuse in women \npatients. He had been asking the wrong questions and failed to elicit \nthe true cause of their injuries. Only when he started asking these \nwomen directly if they were victims of physical abuse did the truth \nemerge.\n  Similarly, according to an article in a November 1995 issue of \nAmerican Medicine, 60 percent of those graduating from medical schools \nfelt that an insufficient amount of attention within the medical school \ncurriculum was given to the issue of family and domestic violence.\n  Since Senator Boxer, Representative Morella, and I introduced the \nDomestic Violence Identification and Referral Act in 1992, the medical \ncommunity has taken many steps to increase outreach and education on \nthe issue of domestic violence. However, as these studies show, the \nfact is that when it comes to domestic violence, the bruises and \nabrasions get dressed, but the cause goes unaddressed. Doctors miss the \nsigns of domestic violence early on and then often miss them again when \nthey have become catastrophic.\n  The Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act provides \nincentives for medical schools to provide significant training in \nidentifying, treating and referring victims of domestic violence. The \nlegislation will give preference in awarding grants under the health \nprofessions education titles of the Public Health Services Act to \nschools that have incorporated training in domestic violence into their \ncurriculum.\n  The title VII and title VIII grant programs, singled out in the bill, \nare demonstration grants and makeup but a small part of the hundreds of \nmillions of Federal dollars that go to medical schools for state-of-\nthe-art medical education. It seems to me to be self-evident that if we \ngive medical schools this sort of funding, they should at least give \nsome time to addressing the No. 1 cause of injury to women.\n  In drafting this legislation we worked closely with doctors, nurses, \nmedical schools, and domestic violence groups. The Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the American Medical Women's Association, the National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence, AYUDA, NOW Legal Defense Fund, \nAmerican Nurses Association, National League For Nursing, Association \nof Reproductive Health Professionals, and the Family Violence \nPrevention Fund, among others, have voiced their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the many groups that assisted in drafting this legislation \nand Senator Boxer for her leadership in this matter. I urge the \nCongress to pass this important piece of legislation this year.\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Wyden has been added as a \ncosponsor to S. 101, the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral \nAct.\n  Senator Wyden is the original author of this legislation, of which I \nam proud to be the Senate sponsor. He wrote it while he was a member of \nthe House of Representatives, and has been the driving force behind \nthis very important legislation. I was honored in the 103d Congress, \nwhen he asked me to introduce the Senate companion version.\n  Since Senator Wyden's election to the Senate last year, we have \nworked hand-in-hand on this legislation. I look forward to working \ntogether in the 105th Congress to finally bring this bill to \npassage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2333-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2333-S2334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the \nNational Character Counts Week resolution. Senator Domenici has \nintroduced this resolution, which declares October 19 through 25, 1997, \nas National Character Counts Week, on behalf of myself and the \nbipartisan membership of the Senate Character Counts Group. I \nespecially want to thank Senator Domenici for his continuing good \nleadership on Character Counts.\n  The national Character Counts Coalition, an alliance of hundreds of \ngroups, communities, and individuals, was born out of a meeting of some \nof our country's best thinkers and doers in Colorado less than 5 years \nago. These folks had many of the concerns that I know a lot of us here \nin the Senate share about the wrong direction that many of our young \npeople seem to be headed.\n  Character Counts calls on all of us, educators, church and youth \nleaders, community and business leaders, and most importantly parents, \nto reinforce six basic values, or pillars of character. These values \nare so important and basic that I do not think anyone could question \nthem. They are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, \ncaring, and citizenship.\n  I have two young children, so I know firsthand how difficult it is \nfor kids to make the right choices when they are constantly being \nbombarded by messages from our popular culture that it is cool to drink \nalcohol or smoke or use vulgar language. To counteract these messages, \nit is more important than ever that we instill in our young people the \nintegrity and good character to stand up for what is right. Children \nare not born with good character. They learn by example, and if they \nhave good role models all around them, I am confident they will make \ncorrect choices for themselves.\n  As evidence that children are eager, even hungry, to do the right \nthing if given the proper reinforcement, I want to hold up the story of \n11-year-old Herbert Tarvin. Many of you may remember hearing on the \nnews about the Brinks armored car that crashed in January of this year \nin one of Miami, Florida's poorest neighborhoods. Herbert was walking \nto school that day when he passed the wrecked truck, and like many of \nthe adults all around him, he gave into the temptation to grab some of \nthe money from the truck. Herbert's newfound riches totaled 85 cents. \nIn all, some $300,000 in cash and coins was stolen from the truck.\n  Fortunately, when Herbert got to school, he had a teacher who cared \nenough to urge her students to turn over any money they had taken. \nHerbert's conscience prompted him to turn his 85-cent windfall over to \nhis teacher, who returned it to the Brinks Co. Herbert says he knows he \nshould not have taken the money to begin with because his mom and \nteacher have taught him better than that, but I am proud of him for \nultimately returning the money.\n  Many of the adults around Herbert did not act so honorably. After \nweeks of public pleas and investigations, only about $300 of the \n$300,000 taken from the truck has been returned. Even so, this story is \nheartening to me because I think it shows that children want to do the \nright thing when faced with difficult situations. As Herbert's mom and \nteacher have done, we all have a role in ensuring that all children are \ngiven the ethical tools they need to make difficult choices in today's \nworld. Quite simply, that is what the Character Counts Program is all \nabout.\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\n  I have found that young people in North Dakota are excited about \nCharacter Counts. Nearly a year ago, I brought together a group of \nabout three dozen North Dakotans, including several young people, to \nintroduce them to the Character Counts Program. Out of that meeting was \nborn a Character Counts initiative in North Dakota, under the \nleadership of 4-H youth specialist Geri Bosch.\n  In the year since then, Geri and her army of college- and high \nschool-aged 4-H youth ambassadors have been traveling throughout North \nDakota to share the Character Counts concept with children, youth, and \nadults alike, and Character Counts is spreading like wildfire in my \nState. In December alone, nearly 200 concerned adults participated in \nCharacter Counts training so that they could take Character Counts back \nto their communities. Even more exciting, more than 1,000 young people \nin North Dakota have participated in the Character Counts Program \ndirectly in some way throughout the last year, and countless other kids \nhave been indirectly influenced for the better through the teachers, \nyouth leaders, clergy members, and other concerned citizens who touch \ntheir lives daily.\n  I have been proud to play some small role in supporting Character \nCounts in North Dakota and our country. Through these kinds of efforts, \nwe can build a better future for our kids, and I want to again pledge \nmy continued help and support for teaching the pillars of good \ncharacter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/14/senate-section/article/S2333-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 447\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
