Mr. President, the debate on tobacco legislation that we \nwill begin again at 10 o'clock this morning is one of the most \nsignificant in which any of us will ever be involved.\n  Smoking is, in the words of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, \n``the chief, single avoidable cause of death in our society, and the \nmost important public health issue of our time.''\n  Every year, tobacco kills more than 400,000 Americans--accounting for \nmore than one out of every five deaths in our country. Smoking kills \nmore people than die from AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, \nsuicides and fires--combined.\n  So often, when we hear that someone has died as a result of smoking, \nwe think, ``That was their choice. They were adults.''\n  But chances are, they were not adults when they made the decision to \npick up that first cigarette.\n  Ninety percent of adult smokers started smoking at or before the age \nof 18--before they were even old enough to buy cigarettes legally.\n  The average youth smoker starts smoking at 13, and is addicted by the \ntime he or she is 14. One out of every three of those children will \neventually die from smoking.\n  It may take another 20 or 30--or even 50--years until that decision \ncatches up with them. But the decision is made when they are children.\n  That is what this debate is really about. Are we willing, as a \nnation, to protect our children from an epidemic that may eventually \nkill them?\n  During the first half of this century, another epidemic threatened \nAmerica's children: polio.\n  Summer was a time of fear for American parents and their children. \nParents kept their children out of swimming pools, movie theaters--\nanywhere the virus might be spread.\n  Still, thousands of children died every year from polio, and tens of \nthousands were crippled.\n  The worst polio epidemic in U.S. history occurred in 1952, when \nnearly 60,000 new cases were reported.\n  Back then, America marshaled all its resources and all its resolve \nand, in 1953, Jonas Salk discovered a vaccine.\n  As a result, polio has all but vanished from this nation.\n  We may not be able to eliminate all tobacco-related disease, as we \neliminated polio. But we can dramatically reduce the number of people \nwho pick up that first cigarette as teenagers and become addicted and \neventually die from smoking.\n  The bill that will be pending in just a few moments provides the \ncomprehensive approach that is needed to do that.\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\n  It is supported by a majority of this Senate--Democrats and \nRepublicans--and by the President.\n  More importantly, it is supported by the American people.\n\n\n                    cigarette companies target kids\n\n  Smoking by teenagers is now at a 19-year high.\n  Every day, 3,000 kids become regular smokers. That's more than a \nmillion kids a year.\n  The increase in teen smoking is not an accident. It is the result of \na deliberate and aggressive marketing campaign.\n  Once-secret internal industry documents make it clear that the \ntobacco industry targets kids--and has for more than 25 years.\n  The tobacco industry spends $13 million a day--$5 billion a year--on \nadvertising. Many of their ads are specifically targeted to kids.\n  A 1981 Philip Morris internal memo makes clear why.\n  According to that memo, ``The overwhelming majority of smokers first \nbegin to smoke while still in their teens . . . The smoking patterns of \nteenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris.''\n  A 1984 RJ Reynolds internal memo--written just before RJR launched \nits ``Joe Camel'' campaign--is even more blunt.\n  ``If younger adults turn away from smoking,'' it says, ``the \n(tobacco) industry must decline, just as a population that does not \ngive birth will eventually dwindle . . . Younger adult smokers are our \nonly source of replacement smokers.''\n  ``Replacement smokers.'' That's how RJR sees children: as \n``replacements'' for older smokers who quit--or die from tobacco-\nrelated disease.\n  If we can keep kids from smoking when they're young, chances are they \nwill never smoke.\n  Tobacco companies know that. That's one reason they're spending $50 \nmillion to try to kill this bill.\n\n\n                     the tobacco industry is scared\n\n  Another reason is because they don't want to be held accountable for \nthe damage they knowingly caused in the past.\n  The tobacco industry is being sued by states across the country. \nStates are demanding to be reimbursed for billions of dollars they have \nalready spent treating smoking-related illnesses.\n  The cases aren't going well for the industry. In the last year alone, \nit has settled out of court with four states, rather than risk going \ninto court and losing even more.\n  The $6.6 billion the tobacco industry agreed to earlier this month to \npay Minnesota is the third-largest court settlement in U.S. history. It \nis topped only by the $11.3 billion it agreed to pay Florida, and the \n$15.3 billion it will pay Texas.\n\n\n                    the truth about the tobacco bill\n\n  The tobacco industry is scared. So they are spending $50 million to \ntry to kill this bill. We have all heard their arguments.\n  First, they are trying to convince the American people that the only \nreason Congress wants to pass a tobacco bill is to raise mountains of \nmoney.\n  The truth is, 40 percent of the money that would be raised by this \nbill wouldn't go to the federal government at all.\n  It would go to state taxpayers, to reimburse them for money they've \nalready spent treating tobacco-related illnesses.\n  The rest of the money would be used for three purpose: To support \nmedical research on treating smoking-related illness and preventing \nsmoking; to dramatically reduce teen smoking; and to help tobacco \nfarmers make the transition to other crops.\n  The industry's second argument is that this bill will create a black \nmarket for cigarettes.\n  They point to the cigarette smuggling problems Canada experienced in \nthe early 1990s when it raised tobacco prices.\n  The reality is, our bill includes tough anti-smuggling, anti-black \nmarket provisions that Canada lacked.\n  It is worth mentioning, I think, that a lobbyist who enlisted several \nlaw enforcement groups to warn that this bill could create a black \nmarket in cigarettes also has another employer: a leading tobacco \ncompany.\n  The third argument the tobacco industry makes is that our bill would \ndrive cigarette companies into bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco industry makes $100 billion a year.\n  Even if it made only $100 million a year, it still would not be in \ndanger of bankruptcy because, under this bill, it is smokers--not \ntobacco companies--who pay.\n  Finally, the tobacco industry wants people to believe that we're on a \nslippery slope; that today, tobacco is the whipping boy, but next it \nwill be alcohol or some other product.\n  This argument ignores one crucial distinction: tobacco is the only \nlegal product sold in the United States that will kill you when used as \nintended.\n  Mr. President, the companies that are making these claims are the \nsame companies whose CEOs raised their hands and swore before Congress \nthat cigarettes are not addictive.\n  They were blowing smoke then, and they are blowing smoke now.\n  As I said, this is a historic opportunity. If we fail to grasp it, \nour Nation will pay a terrible price. Unless we reverse current trends, \n5 million children who are under the age of 18 today will die from \nsmoking-related illnesses.\n  Have you ever known anyone who has died from cancer or emphysema or \nsome other tobacco-related disease?\n  It's torture--on them, and for the people who love them. Unless we \nact now to reverse current trends, Americans will spend $1 trillion \nover the next 20 years--$1 trillion, a thousand-billion dollars--to \ntreat smoking-related illnesses.\n  This bill would raise $516 billion over 25 years, $516 billion over \n25 years to save $1 trillion over 20 years--and 5 million children. Mr. \nPresident, that sounds like a pretty good deal to me.\n  Several years ago, internal documents that the tobacco industry had \nfor years kept secret--that the industry had for years denied even \nexisted--began to trickle out. After a while, the trickle became a \nflood. As a result of these documents, we now know cigarette \nmanufacturers have known for decades that tobacco is addictive.\n  We now know that cigarettes kill people directly, and they are a \ncontributing cause of illnesses from heart disease to sudden infant \ndeath syndrome. We now know that tobacco companies manipulate the level \nof nicotine in cigarettes to hook smokers. We now know that the \nindustry aggressively targets children. We now know that the price of \ncigarettes influences kids' decision to smoke. We know that's true. But \nwe also know it's not enough.\n  The only way we are going to break the deadly cycle of teen smoking \nand addiction and death is with a comprehensive bill that includes \nprice hikes, plus strong counter-advertising efforts and effective \nretail licensing, and sets goals for reducing teen smoking and \nsanctions against tobacco companies for failure to attain them. That is \nwhat this bill contains. If we can improve it, we should. And then we \nshould pass this bill, and urge the House to pass it as well.\n  Teen smoking is an epidemic. If this Congress can't protect children \nfrom a deadly health threat, what in the world can we do?\n  In 1973, a senior RJ Reynolds employee wrote a memo entitled \n``research planning memorandum on some thoughts about new brands of \ncigarettes for the youth market.'' In that memo, he argued--and I \nquote--``there is certainly nothing immoral or unethical about our \ncompany attempting to attract (teen) smokers to our products.''\n  Mr. President, most Americans disagree with that assertion. Most \nAmericans believe that aggressively marketing to children a product you \nknow could eventually kill them is both immoral and unethical. And, \nthey believe it ought to be illegal.\n  As the industry's own documents reveal, most adult smokers start \nsmoking as teenagers. Victor Crawford was one of those kids.\n  He started smoking when he was 13 years old. He died 50 years later, \nafter the cancer that was caused by smoking had spread from his throat \nto his pelvis, lungs and liver. As a adult Victor Crawford served 16 \nyears as a member of Maryland's House of Delegates and its state \nSenate. He was a colorful and effective politician. He was also a 2\\1/\n2\\ pack-a-day smoker. In 1986, Victor Crawford left politics and went \nto work in Maryland's state capital into the\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nwork of lobbying. One of his clients was the Tobacco Institute, the \npropaganda arm of the tobacco industry. The Tobacco Institute paid him \n$200 an hour to help kill whatever tobacco restrictions came before the \nMaryland General Assembly.\n  Six years later, in 1992, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. His \ndoctors told him he had three months to live. But, with the help of new \nand experimental treatments, he managed to hang on for three years.\n  Victor Crawford used those last three years of his life to prevent \nother young people from making the same mistake he had made when he \npicked up that first cigarette at 13.\n  A first reluctantly, then passionately, he spoke about the pain of \nhis illness, and his remorse over having contributed, through his work, \nto the suffering of others.\n  He described his former employers, the tobacco industry, as ``hard-\nnosed, brilliant and ruthless. I can also state without question,'' he \nsaid, ``that the profit motive is supreme, and that there is no avenue \nthey will not explore and no means they will not use to that end.''\n  He told his story to state legislatures, on ``60 Minutes,'' in Ann \nLanders' column--wherever he thought it would get through.\n  A year and a half before he died, he returned to the Maryland \nStatehouse--to the place where he had worked as a legislator and \nlobbyist. Only this time he as a witness, testifying in support of a \nlaw regulating public smoking. He wore a wig to hid the baldness caused \nby chemotherapy, and he was terribly gaunt. But everyone who heard him \nwas deeply moved.\n  Said on of his former colleagues after his testimony, ``Yours was the \nvoice of truth.''\n  Mr. President, Victor Crawford's voice--and the voice of America's \nchildren--are calling to us today.\n  They are asking us to protect them from addiction.\n  They are asking us to protect them from painful and premature death.\n  Are we listening?\n  It is time for Congress to pass a national bill to reduce teen \nsmoking and to tell the cigarette manufacturers, ``Our children are not \n`replacement smokers,' and you cannot prey on them anymore.''\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5031-6", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to take just a little bit of time \nthis morning to again alert Senators and others about troubling new \ndevelopments in South Asia after India thumbed its nose at the world \ncommunity and exploded five underground nuclear weapons. Conditions \nseem to be spiraling out of control in the nation of India. We now see \nthat a key Indian official, according to the news this morning, a key \nIndian official is warning Pakistan and making very threatening, \nprovocative statements, about the area that we know as Jammu-Kashmir. \nIndian Home Minister Advani--there is a picture of him here clenching \nhis fist, saying they were, basically, not going to have a peaceful \nresolution at all of the situation in Kashmir. I am quoting from the \narticle:\n\n       While India's previous government had a policy of not \n     making hostile statements about Pakistan, the BJP [that is \n     the party that is now in power in India] as recently as two \n     years ago advocated ``reclaiming'' Pakistan's portion of \n     Kashmir.\n\n  It is interesting that:\n\n       In the course [it says here] of broadening its platforms \n     for this year's parliamentary elections--and cobbling \n     together a coalition government of 14 disparate parties--such \n     references to Kashmir were dropped. But Advani [the Home \n     Minister] was pointed in his reference today to the disputed \n     state, although he couched it more in terms of Pakistan's \n     stance toward Kashmir than India's.\n\n  But now Advani said, and I quote from the article:\n\n       [Nuclear weapons tests] has brought about a qualitatively \n     new stage in Indo-Pakistan relations and signifies--even \n     while adhering to the principle of no first strike--[that] \n     India is resolved to deal firmly with Pakistan's hostile \n     activities in Kashmir.\n\n  Wait a minute, Mr. President. He is talking about Pakistan's hostile \nactivities in Kashmir? It is India that has around 300,000 troops in \nKashmir. It is India that is spending about a large portion of its \nmilitary budget every year in Kashmir. It is by Indian troops that \nhuman rights groups have said that in the last several years, perhaps \nin the last 10 years, upwards of 13,000 people have been killed in \nKashmir--not by Pakistani troops, but by Indian troops.\n  What this Home Minister Advani is doing is trying to cover what India \nhas done in Kashmir by blaming it on Pakistan.\n  Quite frankly, Kashmir is the East Timor of South Asia, to those of \nus who have followed the problems of East Timor, a tiny little island \nnation on the eastern tip of Indonesia. It was a Portuguese colony for \nseveral hundred years. When the Portuguese left, the Indonesians came \nin to claim East Timor, but they have no rightful claim to it; it is a \nseparate island nation.\n  Since that time, East Timorese have been put to death by the \nIndonesians, slaughtered, people driven out of their homes, driven out \nof their jobs. What has happened in East Timor is a blight on \nIndonesia, and the world community has spoken out forcefully against \nwhat Indonesia has done in East Timor. But the world community is \nstanding silently by while the same kind of slaughter and repression is \noccurring in the tiny state of Kashmir.\n  If you go back to when India and Pakistan were partitioned off, this \ntiny area up in northwest India on the border of Pakistan and India, \nthe United Nations recognized in the late 1940s that this issue needed \nto be resolved, and urged for it to be resolved through a plebiscite, \nto have a vote of the people in this area: Did they want to stay with \nPakistan, or did they want to go with India?\n  But India refuses outside mediation, even from the UN. I had always \nhoped, as many have hoped, that we would have some kind of a peaceful \nresolution of Kashmir. But now India is shaking its fist at Pakistan \nand speaking provocatively of reclaiming certain areas of Kashmir that \nhave already been recognized as being at least an adjunct to, adhering \nto Pakistan, an area called Azad Kashmir.\n  Mr. President, I don't think we can idly stand by and let India \ncontinue these kinds of provocative measures. The world community must \nspeak with one voice in condemning the actions by India with strong \nsanctions. I will have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I hope \nwe can bring up sometime this week in conjunction with others, dealing \nwith the Indian explosion of nuclear weapons and dealing with the \nPressler amendment that Senator Brownback and I will be offering \nsometime this week, I hope.\n  I have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling upon the United \nStates to take the lead in getting other nations together to act as an \nintermediary in the dispute on Kashmir. Better that we act now, better \nthat we try to seek peaceful resolutions of Kashmir before this whole \nthing blows up, before the BJP of India is able to take it to a higher \nlevel, a more provocative level that would involve the use of arms.\n  I hope we can get the support of other Senators in asking the United \nStates to act as a mediator to this very dangerous situation that now \nexists in Kashmir and South Asia.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am on the floor this morning to introduce \na bill called the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act. My \nstatement is going to take about 10 or 15 minutes.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of epic and worsening proportions that \n     results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and \n     adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) The citizens of the several States are exposed to, and \n     adversely affected by, environmental smoke in public \n     buildings and other facilities which imposes a burden on \n     interstate commerce.\n       (13) Civil actions against tobacco product manufacturers \n     and others are pending in Federal and State courts arising \n     from the use, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Among \n     these actions are cases brought by the attorneys general of \n     more than 40 States, certain cities and counties, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other parties, including \n     Indian tribes, and class actions brought by private claimants \n     (such as in the Castano Civil Actions), seeking to recover \n     monies expended to treat tobacco-related diseases and for the \n     protection of minors and consumers, as well as penalties and \n     other relief for violations of antitrust, health, consumer \n     protection, and other laws.\n       (14) Civil actions have been filed throughout the United \n     States against tobacco product manufacturers and their \n     distributors, trade associations, law firms, and consultants \n     on behalf of individuals or classes of individuals claiming \n     to be dependent upon and injured by tobacco products.\n       (15) These civil actions are complex, time-consuming, \n     expensive, and burdensome for both the litigants and Federal \n     and State courts. To date, these civil actions have not \n     resulted in sufficient redress for smokers or non-\n     governmental third-party payers. To the extent that \n     governmental entities have been or may in the future be \n     compensated for tobacco-related claims they have brought, it \n     is not now possible to identify what portions of such past or \n     future recoveries can be attributed to their various \n     antitrust, health, consumer protection, or other causes of \n     action.\n       (16) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     comprehensive public health legislation because of tobacco's \n     unique position in the Nation's history and economy; the need \n     to prevent the sale, distribution, marketing and advertising \n     of tobacco products to persons under the minimum legal age to \n     purchase such products; and the need to educate the public, \n     especially young people, regarding the health effects of \n     using tobacco products.\n       (17) The public interest requires a timely, fair, \n     equitable, and consistent result that will serve the public \n     interest by (A) providing that a portion of the costs of \n     treatment for diseases and adverse health effects associated \n     with the use of tobacco products is borne by the \n     manufacturers of these products, and (B) restricting \n     throughout the Nation the sale, distribution, marketing, and \n     advertising of tobacco products only to persons of legal age \n     to purchase such products.\n       (18) Public health authorities estimate that the benefits \n     to the Nation of enacting Federal legislation to accomplish \n     these goals would be significant in human and economic terms.\n       (19) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 60,000 early deaths each year and \n     save up to $43 billion each year in reduced medical costs, \n     improved productivity, and the avoidance of premature deaths.\n       (20) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (21) In 1995, the tobacco industry spent close to \n     $4,900,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (22) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (23) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (24) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (25) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (26) Tobacco advertising increases the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including increasing tobacco use by young people.\n       (27) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands, and \n     children as young as 3 to 6 years old can recognize a \n     character associated with smoking at the same rate as they \n     recognize cartoons and fast food characters.\n       (28) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market.\n       (29) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (30) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (31) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones. Text-only \n     requirements, while not as stringent as a ban, will help \n     reduce underage use of tobacco products while preserving the \n     informational function of advertising.\n       (32) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (33) If, as a direct or indirect result of this Act, the \n     consumption of tobacco products in the United States is \n     reduced significantly, then tobacco farmers, their families, \n     and their communities may suffer economic hardship and \n     displacement, notwithstanding their lack of involvement in \n     the manufacturing and marketing of tobacco products.\n       (34) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the authority of the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to require the tobacco industry to fund both Federal \n     and State oversight of the tobacco industry from on-going \n     payments by tobacco product manufacturers;\n       (3) to require tobacco product manufacturers to provide \n     ongoing funding to be used for an aggressive Federal, State, \n     and local enforcement program and for a nationwide licensing \n     system to prevent minors from obtaining tobacco products and \n     to prevent the unlawful distribution of tobacco products, \n     while expressly permitting the States to adopt additional \n     measures that further restrict or eliminate the products' \n     use;\n       (4) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     States may continue to address issues of particular concern \n     to public\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (5) to impose financial surcharges on tobacco product \n     manufacturers if tobacco use by young people does not \n     substantially decline;\n       (6) to authorize appropriate agencies of the Federal \n     government to set national standards controlling the \n     manufacture of tobacco products and the identity, public \n     disclosure, and amount of ingredients used in such products;\n       (7) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that the tobacco industry makes efforts to develop and \n     introduce less harmful tobacco products;\n       (8) to confirm the Food and Drug Administration's authority \n     to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful \n     components of tobacco products;\n       (9) in order to ensure that adults are better informed, to \n     require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (10) to impose on tobacco product manufacturers the \n     obligation to provide funding for a variety of public health \n     initiatives;\n       (11) to establish a minimum Federal standard for stringent \n     restrictions on smoking in public places, while also to \n     permit State, Tribal, and local governments to enact \n     additional and more stringent standards or elect not to be \n     covered by the Federal standard if that State's standard is \n     as protective, or more protective, of the public health;\n       (12) to authorize and fund from payments by tobacco product \n     manufacturers a continuing national counter-advertising and \n     tobacco control campaign which seeks to educate consumers and \n     discourage children and adolescents from beginning to use \n     tobacco products, and which encourages current users of \n     tobacco products to discontinue using such products;\n       (13) to establish a mechanism to compensate the States in \n     settlement of their various claims against tobacco product \n     manufacturers;\n       (14) to authorize and to fund from payments by tobacco \n     product manufacturers a nationwide program of smoking \n     cessation administered through State and Tribal governments \n     and the private sector;\n       (15) to establish and fund from payments by tobacco product \n     manufacturers a National Tobacco Fund;\n       (16) to affirm the rights of individuals to access to the \n     courts, to civil trial by jury, and to damages to compensate \n     them for harm caused by tobacco products;\n       (17) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (18) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry; and\n       (19) to protect tobacco farmers and their communities from \n     the economic impact of this Act by providing full funding for \n     and the continuation of the Federal tobacco program and by \n     providing funds for farmers and communities to develop new \n     opportunities in tobacco-dependent communities.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--This Act is not intended to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) except as provided in this Act, affect any action \n     pending in State, Tribal, or Federal court, or any agreement, \n     consent decree, or contract of any kind.\n       (b) Taxation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not affect \n     any authority of the Secretary of the Treasury (including any \n     authority assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms) or of State or local governments with regard to \n     taxation for tobacco or tobacco products.\n       (c) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     which authorize the Secretary to take certain actions with \n     regard to tobacco and tobacco products shall not be construed \n     to affect any authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under \n     existing law regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of \n     raw tobacco.\n\n     SEC. 5. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER, RELATED FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, \n                   AND TRIBAL LAWS.\n\n       (a) Age Restrictions.--Nothing in this Act or the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), as \n     amended by this Act, shall prevent a Federal agency \n     (including the Armed Forces), a State or its political \n     subdivisions, or the government of an Indian tribe from \n     adopting and enforcing additional measures that further \n     restrict or prohibit tobacco product sale to, use by, and \n     accessibility to persons under the legal age of purchase \n     established by such agency, State, subdivision, or government \n     of an Indian tribe.\n       (b) Additional Measures.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided in this Act, nothing in this Act, the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), or rules \n     promulgated under such Acts, shall limit the authority of a \n     Federal agency (including the Armed Forces), a State or its \n     political subdivisions, or the government of an Indian tribe \n     to enact, adopt, promulgate, and enforce any law, rule, \n     regulation, or other measure with respect to tobacco \n     products, including laws, rules, regulations, or other \n     measures relating to or prohibiting the sale, distribution, \n     possession, exposure to, or use of tobacco products by \n     persons of any age that are in addition to the provisions of \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act. No provision of \n     this Act or amendment made by this Act shall limit or \n     otherwise affect any State, Tribal, or local taxation of \n     tobacco products.\n       (c) No Less Stringent.--Nothing in this Act or the \n     amendments made by this Act is intended to supersede any \n     State, local, or Tribal law that is not less stringent than \n     this Act, or other Acts as amended by this Act.\n       (d) State Law Not Affected.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided in this Act, nothing in this Act, the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), or rules \n     promulgated under such Acts, shall supersede the authority of \n     the States, pursuant to State law, to expend funds provided \n     by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Reg. 41314-41372 (August \n     11, 1995)).\n       (2) The document entitled ``Nicotine in Cigarettes and \n     Smokeless Tobacco Products is a Drug and These Products Are \n     Nicotine Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act;; (60 Fed. Reg. 41453-41787 (August 11, 1995)).\n       (3) The preamble to the final rule in the document entitled \n     ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of \n     Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and \n     Adolescents'' (61 Fed. Reg. 44396-44615 (August 28, 1996)).\n       (4) The document entitled ``Nicotine in Cigarettes and \n     Smokeless Tobacco is a Drug and These Products are Nicotine \n     Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n     Act; Jurisdictional Determination;; (61 Fed. Reg. 44619-45318 \n     (August 28, 1996)).\n\n              TITLE II--REDUCTIONS IN UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE\n\n                        Subtitle A--Underage Use\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and ensure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       This title is intended to ensure that, in the event that \n     other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate \n     to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, \n     tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. These \n     additional assessments are designed to lower youth tobacco \n     consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering further \n     increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging \n     tobacco companies to work to meet statutory targets for \n     reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and providing \n     support for further reduction efforts.\n\n     SEC. 203. GOALS FOR REDUCING UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE.\n\n       (a) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required percentage reductions in underage use of \n     tobacco products set forth in this title are achieved.\n       (b) Required Reductions for Cigarettes.--With respect to \n     cigarettes, the required percentage reduction in underage \n     use, as set forth in section 204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage  \n                                                                                   Cigarette Use                \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                         15 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         30 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     50 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                60 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (c) Required Reductions for Smokeless Tobacco.--With \n     respect to smokeless tobacco products, the required \n     percentage reduction in underage use, as set forth in section \n     204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage  \n                                                                               Smokeless Tobacco Use            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                       12.5 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         25 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     35 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                45 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     SEC. 204. LOOK-BACK ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning no later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (d)(1), to determine--\n       (1) the percentage of all young individuals who used a type \n     of tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of young individuals who identify each \n     brand of each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     that type smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Annual Determination.--The Secretary shall make an \n     annual determination, based on the annual performance survey \n     conducted under subsection (a), of whether the required \n     percentage reductions in underage use of tobacco products for \n     a year have been achieved for the year involved. The \n     determination shall be based on the annual percent prevalence \n     of the use of tobacco products, for the industry as a whole \n     and of particular manufacturers, by young individuals (as \n     determined by the surveys conducted by the Secretary) for the \n     year involved as compared to the base incidence percentages.\n       (c) Confidentiality of Data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it to be identifiable, the \n     information may not be used for any purpose other than the \n     purpose for which it was supplied unless that individual (or \n     that individual's guardian) consents to its use for such \n     other purpose. The information may not be published or \n     released in any other form if the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it is identifiable unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     publication or release in other form.\n       (d) Methodolgy.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) be a household-based, in person survey (which may \n     include computer-assisted technology);\n       (C) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (D) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (E) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a manufacturer) based on the \n     point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     tobacco product of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(E) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a particular manufacturer) \n     for the purpose of measuring compliance with percent \n     reduction targets and calculating surcharges provided that \n     the precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of young individuals reporting use of a type of \n     tobacco product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of tobacco product of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95-percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (e) Industry-wide Non-attainment Surcharges.--\n       (1) Secretary to determine industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage.--The Secretary shall determine the industry-wide \n     non-attainment percentage for cigarettes and for smokeless \n     tobacco for each calendar year.\n       (2) Non-attainment surcharge for cigarettes.--For each \n     calendar year in which the percentage reduction in underage \n     use required by section 203b) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on cigarette manufacturers

equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level described in paragraph (4).\n       (3) New entrants.--Each manufacturer of a tobacco product \n     which begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act shall ensure that the percent \n     prevalence of young individuals who use the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products as their usual brand is equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level.\n       (4) De minimis level defined.--The de minimis level is \n     equal to 1 percent prevalence of the use of each \n     manufacturer's brands of tobacco product by young individuals \n     (as determined on the basis of the annual performance survey \n     conducted by the Secretary) for a year.\n       (5) Target reduction levels.--\n       (A) Existing manufacturers.-- For purposes of this section, \n     the target reduction level for each type of tobacco product \n     for a year for a manufacturer is the product of the required \n     percentage reduction for a type of tobacco product for a year \n     and the manufacturers base incidence percentage for such \n     tobacco product.\n       (B) New manufacturers; manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (i) Business Expense Deduction.--Any surcharge paid by a \n     tobacco product manufacturer under this section shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (j) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (k) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 205.

ADJUSTMENTS.\n\n       The applicable base amount under section 402(b) for a given \n     calendar year shall be adjusted as follows in determining the \n     annual payment for that year:\n       (1) Inflation adjustment.--\n       (A) In general.--Beginning with the sixth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the adjusted \n     applicable base amount under section 402(b)(6) is the amount \n     of the annual payment made for the preceding year increased \n     by the greater of 3 percent or the annual increase in the \n     CPI, adjusted (for calendar year 2002 and later years) by the \n     volume adjustment under paragraph (2).\n       (B) CPI.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (C) Rounding.--If any increase determined under \n     subparagraph (A) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase \n     shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (2) Volume adjustment.--Beginning with calendar year 2002, \n     the applicable base amount (as adjusted for inflation under \n     paragraph (1)) shall be adjusted for changes in volume of \n     domestic sales by multiplying the applicable base amount by \n     the ratio of the actual volume for the calendar year to the \n     base volume. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base \n     volume'' means 80 percent of the number of units of taxable \n     domestic removals and taxed imports of cigarettes in calendar \n     year 1997, as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``actual volume'' means \n     the number of adjusted unites as defined in section \n     402(d)(3)(A).\n\n     SEC. 404.

APPLICATION; PREEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Application.--The provisions of this title govern any \n     tobacco claim in any civil action brought in an State, \n     Tribal, or Federal court, including any such claim that has \n     not reached final judgment or final settlement as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Preemption.--This title supersedes State law only to \n     the extent that State law applies to a matter covered by this \n     title. Any matter that is not governed by this title, \n     including any standard of liability applicable to a \n     manufacturer, shall be governed by any applicable State, \n     Tribal, or Federal law.\n       (c) Criminal Liability Untouched.--Nothing in this title \n     shall be construed to limit the criminal liability of tobacco \n     product manufacturers, retailers, or distributors, or\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\n     their officers, directors, employees, successors, or assigns.\n\n     SEC. 703. RULES GOVERNING TOBACCO CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) General Causation Presumption.--In any civil action to \n     which this title applies brought involving a tobacco claim, \n     there shall be an evidentiary presumption that nicotine is \n     addictive and that the diseases identified as being caused by \n     use of tobacco products in the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 \n     Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General (United \n     States Public Health Service 1989), The Health Consequences \n     of Smoking: Involuntary Smoking, (USPHS 1986); and The Health \n     Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco, (USPHS 1986), are \n     caused in whole or in part by the use of tobacco products, \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``general causation \n     presumption''), and a jury empaneled to hear a tobacco claim \n     shall be so instructed. In all other respects, the burden of \n     proof as to the issue of whether a plaintiff's specific \n     disease or injury was caused by smoking shall be governed by \n     the law of the State or Tribe in which the tobacco claim was \n     brought. This general causation presumption shall in no way \n     affect the ability of the defendant to introduce evidence or \n     argument which the defendant would otherwise be entitled to \n     present under the law of the State or Tribe in which the \n     tobacco claim was brought to rebut the general causation \n     presumption, or with respect to general causation, specific \n     causation, or alternative causation, or to introduce any \n     other evidence or argument which the defendant would \n     otherwise be entitled to make.\n       (b) Actions Against Participating Tobacco Product \n     Manufacturers.--In any civil action brought involving a \n     tobacco claim against participating tobacco product \n     manufacturers, as that term is defined in title XIV, the \n     provisions of title XIV apply in conjunction with the \n     provisions of this title.\n\n TITLE VIII--TOBACCO INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND EMPLOYEE \n                       PROTECTION FROM REPRISALS\n\n     SEC. 801. ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND OVERSIGHT OF THE \n                   TOBACCO INDUSTRY.\n\n       (a) Accountability.--The Secretary, following regular \n     consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the \n     Surgeon General, the Director of the Center for Disease \n     Control or the Director's delegate, and the Director of the \n     Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health shall \n     annually issue a report as provided for in subsection (c).\n       (b) Tobacco Company Plan.--Within a year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall adopt and submit to the Secretary a plan \n     to achieve the required percentage reductions in underage use \n     of tobacco products set forth in section 201, and thereafter \n     shall update its plan no less frequently than annually. The \n     annual report of the Secretary may recommend amendment of any \n     plan to incorporate additional measures to reduce underage \n     tobacco use that are consistent with the provisions of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Annual Report.--The Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Congress by January 31 of each year, which shall be \n     published in the Federal Register. The report shall--\n       (1) describe in detail each tobacco product manufacturer's \n     compliance with the provisions of this Act and its plan \n     submitted under subsection (b);\n       (2) report on whether each tobacco product manufacturer's \n     efforts to reduce underage smoking are likely to result in \n     attainment of smoking reduction targets under section 201;\n       (3) recommend, where necessary, additional measures \n     individual tobacco companies should undertake to meet those \n     targets; and\n       (4) include, where applicable, the extent to which prior \n     panel recommendations have been adopted by each tobacco \n     product manufacturer.\n\n     SEC. 802. TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER EMPLOYEE PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Prohibited Acts.--No tobacco product manufacturer may \n     discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against any \n     employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, \n     benefits, or privileges of employment because the employee \n     (or any person acting under a request of the employee)--\n       (1) notified the manufacturer, the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs, the Attorney General, or any Federal, State, or local \n     public health or law enforcement authority of an alleged \n     violation of this or any other Act;\n       (2) refused to engage in any practice made unlawful by such \n     Acts, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality \n     to the manufacturer;\n       (3) testified before Congress or at any Federal or State \n     proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of \n     such Acts;\n       (4) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to \n     commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under such \n     Acts, or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement \n     of any requirement imposed under such Acts;\n       (5) testified or is about to testify in any such \n     proceeding; or\n       (6) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or \n     participate, in any manner in such a proceeding or in any \n     other manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to \n     carry out the purposes of such Acts.\n       (b) Employee Complaint.--\n       (1) Any employee of a tobacco product manufacturer who \n     believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or \n     otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section may, within 180 days after \n     such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his \n     or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary alleging such \n     discharge, demotion, or discrimination. Upon receipt of such \n     a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in \n     the complaint of its filing.\n       (2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation \n     of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days \n     after the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall \n     complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the \n     complainant (and any such person acting in his or her behalf) \n     and the person alleged to have committed such violation of \n     the results of the investigation conducted under this \n     paragraph. Within 90 days after the receipt of such \n     complaint, the Secretary shall (unless the proceeding on the \n     complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a \n     settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person \n     alleged to have committed such violation) issue an order \n     either providing the relief prescribed in subparagraph (B) of \n     this paragraph or denying the complaint. An order of the \n     Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and the \n     opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and \n     556 of title 5, United States Code. Upon the conclusion of \n     such a hearing and the issuance of a recommended decision \n     that the complaint has merit, the Secretary shall issue a \n     preliminary order providing the relief prescribed in \n     subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, but may not order \n     compensatory damages pending a final order. The Secretary may \n     not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a \n     complaint without the participation and consent of the \n     complainant.\n       (B) If, in response to a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary determines that a violation of \n     this paragraph has occurred, the Secretary shall order the \n     person who committed such violation to (i) take affirmative \n     action to abate the violation, and (ii) reinstate the \n     complainant to his or her former position together with \n     compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and \n     privileges of his or her employment. The Secretary may order \n     such person to provide compensatory damages to the \n     complainant. If an order is issued under this subparagraph, \n     the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall \n     assess the person against whom the order is issued a sum \n     equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses \n     (including attorneys' and expert witness fees) reasonably \n     incurred (as determined by the Secretary), by the complainant \n     for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint \n     upon which the order is issued.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, and shall not conduct the \n     investigation required under paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection, unless the complainant has made a prima facie \n     showing that any behavior described in subsection (a) of this \n     section was a contributing factor in the unfavorable \n     personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (B) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the \n     complainant has made the showing required by subparagraph (A) \n     of this paragraph, no investigation required under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be conducted if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior. Relief may not be ordered under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior.\n       (C) The Secretary may determine that a violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section has occurred only if the \n     complainant has demonstrated that any behavior described in \n     subsection (a) of this section was a contributing factor in \n     unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order \n     issued under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review \n     of the order in the United States court of appeals for the \n     circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the \n     order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review \n     must be filed within 60 days after the issuance of the \n     Secretary's order. Judicial review shall be available as \n     provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The \n     commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, \n     unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review \n     could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any \n     criminal or civil proceeding.\n       (d) Noncompliance.--Whenever a person has failed to comply \n     with an order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, \n     the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States \n     district court for the district in which the violation \n     occurred to enforce such order. In actions brought under this \n     subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to \n     grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and \n     compensatory and exemplary damages.\n       (e) Action to Ensure Compliance.--\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\n       (1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under \n     subsection (b)(2) of this section may commence a civil action \n     to require compliance with such order against the person to \n     whom such order was issued. The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have jurisdiction to enforce such order, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy or the \n     citizenship of the parties.\n       (2) The court, in issuing any final order under this \n     subsection, may award costs of litigation (including \n     reasonable attorneys' and expert witness fees) to any party \n     whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\n       (f) Enforcement.--Any non-discretionary duty imposed by \n     this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding \n     brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (g) Applicability to Certain Employees.--Subsection (a) of \n     this section shall not apply with respect to any employee \n     who, acting without direction from the manufacturer (or the \n     agent of the manufacturer) deliberately causes a violation of \n     any requirement of this Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq), or any other law or \n     regulation relating to tobacco products.\n       (h) Effect on Other Laws.--This section shall not be \n     construed to expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any right \n     otherwise available to an employee under Federal or State law \n     to redress the employee's discharge or other discriminatory \n     action taken by a tobacco product manufacturer against the \n     employee.\n       (i) Posting.--The provisions of this section shall be \n     prominently posted in any place of employment to which this \n     section applies.\n\n        TITLE IX--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS\n\n     SEC. 901. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the American tobacco industry has made claims of \n     attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, and trade \n     secrets to protect from public disclosure thousands of \n     internal documents sought by civil litigants;\n       (2) a number of courts have found that these claims of \n     privilege were not made in good faith; and\n       (3) a prompt and full exposition of tobacco documents \n     will--\n       (A) promote understanding by the public of the tobacco \n     industry's research and practices; and\n       (B) further the purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 902. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title applies to all tobacco product manufacturers.\n\n     SEC. 903. DOCUMENT DISCLOSURE.\n\n       (a) Disclosure to the Food and Drug Administration.--\n       (1) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     each tobacco product manufacturer shall submit to the Food \n     and Drug Administration the documents identified in \n     subsection (c), including documents for which trade secret \n     protection is claimed, with the exception of any document for \n     which privilege is claimed, and identified in accordance with \n     subsection (b). Each such manufacturer shall provide the \n     Administration with the privilege and trade secret logs \n     identified under subsection (b).\n       (2) With respect to documents that are claimed to contain \n     trade secret material, unless and until it is finally \n     determined under this title, either through judicial review \n     or because time for judicial review has expired, that such a \n     document does not constitute or contain trade secret \n     material, the Administration shall treat the document as a \n     trade secret in accordance with section 708 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379) and the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder. Nothing herein shall \n     limit the authority of the Administration to obtain and use, \n     in accordance with any provision of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, \n     any document constituting or containing trade secret \n     material. Documents and materials received by the \n     Administration under this provision shall not be obtainable \n     by or releasable to the public through section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, and the \n     only recourse to obtain these documents shall be through the \n     process established by section 905.\n       (3) If a document depository is not established under title \n     XIV, the Secretary shall establish by regulation a procedure \n     for making public all documents submitted under paragraph (1) \n     except documents for which trade secret protection has been \n     claimed and for which there has not been a final judicial \n     determination that the document does not contain a trade \n     secret.\n       (b) Separate Submission of Documents.--\n       (1) (1) Privileged Trade Secret Documents.--Any document \n     required to be submitted under subsection (c) or (d) that is \n     subject to a claim by a tobacco product manufacturer of \n     attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection shall be so marked and shall be submitted \n     to the panel under section 904 within 30 days after its \n     appointment. Compliance with this subsection shall not be \n     deemed to be a waiver of any applicable claim of privilege or \n     trade secret protection.\n       (2) Privilege and trade secret logs.--\n       (A) In general.--Within 15 days after submitting documents \n     under paragraph (1), each tobacco product manufacturer shall \n     submit a comprehensive log which identifies on a document-by-\n     document basis all documents produced for which the \n     manufacturer asserts attorney-client privilege, attorney \n     work-product, or trade secrecy. With respect to documents for \n     which the manufacturer previously has asserted one or more of \n     the aforementioned privileges or trade secret protection, the \n     manufacturer shall conduct a good faith de novo review of \n     such documents to determine whether such privilege or trade \n     secret protection is appropriate.\n       (B) Organization of log.--The log shall be organized in \n     numerical order based upon the document identifier assigned \n     to each document. For each document, the log shall contain--\n       (i) a description of the document, including type of \n     document, title of document, name and position or title of \n     each author, addressee, and other recipient who was intended \n     to receive a copy, document date, document purpose, and \n     general subject matter;\n       (ii) an explanation why the document or a portion of the \n     document is privileged or subject to trade secret protection; \n     and\n       (iii) a statement whether any previous claim of privilege \n     or trade secret was denied and, if so, in what proceeding.\n       (C) Public inspection.--Within 5 days of receipt of such a \n     log, the Depository shall make it available for public \n     inspection and review.\n       (3) Declaration of compliance.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall submit to the Depository a declaration, in \n     accordance with the requirements of section 1746 of title 28, \n     United States Code, by an individual with responsibility for \n     the de novo review of documents, preparation of the privilege \n     log, and knowledge of its contents. The declarant shall \n     attest to the manufacturer's compliance with the requirements \n     of this subsection pertaining to the review of documents and \n     preparation of a privilege log.\n       (c) Document Categories.--Each tobacco product manufacturer \n     shall submit--\n       (1) every existing document (including any document subject \n     to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection) in the manufacturer's \n     possession, custody, or control relating, referring, or \n     pertaining to--\n       (A) any studies, research, or analysis of any possible \n     health or pharmacological effects in humans or animals, \n     including addiction, associated with the use of tobacco \n     products or components of tobacco products;\n       (B) the engineering, manipulation, or control of nicotine \n     in tobacco products;\n       (C) the sale or marketing of tobacco products;\n       (D) any research involving safer or less hazardous tobacco \n     products;\n       (E) tobacco use by minors; or\n       (F) the relationship between advertising or promotion and \n     the use of tobacco products;\n       (2) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturer, the Center of Tobacco Research or Tobacco \n     Institute to the Attorney General of any State during \n     discovery in any action brought on behalf of any State and \n     commenced after January 1, 1994;\n       (3) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturer, Center for Tobacco Research or Tobacco \n     Institute to the Federal Trade Commission in connection with \n     its investigation into the ``Joe Camel'' advertising campaign \n     and any underage marketing of tobacco products to minors;\n       (4) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturers, the Center for Tobacco Research or the Tobacco \n     Institute to litigation adversaries during discovery in any \n     private litigation matters;\n       (5) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturer, the Center for Tobacco Research, or the Tobacco \n     Institute in any of the following private litigation matters:\n       (A) Philip Morris v.

APPEAL OF PANEL DECISION.\n\n       (a) Petition; Right of Appeal.--Any person may obtain \n     judicial review of a final decision of the panel by filing a \n     petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Federal Circuit within 60 days after the publication \n     of such decision in the Federal Register. A copy of the \n     petition shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the Court to \n     the panel. The panel shall file in the court the record of \n     the proceedings on which the panel based its decision \n     (including any documents reviewed by the panel in camera) as \n     provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. \n     Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have \n     exclusive jurisdiction to affirm or set aside the panel's \n     decision, except that until the filing of the record the \n     panel may modify or set aside its decision.\n       (b) Additional Evidence and Arguments.--If the any party \n     applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence \n     respecting the decision being reviewed and shows to the \n     satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence or \n     arguments are material and that there were reasonable grounds \n     for the failure to adduce such evidence or arguments in the \n     proceedings before the panel, the court may order the panel \n     to provide additional opportunity for the presentation of \n     evidence or arguments in such manner and upon such terms as \n     the court deems proper. The panel may modify its findings or \n     make new findings by reason of the additional evidence or \n     arguments and shall file with the court such modified or new \n     findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the \n     modification or setting aside of the decision being reviewed.\n       (c) Standard of Review; Finality of Judgments.--The panel's \n     findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the \n     record taken as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court shall \n     review the panel's legal conclusions de novo. The judgment of \n     the court affirming or setting aside the panel's decision \n     shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided \n     in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Public Disclosure After Final Decision.--Within 30 days \n     after a final decision that a document, as redacted by the \n     panel or in its entirety, is not protected from disclosure by \n     a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, \n     or trade secret protection, the panel shall direct that the \n     document be made available to the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs under section 903(a). No Federal, Tribal, or State \n     court shall have jurisdiction to review a claim of attorney-\n     client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret \n     protection for a document that has lawfully been made \n     available to the public under this subsection.\n       (e) Effect of Non-disclosure Decision on Judicial \n     Proceedings.--The panel's decision that a document is \n     protected by attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection is binding only for the \n     purpose of protecting the document from disclosure by the \n     Depository. The decision by the panel shall not be construed \n     to prevent a document from being disclosed in a judicial \n     proceeding or interfere with the authority of a court to \n     determine whether a document is admissible or whether its \n     production may be compelled.\n\n     SEC. 907. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n       The disclosure process in this title is not intended to \n     affect the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or \n     any Federal law which requires the disclosure of documents or \n     which deals with attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection.\n\n     SEC. 908. PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith Requirement.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall act in good faith in asserting claims of \n     privilege or trade secret protection based on fact and law. \n     If the panel determines that a tobacco product manufacturer \n     has not acted in good faith with full knowledge of the truth \n     of the facts asserted and with a reasonable basis under \n     existing law, the manufacturer shall be assessed costs, which \n     shall include the full administrative costs of handling the \n     claim of privilege, and all attorneys' fees incurred by the \n     panel and any party contesting the privilege. The panel may \n     also impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation if \n     it determines that the manufacturer acted in bad faith in \n     asserting a privilege, or knowingly acted with the intent to \n     delay, frustrate, defraud, or obstruct the panel's \n     determination of privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection claims.\n       (b) Failure to Produce Document.--A failure by a tobacco \n     product manufacturer to produce indexes and documents in \n     compliance with the schedule set forth in this title, or with \n     such extension as may be granted by the panel, shall be \n     punished by a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. A \n     separate violation occurs for each document the manufacturer \n     has failed to produce in a timely manner. The maximum penalty \n     under this subsection for a related series of violations is \n     $5,000,000. In determining the amount of any civil penalty, \n     the panel shall consider the number of documents, length of \n     delay, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, \n     and such other matters as justice requires. Nothing in this \n     title shall replace or supersede any criminal sanction under \n     title 18, United States Code, or any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 909.

A \n     determination or finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     this subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     bring a subsequent action under this section against any \n     tobacco product manufacturer or the applicability of \n     subsection (d) with respect to any such subsequent action.\n\n     SEC. 1410.

If the court \n     determines that the Secretary has proved by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the subject manufacturer's actions \n     or inactions are of such a nature that they present a clear \n     and present danger that the manufacturer will not attain the \n     targets for underage smoking reduction, the court may suspend \n     the subject manufacturer's annual limitation cap on civil \n     judgments.\n\n     SEC. 1411.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have reached an understanding with the \nSenator from South Carolina and the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Massachusetts that the Senator from Kentucky would like to \nspeak for half an hour. Senator Faircloth will be recognized for his \nfirst-degree amendment following the statement by the Senator from \nKentucky. Following that it is our understanding there will either be a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Faircloth amendment, or, if not, the \nFaircloth amendment will be disposed of, and following that it was our \nunderstanding that the other side of the aisle would have the next \namendment, and go back and forth as is the tradition of this body, from \none side to the other with amendments. All amendments which are in the \nfirst degree will be open, obviously, to second-degree amendments. As \nthe Faircloth amendment would be open to second-degree amendment, so \nwill the next Democrat amendment be open to second-degree amendments.\n  I expect shortly the Senator from Kentucky to come to speak for \napproximately half an hour. The Senator from North Carolina is \nagreeable. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could simply clarify that, also I \nthink we would put it in the context of the unanimous consent request \nthat first recognition be for the half hour to the Senator from \nKentucky. But if I could clarify it, we would request that the second-\ndegree amendments would be the right of the Democrat leader, and, \nlikewise, the first-degree amendment placed on the Democrat side would \nbe subject to a second-degree amendment by the Republican side. With \nthat understanding, we ask unanimous consent the Senate accept that as \nthe procedure for the first two amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? I am afraid at this time we just \nhave to have an understanding because it has not been cleared on either \nside. I am confident that understanding would be honored. But I don't \nthink we can lock it in as a unanimous consent agreement at this time. \nI would like to have the Senator from Kentucky, if it is agreeable to \nmy friends from South Carolina and Massachusetts, to have the Senator \nfrom Kentucky recognized for his statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are going into probably what can be \ncalled a frustrating period. It is difficult for me to in 30 minutes \nsay what is in my heart and on my mind as it relates to the tobacco \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, we need order in \nthe Senate please. If Senators and staff will take their audible \nconversations to the cloakroom, it would be appreciated. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair for his courtesies. He is a gentleman and \na scholar.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate begins what I hope is a productive \ndebate on S. 1415, the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking \nReduction Act. We have come a long way in this debate. But in the 15 \nweeks left in this session we also have a long way to go.\n  Nothing surprises me anymore concerning tobacco legislation. \nYesterday afternoon they asked me if I was surprised. I said no. I was \nangry. So, therefore, I wasn't surprised. Last year, I would not have \nbelieved the tobacco manufacturers, attorneys general, and public \nhealth groups would\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\nhave agreed on a comprehensive settlement. But on June 20, 1997, a \nnational settlement was announced. I would not have believed that the \nSenate Commerce Committee could have reported a bill of this magnitude, \nand to do so in only one day of markup. But on April 1st, under the \nleadership of the Senator from Arizona, the Commerce Committee did just \nthat by a vote of 19 to 1. Last Thursday, the Finance Committee \nmodified the bill again in only one day.\n  But part of the explanation for the success of the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee was his ability to get Senators to wait to debate \nmany issues. A lot of them were left to the Senate floor. This bill \nraises hundreds of billions of dollars. Estimates of the Commerce \nCommittee product range from $516 billion to almost $1 trillion. This \nis a tremendous amount of money by any standard. The Finance Committee \nincreased the taxes raised by this bill even further.\n  But not surprisingly, there is no shortage of ideas around here on \nwhat to do with the money. Some want to use it to offset tax cuts. Some \nwant to expand existing spending programs. Some want to fund new \nspending programs. The one thing nearly all of these ideas have in \ncommon is that they have nothing to do with youth smoking. We have \ntaken our eye off the problem of youth smoking. It is how can we raise \nmore money and spend it on other programs.\n\n  Somehow, almost miraculously, the two committee chairmen were able to \nget members of their committee to defer the debate on how to spend all \nof this money. But that debate cannot be deferred any longer, Mr. \nPresident--not if the Senate is actually going to pass a bill. With the \nconfusion that was expressed here yesterday, there are some who are \nbeginning to wonder if a bill can be passed.\n  How all of this money is used goes to the very heart of the bill, and \nuntil we answer these fundamental questions, it is impossible to say \nwith any certainty what kind of bill we have. Mr. President, there is \nan equally important issue that goes to the heart of the bill as well. \nIt will define what this legislation is really all about. There is no \nmore important issue to me personally than how we treat tobacco farmers \nand rural and tobacco-growing communities under this bill.\n  In many ways, tobacco farmers and tobacco-growing communities are the \ninnocent victims in this whole debate. They have not been sued. They \nhave not been accused of withholding documents or information. They \nhave not been accused of manipulating the tobacco grown on their farms.\n  Mr. President, tobacco farmers and tobacco-growing communities are \nscared about what is going on in Washington, DC. They are bewildered at \nthe almost daily barrage of hostile comments coming from various \nsources in this city. Most tobacco farmers are engaged in the same \nlivelihood as their fathers, their grandfathers, and in some cases \ntheir great grandfathers on the same farm and on the same ground.\n  Just like most Americans, tobacco farmers also don't want to see \nyoung people smoke. The poll in my State was something over 90 percent \nthat opposed youth smoking. But they are having a hard time figuring \nout what some of the difficulties in Congress have to do with youth \nsmoking. To most tobacco farmers much of the discussion in Congress \nsounds like an attempt to punish an industry with the youth smoking \nissue finishing a distant second. Tobacco farmers are being lumped in \nwith tobacco manufacturers.\n  A recent Congressional Quarterly article about the plight of tobacco \nfarmers quoted one farmer from King, NC, about the tobacco debate in \nCongress. He said, and I quote:\n\n       They are making us feel like drug dealers. That just burns \n     me up. They put us in the tobacco industry when all we are \n     doing is growing a legal crop.\n\n  Tobacco farmers have been on a roller coaster ride for several years. \nBut that ride has been almost out of control for the last year. Among \nthe greatest disappointments was the June 20th settlement agreement \nitself. That agreement, which threatens to throw the lives of tobacco \nfarmers into turmoil, did not provide one thin dime for tobacco \nfarmers. Zero. Zip.\n  The tobacco companies, attorneys general, and public health groups \nwho were huddled in hotel rooms putting the deal together did not even \ninvite tobacco farmers to the table. They would not let them in the \ndoor. It is tough to find words to express how insulting I found this.\n  The June 20th tobacco settlement included money for event sponsors \nwho would lose tobacco sponsorship under the settlement. The settlement \nhad money for teams or entries in such events. They had money for \nNASCAR races. They had money for rodeos. Somehow, they found $750 \nmillion for these people. But there was nothing for tobacco farmers.\n\n  Mr. President, tobacco farmers in my state were at first shocked by \nnews of the settlement. Then they became angry. I encouraged them not \nto get mad, but to get to work. I urged them to come up with a plan for \nthemselves, to help tobacco farmers and tobacco growing communities \ndeal with the settlement. And Mr. President, tobacco farmers did go to \nwork. I pledged to them last summer that I would do everything in my \npower to represent their interests, and to see to it that a proposal \ndrafted by tobacco farmers would be included in any legislation \nconsidered by Congress. I'm here today to keep my word.\n  Mr. President, there are 124,000 tobacco farm families producing the \ncrop across 20 states in this country. That represents 6 percent of the \nfarms in the United States. Most of these farms are in the southeast. \nOn average, these tobacco farms are 126 acres--about one-third the size \nof the average U.S. farm. So we're talking about small, family farm \noperations.\n  In Kentucky, tobacco is produced in 119 of 120 counties. Two-thirds \nof the farmers in my state produce tobacco. They average about 4 acres \nof tobacco. It is less than 3 percent of their cropland, yet it brings \nabout 25 percent of their farm income. Most tobacco farmers in my state \nhave family incomes of less than $35,000--including non-farm income. \nMake no mistake, we're talking about middle to low-income families.\n  The tobacco settlement will have a significant negative impact on the \nfamily farms in my state, and this impact must be considered in any \ntobacco legislation.\n  Tobacco farmers started meeting last summer to deal with the impact \nof the settlement. They came up with three general principles for \ntobacco settlement legislation: (1) the legislation must preserve the \nfederal tobacco program; (2) fair compensation should be provided to \ntobacco farmers should their ability to produce the crop be diminished; \nand (3) the impact on tobacco farming communities should be taken into \naccount.\n  Mr. President, farms in my State and other States are valued with the \nquota. If the quota under the so-called Lugar-McConnell bill is \nimplemented, from $2 billion to $4 billion in reduction of farmland \nvalue will occur in the fourth year because we lose the quota. What \ndoes that do? It has a rippling effect on local taxes, the tax base, \nthe income for the cities and the counties, our school systems, to say \nnothing of the business community of these small communities.\n  After countless meetings among tobacco farming groups from states \nlike Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and \nGeorgia, an outline of a tobacco farmer proposal came together. We \nworked hard to iron out details and put ``meat on the bones.''\n  I daresay, Mr. President, there are not many Senators who have sat on \nthe porch of many grocery stores and talked to farmers. There are not \nmany Senators in this body who have sat in the kitchen and had a cup of \ncoffee with farm families, talking about what is about to happen to \nthem and their future. I think I understand and feel what they say \nbecause I grew up on a farm and I raised tobacco until I was drafted \ninto World War II.\n  Finally, last October, I introduced the Long-term Economic Assistance \nfor Farmers Act, or one we refer to as the LEAF Act. It was cosponsored \nby 9 tobacco state Senators.\n  But our work didn't stop there. We continued to work through the \nwinter and spring to improve the proposal. Finally, after nine months \nof work, a consensus proposal was developed to assist tobacco farmers \nand their communities.\n  We have provided direct payments to farmers in the event their \nability to\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\nproduce declines. This is the very heart of the LEAF Act. It is \ndesigned to make farmers whole as the value of their assets decline.\n  We also made changes to make tobacco companies pay for any possible \nadministrative provisions associated with the tobacco program. Mr. \nPresident, I have been working for 16 years to eliminate any \nopportunity for critics to claim that there is a tobacco ``subsidy.'' \nIn 1982, we started requiring tobacco farmers to pay for the tobacco \nloan program. I worked closely with Senator Helms to achieve these \nchanges. Senators Thurmond, Hollings, and Warner were all in the Senate \nat that time, and will remember these changes.\n  In 1986, we required tobacco companies to share in these costs. The \ntobacco loan program has operated at no net cost to taxpayers since \nthat time. Still, there were criticisms. Salaries at USDA, crop \ninsurance, and extension services all are partially attributable to \ntobacco. Mr. President, under the LEAF Act, all of these costs--and any \nother conceivable USDA cost associated with tobacco--will now be paid \nby tobacco companies. There will no longer be any basis, directly or \nindirectly, to allege that there is a tobacco subsidy. All possible \ntaxpayer costs have been eliminated under the LEAF Act.\n  And you know something, Mr. President. Our tobacco farmers make an \nextra payment, a deficit reduction payment that is taken out of their \ncheck before they get it from the warehouse and it goes to the general \nfund. Last year, it was almost $32 million. And not another farmer in \nthis country--maybe the peanuts--makes a payment out of their check \ncalled a budget reduction payment. It was over $32 million last year.\n  Mr. President, we have wanted to look beyond the tobacco farmer and \nthe tobacco program. The LEAF Act attempts to take a broader view and \ndeal with the entire impact on tobacco communities and the next \ngeneration.\n  Why is it so important? We had to have some financial underwriting of \nthe 13 colonies--and that was tobacco through Virginia. They underwrote \nthe debt of the colonies. It has been around a long time. ``Mr. Jones \ncame in to buy his spring planting and paid for it with some of the \nfinest tobacco I have seen''--a quote from history. That was before we \nbecame colonies. The pages of Virginia history are splattered with \ntobacco juice. Just think about it. And they want to do away with it \novernight. It cannot be done.\n  We've included economic development assistance. We've included grants \nfor higher education for the children of tobacco farm families. And we \nhave included assistance for displaced workers who have jobs in \nwarehousing, processing, and manufacturing tobacco. We understand \nthings are changing for tobacco and we want to prepare these \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I'm grateful to Senator McCain for his leadership in \nincluding the LEAF Act as Title Ten of S.1415. It's an essential part \nof the overall picture. It must be included in any tobacco settlement \nlegislation. The LEAF Act has broad support among tobacco farming \ngroups. It's supported by the public health community. President \nClinton, who visited Kentucky in April, announced that the LEAF Act \nsatisfies his fifth principle for tobacco legislation of providing \nassistance to tobacco farmers and tobacco growing communities.\n  But let me provide fair warning, Mr. President. I will keep my pledge \nto my tobacco farmers. I will do everything in my power to oppose \nattempts to undermine the LEAF Act, or attack the federal tobacco \nprogram, or threaten the ability of tobacco farmers in my state to deal \nwith the impact of the national tobacco settlement.\n  How many farmers out there have 98 percent of their product \ncontrolled by four companies? There is no leverage. The tobacco farmers \nhave no leverage if we don't have a tobacco program. We have four \ncompanies that handle 98 percent of all the product, so if we don't \nhave that, we are at their mercy.\n  I don't know how many farmers around here have heard of ``farm buy.'' \nThey just go directly to the farm and buy it from big farmers, and the \nsmall farmer is gone, has no leverage whatsoever. And, as we see, \npeople attack the farm program. A proposal has been made which is \nnothing short of a thinly veiled bribe to offer larger tobacco farmers \na promised lump-sum payment in exchange for eliminating the tobacco \nprogram. We found out yesterday it is not a lump sum payment, it is 3 \nyears. And if you look at the bill that was introduced, that is before \nthe Senate, 50 percent of all the money goes to the States and 40 \npercent of that money will be taken up by the McConnell-Lugar bill. \nThat leaves 10 percent for everybody else. But in the bill it says only \n16 percent of the money can go to the farmer.\n  Where are we on this--40 percent we would have to take in order to \npay for it, yet the bill says only 16 percent? We are going to try to \ncorrect that if we can, because it is talking out of both sides of the \nmouth, and you can't do that around here--only for awhile.\n  This is a classic example of Washington telling people, ``We are \nsmarter than you.'' But it simply won't work. Tobacco farmers want to \nkeep a supply management program. For 3 years, every 3 years, farmers \nvote on whether to keep the tobacco program. Earlier this year, farmers \nof flue-cured and burley tobacco, the two largest types of tobacco, \nvoted overwhelmingly to keep the program. In a referendum conducted by \nUSDA for both types of tobacco, almost 98 percent of tobacco farmers \nvoted to keep the program. But now some in Congress want to tell \nfarmers that, ``We are smarter than you.'' That is what is wrong with \nthis place. That is why people don't like us. There are 98 percent of a \ngroup saying, ``This is what we would like to have and what we would \nlike to keep.'' And what do we say up here? ``You don't know what you \nare talking about. This is what is good for you. This is what is good \nfor you. So you don't know what you are talking about, and we are going \nto take care of it for you.''\n  So, 98 percent of those down there who voted, it doesn't make any \ndifference what you do. This is typical Washington, DC, arrogance. I \nhave already discussed how my small, average tobacco farmer--there are \n124,000 of those, but there are only 4 large manufacturers, controlling \nover 98 percent of the cigarette market. This disparity in bargaining \npower could not be greater. Unless tobacco farmers have some mechanism \nto bargain together jointly, they are helpless; they are helpless in \ndealing with the large tobacco manufacturers. The tobacco program \nprovides that mechanism, and it must not be tampered with as a part of \nthis legislation.\n  The focus of the bill should be, must be, youth smoking. I voted for \nsmoke-free schools. I have voted, tried every way I can, to stop youth \nsmoking. So I have no apologies to make, because I want to stop it. \nOver 90 percent of the people polled in my State want to stop it. But \nthe focus of this bill must be on youth smoking, which is to focus on \nwhat will work to reduce youth smoking.\n  Youth smoking rates peaked in the 1970s. Starting in about 1979, \nyouth smoking rates began to decline and continued to decline through \nthe 1980s. Then, about 1991 or 1992, they started to climb again. No \none knows exactly why. And guess what; youth alcohol use started to go \nup at the same time, binge drinking started to go up, marijuana use \nstarted to go back up. In fact, youth usage of marijuana has been \nincreasing faster than cigarette smoking during the 1990s. So far, \nCongress has failed to look broadly at all these trends. Surely this is \nmore than a coincidence. When we look at the causes of youth smoking \nincreases, we should also look at drinking and illegal drug use.\n\n  The American people seem to have a better sense of that than \nCongress. They seem to realize that teenage behavioral changes are more \ncomplex than just tobacco, and the youth tobacco rates have been \ninfluenced by more than just slick advertising by the tobacco industry. \nIn fact, one recent poll verified these opinions. A Tarrance Group/KRC \nresearch poll conducted earlier this month asked people why they \nthought youth smoking rates had been going up. Mr. President, 58 \npercent said the influence of peers and friends was the main reason; 18 \npercent said the parents' example was the main reason; 12 percent said \nHollywood, television, and popular culture were the main reasons; and \nonly 6 percent said the tobacco industry and advertising\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\nwere the main reasons--only 6 percent. So we have a lot more to learn \nabout this issue, and I think, really, how little we do know should \nhave an influence on how broad we make this legislation.\n  I have serious concerns about the size of the legislation. These \nconcerns existed even before the Finance Committee took its action to \nincrease the size of the bill. First, the bill as reported by the \nCommerce Committee appears to contain language never considered by the \ncommittee on April 1. I am specifically referring to the annual \npayments made by the industry. In the McCain committee amendment \nadopted by the committee, the annual payment starting in the sixth year \nwas set at $21 billion, plus an adjustment up for inflation and down \nfor volume. However, in the reported bill, the sixth-year payment is \nthe ``adjusted applicable base amount,'' which it defined as the amount \nof the preceding year, which appears to be $23.6 billion. I do not know \nwhere the language came from. I do not recall it ever being approved by \nthe committee. However, it appears they add $2.6 billion per year for \n20 years to the cost of the bill. In other words, it appears that $52 \nbillion has been added to the cost of the bill. I hope we can clear up \nsome of these things.\n  Mr. President, OMB proceeded to take a number of misleading steps to \nachieve competing objectives. They totally omitted the bill's revenue \nimpact on prices in several respects. They ignored any costs from \nfuture legislation and attorneys' fees. They ignored additional \nregulatory costs of complying with the bill. They ignored price \nincreases resulting from higher sales taxes, State excise taxes, \nwholesale and retail margin increases, manufacturers' future price \nincreases, and they ignored the new licensing fee in title XI.\n  But perhaps the most offensive manipulation by OMB involved their \nconflicting projected volume declines. OMB projected youth smoking \nwould decline by 60 percent when calculating the look-back penalties, \nbut they projected youth smoking to decline by only 29 percent when \ncalculating the price-per-pack increase.\n  As we say down in Kentucky, there is something about that that ain't \nright. But you need a small consumption decline to make the price-per-\npack increase smaller. OMB just had it both ways. They changed the \nprojections to say the bill costs $516 billion and raises the price by \n$1.10.\n  Mr. President, I have Wall Street Journal analyses, I have all these \nthings I could read here this morning. I don't know how much time I \nhave left. It is probably getting close to the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FORD. Good. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me also outline several other concerns I have with S. 1415 which \nI hope can be corrected or improved during the debate.\n  First, we have continuing concerns about the potential for a black \nmarket. We say we can stop that, but Mexico sells cigarettes that I \nsmoke for 90 cents to $1 a pack at retail. Indian reservations are \nselling cigarettes at a retail of around $1.20. If these new estimates \nare correct, we are creating a disparity in price of up to $4 a pack. \nThis is well above the level experts say will cause black market \nactivity. In fact, we already have a considerable amount of smuggling \nin this country because of the large State excise tax increases in \nrecent years. A disparity in price of only 50 to 60 cents per pack has \nalready proven to be enough to create black market incentives, and they \nare going on right now within our own country. Canada fussed at us, you \nknow, when they raised their prices. Now we have two borders.\n  We raised prices that come from Canada and from Mexico, the Caribbean \nand wherever. These fellows do pretty good out there. They are called \ncartels. We have had a hard time stopping drugs from coming in. What \nare we going to do when cigarettes are added to that? When you go down \nto the skid, ``You want some cheap cigarettes or I have another menu on \nthe other side over here starting with marijuana.'' It is interesting \nhow we are going to provide for that and are playing into the hands of \nthose people.\n  The international provisions of title XI sets dangerous precedents, \nMr. President. If it were any other product, this would not even be \ntolerated. I hope title XI can be eliminated or substantially improved.\n  I have concerns that the bill gives the FDA excessive authority to do \nwhat I suspect they wanted to do for the last several years--ban the \nproduct. It is my hope that we can place reasonable limits on the \nunbridled authority.\n  Several serious constitutional concerns have been identified, \nparticularly since the tobacco manufacturers are unlikely to sign on to \nthis legislation. Late last month, four State attorneys general sent a \nletter to Senator Hatch outlining these concerns. Constitutional \nconcerns throw into jeopardy the advertising and marketing \nrestrictions, the upfront payment, the look-back provisions, the \ndocument disclosure section, and the so-called corporate culture \nlanguage.\n  These are legitimate concerns. Each one will have a suit filed. It \nwill be completed. They will file another suit. It will be completed, \nand we will be in court under these provisions for a long, long time. I \nhope these concerns can be addressed as well.\n  Mr. President, a recent Wall Street Journal poll showed that \nAmericans have serious doubt about the motives behind this debate. By a \nnearly 2-to-1 margin, a majority of the people thought the current \ndebate was more about raising taxes to pay for new programs than it was \nabout reducing youth smoking. We have a chance to change some views \nwith the way this debate on the bill is conducted and the final \nproduct.\n  I have two overriding tests for the final product produced on this \nfloor: No. 1, does the bill adequately compensate and protect farmers \nand farming communities? And No. 2, is the bill more about reducing \nyouth smoking or punishing an industry?\n  I look forward to the debate and the opportunity to find the answers \nto many of these problems. I say to the Chair and to my colleagues in \nthe Senate that I am going to do whatever I can to be sure that the \nfarming community is protected in this bill. With the procedure that \noccurred late yesterday, to undo all of the work for 10 long months \nthat many of us have put into this legislation, to undo it in a motion \nis a serious thing. I think it rubbed some of us a little bit the wrong \nway, as we say. There will be some scorched-Earth approach as we \ndevelop this. If we can work out something, I would love to do it. But \nI will not work out anything that does not compensate and take care of \nthe farmers who I am here to represent, and I intend to represent them \nas long as I can stand and as long as people will listen to me. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I can just inquire, it was my \nunderstanding--if I can just inquire----\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield without losing my right to the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand. I ask the Senator from Texas how long he \nwill be speaking, because I understood the Senator from North Carolina \nwas going to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make an opening statement on the \nbill. I want to cover quite a few areas. I always try to be brief but \nit is going to take me a reasonable amount of time to complete my \nstatement. What I would like to suggest is that I go ahead and make my \nopening statement--and I will try to do it as briefly as I can--and \nthen I will yield the floor and allow the normal process to continue.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating our dear \ncolleague, Senator McCain, for the leadership he has provided on this \nbill. Senator McCain was asked to report a bill out of the Commerce \nCommittee. He didn't get an opportunity to choose who was on the \ncommittee. He didn't get the opportunity to write the bill as he would \nhave chosen to write it. But his mission, as assigned him by the \nmajority leader, was to report a bill from the Commerce Committee.\n  Serving as a member of the Finance Committee which got sequential \nreferral of this bill and, in the process,\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\nmade the bill worse, I begin by saying that no matter where I end up on \nthis bill, I congratulate Senator McCain for the work he has done in \nbringing the best bill he could, given the committee he had to work \nwith and the many interests competing against each other on this bill.\n  While we are not on the same side today, I hope that at the end of \nthe process, after conference, perhaps we will be on the same side, but \nI want to make it clear that, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that \nwhen we debate a big issue--and this is a very big issue--often we \nstand on the floor of the Senate and talk about things that not only \ndon't mean very much to the American public, but often don't mean very \nmuch to us.\n  Today we are debating a very big issue: hundreds of billions of \ndollars of taxes, hundreds of billions of dollars of spending, a high \nand noble purpose trying to prevent children from smoking and, in the \nprocess, affecting their health. So this is a big issue.\n  I simply lament that so much of the debate is tainted by trying to \nimpugn the motives of people who are engaged in the debate. We have all \nseen ads run in the paper that refer to this as the McCain bill which \nis aimed at raising taxes and increasing spending. The bill does raise \ntaxes, it does increase spending, but that is not the intent of the \nSenator from Arizona. There is no doubt in my mind that he has brought \nus the best bill that his committee was capable of writing.\n  Let me also say that anyone who opposes the bill knows that they are \nimmediately going to be tarred as being the spokesman for the tobacco \nindustry, which in this debate has become the embodiment of all evil on \nthis Earth. I just lament, going into the debate, that we cannot simply \ndebate the issues without getting into impugning the motives of the \npeople who are involved in the debate.\n  While it may sound trite to many people who might watch this debate, \nlet me say that I believe that for all practical purposes, everyone \ninvolved in this debate in the Senate is trying to do what they believe \nis right, and they are neither the servant, in their own minds, at \nleast, of those who want a massive increase in taxes and spending, nor \nare they the servant of the tobacco industry.\n  It is a shame that when you debate a really important issue, that \nrather than being able to simply focus on the substance of the issue, \nyou end up being pigeonholed, with the debate focused around whose \ninterest you supposedly speak for.\n  Obviously, the first question we have to ask on this bill is, What is \nthe primary effect of the bill? This bill, obviously, raises taxes by \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Depending on the estimates you look \nat--they vary greatly--there is as much as a $200 billion difference in \nthe estimates as to how much money this bill raises. But once you get \nto $500 or $600 billion, arguing about another $100 or $200 billion \ndoes not really add much to the debate.\n\n  The bottom line is this bill is a huge tax bill by any definition of \n``tax bill.'' It is also a massive spending bill. In fact, we will have \nnever passed a bill--let me state it as my opinion. In trying to look \nback and attempt to fit this bill into the broad range of legislation \ndealt with by Congress, it is hard for me to find an initiative that is \nthis big in terms of its fiscal impact since Lyndon Johnson was \nPresident in the first year after the Kennedy assassination. So this is \na big bill--big taxes, big spending, and a big and noble objective.\n  The first point I would like to comment on is, Is this about tax and \nspend, or is this about children smoking? We have ads in the newspapers \nevery day arguing one point or another. We have ads running in many of \nthe States urging our colleagues to not band together with the \ncigarette companies against our children. We have ads in the paper \nurging other colleagues to not participate in tax or spend. How can you \nferret out what the truth is? Well, obviously, it is a very difficult \ntask. But let me tell you what I think are some of the hallmarks we \nought to look at in trying to ferret out the truth.\n  Let me try first to define the question more precisely. Are we \nraising tobacco taxes to prevent children from smoking or to fund new \nspending programs? It seems to me that is a fair question to begin with \nin this debate. And let me tell you what I think would be some of the \nhallmarks you would find if the tax increase were to deter smoking \nrather than to fund programs and the hallmarks you would find if it had \ninstead become a piggy bank for massive new spending.\n  If the objective of the tax increase was simply to discourage \nsmoking, then I think what we would find would be an effort to give the \nmoney back in tax cuts because the objective would be to affect the \nprice of cigarettes, not--Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. If we could take \naudible conversations from the floor to the cloakroom.\n  Mr. FORD. I am glad it is audible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If we could take the less audible \nconversations to the cloakroom, it would be appreciated.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think if you were looking at a rational \npolicy to deter the consumption of an item by raising its price, but \nyour objective was not to collect a huge amount of money to spend and \nyour objective was solely to get people to reduce their consumption of \nthat product, it seems to me that one of the hallmarks of such a \nprogram, one of the outward and visible signs of that objective, would \nbe the imposition of an excise tax to raise the price of that product. \nBut you would try to offset the bulk of that with a tax cut that was \nmore or less aimed at giving tax cuts to people in the same income \ngroups as those who would be paying the higher taxes so that you would \nnot be lowering their real income.\n  But in this case, I simply note, Mr. President, in looking at this \nbill we do not see that happening. In this bill, we are seeing hundreds \nof billions of dollars of new taxes, but we are seeing none of this \nmoney given back to the people who are paying these taxes. So I would \nthink that is evidence that raising revenues to fund new spending plays \na significant role in this bill and in the final outcome of the bill, \nwhether or not that is the stated objective of the legislation.\n  I think a second hallmark of a bill that has turned into a giant \npiggy bank would be the kind of spending which occurs--have you ever \nnoticed when you are spending your own money you tend to spend it \npretty prudently, but when suddenly you have an opportunity, a \nfinancial bonanza to spend someone else's money, the spending becomes \nvery, very careless?\n  Well, I would pose as a question, in trying to determine if this is \nabout children or about money--what evidence is there in this bill of \ncareless spending? I want to just present two pieces of evidence. The \nfirst has to do with payments to attorneys. I know many Members of this \nbody are attorneys, and I am not going to get into all this business \nabout ``some of my best friends are attorneys,'' and I am not trying to \nbash attorneys, but I am trying to make a point about spending at a \nlevel that could only suggest this bill has become a piggy bank for \nmassive new spending.\n  Let me begin by looking at the amount of money going to attorneys out \nof this bill.\n  By almost anybody's measure, this bill will, if adopted, set out a \nprocedure where attorneys who have been involved in these cases will \nget a payment of at least $4 billion. Now, nobody knows what $1 billion \nis. Maybe Ross Perot does, but few others know what $1 billion is, so \nlet me try to convert it down to English.\n  In the lawsuits which have been settled and where billings have been \nsubmitted lawyers are said to be seeking $5.7 billion.\n  Now, let me try to convert that into something which people can \nunderstand. If the lawyers who have worked on these cases were paid \n$1,000 an hour for an estimated total of 200,000 hours they have spent \non the lawsuits which have occurred to date, they would be owed $200 \nmillion, but they are reported to be seeking $5.7 billion or close to \nan average of $30,000 an hour and the effective rate of compensation in \nthis bill could be--let me swallow before I say the number--$100,000 an \nhour. Now, I ask my colleagues, what kind of legislation would we ever \npass,\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\nin representing the 260 million people who live in this country, that \nwould pay anybody $100,000 an hour to do anything? The plain answer, we \nall know, is that we would never, ever, pass an appropriations bill \nthat compensated somebody at $100,000 an hour. In fact, we would be \nvery much challenged and probably criticized--and probably justly--if \nwe were compensating people $1,000 an hour.\n\n  Now, what does it suggest about this bill? Let me make it clear, we \nare going to have a debate about lawyers' fees, and I will have a lot \nto say when we have the debate, but my purpose here is not to mock the \nfact that we could be paying $100,000 an hour to lawyers under this \nbill. My point is a far more important point, and that is, how could \nyou have a bill that paid $100,000 an hour? The only way you could have \na bill that paid $100,000 an hour is if you had put together a bill \nthat had massive amounts of money that are not viewed as money that has \ncome from real taxpayers and, therefore, you have sort of a ``slam it \nup against the wall'' kind of approach to distribute the money. Only in \na bill where the objective was to raise revenue and spend it without \nany regard for the priorities of spending it could you possibly end up \nwith a bill that would compensate attorneys at $100,000 an hour--\nespecially a bill that is sanctioned by the Federal Government and \nespecially a bill where the money is coming not from tobacco companies \nbut from people who are in families, 73 percent of them, that make less \nthan $50,000.\n  A look at the lawyer fees in this bill is an important piece of \nevidence, it seems to me, that needs to be looked at in this debate as \nto whether this is about smoking or whether it is about money.\n  The next issue is equally controversial, and I am not going to debate \nit here. I will probably get into the debate when we have amendments \nabout compensation to tobacco growers, but I want to make the same \npoint about the tobacco settlement with farmers that I made about the \nlawyers. Let me give a little short course on the history of American \ntobacco policy. Again, my purpose is not to criticize the policy of the \nsettlement but to make the point about how careless we have been in \nspending the hundreds of billions of dollars that are entailed in this \nbill.\n  The tobacco program started in 1938 as a way of trying to raise the \nprice of tobacco. It was a program instituted by the Government to \nbenefit the tobacco grower, and it was a program where we provided a \nproduction quota where the people who were growing tobacco in 1938 \nreceived quota based on the number of acres they were growing. The idea \nwas to limit production, to keep people out of the tobacco-growing \nindustry, and to make the price of tobacco products higher than they \nwould be in a competitive market. Not singling out tobacco here, we did \nit for virtually every other crop, but that is how the program started. \nThe program was an effort to use Government power to benefit tobacco \nfarmers, something not uncommon. We use Government power all the time \nto promote the interests of many groups, generally at the expense of \nthe consumer.\n  Now, what has happened over time is that more and more of the people \nwho own these quotas have moved off to the big cities, and when we are \ntalking about compensating tobacco farmers, you get the idea that we \nare talking about compensating people who are actually growing tobacco. \nThe great bulk of every proposal that has been made--from the Ford \nproposal to the Lugar proposal, to the Kennedy proposal, to the Robb \nproposal--a lot of proposals, but virtually all of these proposals are \nfocused fairly narrowly on compensating people who own the quotas, not \nthe people who grow the tobacco.\n  Now, why is this important? It is important because 63 percent of the \nquotas that the Government gave away in the first place are owned by \npeople who don't grow tobacco. So when we are going to compensate under \nthis program in the name of helping tobacco farmers, the truth is that \nthe great bulk of the money is going to people who don't grow tobacco \nbut they have often become very wealthy people by owning a benefit \nwhich the Government gave them, and they then leased that quota to grow \ntobacco to farmers who actually get out and farm tobacco, which is a \ntough, backbreaking business.\n\n  Now, getting to my point. What do you think would be a reasonable \ncompensation for us to give to the holders of these quotas to, in \nessence, end the program? Let me remind my colleagues that unless the \nbill has been changed and it has been rewritten--and I am eager to hear \nwhat the new provisions are--but unless they have been changed, we are \nnot talking about taking the land when we pay people. We are not \ntalking about barring them from growing tobacco. We are simply \ncompensating them for an effect that we believe this bill will have on \ndemand. And while we throw around numbers, the plain truth is, nobody \nknows what effect the bill will have on the demand for tobacco.\n  We are in the midst of a program where we are phasing out Government \nprice supports in the broad base of American agriculture through a bill \nreferred to as Freedom to Farm. Under this bill, we set up a 7-year \nprogram where we provide transition payments to farmers so that at the \nend of the 7 years they have the freedom to farm, the freedom to \nsucceed, and the freedom to fail. Let me say, it is one of the most \nenlightened policies we have instituted.\n  Here is my point: We have evidence for seven crops as to how much we \nhave paid people who grow those crops in return for phasing out the \nGovernment program. Let me just run through some of these costs. For \nwheat growers, we are paying them $125 an acre. That is to phase out \nthe wheat program. We pay it over 7 years, $125 an acre. For corn, we \npay $200 an acre, paid out over 7 years. For grain sorghum, we pay $131 \nan acre. For barley, we pay $70 an acre. For oats, we are paying $8.38 \nan acre. For upland cotton, we are paying $245.99 an acre. For rice, we \nare paying $714.09 an acre.\n  Now, how much do you think we are paying per acre in the least costly \ntobacco bill which has been proposed? Let me give you a hint. It is \nabout $18,000 an acre. Let me repeat that number. If we paid tobacco \nquota owners--not tobacco farmers; we are paying the people that own \nthe Government license; relatively little of the money is going to the \nfarmer--if we paid them the total of the amount per acre that we paid \nall of the other seven crops combined--in other words, we paid them \nevery penny we pay corn, wheat, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland \ncotton, and rice combined--we would pay them $1,495.78 per acre. If we \npaid them the combined amount for all 7 crops, it would be that amount, \nbut yet we are paying almost 18 times the amount we paid every other \ncrop combined to buy out tobacco producers.\n  And the final incredible paradox is that we have a market for tobacco \nquotas. In other words, I could go out this afternoon--I do not know if \nI could do it this afternoon because this bill is on the floor and I \nguess people think it might pass. But last week, I could have bought a \nquota to grow tobacco for $3,784. I could have bought a quota to grow \ntobacco for $3,784. That was the average cost of a quota, at least the \nonly number I could find last week. If people have other numbers, I \nwould be happy to be educated.\n  But we are getting ready to pay somebody who went out on Friday and \nbought that quota five times what they paid for the quota, and then we \nare still going to let them grow tobacco, and we are still going to let \nthem own the land.\n  I am not here today to criticize the tobacco program. I am here to \nraise the question, Is this bill about smoking or is it about money?\n  When we are paying lawyers $100,000 an hour and when we are paying \ntobacco growers, or at least the people who own the right to grow \ntobacco under a Federal licensing program, 18 times what we paid all 7 \nmajor crops combined to phase out their program, does it not suggest \nthat this bill is about money, and not only the use of money, the \nvulgar use of money? How can we justify these kind of numbers?\n  Let me make it clear. I have many colleagues from tobacco-producing \nStates. I don't have tobacco in my State. It is easy to pile on some \nState when you don't have the product grown in your State. I \nexperienced that with sheep and goat raisers. I am willing to support a \nbuy out of tobacco growers and the people who hold quotas. But I cannot \njustify the kind of figures we\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\nare talking about--18 times the combined buy out of all 7 other basic \nagricultural products when added together.\n  What does all of this suggest? It suggests that this bill is not only \nabout money and quantities of money, the likes of which we have seldom \nseen here, but it is also about the perilous use of this money where we \nare taking money and collecting taxes and we are distributing it to \nvarious interest groups and the lack of care with which we are \ndistributing it is clearly indicted by the amounts of money that we are \ngiving people.\n  We are going to get a chance to vote on both of these issues. I do \nnot want to enter into a debate about them here. I will debate both of \nthem when we get to them.\n  But the point I want to make is this: This is evidence that this bill \nis about money and not about teenage smoking. It is clear evidence, it \nseems to me, that in distributing this money the totals are so big that \nthere has not been great care taken with the distribution. Please \nrecognize that if working people got to keep the money, they would \nspend it wisely. Even if it were in the appropriations process in \nCongress, much of it might be thrown away but some of it might be used \nfor some good or objective effort.\n  I simply say this bill stands indicted in how careless we have spent \nhundreds of billions of dollars in dividing up this windfall, this \nwinning of the lottery, by the designation of this industry as the \nenemy of the people and thereby creating a right and a public demand \nthat we seize this money.\n  The next issue I want to talk about is the tax itself. On this issue, \nI think we have one of the greatest gulfs between the rhetoric of the \nbill and the reality of the bill that exists. The rhetoric of the bill \nis that we are taxing these tobacco companies. The rhetoric of the bill \nis these tobacco companies have conspired to deceive; these tobacco \ncompanies have conspired to induce children to smoke. I don't dispute \nthat. I think it is true. I think there is increasing evidence that is \ntrue. But the rhetoric is that somehow we are penalizing the tobacco \ncompanies and the tobacco industry with this massive bone-crushing tax \nof hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the rhetoric.\n  But what is the cold, hard reality? The cold, hard reality is that \nvirtually none of these taxes are being paid for by tobacco companies, \nand, in fact, we have an incredible provision in the committee bill to \nmake it a crime if the tobacco company absorbs any of the tax and does \nnot pass it through to the consumer. So not only does the tobacco \ncompany not pay these hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes, but we \nhave in this bill a provision--almost unimaginable--that makes it a \ncrime for the companies not to force the consumer to pay the tax. So \nnot only do we not tax the tobacco companies but we protect them in \ncase any of them would say, ``Well, look, I do not want to pass the \nwhole thing through but I would like more of the market.''\n\n  Who pays this tax? I would like to suggest that my colleagues ought \nto go out in Washington, DC, and walk the streets and try to take a \nlook at who is smoking. What they are going to find when they do that \nis that basically smoking in America, while there are exceptions to \nevery rule, smoking today is basically a blue-collar phenomenon. When \nyou look at the distribution of the tax burden, you see it as clearly \nas anything that is visible. The tax that this bill imposes, hundreds \nof billions of dollars of taxes, will be borne overwhelmingly by blue-\ncollar workers.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, 74 percent of the taxes that \nwill be collected under this bill will be paid for by Americans who are \nin families who have incomes of less than $50,000 a year.\n  So the rhetoric is we are taxing these big, evil, conspiring tobacco \ncompanies. But the cold reality is that not only are we not taxing \nthese tobacco companies, but we have provisions in the bill that \nprotect the tobacco companies from anyone not passing the tax through \nto the consumer.\n  So every penny, for all practical purposes, of hundreds of billions \nof dollars we are going to collect is coming from real honest to \ngoodness people who are buying tobacco products, the very victims of \nthe conspiracy that this bill is said to rectify. The very victims of \nthe conspiracy that this bill is aimed at rectifying are the people who \nwill pay these taxes. And 74 percent of them are members of families \nwho earn less than $50,000 a year.\n  I don't have any intention, with all due respect, of hurrying up my \nstatement. I intend to cover each of these issues, and I am not going \nto delay them. I am certainly not filibustering.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a comment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Texas was not on the floor but we did \nhave an understanding that we would move forward with an amendment. I \nask the Senator not to deprive us of any information or knowledge that \nwe need from him. But we did have an understanding before the Senator \ncame to the floor. I could have blocked the Senator from taking the \nfloor. But I didn't choose to.\n  So I would appreciate it, if at least at some point we could move \nforward. I thank my dear friend from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say, I understand the Senator from Arizona wanting \nto move the bill forward. There are some key points that need, I \nbelieve, to be made before we start voting on amendments. I am not \ngoing to be in any way dilatory. I have several other issues I want to \ncover. But I will move with all due speed in covering them.\n  But I do want to say that we have a bill that has come to the floor \nwithout objection. We are debating it and I want to make it clear that \nwe are going to debate this bill. We are going to have a full airing of \nviews. It is imperative that we all understand what is in the bill. I \nintend to object to the unanimous consent requests that would limit my \nright or the right of other Senators. This is the Senate.\n  I remind my colleagues that when Jefferson came back from France \nwhere he had been Minister to France when the Constitution was written \nand he asked Washington what the Senate was for--and many of you know \nthe story--Washington, being a southerner, often cooled his tea in a \nsaucer before he drank it. Jefferson asked him what the Senate was for. \nIf you had the House, what did you need the Senate for? And Washington \nexplained to Jefferson that in moments of heated public passion, the \nheat of public opinion would overwhelm the House but the Senate would \nbe like this saucer, as he poured his tea into his saucer to cool, and \nit will cool passions before it acts.\n\n  So I do not intend to delay, but I do not intend to be hurried \neither, nor do I intend to have my rights limited even by my dearest of \nall friends, Senator McCain.\n  Now, 74 percent of the taxes that are collected under this bill are \ncollected from Americans who are in families that have incomes of less \nthan $50,000 a year. Far from taxing the evil tobacco companies, the \ncold reality is, as much as we would like it to be otherwise, as much \nas we would like to convince ourselves and others that it is otherwise, \nthis is a massive, regressive, crushing tax on blue-collar America.\n  Let me give you a figure which is astounding to me, and if it weren't \nfrom the Joint Tax Committee I would question its validity. But listen \nto this number. Of Americans who make $10,000 a year or less--very-low-\nincome Americans--if we pass this bill, we will raise the percentage of \ntheir income coming to the Federal Government by 41.2 percent.\n  Let me give you that number again. For people in America who earn \n$10,000 or less, so substantial is the impact of this cigarette tax on \nthe amount of their income coming to the Federal Government that the \npercentage of their income going in Federal taxes will increase by 41.2 \npercent from this cigarette tax increase alone.\n  Who is paying this tax? Americans who make less than $10,000 a year \nare seeing their Federal taxes rise by 40 percent as a result of this \nbill. Those who make between $10,000 and $20,000 will see their Federal \ntaxes rise by 9.8 percent. Those who make between $20,000 and $30,000 \nwill see their Federal taxes rise by 4.4 percent. Needless to say, by \nthe time you get down to us, Members of the Senate, we see our Federal \ntaxes--relatively few of us smoke, but on average people who make more \nthan $100,000 will see their Federal taxes rise by only .1 percent.\n  So I think we are going to have to come to grips with one clear fact \nabout\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\ntaxes: We are not taxing tobacco companies. We are not taxing \nevildoers. We are not taxing conspirers. We are taxing victims.\n  I hate pulling my mama into the debate, but it is such a beautiful \nexample, I can't resist. My mother is 85 years old. She smokes \nMarlboros. I have spent my 55 years of life trying to get her to quit \nsmoking, and I have failed. And now the doctors tell me that one part \nof her that is still in relatively good shape is her lungs. So I have \nquit trying to get my mother to stop smoking. I still believe it would \nbe good for her not to smoke, but I can't get her to stop.\n  But here is the point. The whole logic of this bill is saying to \nFlorence Gramm, ``Florence, you have been exploited. Joe Camel has made \nyou smoke for 65 years. The tobacco companies, through their \nadvertising, have forced you to smoke. And in doing so, they have \naffected your health. They have perpetrated a terrible evil, and we are \ngoing to do something about it.''\n  So Florence asks, ``Well, what are you going to do about it?'' Well, \nwhat are we going to do about it? We are going to make my 85-year-old \nmother pay higher taxes. So we tell her she is exploited. We are \noutraged about it. The President is outraged about it. We are outraged \nabout it. So what do we do to her to show her how outraged we are? We \nraise her taxes.\n  Now, please forgive me if I seem to be struck by the incredible \nparadox that under this bill the victim is penalized and the \nperpetrator of the fraud is not only not penalized, not taxed, but \nprotected by an incredible provision that forces those who might not \npass through all of the tax to my mother to do so.\n  One final point before I leave taxes in my effort to get on and \nfinish my opening comment goes back to this evidence. What is the \nevidence that this is about getting people to quit smoking, and what is \nthe evidence that this is about money? Well, let me give you a clear-\ncut piece of evidence. If the objective of the bill was to get people \nto quit smoking, you would put the tax on full tilt on day 1. When an \namendment was offered in the Finance Committee to raise the tax to \n$1.50 a pack, the proponent of the amendment offered it phased in over \na 10-year period so as to prevent a consumer backlash.\n\n  What is a consumer backlash? Why would you phase a tax in if the \nobjective is to get people to respond to the tax? Well, we all know. \nMany of us have served on the Finance Committee. All of us have been \ninvolved in debates that entailed tax increases. The reason you phase a \ntax in is to try to hide it from the taxpayer and to try to reduce the \nbacklash to it or the economic or political response to it, and the way \nyou do it is, you start it out small and then each year you make it \nbigger, hoping nobody notices. But isn't it an incredible paradox that \na tax which is supposed to be a tax to shock people into stopping \nsmoking is phased in so as to minimize the ``consumer backlash'' to it? \nIf the purpose of the tax was to get people to stop smoking, you would \nhit people with a tax at its highest level on day 1. Consumer backlash \nwould be what you want. But if the purpose was to raise money, then you \nwould phase in the tax.\n  I submit that the proposal before us, the amendment to raise the tax \nto $1.50, and every proposal save the one in Finance where I raised \nthis point, each of these proposals phases in the tax, and you would \nnever phase in the tax if the purpose of the tax was to get people to \nrespond to it and stop smoking. You would phase in the tax only if you \nwanted to minimize their response to it and their awareness of it. I \nthink that is additional evidence that the objective of this bill, or \nat least the likely result of it, is to raise hundreds of billions of \ndollars and spend the money. The bill is not structured in a way one \nwould believe it would be if its sole objective was to get people to \nquit smoking.\n  I have three final issues I want to talk about. The first issue is \none that weighs heavily on my mind. Maybe I am the only Member of the \nSenate who is concerned about this, but it is an issue that I am \ngreatly concerned about. We are setting a precedent for America's \nfuture with this bill. There are many elements of the bill that I am \nsympathetic to, but there is one element I am very frightened \nabout. Here is that element. It is stated in a clear form--maybe \noverstated, but I don't think so. What has happened in this bill is we \nhave picked, in this case an industry, and it has been so vilified that \nit is popular to tax the product it produces, even though the tax is on \nblue collar workers and not the tobacco companies. And the logic of \nthis is, because of the negative impact on people's health of consuming \nthis product, that tobacco, nicotine, is addictive, and the people who \nsell the product know that and market it in such a way as to get people \nto consume the product. So as a result, we are getting ready to impose \none of history's larger tax increases on the consumers of this product.\n\n  This is a view which basically says my mother is not to blame for \nhaving smoked for 65 years, it is not her fault; she was induced to \nsmoke by an industry which conspired to attract her as a customer, and \nto hold her as a customer. Now, if we take that view in this bill, \nthere is no way you can look at this bill without reaching the \nconclusion that we have decided my mother and the millions of other \npeople who smoke are victims and they have, against their will, made a \ndecision--if we divorce them from responsibility for their own \ndecisions, where does this end? Does anybody here who has ever known an \nalcoholic not believe that spirits, whiskey, alcohol is addictive? Is \nthere anyone listening to this debate anywhere, who has ever known \nsomeone who was an alcoholic, who doesn't believe you can get addicted \nto whiskey?\n  Next month, are we going to have this same--or next year--are we \ngoing to have the same process with regard to hard whiskey and beer and \nwine? Are we going to discover somewhere in the deep files of the \nliquor companies 10 years from now that they targeted their ads to \ntoday's 15 year olds?\n  Are we going to discover that the beer brewers have figured out what \nads to run to get us to go to the refrigerator and get a cool one? And \nare we going to start this process next year on alcohol? I don't see \nhow it can be otherwise. Does it end there?\n  When I go to McDonald's, attracted, as our President is attracted, \nagainst my will--I would like to be as thin as the Senator from South \nCarolina. But McDonald's and every other fast food producer in America \nconspire against me. They fill up the television with ads that attract \nme to go and to eat. They do studies to try to determine my weakness. \nAm I not victimized by McDonald's and Burger King? And, if I am \nvictimized, are they not liable? If I am not responsible, are they not \nresponsible?\n  Here is my point. I hope my colleagues will not take it as a trivial \npoint because I don't mean it as a trivial point. Where does this end? \nIf we don't hold people accountable for decisions they make, does it \nend with tobacco? Does it end with alcohol? Does it end with fattening \nfoods? Where does this debate end?\n  Let me submit the plain truth is everybody who has thought for a \nmillisecond about this issue has thought about this and nobody knows \nthe answer to it. And I submit this is a profound question we need to \npray over for an extended period of time before we set a precedent \nwhich says people are not responsible for the decisions they make and, \ntherefore, somebody else is responsible, and they can be made liable.\n  Two final points: Nobody is looking at black markets. We have a bunch \nof people who are talking as if they are economists and they know what \nthey are talking about. You know, we have all seen--many have repeated \nthe study--if you raise the price of tobacco by 10 percent, you are \ngoing to have a 6-percent decline in consumption. If you think about \nthat, everybody knows that is nonsense. So you could, by doubling the \nprice of cigarettes, eliminate smoking in America? Does anybody really \nbelieve that? But yet ads run every day with that figure in it. People \nrepeat it. Somebody made it up. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Europe has imposed very, very high taxes on tobacco. Has it stopped \nteenage smoking? No. Has it stopped adult smoking? No. Will raising the \nprice of cigarettes--other things being the same--have some marginal \nimpact on tobacco use? Yes. But can we say for\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nevery 10 percent we raise prices, consumption will decline by 6 \npercent? Absolutely not. Any good freshman student in economics would \nlaugh at such an assertion.\n\n  But even more laughable is the arrogance of government. Let me just \ngive you some facts. Great Britain has imposed a very high price on \ntobacco. But have they been able to enforce the tax? The answer is no. \nFifty percent of the British market for cigarettes today, according to \nan article by Bruce Bartlett in the Wall Street Journal, and a fairly \ncomprehensive study he has done at the National Center for Policy \nAnalysis and the De Tocqueville Institute--what he has found is that \ncountries that have imposed high tobacco taxes have seen an explosion \nin black market sales of cigarettes and, as a result, the cigarettes \nsell at substantially below the price with the tax, and in some cases \nthey sell at less than they sold for before the new tax.\n  When Britain has 50 percent of its cigarettes that are bought on the \nblack market and smuggled into the country, or are produced illegally \nthere, when Italy has 20 percent, when Spain has 23 percent, when even \nStates in our country at the low level we now tax relative to the \nlevels we are talking about here have experienced that, when there is \nmore money in smuggling cigarettes in Great Britain than in smuggling \n20 pounds of marijuana--should not we at least look and make some \nobjective judgment as to whether or not we are taking an action which \nwill fill our country up with illegal cigarettes, and so we will have \nsome hood on the corner who is saying to our children: Look, I can sell \nyou these cigarettes, these brands at this price; I can sell you \nmarijuana for this price; a little crack cocaine for this price. But \nyou know the response you get when you raise this issue? The response \nis that people who wouldn't know economics from ethnic studies say: \nThere is nothing to this.\n  There is everything to this. It is a cold reality that in Europe \nblack markets in cigarettes are now a way of life. I think in setting \nout a policy that is aimed at, at least nominally, getting our children \nnot to smoke, we need some hard evidence about black markets. If we \nhave black markets in Canada, if we have black markets all over Europe, \nif we have black markets in Asia, what is the reason to believe that we \nare not going to have black markets in the United States of America? I \nbelieve this is an issue which needs to be dealt with.\n  A final point and I will be through with my opening statement. I am \nloathe to do this because I know when I do it my telephones are going \nto ring off the wall, so people who work for me please forgive me. But \nyou get the idea in reading the newspaper in Washington, DC and in \nworking in the Senate that this issue is the all-consuming issue in \nAmerica; that this is an issue the whole world, at least our part of \nit, our constituencies, are focused on and nothing else. One of the \nthings I try to do is to find out what exists within the beltway and \nwhat exists in America, and try to determine what the public really \nthinks and what is it they want us to do.\n  So last month I got my office to keep pretty meticulous records about \nthe amount of information we were getting in our office about this bill \nand the tobacco issue. And, as of that period, ads had been run in the \nDallas Morning News and the Houston Chronicle--those are the two \nbiggest papers in my State. Some television ads, I believe, had been \nrun. So the question was, over a 30-day period, how many of the 19 \nmillion people in my State thought this was a big enough issue to pick \nup the telephone and call my office?\n  Let me give you the results. We had about 1,400 people call our \nWashington office and say, ``Don't raise taxes on cigarettes.'' Every \none of them was generated, as best we could tell--everyone called in on \na WATTS number and they had been triggered to do so.\n  Three hundred people called in and said, ``Raise taxes on cigarettes; \nsave our children.'' But as best we can determine, almost every one of \nthem was triggered with the use of a WATS line and by an organized \ngroup.\n  Here is the most revealing and important thing. Last month, in my \nseven offices in the State, so far as I am aware, virtually no one \ncalled on this issue. It is the No. 1 issue in Washington, DC. Ads are \nbeing run here, there, and everywhere. And in 30 days, virtually nobody \nwho actually had to pick up their phone and call, as they normally \nwould call an office--not triggered by a special interest group--called \nmy office on this issue.\n  Why is that relevant? Why it is relevant is, I think the Senate, as \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world, needs to take a step back \nand not stop considering the bill--far from it. But we need to not let \nthe special interests that are opposed to the bill or the special \ninterests that are for the bill dominate our thinking on this bill.\n  We need a broader perspective, and the plain truth is, this is not \nthe be all and end all of America. My view is, we need to be sure we \nknow what we are doing, and we need to do the right thing, because the \ntruth is, obviously we have all been told--every time I raise this \nissue in one of our closed meetings, people say, ``Yeah, but they \nhaven't run the TV commercial yet attacking you,'' or whomever. Let's \nnot underestimate the American people. My urging here is that we take a \nlong, hard look at this thing and we try to figure out what the right \nthing is and that we do it.\n  This is a very important issue. There is a lot of money involved \nhere. A lot of hard-working, blue-collar people are going to suffer, as \na result of this tax, a lower standard of living. A lot of people are \ngoing to get huge quantities of money.\n  Let me say that I don't have any doubt that the 1,400 people who \ncalled me against this bill on the WATS line were triggered by the \ntobacco companies, but I also don't have any doubt that almost all of \nthe 300 people who called me for it were triggered by the groups that \nhope to get billions of dollars from this bill.\n  As I see this thing, the only two clearly defined constituencies here \nare people who have a direct interest in the bill. I think we ought to \nlisten to them to see if they have anything to say, but I don't believe \nwe should be frightened of them. I believe we should try to ferret out \nwhat are the facts. I think we need to look at each and every one of \nthese issues: Who is paying the taxes? Who is hurt? Who is helped? How \nis the money being spent? Is the money being spent wisely? Are we going \nto affect teenage smoking? Is this the best way to do it? Is there a \nbetter way to do it? Do we do it without reallocating hundreds of \nbillions of dollars from blue-collar workers to basically bureaucrats \nand public interest advocates who--I don't know how they determine what \nthe public interest is to advocate it, and I am always suspicious of \nanybody who advocates the public interest, other than myself.\n  These are the things that I urge my colleagues to look at. Let's not \ndelay, but let's take the time to know what we are doing. Let's give \nsome prayerful thought about where we are going to be next year if the \nsame thing is happening to alcohol. Where are we going to be the next \nyear if the same thing is happening to the fast food industry? Where \ndoes all this end once you start it? I don't know the answer to this, \nbut I think we ought to know the answer before we start down this road.\n  Let me conclude by simply repeating the remark I made earlier, and \nthat is, I congratulate Senator McCain for his work in the Commerce \nCommittee. Having had a little opportunity to try to have a positive \nimpact in the Finance Committee, I have a greater appreciation of the \ndifficulty he faced. I think it is clear the Finance Committee made the \nbill worse in every respect than if they had never touched it. The \nquestion is, Given that we now have the bill on the floor, what can we \ndo to make it better?\n  I hope at the end of the process that I might be on the same side as \nthe Senator from Arizona. I think the better we understand the bill, \nthe better the chances are that we will serve the public interest and \nthat that will happen.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank the Senator from \nTexas, as always, for his thoughtful and insightful views. Obviously, I \nam not in agreement on a number of the things he said, but his and my \ndisagreements have always been very\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\nagreeable. I believe he has contributed an enormous amount. I do agree \nwith him, I don't know what would have happened if we had given the \nFinance Committee another 24 hours, which I think is, as he mentioned, \na cautionary lesson as to what we have had to go through and what we \nwill go through on the floor and what might have happened if it had \ngone to other committees.\n  Just one other point I want to make for my friend from Texas. Yes, \nthe attacks have started. Millions of dollars have been directed at me, \nso I do know what it is like. You say you don't know what it is like. I \nknow what it is like. I am a big boy, and I can take it, but I have \nbeen rather interested at the ferocity of these attacks and how \npersonal they have been. Obviously, I will not respond in kind. I would \nhave liked to have seen the tobacco companies spend some of this money \non trying to stop kids from smoking and other worthwhile efforts. But \nit is their right as corporate citizens to do so.\n  I mention to my colleagues, Senator Hollings has remarks that he \nwould like to make, and it is my understanding, after that, I say to \nSenator Faircloth, that we will propound a unanimous consent request \nwhich will make his amendment in order, with a motion to table at a \ntime certain after that. That will be at the completion of Senator \nHollings' remarks, so we can move forward with the amending process.\n  I thank Senator Faircloth for his patience and good humor throughout \nthis delay this morning. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas \nreminds me of that youngster who went to the psychiatrist. The \npsychiatrist drew some circles on the blackboard and said, ``Now what \ndo you think of?''\n  He said, ``Sex.''\n  He drew lines up and down. The youngster said, ``Sex.''\n  He drew some crosses. He said, ``Sex.''\n  The psychiatrist said, ``Young man, you're the most oversexed \nperson.''\n  The youngster said, ``Doc, you're the one drawing the dirty \npictures.''\n  The Senator from Texas is the one drawing the dirty pictures. I have \nnever heard so many extreme nonsensicals in my life. We want to keep \nhis dear mother here. No one is victimizing her. What we are going to \ntry to do is help the doctors to counsel her to stop smoking.\n  Let's get back to last June, almost a year ago, to show you how far \nout of kilter this thing has gotten.\n  What happened was, to the surprise of many--I did not know, and I do \nnot know of any Congressman or Senator who participated. I do not think \nthere was a Congressman at the table. I do not think there was a \nSenator at the table. But the tobacco companies, together with the \nStates attorneys general and the White House and the health community, \nannounced a dramatic settlement of $368 billion. That is without a \nCongressman or Senator even thinking in these terms.\n  I have been up here 30 years. And I have worked with the Cancer \nInstitute, Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler and others. Thirty-some years ago, \nyes, we put notification on a pack of cigarettes. And we have \nadmonished--I have seen demonstrations by the Cancer Institute that \nstopped me from smoking. But we have not done near what was announced \nlast June.\n  Last June, the communities got together on the basis of the companies \nstating, in essence, ``Look, we're tired of winning these cases.'' As \nwe speak on the floor of the Congress today, no one has won a jury \nverdict against a tobacco company, period. I think it is in the main, \non account of the publicity and the health and the notification of the \nassumption of risk, that smoking is dangerous to your health. The \ncompanies themselves are engaged in advertising Miller High Life Beer, \nKraft Foods; different other things of that kind, Ritz Crackers, what \nhave you.\n  They are good businessmen. They are not a bunch of crooks, as they \nare trying to be depicted here once the politicians got this particular \nissue. They have run a touchdown in all the directions and in all \nextremes. But what happened was the companies said, ``Look, rather than \npaying out all these costs to lawyers and winning every case after \ncase, why don't we get together and continue in an orderly fashion.''\n  We are not going to have prohibition. Even I heard Dr. Koop testify \nto that before our committee that no, he was not attesting to having \nprohibition. We are not going to have prohibition of tobacco. Tobacco \nwas here. The Indians were smoking it when we arrived.\n  Just the other day we had a celebration with our role model, the \nformer distinguished majority leader, Mike Mansfield, whom when you go \nto the Mansfield Room, he is very proud of that portrait of himself \nsmoking that pipe. And he is 95 years of age.\n  So we live in the world of reality. Hopefully, this Congress will get \nback to reality and not the nonsense that we have just heard of about \ntaxes and what the idea was and everything else of that kind.\n  The idea was to get an arrangement whereby the companies who could \nwin every advertising case about Joe Camel and everything else of that \nkind says, ``We'll stop advertising in this manner. We'll stop spending \nthat money on advertising. We'll stop spending this money on lawyers. \nAnd we'll make an agreement with you to pay in so much of our profits. \nNecessarily, you say that you want to raise the price because that is \nthe best control of tobacco consumption, so we'll go along with raising \nthe price.''\n  We live in the real world. I think it is $4 or $5 or something in \ndowntown London. I was visiting with a friend not long ago from Canada. \nHe picked out of his pocket and lit up a cigarette. And I said, ``How \nmuch, by the way, was that pack?'' He said, ``This one is $7, but in \nCanada it is $6 to $10.'' You see, that shocks us who really have not \npaid that close attention.\n  I never heard of any $360 billion, and I have been working on the \ndefense budget for years on end. That is only $245 billion. Here we \ncome with an amount that they agreed to pay themselves with an increase \nin the cost. The politicians coming around hollering, tax, tax, tax--\ntax and spend, tax and spend, and everything else, including the \ncompanies. Under the whole cloth, the tobacco companies are the ones \nwho thought of the idea of taxing $368 billion. And this just carries \nit up to $500 billion.\n  So they are the ones who gave us the idea that let us go ahead and \nsee how much, if you please, Mr. President, you could charge on \ncigarettes, as much as possible, to try to stop the smoking, pay for \nthe advertising, pay the States back for their Medicaid costs, start \nsome children's programs. Yes, they talk about it--tax and spend. The \nspending is on children, on helping to get children to stop smoking. \nThe distinguished Senator from Texas knows that. We are doing that, and \nwe are going to use that money to try to stop children from smoking.\n\n  And, you know, Mr. President, they went even further than I would \nhave gone if I had been their lawyer or I had been the CEO, and that is \ntake some kind of pledge and penalty for what they call ``look back.'' \nIt took me a long time--they said, ``We're going to be responsible for \nstopping smoking in America.''\n  Now, whoever heard of that? We have been trying to do it with \nnotification on the packages. The health community has been trying it. \nEvery doctor now will counsel you. So there is nothing new. But the \ntobacco companies are supposed to advertise in an adverse fashion and \npay a penalty that goes up, up and away if, as a company, they do not \ncomply or accomplish it.\n  Now, that was a pretty solid agreement that has been distorted in \nevery fashion here which does not seem to get any understanding because \nthe jackals have taken over now, cackling up here about tax and spend \nand everything else of that kind, going into $18,000 an acre, $100,000-\nan-hour lawyers' fees, and all these other things.\n  Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from North Carolina has an \namendment that he wants to put in--and I want to yield to him just as \npromptly as I can--relative to legal fees. And we will debate that and \nthe contribution made by trial lawyers.\n  Let me just state ahead of time, categorically--and I am looking over \nhere at a chart that says ``Minimal Ethics.'' Not at all, absolutely \nnot at all. I have\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nto say something about that chart. I cannot resist the temptation. I \nhave been at the trial bar, and if they think it is anything unethical, \nwe could go to the company lawyers who are now being investigated for \nconspiring with the company executives on how to avoid these charges \nand everything else of that kind.\n  Man, oh, man, talk about being unethical, after the abuse and the \nchallenge they have been through. There is a little attorney general \ndown there in Mississippi. I was just watching it the other night. I \nwas not that familiar with him--Mike Moore. He literally was sued by \nhis own Governor trying to bring tobacco to the bar of justice. But he \nstuck to his guns. Maybe they call that unethical bringing that case \nagainst the industry, or a contingent fee is unethical. But it goes for \nthe ``every mother's son'' the best of counsel. And corporate America \nand the Chamber of Commerce does not like that.\n  Billable hours, good Lord have mercy, we are going to get into a good \ndebate on billable hours. And there are 60,000 of them registered to \npractice in the District of Columbia, 60,000--oh, they got all lawyers \nin Japan right here in the District--59,000 will never see a courtroom \nor know anything about law. It's fixing me and fixing this one and that \none. It's fixing the jury. Unethical? Unethical? I want to hear what is \nunethical about trial lawyers compared to the billable hour crowd.\n\n  But back to the Senator from Texas, and he was talking about the \namount of money, the billions here, to buy out the farmers. At least we \nare paying the farmers who have been making a good living to get out of \nthat, not for those who didn't make a living, went broke, and we came \nand gave them food stamps to the tune of 431 billion bucks, Resolution \nTrust Company. Half of it was in the State of Texas. We bought every \nswimming pool, every tennis court, every golf course, every country \nclub that you could possibly imagine. It was improperly financed. You \nand I know it. Over $200 billion to one State. But they want to talk \nabout honest, hard-working tobacco farmers out there at the sweat of \ntheir brow being bought out of this particular business, coming up here \nwith all these fanciful figures; $18,000 an acre--that takes care of \nthe warehouse, that takes care of the bank on the loan, that takes care \nof the equipment, that takes care of the community, that takes care of \nhis children.\n  When he is out of the business, how do you send them to college? So \nyou let them come in on Pell grants. Yes, it is a comprehensive \napproach. The LEAF Act is intended, because we saw last fall that the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee wanted to just put them out of \nbusiness, and not take care of the communities.\n  I have I don't know how many farmers in South Carolina, I think about \n2,000 tobacco farms, over $200 million, a big cash crop. So when we saw \nthat, we moved. I want to say this categorically and just \ndispassionately, how shocked and dismayed I am to get into this \nparticular situation. The record ought to reflect it. When we saw the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee who said he had seen polls and \neverybody in tobacco farming wanted to get out of it, which is out of \nthe whole cloth. I have been traveling to tobacco farmers, campaigning, \ncrisscrossing all over the State. I never saw the tobacco farmers \ntrying to get out of the business, but that is what he said.\n  I said we are really in trouble. The distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, Senator Ford, and I, we have the LEAF Act and, yes, we \npositioned it. We knew what we were doing because the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee came to me and said, ``Evidently, \nthey are going to have a tough time getting a bill out of any \ncommittee, and the majority leader asked if we can get one out of our \ncommittee. I would like to have it bipartisan,'' the chairman said. I \nsaid, ``I would like to have it bipartisan, too, but we have to take \ncare of the farmers.''\n  He hesitated a few days and came back and said, ``All right, we will \ntake care of the farmers.'' And we went all the way down to Florence \nand said the LEAF Act was taken care of, taking care of the farmers. \nThe President of the United States went out to Kentucky and said the \nLEAF Act is taking care of farmers. We had five conferences trying to \nget this bill finalized with the White House, with the Republican \nmajority and with the Democratic minority to work out what we could, to \nget a comprehensive policy and get it over to the House side. Each time \nwe checked, the LEAF Act was there, undisturbed.\n  Now, last night, out of the clear blue--which is one of the reasons I \nwanted the floor--we get Senator Lugar's bill which had one hearing \nlast fall, I think last September, according to the record, never a \nmarkup, and get this whining out here about equal treatment. Why we \nhave to give him--the Agriculture Committee likes the bill, had been \nmarked up and reported, like ours had been worked upon. No, we have \nbeen hedging against that nonsense of the Lugar approach since last \nfall and working around the clock, locking down everything, and they \ncome and tell us that they couldn't avoid it. They had to get a \nmajority of the Commerce Committee members. I am dismayed the chairman \nvoted with that majority. After all our work trying to work together. \nThat explains my statement yesterday about the bipartisanship.\n\n  Now, back to just exactly what we have here with respect to being \nvictimized and everything else of that kind. I think that agreement, \nhaving been worked out within the Commerce Committee and all of these \nconferences and everything else, was a pretty judicious instrument in \nthat you cannot have tobacco farmers, Senator, unless there are tobacco \ncompanies. You can put the companies out of business. We have a mob \nscene here, a lynch mob coming forward; get rid of the company.\n  Every time we agreed on something, Senator McCain and I heard from \ndifferent groups, ``more, more, more, they are liars,'' they are this, \nthey are that. Let's agree on all of that, you can put them out of \nbusiness. Then McCain and Hollings can start their own tobacco company \nor maybe it would be Sessions and Hollings. It would be a pretty good \nbusiness. All we have to do is get the tobacco from Turkey. We don't \nhave any false records they can go and embarrass us with--juries and \neverything else of that kind. We can go back and get old Joe Camel and \nstart advertising again. Ain't nothing wrong with that. They tried end \non end before the courts to kick out their advertising, constitutional \nright, first amendment, and we can go make a living, and what has \nhappened? Nothing for the children.\n  So that is a pretty good political charade to come out on the floor \nof the Senate and say, now, is it tax or is it for the children, and \nanalyze it in this tricky mind as being just a tax. It is an increase \nin price. You don't have to pay it. It is voluntary. I quit smoking. \nThey say more than half of the people could quit smoking. Yes, it is \naddictive to some, just like alcohol. We could say get rid of Ronald \nMcDonald, advertising fat for the children. Go after that. With that, I \ncan agree with the Senator from Texas.\n  When you come right down to it, it is a balancing act that we are \nengaged in, and nobody wants to acknowledge it. We can get rid of the \ntobacco companies, but that does nothing for us at all. It doesn't do \nanything for the health community. It doesn't do anything for the \nchildren. It doesn't do anything for the payments to be made. This is \nmoney going back to the States. It doesn't do anything for the \nprograms. It doesn't do anything for the look back. It doesn't do \nanything to anything.\n  So these people that run around and want $1.50 and more and more and \nmore, don't even understand the problem, don't even understand what we \nare trying to do on the floor of the Senate with the tobacco bill.\n  We are trying to go along with respectable companies--yes, they did \nstand up and falsely state that they didn't think it was addicting and \neverything, but those folks are gone. If you don't think they have \nexactly, just tell the truth. Go over to the Defense Department and get \ntheir civil and criminal docket and you will find true blue chip \ncorporations of America trying to defraud the government at every turn. \nIt is a sad thing.\n  Then I have to look up here at minimal ethics in the business crowd. \nI talked to my friend, Tom Donohue, yesterday and I worked with him. I\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nhave every chamber of commerce award that you could possibly get.\n  But to get up here and let this legalistic crowd take over and start \ncontrolling--here is the Republican movement that doesn't want to have \nprice controls, wants to deregulate, wants to get rid of the \nGovernment, and now wants to fix prices, wants to fix fees. How can you \ntell when these lawyers have really made the case? It isn't an hourly \nthing. Until last June, there wasn't any case. Nobody has made any--\nthey have gotten some settlements. I know the best of the best from my \nhometown tried one for ancillary smoke--what do you call it? Voluntary \nsmoke? Involuntary smoke? Whatever it is--up in Indiana during the \nmonths of February and March, and even he lost that.\n  We are saying that you are not going to have any more immunity, or \nhave a limit on the immunity. They can still bring individuals. They \ncan still bring class actions. Everything is still in the commerce \nbill.\n  I would like to have given what they promised last June--the \nimmunity. But we did put an $8 billion cap on it. But the reason for \ngiving any immunity is that the juries of America have given them \nimmunity, period. They know the assumption of risk and everything else \nof that kind. It has been out there 30 some years. By the time we get \nalong with some petitions before the court and everything, it will be \n40 to 50 years, and everybody will have known about it; you won't be \nable to get a verdict against the companies.\n  So we who are responsible for public policy are also at a crossroads. \nThere is a pool of opportunity draining out on us. We ought to be \nacting this year. We ought to be acting this week. We ought to get with \nthis thing on a realistic basis and how we brought this bill out, and \nnot engage in trickery and come back in and take a bill that never was \nreported out of the committee, never onto the floor, never in debate, \nand say, ``Stick it in, because we can fix the majority on the Commerce \nCommittee.'' I am saddened to see that. I never have seen that happen \nbefore. I checked with the Parliamentarian. They said yes, it could \nhappen. But I never have seen that and it was sad to see.\n  I have a lot of other things here that we could touch upon, but the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina has been waiting. I hope when \nhe does present his amendment, that he amends the words ``minimal \nethics.'' I don't know that any trial lawyer--they win some cases, but \nthey lose a lot of cases.\n  As between the billable hour crowd and those working for the client \nrather than for themselves, because the clock keeps running, that is \nthe most vicious thing that ever happened to my profession--this \nbillable hour group. That is the worst thing I have ever seen occur, \nbecause I practiced law--never with billable hours; I got results for \nthat client. Then he understood that was the charge, because we won. \nWhen we lost, we assumed all the costs. Everybody knows just that. What \nhas been unethical, according to the testimony made to that attorney \ngeneral down there, is the companies have been unethically engaged and \nthe Chamber of Commerce has been supporting them.\n  I hope the Senator from North Carolina will amend the words there on \n``minimal ethics.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask at this time unanimous consent that \nSenator Faircloth be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. President, we still have one Member on our side who needs to be \ncontacted.\n  I seek at this time that Senator Faircloth be recognized to offer an \namendment, and that we proceed under the understanding that no second-\ndegree amendment be in order to the amendment until the motion to table \nis made at 4 p.m.; that, if the amendment is not tabled, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, be recognized to offer a \nrelevant second-degree amendment; and the time between now and 4 be \nequally divided.\n  Mr. President, this body proceeds on comity. I would like to proceed \nunder that understanding, and as soon as we contact one Member, then we \nwill put this into a formal unanimous consent agreement.\n  At the moment, I would like to ask for my colleagues' indulgence so \nthat Senator Faircloth can be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished leader will yield, I understand we \nare coming back at 2:15. I was trying to get an hour on our side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We will proceed under that understanding, and we will \nattempt to put it into a unanimous consent agreement between now and \nthe next 5 or 10 minutes, and, if not, to try to have it between now \nand by 2:15 when we return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 2421 to Modified Committee Amendment\n\n                  (Purpose: To limit attorneys' fees)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Faircloth), for \n     himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. McConnell, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2421 to the modified committee amendment.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . LIMIT ON ATTORNEY'S FEES.\n\n       (a) Fee Arrangements.--Subsection (f) shall apply to \n     attorneys' fees provided for or in connection with an action \n     of the type described in such subsection under any--\n       (1) court order;\n       (2) settlement agreement;\n       (3) contingency fee arrangement;\n       (4) arbitration procedure;\n       (5) alternative dispute resolution procedure (including \n     mediation);\n       (6) retainer agreements; or\n       (7) other arrangement providing for the payment of \n     attorneys' fees.\n       (b) Requirements.--No award of attorneys' fees under any \n     action to which this Act applies shall be made under this Act \n     until the attorneys involved have--\n       (1) provided to the Congress a detailed time accounting \n     with respect to the work performed in relation to the legal \n     action involved; and\n       (2) made public disclosure of the time accounting under \n     paragraph (1) and any fee arrangements entered into, or fee \n     arrangements made, with respect to the legal action involved.\n       (c) Application.--This section shall apply to fees paid or \n     to be paid to attorneys under any arrangement described in \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) who acted on behalf of a State or political subdivision \n     of a State in connection with any past litigation of an \n     action maintained by a State against one or more tobacco \n     companies to recover tobacco-related medicaid expenditures;\n       (2) who acted on behalf of a State or political subdivision \n     of a State in connection with any future litigation of an \n     action maintained by a State against one or more tobacco \n     companies to recover tobacco-related medicaid expenditures;\n       (3) who act at some future time on behalf of a State or \n     political subdivision of a State in connection with any past \n     litigation of an action maintained by a State against one or \n     more tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related medicaid \n     expenditures;\n       (4) who act at some future time on behalf of a State or \n     political subdivision of a State in connection with any \n     future litigation of an action maintained by a State against \n     one or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related \n     medicaid expenditures;\n       (5) who acted on behalf of a plaintiff class in civil \n     actions to which this Act applies that are brought against \n     participating or nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers;\n       (6) who act at some future time on behalf of a plaintiff \n     class in civil actions to which this Act applies that are \n     brought against participating or nonparticipating tobacco \n     manufacturers;\n       (7) who acted on behalf of a plaintiff in civil actions to \n     which this Act applies that are brought against participating \n     or nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers;\n       (8) who act at some future time on behalf of a plaintiff in \n     civil actions to which this Act applies that are brought \n     against participating or nonparticipating tobacco \n     manufacturers;\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\n       (9) who expended efforts that in whole or in part resulted \n     in or created a model for programs in this Act;\n       (10) who acted on behalf of a defendant in any of the \n     matters set forth in paragraphs (1) through (9) of this \n     subsection; or\n       (11) who act at some future time on behalf of a defendant \n     in any of the matters set forth in paragraphs (1) through (9) \n     of this subsection.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) Each attorney whose fees for services already rendered \n     are subject to subsection (a) shall, within 60 days of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, submit to Committees on \n     the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     a comprehensive record of the time and expenses for which the \n     fees are to be paid. Such record shall be subject to section \n     1001(a) of title 18, United States Code.\n       (2) Each attorney whose fees for services rendered in the \n     future are subject to subsection (a) shall, within 60 days of \n     the completion of the attorney's services, submit to \n     Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate a comprehensive record of the time and \n     expenses for which the fees are to be paid. Such record shall \n     be subject to section 1001(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       (e) Severability.--If any provision of this section or the \n     application of such provision to any person or circumstances \n     is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section \n     and the application of the provisions of such to any person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n       (f) General Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, for each hour spent productively and at \n     risk, separate from the reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket \n     expenses as approved by the court in such action, any \n     attorneys' fees or expenses paid to attorneys for matters \n     described in subsection (c) shall not exceed $250 per hour.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am offering this important amendment \nbecause we cannot allow this tobacco bill to turn into ``Wheel of \nFortune'' for trial lawyers. That is why my amendment caps attorney \nfees at $250 per hour.\n  Under the current bill, trial lawyers will get some $4 billion per \nyear. Billion--with a ``b''. And this is a conservative estimate--\nassuming a 15 percent contingent fee. The Medicaid cases will generate \n$1.2 billion per year. The tort cases will yield some $2.8 billion per \nyear.\n  A Florida circuit court judge, Harold Cohen, estimated their fees at \n$185,186 per hour.\n  Let's see how this compares to regular Americans.\n  The average physician earns $96.15 per hour, the average lawyer makes \n$48.07 per hour, pharmacists make $25.98 per hour, police officers earn \n$16.65 per hour, carpenters make $13.03 per hour, automobile mechanics \nearn $12.35 per hour, barbers make $8.37 per hour, and bakers earn \n$7.65 per hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is to \nrecess at 12:30. That hour having arrived----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be extended \nuntil 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized until 12:45.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. So, Mr. President, who are these ``superman'' lawyers \nwho deserve to be paid more than 20,000 times the salary of a working \nAmerican?\n  Well, one of them is Hugh Rodham, the President's brother-in-law. He \nis on line to get $50 million as a Castano group lawyer. Let me tell \nyou about the hard work that he has done to get this big fee. Let me \ntell you about his background that made him so important to this group \nof trial lawyers.\n  Well, actually, let me just read a couple of quotes from major \nnewspapers to describe his work.\n  ``And just for good measure, the state of Florida has hired Hugh \nRodham (Hillary Clinton's brother) to be a part of their litigation \nteam, despite his complete lack of experience in these types of \ncases.'' That's from the Knoxville News-Sentinel on July 20, 1997.\n  Here is another choice description of the fifty-million-dollar man \nand his invaluable work.\n  Hugh Rodham ``spen[t] the last hours of the June 20th settlement \ntalks in a corner reading a paperback by Jack Higgins, `Drink with the \nDevil.' '' That's from the Washington Post on June 23, 1997.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe that this amendment needs much more \njustification than that. Fifty million dollars to sit there reading a \nbook.\n  But, if that isn't enough, let me talk about the Texas trial lawyers. \nThese fine lawyers will get $88,000 per hour. This means $88 million \nper lawyer. What more can I say?\n  Well, here's something. The money will be paid from money that was \nsupposed to go for Medicare. Who do we pay--the sick and elderly or the \ngreedy lawyers?\n  Mr. President, there is a major political force at work behind the \nscenes in this tobacco legislative effort. I'm not talking about so-\ncalled ``big tobacco.'' What I'm talking about is the trial lawyers.\n  They negotiate settlements in the millions of dollars, and they take \nfees in the millions of dollars, dwarfing what their clients get. They \nalso stand to be the biggest winners if the tobacco settlement is \nenacted--a fact that appears to have become obscured in this debate.\n  Now, with this national tobacco litigation settlement before us, \nwe're not just talking about millions of dollars, or tens of millions \nof dollars, or even hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  We are talking about tens of billions--with a ``b''--of dollars that \nwill be transferred from the pockets of average smokers in this country \ninto the coffers of a handful of trial lawyers.\n  I have read published reports that the trial lawyers are estimating \nthat they will make upwards of $15 billion to $20 billion. That is hard \nto fathom.\n  To illustrate, in the two biggest individual State settlements that \nhave taken place so far, take a wild guess at what the major issue of \ncontroversy has been?\n  For those of you who have not been paying attention, it has been \nattorneys' fees for the private plaintiffs' attorneys who were brought \nin to help the states sue the tobacco companies.\n  In the State of Texas, for example, their $15 billion settlement is \ntied up because the Texas trial lawyers demanded over $2.3 billion for \ntheir work. These demands are ridiculous, and if we approve the McCain \nbill, we will be approving such billion dollar deals for these trial \nlawyers.\n  Yes, the McCain bill provides the option for attorneys to use an \narbitration panel to determine reasonable fees, but what attorney would \nbe foolish enough to seek reasonable fees if they can get $2.8 billion. \nAnd, what is considered ``reasonable'' in this climate?\n  It is ironic that these trial lawyers were brought in by the various \nStates to pursue claims on behalf of the taxpayers in those States.\n  That is, they have been brought in to stand in the shoes of our State \ngovernments and their taxpayers. But I ask you: who ultimately will be \nthe greatest beneficiaries--the taxpayers or the lawyers? Experience \nhas already provided us with an answer.\n  We should not forget how the deck has been stacked with respect to \nthese State lawsuits. It was only when State governments decided to use \ntheir weight, leverage, and resources to go toe-to-toe with the tobacco \ncompanies that these companies decided to settle the cases.\n  States legislatures have even changed the laws mid-stream and \nretroactively to tilt the balance in their favor.\n  The most recent example of this was in April when the Maryland \nGeneral Assembly voted to change the law to permit the State of \nMaryland to seek compensation for taxpayer money paid for smoking-\nrelated illnesses.\n  They first sued the companies, then realized winning the lawsuit \nperhaps was not going to be quite as easy as they first thought. They \nthen went to the Maryland legislature and had the law changed \nretroactively so that their lawsuit against tobacco companies would be \nconsiderably easier.\n  You can be sure that the Maryland plaintiffs' attorneys who stand to \nhave a huge pay day as a result of this lawsuit were closely involved \nin lobbying the legislature on changing the liability law.\n  I'm not saying that the attorneys' should not be reasonably \ncompensated for the hours and energy they have spent in helping the \nStates reach these settlements.\n  All I am saying is that it is outrageous to say that a group of \nplaintiffs' attorneys should be allowed to enrich themselves under the \nguise of claims on behalf of taxpayers. These are the same taxpayers on \nwhose back the spending in the McCain bill will fall.\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\n  Let's also look at how this relates to our past debates over tort \nreform. The motivation behind national tort reform is that our system \nof justice has been distorted by a group of trial lawyers who caused \nthe litigation explosion in this country.\n  At a minimum, it is highly ironic that we are now talking about \npassing a national tobacco settlement bill that will handsomely reward \nthe very same trial lawyers who have so badly corrupted our justice \nsystem.\n  None of us should turn a blind eye to the fact that the debate on \ntobacco settlement legislation, under the guise of protecting youth, is \nreally a debate about the pot of gold that potentially awaits the trial \nbar.\n  And that's not to mention the ``tax and spenders'' who want to fund a \nhost of social programs unrelated to tobacco. Not only are we standing \nhere debating a huge tax increase on working men and women, we are \nsimultaneously opening a can of worms.\n  We're talking about sanctioning a handful of attorneys' attempts to \nenrich themselves at the expense of the clients--in this case, \ntaxpayers--they purport to represent. I urge all my colleagues to give \nthis serious thought.\n  This tobacco bill is not a lottery. This is not ``jackpot justice'' \nfor trial lawyers. The trial lawyers are playing ``Wheel of Fortune'' \nwith the taxpayers money and it must be stopped.\n  I urge you to support my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5034-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2421\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in response to my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, as the saying goes \naround here--and it is genuine--I have the greatest respect and \nfriendship for the distinguished Senator. He and I have known each \nother for a good 30, 40 years almost.\n  I really am a little dismayed and disappointed to see this assault on \nattorneys' fees in the context of what is ethical on behalf of trial \nlawyers. When they put a billboard up with respect to ethical practices \nand making millions--we will get the board, I guess, and have it \ndisplayed.\n  But let me say a word, Mr. President, about lawyers themselves. A lot \nhas occurred over my few years of public service. In the early days, \nwhat we had in the State legislature was about 85 percent of the \nmembership was practicing attorneys. Today, fewer than 15 percent are \npracticing attorneys. That has come about, in a sense, as a result of \nbillable hours.\n  When we came out of the war and set up our practices, what really \noccurred was we had to do services for the client, whether it was in \nthe field of real estate, whether it was in the field of a criminal \ncharge, or whatever. It was an agreed-to fee or, in many instances, a \ncontingent fee on winning the case. That is how I grew up as an \nattorney, which characterizes me now as a ``trial lawyer''--I hope not \nan unethical one.\n  I was listening very closely to the Senator from North Carolina. The \nbest I can tell is he used the expression ``litigation explosion.'' We \ncan get into that. We have debated that, and we found through various \nstudies made by the Rand Corporation for corporate America that there \nis no litigation explosion.\n  ``Corrupted our justice system.'' The nearest thing I could find out \nwas the fee itself, and it was too large, as the distinguished Senator \nsurmised, and that in itself was unethical.\n  We know that people make money. I understand that the fellow on \nHeadline News today, William Gates, a very, very successful \nentrepreneur, never completed college, but he is a genius with a \nbusiness worth some $39 billion. He makes, doing nothing, just \n$125,000. I know he has a modest salary, but it would only go to the \ntax folks. But he operates, and he operates very successfully. They \nhave 21,000 employees there at that Microsoft entity. Every one of the \n21,000 is a millionaire due to the leadership and accomplishment of Mr. \nGates.\n  Now, that is what is to be considered when we talk about trial \nlawyers taking on a noncase and developing a case. That really nettles \nmy corporate friends. Incidentally, I should say this, that the \ncorporate friends have been mine over the many, many years, as they \nwell know from my votes here in the U.S. Senate. And we are very proud \nof the industrial development we have in South Carolina and the efforts \nof our Chamber of Commerce there. They are highly regarded, highly \nrespected. But they had not gotten into this limbo, so to speak, of \nbeing unethical when you win a case.\n  Specifically speaking, going to lawyers generally, it is the genius \nof America that fashioned this great Republic. Lawyers, if you please, \nyou can go back, Mr. President, to the earliest days. ``Is life so dear \nor peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and \nslavery? Forbid it, Almighty God. I know not what course others may \ntake, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!''--a lawyer, \nPatrick Henry.\n  Or otherwise that 30-some-year-old, with quill in hand, seated at \nthat table, ``We hold these truths self-evident, that all men are \ncreated equal.''--Thomas Jefferson, the lawyer.\n  The most applicable one, Mr. President, to this present day, ``But \nwhat is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human \nnature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels \nwere to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on \ngovernment would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be \nadministered by men over men, the greatest difficulty lies in this: you \nmust first enable the government to control the governed and in the \nnext place oblige it to control itself.''--that is our problem now--\nJames Madison, a lawyer.\n  Or the Emancipation Proclamation--Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer. Or in \nthe darkest days of the Depression, bringing about not only economic \nrevival, but equal justice under law, ``All we have to fear is fear \nitself.''--Franklin Roosevelt, a lawyer. Or giving substance to equal \njustice under law-- Thurgood Marshall.\n  I know the abhorrence some have for my friend, Morris Dees, down \nthere with the Southern Poverty Law Center, or with Ralph Nader keeping \nthe conscience clear with respect to consumer safety in America. But \nthese are lawyers who are out leading the way.\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that there is no higher calling \nfor a profession than to eliminate itself. If the ministers could \neliminate all sin and the doctors all disease, we lawyers are burdened \nwith the challenge of trying to eliminate injury in cases. When I first \ncame to the Senate that was really what was at hand, what you might \ncall class actions.\n  Up there in Buffalo, NY, Love Canal, toxic fumes, poisonous air. And \nas a result of the class actions there, the next thing you know what we \nhad was the Environmental Protection Agency, which in and of itself, \ndespite those who criticize the bureaucracy of it, has\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\neliminated not only the injury and drinking their own sewage and \nbreathing their own toxic fumes, but eliminated thousands and thousands \nof individual cases.\n  Then next, of course, we had the matter of the asbestos cases. We had \nthe cases with respect to the Dalkon Shield, breast implants; we had \nthe cases of the little children burning up in flammable blankets in \ntheir cribs. And we got the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I just \ntalked the other day to the chairman there who is doing the outstanding \njob that she is doing at the Consumer Product Safety Commission looking \nat all of these particular instrumentalities.\n\n  And good corporate America does just that. The J.C. Penney Company--\nthere is no more outstanding firm. I have visited their laboratories \nwhere they have instituted safety tests of all the articles to be sold, \nparticularly in the field of children's toys, and what have you. So the \ntrial lawyers brought that about.\n  And, Mr. President, just this past week I noticed a little squib in \nthe Times. They had down there that Ford Motor Company had recalled an \nengine. They took the initiative of recalling 1,700,000 pickup trucks \nbecause the link bolt on the wheel was loose. The wheel threatened to \ncome off and cause an injury.\n  Now, Ford Motor Company was not particularly enthused about safety, \nwe know, because back in 1978 Mark Robinson had to bring that Pinto \ncase. And they got a verdict of $3.5 million actual damages and a \nverdict of $125 million punitive damages. No, they never collected a \ndime, I don't believe, for those punitive damages.\n  But I say to the Senator from North Carolina, I can tell you now, \nthat saved a lot of injury and a lot of cases, because Chrysler has \njust had a recall that I saw in the news. And you can go right on down. \nThat brought about attention to safety and people not burning up and \nhaving the wheels lock on them, and those kinds of things, and coming \noff and causing that injury.\n  That brings us, Mr. President, to the present case at hand, which, in \nessence, was not a case at all. I never heard of bringing in, in a \nclass action, the tobacco companies and getting them to agree not to \nsell their product, but rather to advertise adversely not to sell, not \nto attract; on the other hand, agreeing, if you please, to a look-back \nprovision whereby they would be burdened with the beauty of diminishing \nbusiness for themselves, tobacco consumption, particularly in the field \nfor little children, and raising the price of their product whereby the \nmoneys would go then to the attorneys general and the U.S. Government \nto help pay these expenses, and so forth. That was not a case that was \njust filed and tried a few weeks later, and they got a verdict.\n  On the contrary, it was a long, hard, contingency struggle with a \nguarantee not only to get nothing had it not succeeded--and none have \nsucceeded so far. I repeat, no one has sued a tobacco company and \ngotten a jury verdict as of this minute, period. But they said, we \nthink we can do it if you let us try; and we will take it on a \ncontingent basis. I do not know what the percentage is down in Florida \nor Texas or Mississippi where they have settled--somewhere around 10, \n15 percent or whatever.\n  The States, the health community, the U.S. Government had nothing to \nlose. The lawyers bringing this pioneering, if you please, health care \nfor all of America, they had everything to lose. In fact, a fine \nattorney general down there, Mike Moore, had to really withstand being \nsued by his own Governor of his own State of Mississippi trying to \nprevent him from bringing the case.\n  Don't give me this billable hours or $180,000 an hour or $5 an hour \nor whatever it is. This isn't any hourly thing. This is a no-case \nsituation whereby you turn around and have to pay legal fees to defend \nyourself in order to bring the case, and he withstood that for a year \nin the courts with his reputation relatively ruined, but holding on. \nThen after they won that, they literally had to hide the witness and \nsecure his safety because they had a whistleblower in one of the \ncompanies who was willing to bring forth the records and say here they \nare, here is the actual fact within the company records, here is what \nthey stated, here is what their research found, here are their plans on \nadvertising and here are the ingredients they also included in order to \nbring about addiction. They had to hide the witness.\n\n  Don't give me billable hours. I don't know how much hog farmers make. \nI am waiting for my friend to come back, but I know the lawyers make \nnothing unless they succeed in bringing this case. Now, of course, \nhaving done that, and getting these other lawyers in, his friend, \nDickey Scruggs, and Ron Motley from my State of South Carolina, they \nhad an expert approach. If a painter paints a $10 million painting, I \ndon't know how much he gets an hour for painting it, but you have to \nhave expertise.\n  The ingenuity of using the RICO provision of the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, that is what they did. They said we can use the RICO \nprovision and really go after them. And that was a wonderful, ingenious \napproach to the actual trial of this particular class action. You have \nto understand all along nobody over the 3-year period is paying anybody \na red cent when they talk about billable hours. So they brought their \ncase, they struggled along, and they got right to the point where it \nwas going to be exposed, that particular record of the unethical.\n  My distinguished friend on the other side of the aisle has a sign up \nthere about ethical; it is the unethical conduct of the corporate \nlawyers, not the trial lawyers. They have not mentioned one thing \nunethical other than they won the case and they will get a good fee. \nThey deserve every dime of it and more. They ought to get some kind of \naward from the health community because this will save us billions and \nbillions of dollars in cost, in health care, hundreds and thousands and \nperhaps millions of lives from cancer deaths.\n  Not Dr. Kessler, not Dr. Koop, but Mike Moore, Dickey Scruggs, Ron \nMotley have done more to save people from cancer than Koop and Kessler \ncombined, and Koop and Kessler have tried their best, but there is more \nthan one way to skin a cat. No one in Congress was at that table. There \nwasn't any Senator--``I introduced the bill.'' There wasn't any \nCongressman, ``I sponsored, I cosponsored,'' all of this ``I'' stuff. \nNow they have a lynch mob going on because the polls show that lawyers \nare unpopular, particularly trial lawyers.\n  I have a friend in town here, sends me a thank-you note at Christmas, \nVictor Schwartz. We have been in this routine 20 years. Victor \nrepresents the business round table and the Chamber of Commerce, and he \ngets the conference board and he gets all these retainers so long as he \ndoesn't win the case. It reminds me of Sam Ervin's famous story about \nthe doctor who practiced there in Monroe, NC, for some 32 years all by \nhimself. Finally, he had a young son who graduated from medical school \nand he turned to him and said, ``Son, I haven't had a vacation in 32 \nyears. I am taking off with your mother for a couple of weeks.'' He \ncomes back and the son walks up to him and he says, ``You know Ms. \nSmith, Daddy?'' ``What about her?'' He said, ``There is really no \narthritis in her back, I got that thing cured.'' He said, ``Oh, my \nheavens. That is the patient that sent you through med school. Why did \nyou do that?''\n  You can solve cases, but that is our problem with most lawyers now. \nAs long as they can get a continuance, as long as they can make a \nmotion, as long as they can delay, as long as they bureaucratize the \njudicial system--and that is the corporate defendant crowd. The \nplaintiff doesn't win until he concludes a case. He has no time; he has \nabout five or six cases waiting, a lot of time out there, a lot of \nmoney, a lot of time investigating everything else. What happens is \nthat he finally scores, but he not only scores for himself, he scores \nhere in this particular case for all of America, because they met last \nJune and they had the sensibility not to be greedy. The inference is \nthat you have a greedy bunch that is unethical; they are getting too \nmuch. Not at all.\n\n  The fact is, they had the sensibility to say, like Kansas City, there \nis only so far that we can go. There has to be balance. If we put them \nout of business, if we continue to pressure and take legitimate \ncompanies out of business, then what will happen is that newcomers \nwithout these records that are really bringing about the settlements \nfor us, they won't have any records of\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nany kind of additives. They won't have any records of any kind of lies \nto Members of Congress or anything of that kind. They won't have any \nrecords of agreeing not to advertise or agreeing to advertise adversely \nto children, or agreeing to a look-back provision. What we will do, \nlike Samson, is pull down the temple walls and ruin us all and we will \nhave gotten nowhere.\n  Now, we understand here this week we can get nowhere. We can start \nwith lawyer fees. We can start with $1.50, $2 a pack, up, up and away. \nWe can have impossible look-back penalties and everything else of that \nkind, but this isn't the end of Congress. We will be back and we can \nalways amend what we never have tried before, like look-back and \nnonadvertising agreements.\n  But my counsel is let's move on with the provision of the commerce \nbill which says simply as to the agreements made within the States, we \ndon't disturb them--all of them, as best I can tell, are under \narbitration. But as to the new agreements made for lawyers, they are \nsubject to arbitration for both sides and approved by the court itself. \nNow, there is nothing unethical or untoward or whatever it is. The \nbeginning lawyers who made the case are deserving. The others who are \npiling on deserve a heck of a lot less. We all know that.\n  So we are not just setting an example here of $185,000 for nothing \nbut trial lawyers as the thing is depicted at the present time.\n  I can see we have some others that would like to be heard at this \nparticular time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield time to the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am very concerned about this and a whole raft of other \namendments as well.\n  First of all, I think we need to examine the context in which this \namendment is being debated.\n  If the members of this body succumb to the temptation to ``pile on'', \nto ``out-tobacco'' Big Tobacco--and that is surely where we are \nheaded--we will guarantee that the tobacco companies are not part of \nthe equation.\n  Why should we care about this? Tobacco causes cancer and a panoply of \nother serious diseases. The companies have known this for literally \ndecades; they have known nicotine makes their products addictive. They \nhave continued to market their products, and to target their marketing \nplans and their advertising to children.\n  That being said, I implore my colleagues to recognize that if the \ntobacco companies are not part of the equation, then we will not have a \nmeaningful bill that can work. It is as simple as that.\n  Last June 20, the tobacco companies agreed voluntarily to make \npayments which will range up to $368.5 billion over the next 25 years. \nThey freely chose to make those payments, payments which will help \nCongress fund a new War on Tobacco, in exchange for certain changes in \nthe law, such as a more predictable litigation environment.\n  In order to devise a bill which is workable and which will not be \nlitigated for years, we have to respect the legal boundaries imposed by \nour Constitution, that great document upon which our Country was \nfounded. Constitutional scholars have examined the provisions \nincorporated in the Commerce bill, and have found them to be lacking.\n  For example, public health experts have testified before our \nCommittee that advertising restrictions are an important weapon in any \nnew War on Tobacco. But legal scholars have also cautioned that those \nrestrictions must be drafted in a manner which is constitutionally \npermissible--which, by the way, this bill is not.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as someone who has been \nconcerned about constitutional principles during my tenure in office, I \nmust caution that unless this bill is changed in some very fundamental \naspects, we will wind up in 10 years of litigation over a variety of \nissues, not the least of which will be constitutional issues that will \nliterally cause more problems than anyone ever envisioned.\n  During each of those years, one million more kids will become \naddicted to tobacco and will die prematurely because the Congress is \npursuing a constitutional collision course which could ultimately \nrender substantial parts of the Commerce bill null.\n  It is important to note that, while the tobacco companies voluntarily \nagreed to the $368.5 billion amount, they have refused to agree to the \nCommerce bill's $516 billion price tag.\n  We have all seen estimates that the Commerce bill will add $1.10 to \nthe price of a pack of cigarettes in the next five years. What that \nTreasury estimate does not take into account are any increases due to \nState excise taxes, wholesaler or retailer markups, attorneys fees, \nreductions in volume due to increases in black market sales, or \nimposition of ``look-back'' penalties.\n  Let us be real. The manufacturers, for instance, added 5 cents per \npack solely because of just one State settlement, the Minnesota \nsettlement.\n  The $1.10 figure is a myth.\n  During the course of 10 hearings on the tobacco issue, the Judiciary \nCommittee heard an abundance of evidence on this issue.\n  We had three financial analysts testify at our hearings, each of whom \ndid independent analyses, using very detailed economic models, and none \nof them concurred with an estimate as low as $1.10. Their estimates \nranged as high as $2.50 to $3.00, for a total cost of about $5.00 per \npack.\n  If that happens, there will be a raging black market. It will be even \nworse than it is now. We have received testimony that one out of five \ncigarette packs sold in California today is contraband. Can you imagine \nwhat is going to happen if this bill forces tobacco prices up to \nbetween $4.50 and $5.00 per pack?\n  There is an additional implication that, with the exception of our \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, and our colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Moseley-Braun, no one is focusing on.\n  Who will bear the brunt of these increased costs, of these new \npayments intended to curb youth smoking? It is adults at the lower end \nof the economic spectrum. For example, almost one-third of people with \nincomes below $10,000 per year are smokers.\n  It would be better to bring this agreement into some perspective \nwhere we can get the tobacco companies on board, however reluctantly.\n  I would like nothing more than for them to pay $1 trillion per year. \nBut the practical reality is that that will not happen. They will \neither move offshore or go bankrupt first, and they will be totally \nbeyond our control.\n  If we design a program which does not have their open opposition, \nwhich is modeled on their voluntary agreement of June 20, 1997, we will \nhave effective accountability, because we will have look-back \nprovisions that are constitutional. We will have an effect ban on \nadvertising provisions, because without their compliance Congress \ncannot enact stringent advertising restrictions. In short, without the \nreluctant agreement of the tobacco companies, we will not have the \ncomprehensive program that many of us want.\n  Having said that, I have listened carefully to my colleague from \nSouth Carolina.\n  It is well known that I have been an advocate for legal reforms.\n  It is well known that I am supportive of product liability reform.\n  It is well known that I have not been someone who just is a rubber \nstamp for the trial lawyers of America, even though I have been one \nmyself.\n  It is well known that I think there are excesses in the law.\n  But I think we go a long way toward being excessive as a Congress if \nwe start setting fees for professionals in our society, professionals \nwho are not directly participating in a government program.\n  If we allow ourselves to start dictating what fees have to be paid to \ncertain professions in our society, however tempting, then I think we \nare starting down a dangerous road.\n  How can conservatives support setting fees in a free market system? \nThat is as bad as setting prices.\n  I have extensively examined the tobacco issue. One thing has become \nevident. We would not be here today debating this legislation were it \nnot for the Castano attorneys.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina has made some very \ntelling points. Yes, there are excesses. Yes, there are things we can \ncriticize.\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nYes, we know that many of the trial lawyers have been associated with \none political party.\n  That irritates some people, and rightly so. But the fact of the \nmatter is that he is right. It has been the contingent fee system that \nhas allowed people who do not have any money to be able to defend \nthemselves, to assert their rights, and to obtain verdicts in their \nbest interests. And without the attorneys being willing to take cases \non a contingent fee basis, many of the wrongs in our society would not \nbe righted.\n\n  Frankly, I have been on both sides. I started out as an insurance \ndefense lawyer. I tried medical liability defense cases. I know what it \nis like to have people, plaintiffs lawyers, bringing lawsuits, some of \nwhich are trumped up.\n  But I have also been on the other side where people who were humble, \nwithout money, had no recourse other than to hope they could find an \nattorney who would take their case on a contingent fee.\n  This meant that if I didn't win the case, I didn't get paid. If I won \nthe case, then I got somewhere between 25 and 40 percent of the \nverdict. I never had a case where my client got less as a result of the \ncontingent fee paid to me than they would have gotten by a settlement \nbefore a verdict--never, at least not to my recollection.\n  On this particular issue, Senator McCain and those who have written \nthis bill--basically the White House, if you will--inserted a \nreasonable provision. That provision says that, for the purposes of \nawarding attorneys' fees and expenses for those actions, the matters of \nissue shall be submitted to arbitration before a panel of arbitrators.\n  In other words, they are not going to give the trial lawyers a free \nride here. They are going to require them to submit their fees to \narbitration. They are going to have to come in and justify those fees.\n  In any such arbitration, the panel shall consist of three attorneys, \none of whom will be chosen by the Castano plaintiffs' litigation \ncommittee, that is, the plaintiffs' attorneys who were signatories to \nthe June 20, 1997 settlement agreement.\n  It seems to me that our distinguished Senator from Arizona did a good \njob in putting this provision in. A similar provision is in the \nlegislation I filed on November 13.\n  This represents a reasonable approach to the problem.\n  The fact of the matter is that I have devoted a lot of study to the \nCastano group.\n  And, yes, most of them are Democrats. Most of them are liberal \nDemocrats at that. But there are a number of them who are Republicans, \na very small percentage of them.\n  The fact of the matter is that politics should not play a part in \nthis. Without the Castano group, we would not be debating this issue; \nwe would not have been able to bring national debate to the point of \nconsidering a bill which penalizes the tobacco industry anywhere \nbetween $368.5 billion and estimates as high as $800 billion over 25 \nyears.\n  I believe that members of the Castano group alone have spent \nsomewhere between $20 million and $40 million in basic time alone. That \nis a lot of money. Some have argued that this figure could approach \n$100 million.\n  This has been going on for years, in State after State. It has been \ngoing on at the expense of the attorneys, without whom we would not be \nhaving this opportunity to start a whole new national War on Tobacco.\n  I have to admit, at times my angst over the trial lawyers' support \nfor one side or another shows at times. That is true for most Senators. \nAnd the trial bar has brought a lot of this criticism upon itself, to \nbe fair. They seem to be looking out only for their interests \nsometimes, which is not unusual in the business community.\n  But we should not allow that to cloud the facts on this issue. We \nshould think twice before we move toward having the Congress of the \nUnited States set attorneys' fees.\n  What is it going to be next? Accounting fees? What is it going to be? \nPrivate doctors' fees? Our public attempts at rate setting already have \nproven how government interference can distort the marketplace.\n  But I agree with the Senator from South Carolina--this is the last \nbastion of freedom there is.\n  Whether you like the trial lawyers or not, they take cases that \nnobody else will take. They do it at their own expense many times. Yes, \nthey make a lot of money, if they are good enough. But the fact of the \nmatter is they play a very significant and important role in our \nsociety. It is just that simple.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues on the other side. Large hourly \nlegal fees are a concern. That is why the bill sets up an arbitration \npanel which will examine fees based on set criteria such as the time \nspent and the complexity of the case. Attorneys should have to justify \ntheir fees; I don t disagree with that position.\n  I cannot condone legal fees which approach $1,000 per hour. But that \nis not the real issue. When we start setting attorneys' fees, whether \nthey are $100, $250, $500, or $1,000, it is a very serious matter.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Bruce Artim and Marlon Priest of my \nstaff be permitted privileges of the floor throughout this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me close with this.\n  I am very sympathetic to the motivation of this amendment and to the \narguments that the Senator from North Carolina has made.\n  However, there are a number of reasons that I have given here that \nthis amendment is flawed and, in fact, is unlawful.\n  As much as I dislike this Commerce Committee bill, and as much as I \nthink it is a piling on, the approach it uses to resolve the attorneys' \nfees issue is far more preferable than an arbitrary price cap.\n  For Congress to interfere retroactively with private contracts would \nbe, in my opinion, unconstitutional. Congress should not break private \ncontracts.\n  The June 20, 1997, settlement recognized that a private agreement \nbetween a plaintiff and his or her attorney is a legally enforceable \ncontract with which we should not unilaterally interfere, however well-\nintentioned our motives are.\n  Such interference by capping a contractual fee might very well \nconstitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The \nSupreme Court cases clearly say that the Federal Government cannot \nconfiscate money or interfere with a lawful contract.\n  Under any view of federalism, there is no justification whatsoever \nfor Congress, entering the field of pure State activity to alter the \nrights and remedies of private parties and then dispensing, with no due \nprocess, protections guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  Regulation of attorneys' fees properly belongs in the domain of the \nStates. Such usurpation of State prerogatives may very well violate the \nTenth Amendment. Recent court opinions such as New York v. United \nStates and Prinz v. United States have made the Tenth Amendment a \nshield against Federal imposition on the sovereign authority of the \nStates.\n  State courts have already shown a willingness to step in and prevent \nunreasonable and excessive fees in tobacco settlements. For example, in \nthe Florida case, the Court threw out a contingency fee arrangement \nwhere it was found to be clearly excessive. This shows that the State \ncourts will be best equipped to address this issue by utilizing the \narbitration clause of the Commerce Committee bill.\n  I think we must also examine the precedent we are setting here in \nhaving the U.S. Congress consider singling out any profession for a cap \non their earnings. We do not do this for corporate CEOs, although we \nhave tried in the past. We don't do it for sports figures or \nentertainers, for that matter. Should we consider capping Jerry \nSeinfeld's pay because he makes tens of millions of dollars a year, or \nmy dear friend Karl Malone because he makes millions of dollars every \nyear as one of the greatest basketball players who ever lived?\n  No, we don't do that, and we should not be doing it here, even though \nI do have some sympathy for what motivates the distinguished Senators \non the other side of this issue.\n  I compliment my friend from South Carolina in his statements here \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\n They are fair statements for the most part, arguing that, without the \ntrial lawyers being able to take contingent fee cases and to be able to \nuphold the rights of the downtrodden and those who don't have any money \nand those who can't afford any attorneys, we would not have nearly the \njustice ideal we have today.\n  I also compliment my colleagues from Alabama and North Carolina, who \nhave argued very forcefully and potently for this amendment. They make \na number of compelling arguments.\n  I know I have taken too long and I apologize to my colleagues. I feel \ndeeply about this.\n  I recognize I have irritated just about everybody in the debate. I \nhaven't meant to. It isn't my desire.\n  I feel very deeply we need to pass a strong anti-tobacco bill which \nis constitutionally sound and which will not be litigated for years. \nThe best way to do this is to model it after the agreement reached last \nyear between all the parties.\n  That, I believe, would be in the best interests of our children.\n  I cannot tolerate the fact we are going to have 10 years of \nlitigation because we are considering faulty legislation. We should be \npulling the companies in, albeit kicking and screaming, and making them \nbe active participants. I want them to be part of the solution. Some \nmay view that as naive, but I am optimistic.\n  The fact that we are considering legislation with such obvious flaws \nbothers me terribly. I am also bothered by the fact that we will go so \nfar as to start setting professional fees here in the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from \nUtah has made a very, very powerful statement. We are most grateful.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Illinois 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the Senator from \nUtah, I appreciated his oration and his irritation. He plays a valuable \nrole in the Senate, and he raises issues that are important to all of \nus regardless of on which side of the aisle we fall.\n  This amendment, sponsored by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nFaircloth, is one which we should understand what it stands for. This \nis an amendment to limit the attorneys' fees that will be payable to \nplaintiffs' attorneys who joined with all the States' attorneys general \nto bring the lawsuits against tobacco companies.\n  Now, to paraphrase my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, \nthe tobacco companies hate these attorneys like the Devil hates holy \nwater. Were it not for these attorneys, there would be no McCain bill \nin the Chamber this week. Were it not for these attorneys, there would \nhave been no State lawsuits. Were it not for these attorneys, these \ntobacco companies would continue to make billions of dollars, would \ncontinue to exploit our children, would continue to be the source of \nthe No. 1 preventable cause of death in America month after month, year \nafter year, and decade after decade.\n  So it is no wonder that the Senator from North Carolina wants to get \neven with these attorneys. They have upset the applecart for Tobacco \nRow. These attorneys have joined with States' attorneys general, 42 of \nthem, to bring lawsuits which have successfully brought the tobacco \ncompanies to their knees. And if this Senate has the courage this week \nthat I hope it does, we will pass the most comprehensive historic \nlegislation this Nation has ever seen to protect our children from \ncontinued exploitation by these tobacco companies.\n  So here comes the Senator from North Carolina, and he says, well, I \nthink it is only reasonable that we limit these attorneys to fees of no \nmore than $250 an hour. At least I think that is what his amendment \nsays; it has been written over a couple times. But I think that is what \nhe ended up concluding. For most people in America, $250 an hour is an \namazing amount of money. To anybody who would think about making \n$10,000 a week, that is an amazing amount of money. But, ladies and \ngentlemen, we are talking about attorneys who are playing in the big \nleagues here.\n  Isn't it interesting that all of his rancor and all of his anger \nabout attorneys' fees only affect the fees that are being paid to \nattorneys who are fighting tobacco companies. I have searched this \namendment, line for line and page for page, to find some limitation on \nthe amount of money paid to the attorneys for the tobacco companies. \nNo, not a single word of limitation. Pay them what you will. But the \nplaintiffs' attorneys, representing the children who are being \nexploited by these companies, the plaintiffs' attorneys who come in \nhere representing flight attendants to try to make sure in a courtroom \nthat they are protected from the kind of secondhand smoke that is \ndamaging, those are the targets of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Isn't it an amazing thing that these tobacco companies, when they put \ntheir enemies list together, put at the very top these attorneys. Well, \nwhy did these State attorneys general bring in these private attorneys \nas part of the lawsuits? For one simple reason: They didn't have the \nresources in many States to really go after these tobacco giants, so \nthey brought in the trial attorneys and they said, ``If you are going \nto sue the tobacco firms, do it on a contingent basis. If you win the \nlawsuit, which has never been done--never been done--if you win the \nlawsuit, you will win a substantial fee. If you lose, you go home \nemptyhanded.'' These attorneys said, ``We will take it on; on a \ncontingent fee basis, we will take it on.'' And guess what. They are \nabout to win. If we do the right thing, they will win. In at least four \nStates, they have won. It just angers the tobacco companies to think \nthat they are going to have to pay the fees of the attorneys who sued \nthem.\n\n  Why did we need these attorneys? Because, honestly, ladies and \ngentlemen, when it came to Congress, when it came to State \nlegislatures, when it came to many Governors' offices, and, yes, even \nwhen it came to the White House year after year and time after time, \nthe tobacco companies had a cozy relationship. They knew no one was \ngoing to go in and challenge them.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. But in a courtroom, it is a different story. In a \ncourtroom--I will when I finish; I will be happy to yield when I \nfinish. In a courtroom, it is one attorney against another. It is a \njury of peers, 12 Americans sitting in judgment, and that is when the \ntobacco companies are being brought to their knees. They could not buy \nit through lobbyists. They could not buy it through political \ncontributions. They had to walk into a courtroom. And when it happened \nin 42 different States, they said, ``It is time to settle. The game is \nover.'' So naturally they are angry with these attorneys, these trial \nlawyers who have brought them to their knees.\n  And think about the limitation of $250 an hour. Not a word about \nlimiting the amount of money paid to the tobacco company attorneys, and \ncertainly not one word about limiting the money paid to the tobacco \ncompany executives. Four years ago, do you remember that shameful scene \nwhen seven tobacco company executives, under oath, in the House of \nRepresentatives swore to God on a stack of Bibles that tobacco was not \naddictive? Tobacco is not addictive. Imagine they would say that. And \nthese men, who were being paid millions of dollars a year by exploiting \nour children and selling their products, are not even mentioned in this \namendment.\n  Now, if we are going to work out some moral outrage about how much \nmoney we are going to pay people, then let us include not just trial \nlawyers. Let's include the attorneys for the tobacco companies. Let's \ninclude the tobacco company executives. Or let's call this amendment \nfor what it is. This is an effort to get rid of the element that has \nbrought the tobacco companies finally to this Senate floor and brought \nus finally to comprehensive legislation.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. KERRY. Not on your time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Does the Senator have a copy of the amendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator to yield on the \ntime of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am satisfied.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Does the Senator have a copy of the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have the amendment 2421.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Look at the top of page 2 and line 10 at the bottom. \nWhat does it say?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry. Page 2?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Page 2. Read the top line.\n  Mr. DURBIN. ``* * * made public disclosure of the time accounting \nunder paragraph (1) and any fee * * *''\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Now read the bottom, line 10. It clearly includes the \nattorneys for the tobacco companies.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, Senator. I do not see that reference in here \nin the copy I have.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If the Senator will read, at the top, it clearly \nsays--in the English language it is pretty clear--that it includes all \nmatters, defendant or otherwise.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, but I do not see that reference, unless this \nis another copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. ``* * * who acted at some future time on behalf of a \ndefendant in any of the matters set forth in paragraphs (1) through (9) \nof this subsection.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator clarify then, is he saying that any of \nthe attorneys hired by the tobacco companies and paid by the tobacco \ncompanies relative to this litigation will be limited to how much they \nwill be paid----\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. By the tobacco companies?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That is exactly what I am saying.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Whether that money comes through this agreement or not?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How will the Senator possibly monitor that and police \nthat in terms of the banks and hoards of attorneys who represent these \ntobacco companies? In the issue of the plaintiffs, we clearly have a \ncase with an attorney general and we have a law firm that has reached \nan agreement and contract with them. Is the Senator from North Carolina \nsaying, then, that as to all the activities of attorneys for tobacco \ncompanies that he is going to limit their fees to $250 an hour?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If they submit a record, they will have to submit a \nrecord to the Congress. And of course it would be perjury to lie about \nit. They have to submit the record. Yes, I am saying they are going to \nbe held responsible. And to the same fees that we are paying the \nplaintiffs' attorneys.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What if they have already been paid?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Then it will be up to the tobacco companies to make an \nadjustment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The tobacco companies will have to call their attorneys \nin and make an adjustment under your act?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I believe that is a very difficult \nthing to accomplish. I don't think it is going to happen. What the \nSenator is asking----\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. It is difficult to see $185,000 an hour paid to \nplaintiffs' attorneys that come out of the working people of this \ncountry, too. And that bothers me considerably.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator the money that comes \ninto this comes from tobacco companies which have made a profit at the \nexpense of children and Americans for a long period of time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I beg to correct you. It comes from the taxpayers of \nthis country. The tax is on cigarettes and cigarettes are smoked by \ngenerally people with incomes of less than $40,000 to $50,000 a year. \nThey are going to pay 70 percent of this tax. We are going to buy Lear \njets for attorneys out of the working people of this country because 70 \npercent of this money we are going to pay to these attorneys comes from \npeople making less than $40,000 a year. And how anybody can justify \npaying an attorney $100,000-plus an hour, and taking it out of the \npockets of people making less than $40,000 a year, I don't know.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from North Carolina, what I \nunderstand this bill to include is an arbitration proceeding, if there \nis any question about the fees to be paid to attorneys, and in the case \nof the State of Florida, that in fact occurred. The attorneys' fees \nwere reduced. But let's not lose site of the bottom line here. Were it \nnot for these attorneys bring these lawsuits, we wouldn't be here \ntoday. We would not be discussing that legislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I don't know that that is true. But they arbitrated it \nin Florida down to $180,000 an hour. But I would like to yield the \nfloor now to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Illinois \ncontrols the floor--has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do I have?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the time agreement was the time \nwould come from the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The time was yielded to me, Mr. President. Our debate \nwas on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right. The Senator from Illinois does control \nthe floor. The time was charged to the Senator from North Carolina. So \nthe Senator from Illinois still has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Senator from South Carolina recognized me \nfor 10 minutes. Do I have any time remaining on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 4\\1/2\\ minutes? I yield that back to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, who has been kind enough to wait.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I understand the Senator wants to yield \nsome time now. I think we can go back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you. I yield the time, I yield whatever time is \ndesired by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, point of inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could ask the Senator from Alabama how much time he \nmight use so other colleagues can plan, so we can proceed down?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is, indeed, an important issue. We \nhave heard a lot today about validity of contingent fees. Historically, \ncontingent fees have not been favored by the law. They have been \nscrutinized. Lawyers ethically were supposed to take fees on a paying \nbasis unless the person could not afford to hire a lawyer--but we have \nalways affirmed a contingency fee basis. I am not here to criticize \nthat. I am not. This legislation in no way would stop private attorneys \nfrom going forward with contingent fee arrangements with their clients. \nAs an attorney, I have filed cases on an hourly fee basis and on a \ncontingency fee basis. I don't think there is anything wrong with that \nand I don't mean to suggest there is.\n  But in the history of litigation, in the history of America, in the \nhistory of law, in the history of the world there have never been fees \nequivalent to the ones we are talking about today. They go beyond \nanything we can imagine. These fees are beyond any payments that have \never been known in the world of law. I call them the mother of all \nattorney's fees. This is a serious matter.\n  The attorneys general of the United States have come to this \nCongress, this Senate, and they have asked us to approve a settlement, \nto add things to it, to review it and comprehensively deal with this \nmatter. So one of the things that we have to deal with is attorneys' \nfees.\n  Under the Constitution, the Congress is empowered to regulate. We do \nit when we enact a minimum wage. A person has a contract with somebody \nat $4 an hour, and we say the wage ought to be $5 an hour; that \ncontract is vitiated. We have a lot of containment of attorney's fees \nin America.\n  Indeed, with regard to Social Security cases, there is a limitation \non attorney's fees. With regard to the Criminal Justice Act, the limit \nis $75 an hour. Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, attorney's fees \nare limited to $125 an hour. Limitation of attorney's\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nfees is common. We have had a number of research papers written on fee \nlimitations. A professor from Cardozo School of Law has written \ncomprehensively on this legislation and says it is, indeed, \nconstitutional.\n  To illustrate the amount of money at issue in these cases, I would \nlike the people of this country and the Members of this body to think \nabout this: The yearly general fund budget for the State of Alabama is \nless than $1 billion. In Texas, a judge has approved payment of $2.3 \nbillion to a handful of lawyers for this litigation. They approved that \nkind of fee.\n  In Florida, attorneys are still battling to obtain $2.8 billion in \nfees--that is two thousand eight hundred million dollars--two thousand \neight hundred million dollars. That is absolutely unconscionable, as a \njudge in Florida said, and as anyone who has any sense of decency ought \nto understand. We have been asked to pass legislation dealing with this \nhealth care problem and try to do something about teenagers and \nsmoking? We have a right to pass legislation dealing with attorney's \nfees.\n  Let me share something with you. People may not understand exactly \nhow all of this has occurred. I have a transcript of a recent 20/20 \nprogram about the Florida attorney's fees debate. Let me share some of \nwhat was said in that program. The segment is entitled, ``What A \nDeal.''\n\n       Hugh Downs. What is your time worth? How does $7,000 an \n     hour sound? That's what some lawyers want to be paid for \n     their work on Florida's suit against the tobacco industry. \n     Each and every one of them could become a millionaire many \n     times over, just from this one case.\n\n  So, did they really earn their fee? Well, John Stossel tells us how \nthe lawyers came to demand a king's ransom for their work.\n\n       John Stossel. The children are supposed to benefit from the \n     new money for anti-smoking programs. And later the governor \n     invited in some children and dummied up a check to celebrate \n     the first $750 million payment. But now it turns out that \n     Florida's taxpayers may not get as much of that money as they \n     thought because Florida lawyers are in a legal battle over \n     how much money they should get.\n       Montgomery, the plaintiff's lawyer in the case, says they \n     deserve $2.8 billion. That's right--billion, says Stossel.\n       He (referring to Mr. Montgomery) doesn't exactly need the \n     money.\n       This is his multimillion-dollar house in luxurious Palm \n     Beach right next to the ocean.\n       The house is so huge, it looks more like a palace. Even his \n     Rolls Royce and his Bentley live in a garage that's bigger \n     than many houses. Montgomery got this rich suing carmakers \n     and hospitals and insurance companies.\n       Bob Montgomery. So this is my putting green, and this is my \n     sand trap. And what I do is I have these balls, and this is \n     where I drive them.\n       John Stossel. Out into the water?\n       Bob Montgomery. Out into the water.\n\n  He has so much money, he doesn't worry about his golf balls. He hits \nthem out into the ocean.\n\n       John Stossel. The inside of the house is even more grand. \n     Montgomery has a vast art collection.\n\n  Another attorney, Mr. Fred Levin, defends the fees.\n\n       Fred Levin. It was contracted.\n       John Stossel. So who made this contract?\n       Fred Levin. Well, the State did. It was a valid, legitimate \n     contract.\n       John Stossel. Fred Levin helped the governor put the deal \n     together.\n       You're a private lawyer? (Asked of Mr. Levin.)\n       Fred Levin. Right.\n       John Stossell. What are you doing there? Just giving \n     advice?\n       Fred Levin. Well, yes.\n       John Stossel. Friendly advice?\n       Fred Levin. Yes, I was a--I'm a good friend of the \n     governor's.\n       John Stossel. Friendship starts to explain how some of \n     these private lawyers were selected and ended up with a \n     contract that says each now is entitled to hundreds of \n     millions of dollars. It began four years ago, when Levin came \n     up with a scheme to use Florida's legislature to make it \n     easier to win a suit against big tobacco.\n       Fred Levin. I took a little-known statute called a Florida \n     Medicaid recovery statute, changed a few words here and a few \n     words there, which allowed the state of Florida to sue \n     tobacco companies without ever mentioning the word \n     ``tobacco'' or cigarettes. The statute passed in both the \n     house and the senate. No one voted against it.\n       John Stossel. Well, did the people know what they were \n     voting for?\n       Fred Levin. No. And if I told them, they'd have stood up \n     and made a--you know, they'd have been able to keep--keep me \n     from passing the bill.\n       John Stossel. This made the suit much more winnable?\n       Fred Levin. Oh, God. It meant it was a slam dunk.\n       John Stossel. And who would get to be the lead lawyer on \n     this slam-dunk offense?\n       Fred Levin. Initially, I was assuming that I would be \n     bringing the case. But then they said, ``Fred Levin's going \n     to make all the money.''\n       John Stossel. Fred Levin's doing a scam here. He's changing \n     the law so he can get rich.\n       Fred Levin. So I went to the governor and I said, ``Listen, \n     let me help you get a group of lawyers together, our dream \n     team, and I'll get out.''\n\n  Mr. Montgomery suggests that if he lost the case, he would have been \nout $500,000. He probably has that much invested in all of his \nautomobiles in this mansion he has. He suggested his cost was $500,000.\n\n       John Stossel. Am I missing something here? The controversy \n     has become, should the dream team get billions from the \n     25-percent deal they have with the State or from \n     arbitration? My question is, why do private lawyers get so \n     much of the State's money in the first place? When this \n     construction company got the contract to replace this \n     Florida bridge, they had to compete against other \n     construction companies. There was competitive bidding. To \n     win the job, they had to show they were qualified and \n     submit the lowest bid. All States have such rules to \n     prevent politicians from funneling projects to their \n     friends. But that's not what happened with the lawyers. \n     Here, Fred Levin called some friends. You picked the dream \n     team.\n\n  Then Mr. Stossel discussed how the deal was negotiated and the fact \nthat Mr. Levin and the Governor were close, riding in the same car \ntogether.\n  Then Mr. Stossel asked Mr. Levin why the Governor was spending the \nnight at this trial lawyer Montgomery's house.\n\n       Fred Levin. Well, when he's in Pensacola, he sleeps at my \n     house, so--\n       John Stossel. That week, Levin threw a big party. His \n     estate's so big he buses the guests in from where they've \n     parked their cars. The Governor came, of course.\n\n  And they talked about how the Governor's guests had raised a lot of \nmoney for him.\n  As Professor Lester Brickman of Cardozo Law School said:\n\n       It's an outrage. It's more than greed, it's a scam.\n       John Stossel. Law professor Lester Brickman, who's an \n     expert on legal fees, says it's not right to hand such a \n     lucrative-fee case to a friend.\n\n  This is the issue we are talking about today. I was attorney general \nof Alabama when this litigation was being suggested. I had groups of \ntrial lawyers come to me and ask me to file the litigation. We had \nmeetings and we discussed it. They wanted a contingent fee, as I \nrecall, 25 percent of the recovery.\n  I remember saying, ``Well, some of the States are moving along fine \nin this litigation. If they win, I assume Alabama will be able to win \nwith our own staff. I don't believe we need you to represent us.''\n  They said, ``Well, you don't just hire us, you can hire some of your \nlaw firm friends, too. You can cut them in on the deal.'' That was one \nof the things they suggested to me.\n  I said, ``We're not hiring lawyers for friendship. We're not hiring \nlawyers to pass out funds to people we want to give money to. If we \nneed a lawyer, we'll hire a lawyer.'' I didn't do so.\n  Basically, what I had predicted came true. When the end came, the \ntobacco companies settled all over America. Some States had hired \nlawyers on a contingent-fee basis, lawyers that may have only worked a \nfew weeks or months, and then began to come in and claim 25 percent of \n$2 billion, $3 billion, $15 billion. This is supposed to be fair and \njust? I submit that it is not.\n  My good friend and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on which I \nserve, expressed real concern that we ought not attack contingency-fee \ncontracts, as these contracts benefit people who cannot afford to hire \nlawyers on an hourly basis. I don't intend to undermine normal \ncontingent-fee contracts, and nothing in our amendment does that.\n  I think everyone needs to know that this McCain bill that the \nadministration has approved and signed off on, and the trial lawyers, I \nsuppose, have signed off on, calls for a panel of arbitrators. It \nconsists of three people: The Castano plaintiffs; I understand one of \nthem may get $50 million out of this litigation. Plaintiffs would have \none member on the arbitration panel. The other members of the group \nwould be the manufacturers and the attorney\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\ngeneral. They get to pick the second one.\n  But you see, there is a problem there, because the accord really is \nbetween the manufacturers and the attorneys general and the plaintiffs' \nlawyers. I submit that they are not defending the best interests of the \npeople--they signed those contracts together.\n  In this situation, the plaintiff lawyers have placed themselves in--\nand I don't know any other way to say it--a conflict-of-interest \nposition. When the tobacco companies agreed to settle, they went to the \nlawyers on the other side and said, ``Now, let's talk about your fee. \nWe won't pay all the money to the State and let you be paid by the \nState, because that would look bad. We'll just have a little side \nagreement, and we'll pay your fee, and it won't come out of the State's \nmoney.''\n  The attorneys general agreed to that. So the attorneys general are in \non the agreement. And the plaintiff lawyers are in on the agreement. \nAnd the tobacco companies are in on the agreement. Anybody who knows \nanything about economics and thinks realistically about this matter \nwill know there are not two separate pots of money.\n  The attorneys' fees and the recovery by the States are all payments \nby the tobacco companies to get these people off their backs. The \ntobacco companies do not care whether lawyers get the money or whether \nthe children of the State or the children of the United States get the \nmoney. They are not concerned about that. They want this litigation \nover.\n  So this is what we have. The more you pay the lawyers, the more \nlikely they may be to compromise the interests of the State and the \nchildren. Every dollar that goes to them is a dollar that would not go \nto the children.\n  The third member of this arbitration panel is picked by the \nplaintiffs and the manufacturers and the Attorney General. So you have \nmore of the same. This is not an effective arbitration panel. It is a \nstacked deck. I am not sure some of the people who defended this panel \nhave fully thought that through. We will need to talk to them about \nthat. But this is not an acceptable panel.\n  Some people say, ``Well, Congress can't undermine contracts.'' We \nlimit the minimum wage. And Florida has limited attorney's fees--at \nleast so far they have tried to. People on the other side say, ``Well, \nit's not so bad. Florida limited their attorney's fees contracts. So if \nFlorida can limit that contract, why can't we limit their fee?'' But in \nTexas they did not. In Texas a judge has approved $2.3 billion in \nattorneys' fees.\n  I will point this out to you: I have a recent article about the owner \nof the Baltimore Orioles making over $1 billion from these attorneys' \nfees, $1 billion--B-I-L-L-L-I-O-N--$1 billion. I suspect he probably is \nmaking more off the lawsuit than he has made on all of his other \ninvestments.\n  Do you know how many billionaires there are in the United States \naccording to Forbes? I had my staff check. There are about 60. I wonder \nhow many new billionaires these attorneys' fees will make? Who will pay \nfor this wealth transfer? Who will be making more Montgomerys with \nmultimillion-dollar mansions on the beach, who hit their golf balls out \ninto the water because they have so many they don't care, and have \nworld-renowned painting collections?\n  I am not weeping at all over the poor state of these attorneys. I \nthink it is time for us to have a clear policy about what we ought to \npay. This body voted last year that $250 was a fair wage for them to be \npaid per hour, and I think it is, too. I support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 58 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes have expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I presume the Senator can yield himself more time if he \nwants to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will reserve the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I use. I will \nnot use that much time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is time we really talked about what is \nreally happening here. And it is time that we face reality with respect \nto this amendment.\n  I am just astounded listening to the Senator from North Carolina and \nthe Senator from Alabama suggest they know better than their own \nattorneys general, who are elected, after all, who are accountable to \nthe people of their States, just as we are as Senators, and who \nsuddenly, representing the Republican Party, are attacking people \nbecause they have made some money and they do not like the way they \nhave made some money.\n\n  This is an unprecedented situation as far as I know. The Senator from \nUtah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, could not \nhave put it more strongly or directly. He asked the question, What is \nour party coming to if this is what we stand for?\n  Now, I ask my colleagues just to read this amendment. This amendment \nsays:\n\n       No award of attorneys' fees under any action to which this \n     Act applies shall be made * * * until * * * [they] have \n     provided to the Congress a detailed time accounting with \n     respect to the work performed.\n\n  They want to turn the U.S. Congress into an accounting committee for \nattorneys, private attorneys who have contracted privately with the \nattorneys general of their States.\n  But after that, if ever there was a violation of what I thought the \nRepublican Party stood for, here it is. ``This section shall apply to \nfees paid or to be paid to attorneys under any arrangement * * *'' \ni.e., retroactively. They are going to go back and say, no matter how \nmany hours attorneys may have worked, no matter how much their firm may \nhave put in, they are going to have to live by a certain fee that may \nbe well below what they have already invested in a case.\n  But even more importantly, they do this for any attorney ``who acted \non behalf of a State or a political subdivision of a State in \nconnection with any past litigation,'' ``who acted on behalf of a State \nor [any] political subdivision of a State in connection with any future \nlitigation,'' ``who acted at some future time on behalf of a State or a \npolitical subdivision of a State in connection with any past \nlitigation,'' ``who act at some future time on behalf of a State or a \npolitical subdivision of a State in connection with any future \nlitigation of an action maintained by a State against one or more \ntobacco companies * * *''\n  Here is the most extraordinary long-arm reach of the Federal \nGovernment into the affairs of States from the very people who are most \nconsistently on the floor of the U.S. Senate saying, ``Keep the Federal \nGovernment out of our business. Keep the Federal Government away from \nintruding. Don't put mandates on the State. Don't preempt State \naction.'' And here we are with the greatest single preemption, \nintrusion, and nit-picking, micromanaging that I have ever seen.\n  That said, they are not even dealing with reality, Mr. President. \nThey are coming in here and talking about $180,000 fees. That is not \nwhat they got in Florida. In point of fact, that is what the attorneys \nmay have asked for because that was their agreement, but that is not--\nthey are subject to arbitration.\n  Every single State is subject to arbitration. This bill honors the \nnotion that there will be arbitration. No one expects attorneys to be \npaid the kind of money that is being thrown around on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. That is not going to happen. And they cannot point to an \ninstance where it actually has happened.\n  In Minnesota, they settled for 7.5 percent. The Attorney General \nsettled, all of the parties settled. And what is really fascinating is \nmy friend from Alabama says there are not two pots of money. Well, that \nis not true. In Minnesota there are two pots of money, because they \ncame to an agreement that one pot would pay the people what they get by \nvirtue of a settlement, and the companies, the tobacco companies will \nwind up paying the attorney fees outside of it. That can happen in each \nand every other State subject to the determination of the arbitration \nprocess, subject to the courts, subject to the attorneys general and \nothers.\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\n  Who is the Senator from North Carolina, who is the Senator from \nAlabama to say that the attorney general of a State does not know what \nhe is doing, that the attorney general of a State is incompetent to \ndecide that he wants to run for reelection based on what he thought was \na fair approach to arriving at a settlement?\n  Why is it fair? It is fair, Mr. President, because no one wanted to \ntake these cases. No one wanted to take these cases. I stand with my \nfriend from South Carolina as somebody who has tried a case and who has \ntaken a contingency case.\n  When I first got out of school I started a law firm. We did not have \nthe money to carry the case. We did not have anybody supporting us. But \nabout six or seven people who had hairs implanted in their head from \nrug fibers came to us. It turned out that the hairs were cancer, \ncarcinogenic, and they got extraordinary blisters and reactions to this \nand spent days in hospitals and being treated.\n  But how were they going to get redress? Well, they got a couple of \nyoung lawyers who took the cases on a contingency. And we took those \ncases based on the notion that we invested our money in the \ndepositions. We invested our money and the time put into it. And we \nworked for 2 long years, Mr. President, in order to be able to finally \ntake that case to court, win the case in court, and ultimately force \nthe rest of the cases to settlement. There are countless examples like \nthat.\n\n  America is going to have an opportunity to see a movie soon in which \nJohn Travolta will play Jan Schlichtmann, a young attorney up in \nMassachusetts who took a case of people in the City of Woburn, who had \nbeen poisoned by toxics put into the well system and their kids were \ndying of leukemia. This was a case that nobody wanted to take. This was \na case that took years to prove, and they brought experts from all over \nthe country. They invested in it themselves to the point, Mr. \nPresident, they were floating their own credit cards to the point of \nbankruptcy. They mortgaged their home to the point of bankruptcy. This \nlawyer lost his automobile. It was repossessed because he was going to \nwin on behalf of these people. Ultimately, he was able to pay off all \nthe bills and he barely made any money at all.\n  That is a case you win. Most cases in America are stacked against the \nplaintiffs. In most cases in America, corporations have all the money. \nThat we have seen from the tobacco industry over the last years. And \nthat is why, as the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, in all the \nyears of litigation, not one single penny has been paid out in the \ncourt as a result of a victory won in the court at this point in time.\n  Who will bring those cases? This isn't the only example of that. \nThere is the most extraordinary misunderstanding in America about \ncontingency fees and what happens for the cases that are won that \ncreate a big stir. There are dozens of cases that are lost. There are \ndozens of cases litigated where people make an effort and they don't \nwin. And that is our system of jurisprudence in America. That is how we \nprovide the average citizen, the person who doesn't have the bucks, \naccess to the courthouse. And here we are with a system that we have \nworked out in this bill which sets up arbitration which says, in \nsection 1407, that in any case where the State and their litigation \ncounsel failed to agree on attorney fees and related expenses, the \nmatter of attorney fees and extensions shall be submitted to \narbitration.\n  There is no automatic payout in this bill. No attorney walks away \nwith fees that any attorney general or any State thinks are wrong. That \nis not going to happen. And there are people accountable at the State \nlevel if it did happen. It is not the business of the U.S. Senate to \nstep in and suggest that, because the Senator from Alabama finds the \nlifestyle of a particular individual who may not even have made the \nmoney through that case, other cases--finds it onerous, to say we will \nlimit it.\n  I bet any one of us could find any number of corporate executives, \nchieftains, in this country who have their airplanes, who have their \nnice cars, who may or may not choose to hit a golf ball in the ocean. I \nam sure you could say they have a lifestyle that somehow people find a \nlittle bit objectionable or they are jealous of, but since when in this \ncountry do we say we will limit their capacity for earnings and step in \nand become the accounting agency for those kinds of transactions?\n  I hope my colleagues will measure carefully the capacity in this \nbill. This would interfere with private contracts. The amendment is not \nnecessary, because a bill has a means of resolving these. The courts \nhave already shown an unwillingness to prevent any unreasonable fee, \nand these contingency fees preserve the rights of our citizens to be \nable to have access to the court.\n  Let me share why that is so important. It was the result of a suit \nbrought on contingency that helped make automatic teller machine \noperators responsible to put those machines in a way that people \nweren't attacked or somehow there was a sense of responsibility about \nthe locations. That is one of those victories that you win because \npeople took a case.\n  Another case, where a $10 million punitive damage award against \nPlaytex removed from the market tampons linked to toxic shock \nsyndrome--those problems had been deliberately overlooked by the \ncompany. It was only because of the suit that people were protected.\n  In St. Louis, a jury returns a $79 million award against Domino's \nPizza because of its fast delivery policy. We had a woman, Jean Kinder, \nwho suffered head and spinal injuries when a delivery driver ran a red \nlight and hit her, because the policy was, you have to push delivery. \nThey changed their policy because a lawyer brought that concept to \ncourt, and it was rectified.\n\n  An 81-year-old died from a fatal kidney ailment after taking an \narthritis pain relief drug called Oraflex for about 2 months. The \nmanufacturer had known of the serious problems associated with the drug \nbut failed to warn the doctors, and, in fact, Eli Lilly removed the \ndrug, as a result of that suit, from the world market after it had been \navailable in the United States for less than a year.\n  Eight punitive damages awards were required before the A.H. Robins \nCompany recalled the Dalkon Shield, the IUD, and we all know what \nhappened with respect to that.\n  All of these were instances, Mr. President, where American citizens \nwere protected by virtue of the capacity of a lawyer to take a case. I \ncan tell you, if you limit these fees to the level they want, what you \nare really doing is limiting the access of the average American to the \ncourtroom, because you will make it impossible for lawyers to take \nthose fees under those circumstances--not to mention the \nunconstitutionality and questionable practice of how you regulate \ndefendants' fees in totally private contractual relationships outside \nof anything to do with State action, outside of anything to do with a \ncompelling straight interest, with no appropriate rational nexus that \nthe court requires for that kind of test.\n  This doesn't work. It is not needed. It is wrong. It is an \nexaggerated problem seeking some kind of solution. This is not the \nsolution.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield whatever time is desired to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will share a few thoughts as we discuss this thing. I \nthink the feelings are strong on both sides.\n  I suggest that Federal action is appropriate here because the States \nhave asked for a comprehensive settlement of this matter. The \nlegislation that we have proposed is a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation. It involves where the money goes. We don't agree with the \nStates on everything that they say, and we will be doing things \ndifferently in a number of ways. It will represent the consensus of the \nHouse and the Senate and the President, if he signs it.\n  I think it is perfectly appropriate for us to deal with the problem \nof just how much these litigators make. When you have a young lawyer \ntaking on a big company and winning a contingent fee verdict and making \nsome money off of it--we are not trying to undo that. We are talking \nabout a massive effort, nationwide, that has resulted in incredibly \nhuge profits or windfall attorney fees that ought to be contained by \nthe\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nvery nature of this. We have a right to legislate that.\n  Whereas at this stage Florida has reduced the attorney's fees that \nwere to be awarded of $2.8 million, one of the lawyers, I think, is \nstill contesting that, and they may not prevail. Or if they do, it is \njust proof of the fact that courts and legislative bodies have the \npower to deal with excessive fees in this kind of circumstance.\n  Finally, they say, well, there is an arbitration panel in this \nagreement. I must tell you, the configuration of that panel is \nunacceptable. It is unacceptable for two different reasons, really. It \nis unacceptable, No. 1, because it doesn't even come into play unless \nthe attorney involved is unavailable to agree with the plaintiff. The \nplaintiff is the attorney general or, I guess, representing the State, \nof the people. I am on page 438 of the agreement. It says you can't \nhave arbitration unless the attorney involved--that is, the private \nplaintiff lawyer--is unable to agree with the plaintiff--that is, the \nattorney general who employed that attorney--the attorney general, with \nrespect to any dispute that may arise between them regarding their fee \nagreement.\n\n  Why, this is the fox guarding the hen house. These are the same \npeople that agreed to the fees. We don't have a good thing there.\n  Then, when it talks about submitting it to arbitration, the makeup of \nthe panel shall consist of three persons, one of them chosen by the \nplaintiff--that is, the attorney general--one of them chosen by the \nattorney--that is, the plaintiff's attorney--and one of them chosen \njointly by the two of them. That is who is making the decision--the \nsame people that got us into this fix. I submit that is not an \neffective arbitration panel and it is not something that at all deals \nwith the seriousness of the problem.\n  Lester Brickman, when he was interviewed on ``20/20,'' the professor \nfrom Cardozo Law School, made these statements: ``These are politicians \ninvolved who are stroking the backs of lawyers because lawyers have \nstroked their backs before and may yet stroke their backs again. So I \nthink the public perception here, which is probably pretty accurate, is \nthat it smells.''\n  I want to make one more point. I think this is really important. I \ncan see how that could be of confusion. The Senator from Massachusetts \nsays there really are two pots. This is fundamental when you think \nabout it. It is not two pots. There is one pot of money; that is the \ntobacco companies; and they will pay it over to get rid of this \nlawsuit. And they are willing to pay as much to the lawyers to get them \nto agree to the settlement. It is not a healthy relationship. It is not \na healthy relationship. And the suggestion that the tobacco company can \ngo over here to the side and enter into a side deal with the lawyers \nwho are supposed to be representing the State and the people to pay \ntheir fee, and that is not going to affect the overall settlement, is \nnot sound thinking. It is the same money, and every dollar they agree \nto give is one dollar less that goes to the people and victims of \nsmoking.\n  I believe the present proposal is not effective at all. I object to \nit. I believe the Senator from North Carolina has a proposal that will \nfix this matter. It will be a generous fee for these attorneys. They \nworked on it for 4 years, and they have 10,000 hours. They get paid \n$250 for every one of those hours. That is perfectly generous.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Although I have not been in this institution long, I \nhave already discovered one thing about the Senate. Things are not \noften as they appear. This discussion has been almost entirely about \nmoney, what fees are paid, and who pays them.\n  But in truth, this amendment is not about money, it is about power. \nIt is about whether or not the individual American who has little or no \nmoney, cannot afford expert testimony, cannot afford to pay the fees \nwith extensive and complex litigation, can stand in a courtroom face to \nface with the largest and richest, most powerful corporations in the \nworld and get justice.\n  Through almost all of the history of this Republic, we have assured \nthat right to every American. But today, this Congress is at a point of \njudgment about the tobacco industry because those individual lawyers, \non contingency fees, representing individual American citizens, have \nbrought us to this point of decision.\n  Make no mistake about it, Americans are dealing with the reality of \nhealth care and tobacco and the financing of our future health care as \na result of a potential tobacco settlement, not because of this \nCongress, not because of the good graces of American industry, not \nbecause the leadership of the President, but because of the threat in \ncourts of law that individual attorneys, on contingency fees, have \nfound justice for individual American citizens.\n  This fight is not about money. There are ample resources in any \ntobacco settlement. The fees would be paid. It is about whether or not \nthis door to American justice is to be closed. And that is the \ndecision.\n  The great irony of it is, on the other side of the aisle, the party \nwhich has always claimed to represent the rights of the individual, the \nfounding wisdom of our constitutional system, and the prerogatives of \nindividual State governments, would be bringing this amendment at all. \nIf it were to succeed, the Senate of the United States would be setting \nprofessional fees, a judgment that not only does not belong here but \ndemeans the institution. The Senate of the United States would be \ntaking prerogatives away from State governments and State attorneys \ngeneral which have negotiated these decisions or made these judgments.\n  The McCain legislation deals with this, in what I believe is a proper \nfashion, in setting arbitration panels where arbitrators can pay what \nexpenses the lawyers had, what they had to pay, the risk they took, the \ntime involved, and then, on a professional, informed basis, decide on \nproper compensation.\n  Alternatively, that judgment will be made here, and on what basis? \nWho here knows the risks involved, what expenses were incurred, what \nprofessional judgments were required? Never in my limited experience in \nthis institution would we be making a less informed decision.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the defeat of this amendment. The \nattorneys general of this country have availed themselves of a right \nthat individual Americans have used for generations. They made a \njudgment to the taxpayers of this country who could not afford to pay \nprivate attorneys the enormous fees, the enormous costs through recent \nyears, to avail themselves of contingency fees to protect the taxpayers \njust as individual Americans have done for years. Now it is time to \nensure that system worked--that freedom to remain with the individual \nStates to reach their own final judgments.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me suggest to you this legislation is not \nonly inappropriate for the institution, it is not only denying \nAmericans a power of equal justice against the strong and the powerful, \nwhich they have enjoyed for generations, it is also, finally, if \nnothing else, patently, clearly, unequivocally unconstitutional. On \nwhat basis will the Federal Government take this judgment away from the \nStates under the 10th amendment? And on what basis would this Congress \ndecide to take this compensation away from individual Americans in what \nis clearly an unconstitutional seizure of property without \ncompensation?\n  Mr. President, this amendment is bad on a variety of bases. \nCollectively, it is almost unthinkable. I am very pleased that Senator \nHollings and Senator Kerry have led us in the debate, and am more than \na little proud that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on which I \nam proud to serve, Senator Hatch, once again, as has been his \ntradition, has come to the floor of this institution in the protection \nof the prerogative of the institution and the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding the time.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I do. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\n  I thank my friend from North Carolina.\n  The Faircloth cap is an attempt to insert a bit of sanity into a \nworld of attorney-fee madness. The national tobacco settlement has \nturned into the ``national lawyer enrichment deal.'' Let me tell you a \nlittle about the current ``national lawyer enrichment deal.''\n  Under the current bill, conservative estimates say that we are about \nto hand over approximately $4 billion a year to lawyers --$4 billion a \nyear--every year--for at least the next 25 years. This, Mr. President, \nis absolutely outrageous.\n  I am sure the friends of the trial bar will stand up and say I am \nexaggerating. They will say we are stretching this one. Lawyers aren't \nreally asking for that much money, it will be said. They aren't that \ngreedy, some will claim. They just want to be paid a fair wage for a \ngood day's work. Well, let's see if I am exaggerating. Let's see if the \ntrial lawyers just want a fair wage for a good day's work. Let's take a \nlittle tour of the ``national lawyer enrichment deal.''\n  In Minnesota, where a few lawyers are reportedly seeking to rake in \napproximately $450 million, the lawyers in Minnesota actually took the \ncase to trial, so it is reasonable to assume that they employed more \nattorneys and put in more hours than some lawyers in other States. So \nlet's assume that 50 lawyers worked a total of 100,000 hours. These 50 \nlawyers would each take home $9 million for his or her labor--$9 \nmillion. And what is the hourly fee for the hard-working plaintiffs' \nlawyers in Minnesota? It is $4,500 an hour, Mr. President, $4,500 an \nhour for the plaintiffs' lawyers in Minnesota.\n  Well, let's take a look at Mississippi. We will stop off in \nMississippi on our national tour. The latest reports out of Mississippi \nare that the lawyers are seeking $250 million. Assuming that 25 lawyers \nworked on these cases for 25,000 hours, the Congress would be \nauthorizing each lawyer to receive $10 million a piece.\n  Let's break that down on an hourly basis. If each of these lawyers \nworked 1,000 hours exclusively on the tobacco litigation, that would \nenable them to earn $10,000 an hour. Pretty good day's pay, I would \nsay--$10,000 an hour.\n  Now let's stop off in Florida, and this is better than Disney World. \nA handful of trial lawyers in Florida are trying to take us for a ride, \nthe ride of our lives. These fellows are looking to receive as much as \n$2.8 billion. One lawyer has already sued for his $750 million share of \nthe pot. And we don't even have to make assumptions in Florida because \nthe judge has already done the math for us. The judge looked at the \ngreedy grab by the lawyers and concluded that the demands for \nattorneys' fees--and this is quoting the judge--``Simply shock[ed] the \nconscience of the court.'' The judge concluded that even if the lawyers \nworked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays, for over 3 \nyears, they would earn over $7,000 an hour--$7,000 an hour. In fact, we \nknow the actual hourly rate for the Florida attorneys is immensely \nhigher because no one can seriously contend that any lawyer, much less \nevery lawyer, worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on tobacco \nlitigation for 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  But it gets better. The final stop on our lawyer enrichment tour is \nTexas. There a handful of lawyers are going after $2.2 billion. Well, \nlet's see what kind of hourly fee the lawyers want in Texas. Texas did \nnot go to trial so it is reasonable to assume Texas put in far less \ntime than Minnesota.\n  Again, assuming that 25 lawyers worked a total of 25,000 hours, then \neach of these lawyers could earn $88 million. And what kind of hourly \nfee is that for our Texas trial lawyers? That is $88,000 an hour--\n$88,000 an hour for the plaintiffs' lawyers in Texas. And if that is \nnot outrageous enough, the $2.2 billion for attorneys in Texas have to \nbe paid out of the Medicare money. So who do we pay, the sick and the \nelderly or the greedy and the lawyerly?\n  Let's compare the tobacco trial lawyers to the rest of the world. \nLet's see how $88,000 an hour compares to the average wage of others in \nour booming national economy.\n  First, we know that minimum wage mandates that workers be paid $5.15 \nan hour. We certainly know that the tobacco trial lawyers are making a \nheck of a lot more than the minimum wage earner. Senator Kennedy will \nhave to pass an awful lot of minimum wage hikes this year to keep up \nwith the plaintiffs' lawyers. In fact, we are going to authorize the \ntrial lawyers to earn nearly 50 times the minimum wage under the \nFaircloth amendment.\n  Simply put, the tobacco trial lawyer is also making a heck of a lot \nmore money than every other wage earner in our country--everybody. As \nSenator Faircloth has pointed out, the baker earns $7.65 an hour; the \nbarber, $8.37 an hour; the auto mechanic, $12.35 an hour; the \ncarpenter, $13.03 an hour; the police officer, $16.65 an hour; the \npharmacist, $25.98 an hour; all the rest of the lawyers, $48.07 an \nhour; and the doctors, $96.15 an hour. That is what everybody else is \nmaking. The Faircloth cap would bring the trail lawyers' stake back to \nthe edge of reason. The cap would allow lawyers to recover their costs \nas well as a reasonable hourly rate as high as $250 an hour.\n\n  I might say even the $250-an-hour rate sort of makes me cringe. I \nsuspect if the Senator from North Carolina had his way about it, it \nwould be lower than that. But that is what the amendment states.\n  I know that amount is not exactly $88,000 an hour. I would not argue \nthat $250 an hour is as good as $88,000 an hour. But it is not exactly \nchicken feed, and it is way the heck more than anybody else in America \nis making on an hourly basis. I would say there are a lot of us in the \nSenate who would like to have that kind of take-home pay. I know there \nare a lot of folks in America who would be more than happy for $250 an \nhour.\n  This cap is extremely generous and eminently reasonable. In fact, the \nFederal Government has established numerous attorney fee caps over the \nyears that prove the point. Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, the \nfee cap is $125 an hour; under the Criminal Justice Act, $75 an hour; \nunder the Internal Revenue Code, $110 an hour.\n  We ought to pass the Faircloth cap. It is fair and it is \nconstitutional. A sweeping Federal regulatory bill cannot leave out the \nmatter of lawyers' fees, especially when omitting the issue would allow \nfor such abuse.\n  Let me spell this out.\n  The tobacco bill is an all-encompassing Federal regulatory scheme. \nThe scheme will expand the Federal jurisdiction over tobacco products, \nregulate the manufacture, advertising, and sale of tobacco products, \nfundamentally affect and alter past, present, and future litigation \nover tobacco products, and facilitate the implementation of the \nsettlement reached between 40-some-odd States and the cigarette \nmanufacturers.\n  It would defy all logic and reason to pass this type of sweeping \nFederal regulation without including some type of minimal regulation \nfor the payment of attorneys' fees for civil actions affected by the \nbill. Basic fairness requires that we not neglect this critical issue.\n  Throughout the debate over the tobacco settlement, we have constantly \nheard assertions that the tobacco companies have gone after women, \nchildren, and the elderly. If we don't pass this sensible fee cap, then \nwe will not only be creating an exclusive club of trial lawyer \nbillionaires--that is with a ``b,'' Mr. President, billionaires--but we \nwill be unleashing a legion of lawyers to prey upon these very same \npersons in future tobacco cases affected by this bill. Surely, nobody \nin the Senate would want such a result.\n  No one is trying to deny any lawyer a fair wage. Surely, $250 an \nhour, which is in the Faircloth amendment, is more than a fair wage by \nthe standard of anybody else living in our country.\n  A vote for the Faircloth amendment is a vote for reason and sanity. \nLet's stop the National Lawyer Enrichment Tour before it starts.\n  Mr. President, just a couple of other observations that I would like \nto make before relinquishing the floor.\n  Neither the Contracts Clause nor the Due Process clause prohibit \nregulation of attorney fees as part of a broad, comprehensive \nregulatory bill.\n  The Court has pointed out that a ``party complaining of \nunconstitutionality . . . must overcome a presumption of \nconstitutionality and `establish that the legislature acted in an \narbitrary and irrational way.'''\n  It is neither arbitrary nor irrational to regulate attorney fees as \npart of a\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\ncomprehensive federal effort to expand federal jurisdiction over \ntobacco products, regulate the manufacture, advertising and sale of \ntobacco products, fundamentally affect and alter past, present, and \nfuture litigation over tobacco products, and facilitate the \nimplementation of the settlement reached between forty-some-odd states \nand cigarette manufacturers. In fact, it would defy all logic and \nreason to pass this type of sweeping federal regulation without \nincluding some type of minimal regulation for the payment of attorney \nfees for civil actions affected by this bill.\n  Even CRS--when looking at a stand-alone fee cap last October--\ndetermined that ``it seems very likely that the proposal in question \nwould not violate due process.''\n  Federal courts have routinely upheld laws that abrogate past \ncontracts, so long as those laws have a rational basis. It is certainly \na rational basis to regulate fees as part of a broad regulatory \npackage. Moreover, it is rational to ensure that an equitable amount of \nfinite resources will be available to protect the national public \nhealth and welfare and to compensate those who suffer from tobacco-\nrelated diseases.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has declared that ``Congress may set \nminimum wages, control prices, or create causes of action that did not \npreviously exist.''\n  In one classic Supreme Court case, the Court held that Congress could \nretroactively cancel a ``free rail pass for life'' given as part of a \nsettlement of litigation. Moreover, to accept the trial lawyers' \ntakings argument, one would also have to consider it a constitutional \nviolation for Congress to require States to abrogate contracts with \nstate employees in order to increase the minimum wage.\n  Professor Brickman has explained that ``[i]f individual parties could \ninsulate themselves from congressional legislation by entering into \nprivate contracts before such legislation were enacted, then:\n\n     the result would be that individuals and corporations could, \n     by contracts between themselves, in anticipation of \n     legislation, render of no avail the exercise by Congress, to \n     the full extent authorized by the Constitution, of its power \n     to regulate commerce. No power of Congress can be thus \n     restricted. The mischiefs that would result from a different \n     interpretation of the Constitution will be readily perceived.\n\n  Finally, the ``constitutionality of the amendment under a Taking \nClause analysis is further buttressed by the fact that attorneys \naffected by the regulation are receiving substantial financial benefits \nfrom [the Tobacco Bill].'' (Brickman Letter at 2.) These substantial \nbenefits for attorneys, financial and otherwise, include the fact that \nthe federal government is: (1) ratifying the national tobacco \nsettlement, (2) establishing a national trust fund to provide States \nwith Medicaid reimbursements and attorneys with a basis for recovery, \n(3) removing limits on tort liability in future cases, (4) making it \neasier for plaintiffs to recover by changing the burden of proof and \nestablishing a presumption that certain diseases are caused by use of \ntobacco products, and (5) creating a national public database with \nincriminating documents to use against tobacco companies in present and \nfuture litigation.\n  No court would view these substantial benefits for plaintiffs' \nattorneys and conclude that they have suffered an unconstitutional \ntaking. Even the CRS document referenced by the opponents of this \namendment clearly spells out that ``indeed, the Supreme Court has never \nfound a taking based on federal legislative alteration of existing \nprivate contracts.''\n  Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina for an outstanding and important amendment. There should be no \ntobacco bill at all--at all--unless this unjust enrichment of this \nselect group of lawyers is curbed. The Faircloth amendment would do \nthat. I commend the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his \ngood work, and I am happy to be a cosponsor of his amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Hollings.\n  Mr. President, here we go again. Now we find out that this bill \ncovers not only prospective actions but it also has been expanded to \ncover, and thereby affect, four State settlements that have already \nbeen finalized in Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota.\n  We have been through this before in Minnesota. The tobacco industry \nchallenged the State entering into a contingent fee with attorneys. \nThey took this challenge to the trial court, to appellate court, and \nthe Minnesota Supreme Court, and they lost every time. This amendment \nis another tobacco company amendment, and I believe they will lose \nagain on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I have to respond to some of what I have heard my \ncolleagues on the other side say about how these attorneys have done so \nlittle. That is a bitter irony, from the point of view of a Senator \nfrom the State of Minnesota. Minnesota, for instance, from August 1994, \nwhen the case commenced, until January 1998--we had numerous, \nunprecedented pretrial and discovery proceedings. Over 34 million pages \nof documents were reviewed. The majority of them had never been \ndisclosed. The tobacco companies fought this over and over and over \nagain on privilege claims. They lost.\n\n  And the irony, I say to my colleague from South Carolina, is that \nmuch of what we know about all of the tobacco companies' tactics of \nmisinformation and deceit come from those documents--from the State of \nMinnesota, from that case, from that settlement. It has a lot to do \nwith the fact that people in the country want us to pass tough \nlegislation. It has a lot to do with the fact that Minnesota led the \nway.\n  What we are really talking about here is something very historic. \nThese States went on a contingent fee basis with lawyers, took on the \ntobacco companies, and these settlements were historic because these \nwere the first time that this tobacco industry had ever lost in court. \nDespite the long odds, Attorney General Humphrey and other attorneys \ngeneral took on the industry, went with contingent fee, and the tobacco \nindustry tried to stop it. They lost in Minnesota. And because of this \nwork, with 34 million documents, additional information, a record of \ndeceit and misinformation by this industry--that is what this debate is \nall about.\n  This is not about anything other than making sure that when consumers \nwant to take on a powerful industry like the tobacco industry, or the \nState of Minnesota wants to take on a powerful industry like the \ntobacco industry, they won't be able to do so. As a matter of \nfundamental fairness, this amendment should be defeated. I just have to \nsimply say, I don't know where my colleague from Kentucky gets all of \nhis arithmetic from--I am talking about Senator McConnell from \nKentucky----\n  Mr. FORD. Thank you. Thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Not Senator Ford--dividing up how many lawyers worked \non this and how much they got paid and all the rest of it. I never \nheard any of that before.\n  Here is what I do know. It is true the State of Minnesota took on \nthis industry. It is true the tobacco industry, just like some of my \ncolleagues, don't want that to happen. It is true they challenged the \ncontingency fee, just like my colleagues are trying to do here today on \nthe floor of the Senate. But the tobacco industry lost in Minnesota in \na case that went to the Supreme Court. Minnesota, working with lawyers \nand working with consumers, unearthed--what is it again; let me make \nsure I have the exact figure--34 million pages of documents.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment should be defeated. If it is adopted, \nit would be great for the tobacco industry, but it would not be great \nfor the consumers and people we represent, and I think Minnesota is \nliving proof of that.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will my colleague be kind enough to give me 10 \nseconds?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 3 or 4 more minutes.\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I won't need that much time.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Joe \nGoodwin, who is an intern, be allowed the privilege of the floor for \nthe duration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  We have had a lot of conversation today about limiting attorneys' \nfees, that this would be a new thing, that the Federal Government \nshould never get into limiting the fees that these magnificent saviors \nof society, the trial lawyers, have done for us.\n  We limit attorneys' fees to every other attorney under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act. We limit to $125 attorney fees against the \nFederal Government in civil rights cases. Now, maybe they are less \nimportant than the tobacco case, but they only get $125 an hour.\n  The Criminal Justice Act has a cap in most criminal cases of $75 an \nhour, and the Internal Revenue Code limits to $110 an hour a cap for \nwinning parties in tax cases. And here we are talking about $88,000 an \nhour in Texas, and this is a fixed, done deal. This is not a guess--\n$88,000 an hour.\n  I just had to think what that meant. A trial lawyer makes more in an \nhour and a half than a U.S. Senator makes in a year. Now, maybe he is \nworth more, according to the testimony we have heard, but in an hour \nand a half, a Texas trial lawyer makes almost exactly the same amount \nof money that we pay a U.S. Senator for a full year's work. And they \nare saying, ``No, you cannot cap these great people, they have saved \nsociety.'' Time after time we hear what they have done to save mankind. \nWell, I don't think they are saving mankind. They are saving their own \nkind, and that is exactly what they are working on.\n  We go back to what they are worth. I don't see how anybody can \njustify this. They say we are setting fees. We set fees on doctors of \nall types--anesthesiologists. For all doctors, we set fees. We set \nhospital rates. We set lawyer's fees. But yet, when it comes to these \nexorbitant, ridiculous fees that the American taxpayers are paying--and \nI repeat that 70 percent of this tax that is being collected and given \nto these attorneys is coming from people making less than $40,000 a \nyear. Extrapolated, that is about 26 minutes' work for a Texas trial \nlawyer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 3 minutes he has \nyielded himself.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair. Does Senator Sessions wish to \nspeak?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, are we swapping sides now?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield such time as necessary to the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has less than \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. About 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from South \nCarolina. I am not a lawyer, and I don't understand all the work that \nlawyers do. When I was growing up, my dad said a little knowledge of \nthe law is dangerous. Get yourself a good lawyer and stay with him or \nher. That is what I have tried to do.\n  I have been in the insurance business, and I understand that very \nwell. How many times has an independent agent down in some small \ncommunity--and I have done it on many occasions--been asked to make \nbids on a piece of property or on a fleet of trucks or liability, or \nwhatever it might be, and the staff in that little agency work for \nhours, day and night, putting together a comprehensive bid. Lo and \nbehold, we lose. That is part of the game.\n  Then we get another bid. It may be on a county or on a city, and we \nwork for days and into the nights putting together a comprehensive bid. \nAnd we lose.\n  But lo and behold, one time we submit a comprehensive bid and what \nhappens? We win. It makes us feel good. But then somebody comes along \nand says, ``Ford, you've made too much money.'' Well, I have lost 100 \ntimes and finally win one and they say, ``Ford, you've made too much \nmoney, you just can't do that.'' So they limit the amount of money I \ncan make as an insurance agent.\n  It is the same thing that happened yesterday. Ninety-eight percent of \nthe farmers who have tobacco quotas voted to keep the farm program. But \nin here, on the Senate floor yesterday afternoon, they said that 98 \npercent didn't know what they were talking about--``We're going to wipe \nout the quotas because we know more than you do.'' That is why they \ndon't like politicians in Washington. They don't want to do what their \nconstituents want them to do.\n  Here we are saying after 98 percent of the people voted one way, \n``You don't know what you want, and we're going to take care of you.'' \nIt is the same way with the attorneys general. Over 40 of them took on \nthe tobacco industry. It was a pretty awesome cause, and they have won. \nThey worked out a deal.\n  Now we say, ``After you have done all that, you can't charge that \nmuch.'' You sign a contingency fee. What is a contract for? Are we the \n``big brothers'' that vitiate contracts? I don't think so. You talk \nabout protecting little fellows. As I understand the tobacco deal, it \ncame from a little fellow whose secretary lost her mother, and he \nfigured out that the States could sue. A little fellow made it, and he \ncame along and others joined with him.\n  We are now saying to these 40-some-odd attorneys general, ``You don't \nknow what you're doing, you paid too much.'' We weren't even in on it. \nWe didn't even help. But now in the end, we say, ``No, you can't have \nthat, that's too much.''\n  They took the chance. How much did it cost? How much did they pay? \nEverything they have paid comes out of this hourly cap. I am sure that \nsome lawyers do better than others. Lord, when I was in the insurance \nbusiness, I would have loved to have had a boat. I had a johnboat I \nfished in, and I was proud of it. I had a decent automobile--I didn't \nhave a jet to fly around in --but I was proud of it. I made it by being \ncompetitive. I went to the people who had an opportunity to give me a \nchance, and I asked them, ``Can I bid?'' We worked it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 4 minutes yielded has expired.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask for 1 more minute.\n  Now we are saying you can't just do it. If there ever was an \nintrusion in private practice, private business--I am surprised at the \nRepublican side. Ninety-eight percent of the farmers say we want it one \nway, and they say, ``You can't have it because you don't know what \nyou're talking about.''\n  Lawyers go out and win a case, and they say, ``You've got too much by \nwinning, we're going to take it away from you.''\n  I don't understand what this body is trying to do. I don't want you \nto take anything out of my pocket, but that is the name of the game, as \nI see it, and when you win, you win; when you lose, you lose. When you \nlose, you pay it all. When you win, you get to pay off what it cost \nyou. You don't put all that in your pocket.\n  So I go back to the insurance business. We spent hours and hours \ntrying to be competitive and win one. But we did not win them all. We \nlost a lot of them. But when we did win one, I would not want somebody \ncoming along saying, ``You have made too much.''\n  It is like gambling. You have to pay--they had an amendment around \nhere saying, ``If you win, you have to pay tax on it; but if you lose, \nyou can't deduct it.''\n  Oh, we are doing pretty good around here, Mr. President. I hope that \nsomeday we can come down and have a little common sense and we can try \nto work this to the advantage of everybody in this country under the \nbasis that we are competitive. It is a free system. And if you come out \nahead, Lord, let's don't say, ``You made too much.'' Let us praise them \nfor being good. The prize is being good. You made it work.\n  So we are saying, ``If you are good, you are going to be \nhandicapped.'' That sounds like a horse race to me. I come from \nKentucky. We race thoroughbreds. If you have one that is way out front, \nyou better put 126 pounds on him. If you have one that is light, you \nput 112 or 114.\n  So that is what we are trying to do here. If you are a thoroughbred \ndoing a\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\ngood job, we are trying to handicap you from running a race.\n  Well, Mr. President, I hope this amendment is not approved. I hope my \nfriend from South Carolina wins on this one. Then we can get on to \nother things and help the farmers that have a tobacco quota. Let them \nwin a little something in the days to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alabama ask unanimous \nconsent to use time from the Senator from North Carolina?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I did not hear the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina controls time.\n  Does the Senator ask unanimous consent that he be allowed the use \nthat time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to use \ntime from the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to mention a few things.\n  First of all, attorneys' fees do affect the settlement because it is \nmoney otherwise available to be paid by the tobacco companies that \ncould be used for health of the children and the good things this bill \nseeks to do, for that money is directly usable for good things, and it \nought not to be given away in unprecedented windfalls for attorneys, \nmany of whom did little work.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Minnesota said that his lawyers \ndid a lot of work. And I think that is probably true. Perhaps the \nMinnesota attorneys have done more work than any other group of \nattorneys in the country. And they were paid, I believe, $450 million. \nThat is not $2.8 billion. That is 5, 10 times what they made. So they \ndid a lot of work in Minnesota, and they are going to get fees far less \nthan this settlement would call for.\n  People say we should not mess with the contracts. But the other \narguments from the people opposing the Faircloth amendment are: Don't \nworry about it. Florida reduced their fees. Although Texas hasn't yet, \nthey may yet. And there are arbitration policies to reduce fees.\n  So they are already admitting it is appropriate to reduce these fees. \nAnd as was noted, we contain fees for doctors and lawyers and every \nother kind of litigation--on many other kinds of litigation in the \ncountry. And we are comprehensively dealing with a health problem that \nis significant.\n  Now, we are here setting about to pass legislation to control abuses \nby tobacco. And I submit we can control abuses by attorneys.\n  Let me make one more important point. With regard to this litigation, \nStates have the right to opt out. They are not required to be bound by \nthis and, therefore, the 10th amendment, in my opinion, would not be \nimplicated. They could opt out and not be bound by this agreement.\n  But they have sought our legislation to comprehensively deal with \nthis in a fair way. And that would call upon us, I submit, to contain \nthe abuses of the attorneys fees.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks at this time and recognize \nSenator Enzi from Wyoming, who I understand wishes to make remarks, \nunless our time has expired and you want to go back to your side, which \nyou should be entitled to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We only have about 7 minutes left. So you have a half-\nhour or more.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Does the Senator from Wyoming ask unanimous consent to take time from \nthe Senator from North Carolina?\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. And I say thank you to the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I do rise to support the amendment numbered 2421 which \nis offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth. I am \nvery much in support of this amendment. And part of it is as a \nprotection to the attorneys. I know they are very sensitive to the kind \nof reputation they get in a lot of instances, and this is one of those \n``save the reputation of the lawyers'' amendments. I am sure a lot of \npeople out there are not used to making $88,000 an hour, and as a \nresult they are probably a little upset with the attorneys who might \nget that in some of these tobacco cases.\n  One of the things that people are seeing in this country is a new \nlottery. And this new lottery is one that requires you have an attorney \nto scratch your card for you. The tobacco situation is probably one of \nthe new easy targets. In fact, I am predicting that the courts are soon \ngoing to be clogged with lawsuits, and part of that is because there \nare attorneys out there who can see this as a retirement bill as well \nas an easy target. It has been adjudicated, it has been worked, and it \nis easy to see that the tobacco companies have been hiding documents \nand doing a number of other things.\n  Along with these remarks, I want to state I am probably one of the \nfew who has not received any money from the tobacco lobby. I have been \nvery concerned about these issues. I grew up in a house where both of \nmy parents smoked, and my dad paid probably the ultimate price for \nthat, even though he quit before he passed away.\n  The amendment would only require lawyers to provide an accounting of \ntheir legal work to the Congress in relation to the legal actions that \nare covered by the underlying bill, including any fee arrangements \nentered into, and it would limit the payments of attorneys' fees to \n$250 an hour. That is not $250 an hour total for the firm; that is for \nthe lawyers that are involved in this, and there may be more than one \nlawyer involved in it. So it isn't a complete limitation.\n  I have heard some comments that this may just be the start of \nlimiting other kinds of occupations. Perhaps it is, and perhaps it \nought to be. Again, I think the people would be appalled to find out \nthat people might make up to $88,000 an hour. And that might not even \nbe the highest case in it.\n  I do have to give some reference to the accountants who were \nmentioned. In accounting ethics, the amount that you charge cannot be \nbased on what you find or the amount that you are working with. It is \nbased on hours worked. We already have that kind of a limitation.\n\n  I don't know of any other occupation where you get to find a pot of \nmoney and then, without being injured or damaged in the case, be able \nto share in that pot of money. Usually you have to have some separate \narrangement for it, some kind of a limitation. Part of that is to \ndiscourage greed.\n  What is happening with the tobacco bill is that there are some \nwealthy and connected trial lawyers that are lining their pockets from \nthe settlement supposedly made on behalf of the American public. This \nbill would impose one of the most regressive taxes in American history \nwith outrageous legal fees charged by insider lawyers, some of whom \nbecome billionaires as a result of their reputation for the States and \nclass actions.\n  A document here mentions that the attorney general of Mississippi, \nMike Moore, got to pick the No. 1 campaign contributor, Richard \nScruggs, who received $2.4 million in fees for the State's asbestos \nlitigation. Then he got to lead the Medicaid recovery suit.\n  Minnesota lawyers might want to know why Attorney General Humphrey \nchose Robins, Kaplan, with a 25 percent fee arrangement when Texas, \nIllinois, Indiana, and West Virginia all had lower percentages than \nthat. They were the ones that had to do the harder work, the initial \naction.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last fall that four lawyers who \nhelped to settle Florida's billion-dollar windfall were now demanding \n25 percent of the settlement, or $1.4 billion. Florida Attorney General \nBob Butterworth has called that enough to choke a horse.\n  In Texas, Governor Bush has filed a legal challenge to the $2.3 \nbillion contingency fee, part of the recent Texas settlement. He did \nthat in the interests of the taxpayers who may end up paying for that.\n  This is not a defense of tobacco or the executives who run the \nindustry. It is quite the opposite. In fact, I am getting a lot of \ncomments from folks in my State. One lady said, ``Let's see now, the \ntobacco companies have been\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nabusing my body for all of these years while I have been smoking, and \nnow you are going to punish them, and the way you are going to punish \nthem is to tax me?''\n  They are figuring that out all over this country. It isn't the \ncompanies that are going to be paying the tab. In these lawsuits, it \nisn't the companies that are going to be paying the tab on that either. \nSometimes it is the taxpayers.\n  In a lot of these lawsuits, it comes directly out of the amount of \nmoney that the individuals might have gotten. They don't have control \nover how much those lawsuits are going to be. If that amount of money \nholds for the State of Texas, those attorneys will earn $88,000 per \nhour for their legal representation. The American taxpayers are going \nto be left holding the tab for a number of outrageous fees.\n  I think it is proper for us, again, in defense of the legal \ninstitution, to limit those fees so people aren't seeing these as a \nlottery for attorneys where everybody else gets the pain and the \nattorneys get the dollars.\n  I ask that you support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment, not because I \nfavor the underlying bill. I do not favor the underlying bill.\n  I want to specifically address this amendment and what is going on \nwith regard to this amendment. We need to get back to the basic \nquestion of what we are all doing here, why we came here, and what we \nought to be doing as U.S. Senators. We who pretend to call ourselves \nconservatives ought to really ask the question, whether or not we want \nto get into lawsuits that have already been decided pursuant to \ncontracts that have already been executed between private practitioners \nof the law and sovereign States, and to go in and say that we are going \nto abrogate what you have done to private citizens agreeing to cases \nthat have already been decided and say we will undo all of that. We, \nthe Federal Government, we, the U.S. Senate, are going to get right \ninto the middle of that and we are going to require you to send billing \nrecords to the Judiciary Committee that I sit on.\n  I did not come to the U.S. Senate to review billing records from \nlawyers in private lawsuits.\n  Now, we need to get away from deciding who the good guys are and the \nbad guys are and just jumping on the bad guys. Nobody likes trial \nlawyers. You heard a defense already about how great contingent fees \nare and they are necessary, and all that is true, and so forth. It is \nbeside the point with regard to this. The point is really us. This \nparticular amendment has nothing to do with the tobacco deal. This \napplies whether or not a company is making a deal with the government \nor not. It applies to Federal lawsuits. It applies to State lawsuits. \nThis has nothing to do with the tax money we are going to be raising if \nthis bill passes, which I will oppose. It is dipping into a completely \ndifferent area that has nothing to do with the tobacco legislation \nbecause we feel like trial lawyers are getting fees that are too great.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't care what the trial lawyers get, if it is \nsomething that is agreed to by the parties and is something that is \nsupervised by the courts. It has been pointed out that in one case in \nFlorida the courts found that the fee was outrageous. That is the very \npoint. If a court determines that a fee is outrageous, they can set it \naside. It is regulated by the courts. It is regulated by the States. \nEvery State in this Union regulates attorneys' fees. If it is \noutrageous, if it is not justified, people can take a claim to the \nStates.\n  Should the Federal Government and should we on our side of the aisle, \nof all people, be urging the Federal Government to get into the middle \nof private lawsuits and deciding what fees ought to be in cases where \nthere is a Federal court or a State court that has already decided, and \nhas nothing to do with Federal legislation otherwise? I think that is \ntremendously bad policy.\n  I think this whole tobacco approach, quite frankly, is bad policy. I \nthink this idea of taxing waitresses and cab drivers in order to give \nthese same lawyers attorneys' fees of any kind is a bad idea. But the \ntobacco companies are bad guys, the trial lawyers are bad guys, and we \nare forgetting the principles that we came up here and are supposed to \nbe supporting; that is, let the Federal Government do what they are \nsupposed to be doing, let individuals have individual responsibility, \nlet sovereign States make the laws, if they want to, and let private \nlitigants go to court and fight it out before a jury of their peers.\n  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I approve the Faircloth amendment that \nseeks to limit attorneys fees in tobacco cases to $250 an hour. In \naddition to being impracticable--it makes the United States Congress \nbookkeepers charged with tabulating every lawyer hour in tobacco \ncases--the amendment simply is unfair. While $250 per hour may be just \ncompensation in some cases, I do not agree that this arbitrary cap is \nappropriate in all instances.\n  Attorneys who took tremendous risks and initiated cases on novel \ntheories deserve, I believe, to be compensated for more than those who \nfiled the just-add-water complaints. Even late-coming attorneys in \nthese ground-breaking cases deserve to be paid at least as much as the \ntobacco company lawyers. This amendment would not allow this, however, \nbecause, while the plaintiff lawyers who have not yet been paid would \nbe subject to the cap, many tobacco company lawyers have already been \npaid an hourly rate that is significantly higher than $250 per hour.\n  While I strongly disagree with this one-size-fits-all approach, I \nshare Senator Faircloth's concern with excessive attorneys fees. I \nsuggest, however, that there are other methods and other limits that \nare far less burdensome on Congress, and will provide a more equitable \noutcome. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just under 20 minutes. Does he \nyield 15 minutes?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that I always enjoy \nhearing our colleague from Tennessee speak. I find myself agreeing with \neverything he said. But it really has no application to the bill which \nis before the Senate and the amendment which is submitted to that bill. \nI agree with the Senator from Tennessee. We ought not to be involved in \nthese things. But that is what has brought us to the floor of the \nSenate today because we are involved in that. We are getting ready, as \nhe said--his words are better than any words I could come up with--we \nare getting ready to tax waitresses and taxi drivers to collect $500 \nbillion to $700 billion, which will be used, among other things, to pay \nlawyers.\n  So to lament that we are in this debate, I think, is something that I \nagree with but it is not relevant to the debate that is before us, \nwhich I want to be engaged in.\n  I spoke at some length this morning, so I don't need to repeat a \nspeech I have already given. But, in watching this debate unfold, there \nare several issues that have been raised that I want to answer.\n  The first issue is we should not be setting fees. I want to ask the \nSenator from North Carolina a couple of questions, if I could have his \nattention. Are we not setting the equivalent of excise taxes to be paid \nby blue-collar workers all over America in this bill?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Absolutely we are.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Are we, in this bill, not setting out in detail, in fact \nin 753 pages of detail, how we are going to spend every penny of this \n$500 billion to $700 billion?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We have detailed every dime of the expenditure, and \nnow we have opposition to detailing the attorney fees.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the point I make is that we have set out in \ndetail how we are going to take $500 billion to $700 billion out of the \npockets of blue-collar workers.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that 73 percent of this money will be \ncollected\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nfrom people and families who earn less than $50,000 a year, and people \nwho make less than $10,000 a year will see their Federal taxes rise by \n41 percent as a result of this cigarette tax. That is set out in detail \nin the 753 pages of this bill. The 753 pages of this bill set out in \ndetail how we are going to undertake the largest expenditure of \ntaxpayer money since we initiated in the Great Society the year Lyndon \nJohnson became President, and each and every part is set out in here.\n  My answer to the question is we shouldn't. We shouldn't be setting \nthese fees. The assertion is we are setting everything else. We are \nsetting an excise tax equivalent. We are setting the expenditure in \nminute detail for everything else. The legal fees will arise from this \nsettlement, which will be adopted by Congress and signed by the \nPresident.\n  So, if we are doing all of those things, why shouldn't we set fees? \nObviously, we should.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. There is great conversation that we are going into \nthese attorney settlements with tobacco companies; that that is wrong; \nthat we shouldn't do that; we are interfering in a private contract. \nYet, we are telling the tobacco companies, without any question, cancel \nyour contracts in advertising, whether it is television, billboards, \nnewspapers, racetracks. All those you cancel. You go back and \nretroactively do it. And because we are trying to set caps on \nattorneys' fees, they say we are interfering in the private sector. \nWhat is the other part of the bill?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would say the argument is even stronger than that. The \nwhole purpose of this 753 pages is to abrogate all of those court \nsettlements. The whole purpose of this bill, the whole purpose of this \n753 pages, is to interfere with each and every one of those court \ndecisions. That is the whole purpose.\n  So if we are going to set out how we are going to collect the money, \nif we are going to set out how we are going to spend the money, should \nwe not set out how we are going to spend the money that relates to the \nportion of the settlement that will go to attorneys' fees?\n\n  The second statement is we are abrogating contracts. Do we not have \nin this bill an arbitration panel that is supposed to set these legal \nfees? The answer is yes. We do. In fact, this bill sets out in some \ndetail an arbitration panel that is going to set legal fees.\n  So the argument that by setting out in law what the maximum legal fee \nis we are abrogating the contract, that is a house we passed 15 miles \ndown the road in this bill, because this bill sets up an arbitration \npanel to set the fees.\n  All the Senator from North Carolina is doing is saying, having \ndecided that we are going to have fees set, let's let Members of the \nSenate stand up and cast a vote on this issue. Let's not hide behind \nsome arbitration panel, which will be made up exclusively, I assume, of \nlawyers to make this decision.\n  What is really the issue here? The issue here boils down to this: We \nunderstand that when we are looking at a payment, which has been \nestimated--and I think correctly--at roughly $4 billion to attorneys, \ngiven the billing records on the cases that have been tried, that \ncomes--there are about 45,454 hours--what this really comes down to is \nabout $88,000 an hour as a potential payment.\n  Does anybody believe we would pass an appropriation bill paying some \n$88,000 an hour? Well, maybe some believe it. Maybe we would. But I \nthink that you would be kind of embarrassed if you went back home and \nit became known that you were going to pay somebody more for working 3 \nhours than we pay the President of the United States for the entire \nyear. I don't think so. Why do we have this kind of money in this bill? \nBecause we are spending somebody else's money. Because as a prominent \nDemocrat politician in my State said of this whole tobacco issue, ``We \nwon the lottery. We won the lottery.''\n  All the Senator from North Carolina is doing is saying we are going \nto set the fee at five times the normal fee that is set. It seems to me \nthat is imminently reasonable. As a matter of principle, if we were \ndebating what our rules should be in this debate, my view is the States \nhave settled these lawsuits and those settlements ought to stand. I \nbelieve that the Federal Government ought to be looking at Federal \ninterests and letting the States settle these issues.\n  If that were the case, then I think setting this arbitrary cap would \nmake no sense. But the point is that is not what we are debating. We \nare debating this great big, thick bill that goes back in and changes \nthe settlement which sets out the amount of money that is going to be \npaid, which pays a payment to the States that is not directly related \nto what they settled for, which sets out in detail how we are going to \nspend this almost unbelievable amount of money, even for Washington, \nDC. The idea that we would do all these things and then we would \nsuddenly get squeamish when it comes down to guaranteeing that we are \nnot going to pay plaintiffs' attorneys $88,000 an hour, I think if we \nare suddenly going to become immodest about what we are doing in this \nbill, if shame is suddenly going to enter into our thinking, it is a \nlittle bit late at this point.\n  So I agree that this whole exercise has us doing things we ought not \nto be doing. But this is not my bill. I perfectly well understand this \nis not the bill of the Senator from Tennessee. His sentiments on the \nbill are the same as mine. I hope we can improve it. I hope we can find \nsomething we can all be for.\n\n  But I wanted to make my point, that to say we shouldn't be setting \nthis fee when we are setting everything else doesn't make any sense. To \nsay we shouldn't be abrogating contracts when the bill specifically \nabrogates contracts, it just does it through this arbitration board, \nwhich we shouldn't hide behind.\n  I think the choice is clear, and I am for the amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I have the time, I would.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield whatever time the Senator needs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I have a question. It seems to me that we both agree \nthat we have a bill that we do not like and that we have an arbitration \nprovision in that bill that we do not like. That legislation has not \npassed yet. The Senator says we are doing all of these things--we \nmight; we might not; that has not passed.\n  Would it not be better for the Senator from Texas and me to join in \ntrying to defeat that arbitration provision and trying to defeat that \nbill instead of adding to a bad provision an even worse provision that \ngoes against our principles, that gets us involved in private \nlitigation, and that causes people to have to send billing records up \nto the Judiciary Committee where we go through and try to justify some \nkind of an hourly rate?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond to the Senator's question. Generally, the \ncase goes directly to the heart of the matter. If I thought that we \ncould correct every problem with the bill, then I don't think there \nwould be a need for this amendment. But my concern is that, given that \nanyone who opposes the bill is immediately tarred as being the lackey \nof the tobacco industry, given the head of steam, at least outside the \nbeltway that the bill has, I am not confident we can correct it, and if \nthe bill ends up passing so that my 85-year-old mother has to pay more \nfor her cigarettes, which I wish she would quit smoking, I would at \nleast be able to say that we guaranteed that no plaintiff's attorney is \nbuying a Lear jet with that money.\n  So this amendment will make the plaintiffs' attorneys millionaires \nbut it will not make them billionaires.\n  Now, should we have the power to stop them from being billionaires? \nIf this were a State matter and we were not involved in it, my answer \nwould be no. But this bill is a preemption of all those State \nsettlements, so how can we do all those other things, set out in detail \nwhere the money is coming from and how it is going to be spent, and \nthen leave the potential that we are going to be reading in the \nnewspaper next month that a plaintiff's attorney got $88,000 an hour \nfrom the tax imposed on blue-collar workers? I don't want to risk that \nhappening. That is why I am for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nfor yielding me 5 minutes. I want to stand up and speak on behalf of \nGrandma Gramm, that her money not go to lawyers as well.\n  Mr. President, I have been following this debate back in the office. \nI followed it for some period of time. I serve on the Commerce \nCommittee. I initiated this debate in the Commerce Committee and \ndiscussed it there. It seems as if the points have been pretty well \nmade, pretty significantly made and repeated in the true tradition of \nthe Senate about five times, so we all get it pretty clearly.\n  One thing that I want to point out, though, at this juncture, because \nthe debate has been engaging, is whether or not the Senate should set \nlegal fees, whether we should get involved in this. And I generally, as \na principle, would say no, we should not, but the fact is, in this bill \nwe already are setting legal fees. We are setting them in this bill. \nAnd so to the extent that we are going to set them, I think the only \nquestion for us to ask ourselves is how much.\n  Should it be nearly $100,000 an hour or should it be $250 an hour? As \nto the question of whether or not we are setting legal fees, they are \nbeing set in this bill. In this bill, we are providing the money. We \nare setting in place the mechanism to give this money to the trial \nlawyers.\n  That is happening. I don't care how you cut it. That is what happens \nif this bill passes. If this bill doesn't pass, that doesn't happen. We \nare setting the amount the lawyers are going to get. The only question \nthat remains is how much per hour is good compensation.\n  Now, I understand the good Senator from South Carolina. He and I \ndebated this in the Commerce Committee. He thinks they are entitled to \nwhatever they can get because they were the ones willing to put forward \nthis litigation. They were the ones willing to put themselves on the \nline. They were the ones willing to say, I am going to go out here, and \nI may not get a dime or I may hit the jackpot. I hit the jackpot.\n  So they are entitled to get that. I understand that. But I can't vote \nfor that. I can't in the Senate say I am going to tax the people so \nthat we can transfer $100,000 per hour in legal fees.\n  I think Grandma Gramm would say $250 an hour is too much, too, but it \nis a lot closer and a lot better than $100,000 per hour. And this bill \nsets those legal fees. No matter how you cut it, it puts the money in \nplace to set those legal fees. Without this bill, that money doesn't \ngo. With this bill, that money does go to lawyers. So it is only a \nquestion of how much. I just ask my colleagues to look at it. Which is \nthe more appropriate figure, $100,000 an hour or $250 an hour?\n  With that, everything having been said four or five times, I yield \nback the remainder of my time to the manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if there was any real sincerity or \nconcern about money--and, incidentally, I never have seen my Republican \nfriends ever worry about people making money. You all really are \nworried about people making money? Come on. You know and I know they \nwould come in here and say, here is the head of Philip Morris--and I \ngot all these things, billable hours--$85,779,000 with stock options \nthere. That is his pay, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n  But I can play that game of so much an hour. Let's talk about the 5 \nyears with nothing an hour. ``He either fears his fate too much or his \ndessert is small,'' we say in the practice, ``to fail to put it to the \ntouch and win or lose it all.''\n  And the lawyers in Florida, in Texas, in Minnesota--nothing an hour \nas of now. Instead of a jackpot, they are hitting a hijacking on the \nfloor of the Senate by a crowd that is trying to make TV shorts that \nHollings is in the pocket of the trial lawyers. The truth of it is, I \nam trying to get into their pocket. I can tell you that right now. And \nI might succeed. I got some names here from the different Senators \naround that seem to know them better than I do.\n  But in any event, the comeuppance is that blood, sweat, and tears. \nThere isn't any question about it, by gosh, when you take the little \nlady who came in, and they decided to bring the case, and he got his \nfriends in and they worked it. And I asked them. I said, ``I saw one \naccount they had $5 million invested in the Mississippi case.'' They \nsaid, ``Well, they got that from the asbestos cases and everything \nelse.'' Maybe that is what it is; the Chamber of Commerce just doesn't \nlike class actions. But that is cleaning up bad medical devices, the \nimplants, the asbestosis, and now cleaning up tobacco.\n  This is not a billable hours thing. They haven't got billable hours. \nZero hours, 1993; zero hours, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998. They \nhaven't gotten a dime. And you all are trying to hijack them on what \nhas been agreed to by the attorneys general, by the Governors, by the \nclients and everything else, preying around like vultures on agreements \nmade. Ex post facto now, they want to come in and show how concerned \nthey are. If you had been concerned, you would have done something \nabout it. I have been up here 30 years, and they haven't done anything \nother than put the ad on a packet of cigarettes.\n  Now we have somebody who has brought tobacco to the bar of justice, \nand they haven't gotten anything yet--zero hours. And yet you all want \nto come in here and play this game about you are all worried about who \nis getting the money.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely ludicrous for this group to come in. \nIt is another design. It is just that you take a poll. They don't like \nlawyers in the poll, so they make the little TV short in the campaign \nthis fall and they say so-and-so is in the pocket of the trial lawyers, \nyak, yak, yak, and everything else of that kind. But I will show where \nthe attorneys general and the Governors and the parties all agreed and \nthe work did it. And we didn't do it up here in Washington. Now is no \ntime to come in here and start preying on people on an agreement that \nhas already been made.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time yielded to the Senator from South \nCarolina has expired.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield 2 of those minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are looking at a situation that is \nliterally intolerable. It is not acceptable to have these kinds of \nfees. I know contracts were entered into, but nobody expected it to \nbreak the way it did. We have law firms in States that literally did \nonly a few weeks' worth of work; States are going to recover billions \nof dollars, and they are going to get 15, 20, 25 percent of that \nrecovery. We already have provisions in this bill, agreed to by the \nPresident and the trial lawyers and the members of the other party, to \ncontain some of these fees in a poor and ineffective way. I say if we \ncan do it that way, let's do it straight up. Let's have a fair fee per \nhour: The more hours you work, the more money you get paid. We have \nevolving all sorts of contracts in this case and abrogating them, and \nwe can certainly make a rational agreement on attorneys' fees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We have been on this now for several hours, and we \nhave come down to two things: Should we abrogate contracts or not? They \nsay they are contracts with these attorneys, they have made these \ncontracts. Well, maybe they have. But we are writing 750 pages of law \nabrogating contracts that the tobacco companies have written with \nadvertising agencies, every condition conceivable. It is 750 pages of \nabrogating contracts.\n  Now, if anyone can sit here and tell me that they believe that \n$88,000 an hour, which is the established fee on the Texas attorneys, \nis a reasonable fee, now, this is being paid by taxpayers' dollars; we \nare collecting this\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nmoney from the working people. Seventy percent, as has been said by \nSenator Gramm and many others, 70 percent of it is coming from people \nmaking less than $40,000 a year. This is Federal tax dollars. It might \nnot have started out to have been Federal tax dollars, but that is what \nit has become when we tax cigarettes and put the tax on these people.\n\n  When I look at the reality, as I believe was mentioned by Senator \nGramm, when a Texas lawyer makes in 3 hours more than the President \nmakes in a year, and a Texas lawyer makes more in an hour and a half \nthan a U.S. Senator makes in a year, there is something wrong with the \nsystem. We might not be that good, but we aren't that bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, under the agreement I move to table the \namendment. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion by \nthe Senator from South Carolina to lay on the table the Faircloth \namendment, No. 2421.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER (when her name was called).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is now our intention----\n  Mr. FORD. I apologize to the chairman. Could we have order? The \nSenate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have several comments to make.\n  First of all, it is time we started getting a list of the amendments. \nSo we would appreciate it if on both sides we could have Members get \ntheir amendments so that we could start in the process, as we always \ndo, of narrowing down the amendments and seeing which can be agreed to \nand start looking at time agreements.\n  Mr. President, the second thing I mention is that we will now be \ngoing, as we have agreed amongst us to go, to the other side for an \namendment. It is my understanding that amendment will be the issue of \nraising from $1.10 to $1.50 a pack. We would like to work on a \nunanimous consent agreement so that it would read that there would be \nthe amendment relative to $1.50, and no second-degree amendments be in \norder to the amendment prior to the motion to table. Further, we would \nask if the amendment is not tabled, it be open to relevant second-\ndegree amendments, and the time between now and that time to be \ndetermined be equally divided, with a vote occurring on or in relation \nto the amendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire wants assurance as to when his \namendment will be considered. We are trying to work that out with the \nmajority leader. I know there are people on the other side who also \nwant assurances for their amendments. I believe the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, is also looking for the same. But it would \nbe our intention at this time, after the usual formalities, to move to \nthe amendment on that side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just for the Senators' information, now the Senate just \nhad a vote on limiting legal fees. That probably is not the only vote \nthat we are going to have on that issue. And the Senator managing the \nbill, I compliment him for doing a very good job.\n  I might mention, some of us also have statements we would like to \nmake on the bill. We have been on the bill now for a day. This is a \nvery extensive, expensive bill. Some of us wish to speak on the bill. \nWe wish to tell our constituents what is in this bill, maybe why we \nhave some concerns, maybe so we might be able to influence people on \nhow various amendments might go.\n  But I just tell my friend and colleague from Arizona, certainly the \nidea of going back and forth on amendments is acceptable, I think, for \nall Senators certainly on this side. But in all likelihood, there will \nbe additional amendments dealing with the issue we just debated.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I greatly fear there \nare lots of amendments right now that are being contemplated on both \nsides. That is why I think we have to start through this process.\n  I ask Members on this side to provide us with their amendments--so we \ncan start through this process.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are prepared on this side with the Kennedy \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is still our desire to finish this bill before the \nweekend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object. Is the unanimous consent \nrequest propounded?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, do I now have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, since I have the floor, I understand there \nis some comity here on amendments back and forth. But what I would like \nis to get an understanding, as we move through this process, that those \nof us who have amendments which have some impact on this bill and which \nneed some time to be debated are going to get a commitment for time and \na place when they will be brought up.\n  I can offer my amendment at this time. It is not my inclination to do \nthat, if I can get an understanding without losing the floor that I am \ngoing to get a time to bring up my amendment.\n  I ask the leader of the bill if he would be willing to agree--and \nopposing side--if they would be willing to agree that the amendment on \nimmunities, which I think everybody is familiar with and is sponsored \nby myself and Senator Leahy, would be available to be brought up at a \ntime specific on Thursday so that there will be a reasonable lead time \nhere, and that time would be at 10 o'clock, assuming that is agreeable \nto everybody and we have 3 hours on that amendment and no second-\ndegrees be in order and we proceed to vote on it.\n  Without that sort of an assurance, I am going to offer my amendment \nat this time.\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will not yield the floor, but I yield for a question. I \nyield to the Senator from New Mexico for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Gregg, doesn't it seem like this is a very \nimportant bill? I gather that it is probably, in one fell swoop, adding \nmore money to government than anything we have ever done in any single \nbill in modern history. Don't you think we have rules and we ought to \ntake our time and do this in a normal manner that befits the Senate for \none of the most important spending bills that we have had in decades?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think that is probably true. The Senator from New Mexico \nis accurate. The normal manner is to offer my amendment at this time, \nsince I have the floor.\n  I am willing to wait until Thursday to do that if I get assurance----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me mention, the Senator and I just had a conversation \nwhere I said he would achieve his goal of a date certain for his \namendment and he said he would agree to a time agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I have the representation of the Senator from Arizona \nthat sometime on Thursday, hopefully early in the day, we will get this \namendment up, it will have a reasonable amount of time and will not be \nsubject to second-degrees, to the extent if that is in the capacity of \nthe Senator from Arizona, and the representation from the other side \nthat that is possible, I am perfectly happy to go forward.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say in response to the Senator from New Hampshire \nthat it has been the custom in this body to go from one side to the \nother with amendments to start with. We just finished with an amendment \nfrom this side and would like to move to that side.\n  I, again, assure the Senator from New Hampshire that the only reason \nI cannot assure him right now is the majority leader is making these \ndecisions, but I can assure him that the amendment will be considered. \nI will work on having it done sometime in the next 48 hours, with a \nreasonable time agreement, if that is reasonable to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think that is probably a reasonable statement from the \nSenator from Arizona, who has a fine reputation in this institution, \nand I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we need to move forward. I would like to \nmove forward with an amendment, and I hope my colleagues would show \nthat comity. It is the other side's turn.\n  I ask that after my friend from Texas makes any comment, if we could \nmove forward. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, going back from one side to \nthe other is the practice when we have a unanimous consent agreement. \nThe Senate procedure is recognizing people who, in a timely fashion, \nask to be recognized, and they are the first on their feet and they are \nrecognized.\n  I went to great effort to try to see that no one objected to bringing \nthe bill up, because I think the bill needs to be debated and I think \nwe all need to be educated. But I am not going to agree to a time limit \non an amendment that I have not seen, nor am I going to agree to not \nhaving a second-degree amendment on an amendment that I have not read, \nnor am I in any way going to limit my ability as one Member of the \nSenate to have a full debate. So I would be happy to have the Senator \nbe recognized to offer his amendment tonight if we want a gentleman's \nagreement. It is a major amendment. If the Senator wants to require \nsome debate, we will want to look at it and see if we want to second \ndegree. We may or may not agree tomorrow to having a time limit on it.\n  Not having seen the amendment and not knowing exactly where we are, I \njust say to the Senator from Arizona, I am ready to move ahead. I would \nbe happy to have the Senator recognized but I am not ready to waive my \nright and the right of every other Senator to a full debate to offer \nsecond-degree amendments. I want to put people on notice of that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me say--I believe I have the floor--that is exactly \nwhat we are doing. I just wanted to allow the other side to propose an \namendment and then we will work on making sure everybody has their \nviews and this amendment is debated and discussed thoroughly, and then \nwe would look forward, obviously, to a time where we could vote on the \nissue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could say to colleagues, there has \nbeen a request for some colleagues to be able to speak on the bill. \nLast night, we were here for a period of time and there weren't many \nSenators here. Again, tonight, depending on the time that Senator \nKennedy is engaged in debate, there will be time, I am confident, for \npeople to be able to speak on the bill. So I hope that Senators who \nhave that desire will take advantage of that.\n  Secondly, I think there has been no effort whatever to try to limit \nthe debate at this point. It is rather an effort to try to gather all \nthe amendments, find out what the second-degree amendments are, share \nthem with everybody on both sides, and have a sense of how we can \nproceed in an orderly fashion.\n  But as colleagues know, the manager of the bill could have come to \nthe floor, filled a tree, held the floor, gone through an alternative \nprocess. We are trying to avoid that, trying to do this in a \ncooperative, bipartisan way, moving from side to side, recognizing the \nneeds of a lot of Senators to be heard. So we hope Senators will take \nadvantage of that.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts wants to be recognized now as the next \nSenator to propose an amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I am not trying to \ndelay my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  I am telling my colleague from Arizona--and actually I told him in \nprivate what my colleague from Texas just said--I am not going to agree \nto a unanimous consent. This proposal was to vote on a $1.50 tax \nincrease, and vote on or in relation to the amendment at 10 a.m. \ntomorrow morning. I am not going to. That is one of the largest tax \nincreases in history. It says no second-degree amendments. Some of us \naren't quite ready to go quite that fast.\n\n  This idea of saying submit all your amendments--I am working on a \nbunch of amendments, but I will tell you we just got the bill last \nnight. We were being pretty collegial saying we are not going to object \nto going to the bill. We could have tied the Senate up for 3 days and \nhad more time to study the bill. Some of us need time to study the \nbill. Some of us are reading the bill and there are interesting things \nto find.\n  On the first day the bill is on the floor to say we will have an \namendment introduced at 6 p.m. and we will vote tomorrow morning at 10 \na.m. on the largest tax increase, without giving us a chance to offset \nit, without giving us a chance to amend it, I think is a serious \nmistake.\n  Now, we are not going to be railroaded. It takes unanimous consent to \npass this kind of amendment or get this kind of agreement. I told my \ngood friend from Arizona he is not going to get it. So we can have the \ndebate. We need to have the debate. We need to talk about whether this \nis a tax increase or price increase. I think we need to study this \nthing a little bit further and not try to railroad it through the \nSenate.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is not some itty-bitty bill. This involves as much as \n$860 billion, according to some.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that there are all kinds of \nviewpoints about this bill?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. On both sides of the floor.\n  Is the Senator aware that, frankly, there is no way of getting \nvoluntary protocols under this bill that would resolve the \nconstitutional issues involved in this bill, especially with regard to \nthe look-back provisions, the ban on advertising, and other issues?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's remarks, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. I know he has had hearings on at least tobacco \nlegislation. I don't know that anybody has had hearings on this bill.\n  Right now we are being asked to vote on some of the most significant \namendments of this bill and we really have\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nhad very little time to even debate the general provisions of the bill, \nto maybe ask the sponsor of the bill and the proponents of the bill to \nexplain some sections.\n  Just to give you an example, there is a look-back provision. The \nSenator from Utah said maybe it is unconstitutional. There was a look-\nback provision that was added that wasn't passed out of the Commerce \nCommittee and that wasn't passed out of the Finance Committee. It was \njust added. It was introduced last night. The look-back provision says \nwe are going to do sampling and find out. If we don't meet the target \nfor teenage consumption, as specified, there will be a penalty of \n$1,000 per teenager who smokes specific brands.\n  It looks very bureaucratic and, frankly, unworkable to this Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to tell the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nthat we had constitutional experts come in and say there is no way that \nlook-back provision is constitutional. They are also saying that, of \ncourse, they tried to cure the advertising restrictions by adopting the \nFDA regulation. But we have top-flight, from the left to the right, \nconstitutional experts saying that is unconstitutional.\n  Then, last but not least, we have a section 14 on here that basically \ntalks about the other advertising restrictions that almost everybody \nagrees are essential if we want to do something about teen smoking, \nand, by gosh, those other advertising provisions have got to have a \nvoluntary protocol, have to have the tobacco companies on board in \norder to be effective, or they are unconstitutional. What are we going \nto do? Vote for an unconstitutional bill, or work on it, and work, as \nthe Senate should, on a bill that could amount to as much as close to \n$900 billion?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I will yield the \nfloor in just a moment. I just make the comment to my good friend and \ncolleague, I stand willing to work with him. I have no intention of \nunduly delaying. I know my colleague from Massachusetts has an \namendment to increase--I don't know if it is taxes or fees of $1.50. I \nknow there are other amendments dealing with the taxes, or the fees, \nand we need to address those. We can do so. I just do not think we can \ndo it in that short of a timeframe that was proposed.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe I have the right of first \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Arizona, as I remember, had the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition. I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Just a brief comment: I thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his concerns, and the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Utah as \nwell. We would like to get amendments together so we can move forward. \nI understand the concerns. They have been made to me, and on this \nfloor. We look forward to a vigorous debate.\n  I thank the Senator for his willingness to work, all of us together. \nI thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 2422 to Modified Committee Substitute\n\n     (Purpose: To modify provisions relating to industry payments)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), for himself, \n     and Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Graham proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2422 to the modified committee substitute.\n\n  The text of the amendment reads as follows:\n\n       Beginning in section 402, strike subsection (b) and all \n     that follows through section 403(2) and insert the following:\n       (b) Annual Payments.--Each calendar year beginning after \n     the required payment date under subsection (a)(3) the \n     participating tobacco product manufacturers shall make total \n     payments into the Fund for each calendar year in the \n     following applicable base amounts, subject to adjustment as \n     provided in paragraph (4) and section 403:\n       (1) For year 1--$14,400,000,000;\n       (2) For year 2, an amount equal to the product of $1.00 and \n     the total number of units of tobacco products that were sold \n     in the United States in the previous year.\n       (3) For year 3, an amount equal to the product of $1.50 and \n     the total number of units of tobacco products that were sold \n     in the United States in the previous year.\n       (4) For year 4, and each subsequent year, an amount equal \n     to the amount paid in the prior year, multiplied by a ratio \n     in which the numerator is the number of units of tobacco \n     products sold in the prior year and the denominator is the \n     number of units of tobacco products sold in the year before \n     the prior year, adjusted in accordance with section 403.\n       (c) Payment Schedule; Reconciliation.--\n       (1) Estimated payments.--Deposits toward the annual payment \n     liability for each calendar year under subsection (d)(2) \n     shall be made in 3 equal installments due on March 1st, on \n     June 1st, and on August 1st of each year. Each installment \n     shall be equal to one-third of the estimated annual payment \n     liability for that calendar year. Deposits of installments \n     paid after the due date shall accrue interest at the prime \n     rate plus 10 percent per annum, as published in the Wall \n     Street Journal on the latest publication date on or before \n     the payment date.\n       (2) Reconciliation.--If the liability for a calendar year \n     under subsection (d)(2) exceeds the deposits made during that \n     calendar year, the manufacturer shall pay the unpaid \n     liability on March 1st of the succeeding calendar year, along \n     with the first deposit for that succeeding year. If the \n     deposits during a calendar year exceed the liability for the \n     calendar year under subsection (d)(2), the manufacturer shall \n     subtract the amount of the excess deposits from its deposit \n     on March 1st of the succeeding calendar year.\n       (d) Apportionment of Annual Payment.--\n       (1) In general.--Each tobacco product manufacturer is \n     liable for its share of the applicable base amount payment \n     due each year under subsection (b). The annual payment is the \n     obligation and responsibility of only those tobacco product \n     manufacturers and their affiliates that directly sell tobacco \n     products in the domestic market to wholesalers, retailers, or \n     consumers, their successors and assigns, and any subsequent \n     fraudulent transferee (but only to the extent of the interest \n     or obligation fraudulently transferred).\n       (2) Determination of amount of payment due.--Each tobacco \n     product manufacturer is liable for its share of each \n     installment in proportion to its share of tobacco products \n     sold in the domestic market for the calendar year. One month \n     after the end of the calendar year, the Secretary shall make \n     a final determination of each tobacco product manufacturer's \n     applicable base amount payment obligation.\n       (3) Calculation of tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     annual payment.--The share of the annual payment apportioned \n     to a tobacco product manufacturer shall be equal to that \n     manufacturer's share of adjusted units, taking into account \n     the manufacturer's total production of such units sold in the \n     domestic market. A tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     adjusted units shall be determined as follows:\n       (A) Units.--A tobacco product manufacturer's number of \n     units shall be determined by counting each--\n       (i) pack of 20 cigarettes as 1 adjusted unit;\n       (ii) 1.2 ounces of moist snuff as 0.75 adjusted unit; and\n       (iii) 3 ounces of other smokeless tobacco product as 0.35 \n     adjusted units.\n       (B) Determination of adjusted units.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (C), a smokeless tobacco product manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units shall be determined under the \n     following table:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             For units:                                    Each unit shall be treated as:       \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot exceeding 150 million                                                                          70% of a unit\nExceeding 150 million                                                                             100% of a unit\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (C) Adjusted units determined on total domestic \n     production.--For purposes of determining a manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units under subparagraph (B), a \n     manufacturer's total production of units, whether intended \n     for domestic consumption or export, shall be taken into \n     account.\n       (D) Special rule for large manufacturers.--If a tobacco \n     product manufacturer has more than 200 million units under \n     subparagraph (A), then that manufacturer's number of adjusted \n     units shall be equal to the total number of units, and not \n     determined under subparagraph (B).\n       (E) Smokeless equivalency study.--Not later than January 1, \n     2003, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report \n     detailing the extent to which youths are substituting \n     smokeless tobacco products for cigarettes.

Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Arizona, who, as I understand, was trying to work out a \ndecent process so that we might debate this during the course of the \nevening, and then at least work out some process where we could have a \nfair allocation of balance in terms of time as we debated it tomorrow. \nI hope those who support that position would, if we don't get a formal \nagreement, at least follow that process tonight and also in the \nmorning. Then the leaders and those who are interested in either \nextending debate, or amendment, or whatever they want to, will proceed \nand will obviously have the right to do it.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Arizona, who was trying in his \nconversations with us to work out a process so there could be an \nadequate time for debate and discussion, and also balance in terms of \ntime between those who favor this position and those who are opposed to \nit.\n  I want to express our appreciation to all of our Members for the \nopportunity of raising this issue with my friend and colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, who has been one of the really important \nleaders here in the Senate on the tobacco issues; also, our friend and \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, who has been the chair of a task force on \nthe tobacco-related issues, and has been really tireless in terms of \ndeveloping a command of this issue, and has also been tireless in \ntrying to work out bipartisan support, not just on this issue but on \nother issues as well; our friend, Senator Durbin, who has been so \ninvolved in this issue, in particular on the price, as well as a number \nof my other colleagues; my colleague from Massachusetts; Senator Reed; \nand so many others. I am grateful to all of them.\n  We look forward over the period of these next several hours and \nhopefully at a time during tomorrow morning to be able to present this \nissue to the U.S. Senate.\n  We are very mindful that only a few hours ago, just a few yards from \nwhere we gathered this evening, we had the good opportunity to be with \nDr. Koop, who is really the foremost public health official in this \ncountry and who has been such a leader in protecting the children in \nthis Nation on this issue, as well as many others. I think that all of \nus who were gathered there were impressed that Dr. Koop was speaking on \nbehalf of all of the public health community. It was really a singular \nvoice in which he spoke for all of the public health communities. We \ncan spell out the reasons why as we get into the debate and discussion \non this issue. He was speaking not as a partisan, not as a Republican, \nnot as a Democrat, but for all Americans, because that is what his \nservice has been to this country as our Surgeon General. He has been \nthe defender of the public health, and also as one who is a keen \nanalyst as to what has been the real strategy of the tobacco industry \nover the period of these past years, who recognized what their strategy \nwas in order to meet their financial requirements, that it was going to \nhave to make a particular appeal to the children in this country.\n  He spelled that strategy out long before it became evident as a \nresult of the various publications of various documents that have been \nmade available to the American people during the process of the various \nState suits. He is really one of the great giants.\n  I took the opportunity at that time to thank him for his strong \nsupport of an amendment that was going to raise the price of a package \nof cigarettes to $1.50, because this would mean anywhere from 750,000 \nto 900,000 young people who would not be engaged in smoking and \nanywhere from 250,000 to about 300,000 young people children who would \nnot die a premature death.\n  I thanked Dr. Koop on that occasion for the families. I thanked him \nfor the children who would not have the addiction. I thanked him for \ntheir parents because their children would not be addicted. I thanked \nhim, for all Americans, for his willingness to take a stand on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are bringing here this evening is not \nan issue which is strange to the Members of this body over the period \nof these past weeks and months. I think all Americans have probably had \nthe opportunity to listen to the public health community, represented, \nas I said, by Dr. Koop, and Dr. Kessler, and the representatives of \nmany of those that have been afflicted with the kinds of illnesses and \ndiseases that have been caused by addiction.\n  We have heard the uniform appeal--the uniform appeal of all of those \nwho have really studied this issue in any detail--that if we are going \nto have a significant impact on reducing the addiction of children in \nour country, the best way to do this is by having an increase in the \ncost per pack of cigarettes, and to do it in a timely way.\n  By ``in a timely way,'' we mean doing it rapidly. We have devised \nthis amendment to be a stepped-up process over a period of 3 years. \nThere are others who have favored a $1.50 increase a pack in a 2-year \nperiod. We have accepted that particular challenge and followed their \nguidance. This amendment, more than any other proposal or amendment \nthat is going to come in this Chamber, is motivated by protecting the \nchildren of this country. That is the reason behind this amendment, \nclear and simple. If you are interested in public health, you support \nthis amendment. If you are interested in protecting children, you \nsupport this amendment. If you are interested in doing something about \nthe problems of addiction and children, you support this amendment. If \nyou are interested in trying to provide some limitation on children \nbeing involved in gateway drugs, you support this amendment.\n  For all of these reasons and many more, this is a compelling \namendment, and it is supported overwhelmingly by the American people, \nby families all over this Nation, Republican and Democrat, North and \nSouth alike. We will have the charts available that will indicate what \nthe various data reflect. That is important and useful perhaps for \nsome.\n  But what we are motivated by and why we are offering this amendment \nis because of public health. Those who have studied this issue in terms \nof children believe that this is the first and most important step we \ncan take to reduce the smoking addiction of children.\n  This chart, Mr. President, points out very quickly and easily for the \nbenefit of the Members the number of children who will be deterred from \nsmoking by an increase of $1.10, 3 million; $1.50, 3,750,000. The \ndifference of the proposal that is in this Chamber will be 750,000. \nThat is what we are talking about by accepting this particular \namendment. We will come back to elaborate on that\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\nin a while. We are talking about the number of children whose lives \nwill be saved by the cigarette price increase. We are talking about \n125,000 who will have an early death.\n  I think one of the questions we are going to be asked sometime during \nthis debate is, well, this is fine and well that you talk about \nincreasing the cost per pack to $1.50, but how do we know this is \nreally going to have the impact that you are stating here this evening?\n  We will have a chance again either later tonight or tomorrow to go \nthrough a number of the public health reviews and the studies and the \ntestimony that has been taken by a number of the committees over the \nperiod of these past weeks. We have had a number of committee hearings \non this very issue. But perhaps one of the most impressive factors has \nbeen what happened with the significant price increase in our \nneighboring country of Canada that moved up to a $5 per pack price \nincrease in 1991 and what happened to youth smoking over that period of \ntime. You see the dramatic reduction of youth smoking as a result of \nthe significant increase in the price of cigarettes.\n  I hope we will not have to take a great deal of time to review that \nparticular phenomenon. It is irrefutable. It is absolutely irrefutable. \nThe public health information is irrefutable; that with a dramatic and \nsignificant increase in the price we see a significant reduction in \nyouth smoking. This is one of the clearest examples to demonstrate what \nwe hope will be achieved.\n  We have set a goal of a 60-percent reduction in youth smoking over 5 \nyears by increasing the price per pack of cigarettes. That is a \nnational goal, and that has been one that has been stated and \nreaffirmed by many, even those who do not support this particular \nproposal. The only way we will get the 60-percent reduction over the 5-\nyear period is by going to $1.50 per pack. That is basic and that is \nfundamental. But I just mention here that after a period of time we saw \nthere was a growth in terms of the black market in Canada.\n  Mr. President, 85 percent of the Canadian people live proximate to \nthe United States. There was an increase in smuggling, and there was a \ndecision that was made by the Government of Canada to basically leave \nit up to the Provinces as to whether they were going to maintain their \nincrease in the higher cost per pack. So they left it up to the \nparticular Provinces, and the result from leaving it up to the \nProvinces is in the Provinces that maintained the higher cost, we saw \nthe continuation of a significant reduction in youth smoking--a \nsignificant reduction.\n\n  We will have a chance perhaps, if necessary, to go Province by \nProvince, but, nonetheless, that was the result. We cannot make the \ncase any clearer than has been made, that this particular amendment is \nthe amendment that deals with children; this particular amendment is \nthe amendment that deals with addiction. If you are interested in \ntrying to do something in the interest of public health, this is the \namendment, with all due respect to the other amendments. We understand \nthe relationship that they have to each other, and I am a strong \nsupporter of the other provisions of the legislation. With the dramatic \nproposals that we are making here on the increase in the cost, when you \nhave the other programs that are built in to deter individuals from \nbeginning smoking and the other reductions in advertising, all of it \nhas a symbiotic effect that will have an important impact on children. \nWe are doing everything we can.\n  The basic support for the proposal we are advocating today is a \nculmination of everything that has been recommended to us by the public \nhealth community. We have taken their recommendations and now are \nbringing them to the Senate. We know the American people are for it. \nThe question is going to be, are we going to have the support of the \nMembers or is the power of the cigarette and tobacco industry, which \nhas been reflected in so many ways over the period of recent months and \nin recent years, going to be again demonstrated in this Chamber in \nterms of resisting these issues.\n  Senator Conrad, who has held hearings with regard to the issues of \nsmuggling and what will the impact of this be on the tobacco industry. \nAll of these issues are important, but make no mistake about it, Mr. \nPresident, those of us who are advocating this amendment are advocating \nit for a very fundamental reason, and that is to protect children in \nour country and in our society, and we believe that the kinds of \nprotections we are offering here are the kinds of protections that are \ngoing to have the most important impact for our country.\n  We offer this amendment which is really one we believe the Senate \nshould move towards and be willing to accept. We can go back in terms \nof the time and understand what is really happening out there in \nAmerica, the impact that tobacco has on the young people of this \ncountry.\n  I see my colleagues from New Jersey and North Dakota are here and \nready to address this issue, but let me just take a few moments to go \nthrough the way children become involved in the addiction of tobacco.\n  Smoking begins early, Mr. President. 16 percent of adults who are \ndaily smokers began smoking--and these are the cumulative figures--by \nage 12. Just think about it. By the age of 12, 16 percent; by the age \nof 14, 37 percent. By 16 or under, we are talking about 62 percent. \nThese are the children who become addicted. These are the children who \ndo not have the benefit of being able to make a balanced and informed \njudgment about going ahead and involving themselves in the use of \ntobacco.\n  We are talking about very young children who begin the utilization of \ntobacco and move on through. By the age of 16, 62 percent of those who \neventually are going to become addicted have already started down that \npath, and they are the ones who have been targeted by the tobacco \nindustry for marketing--for addiction. It is for these children that \nthe studies demonstrate that the increase in the costs of tobacco, \nbecause of the limitations in their purchasing power, will be a very, \nvery powerful and important disincentive to these young people. Added \nto the other features of the program, it will be a serious disincentive \nfor them to get started smoking.\n  Mr. President, I will wind up now to let my colleagues speak. I hear \noften: Isn't this really a disservice to those families who may be \ninvolved in smoking, that they will have to pay, really, a \ndisproportionate share because we will have an increase in the costs of \nthese cigarettes? I must say, that is an argument that you hear out \nhere occasionally on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but the fact is I \ndon't hear that back home in my State of Massachusetts. People, even in \nblue-collar areas, who perhaps smoke more than others in a community, \nare saying we are not less concerned about our children than those who \nmay come from a different socioeconomic background. Those working \nfamilies are concerned about their children. Time in and time out, when \nyou ask working families, ``Do you want to do something about reducing \nthe opportunity for your children to start smoking,'' their answer is \nyes, and overwhelmingly yes. Because they understand, as all of us \nunderstand, that these children, once they get started down the path \ntowards addiction, find it extremely difficult if not impossible, to \nbegin to get control.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor now. I look forward to our \ncontinued discussion of this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the names of Senators Harkin and \nWellstone as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not support this amendment. I don't \ndoubt that the goals of the Senator from Massachusetts and those who \nsupport this amendment are the same as those who support the underlying \nbill, which is $1.10. I reject the notion that more is automatically \nbetter. There is a point at which we have gone too far. Some believe \nstrongly we have already passed that threshold. We just had a little \ndiscussion while we were waiting, while the Senator from Massachusetts \nwas waiting to propose his amendment, that amplified the concerns of \nmany who believe this legislation has gone too far. On the other side, \nthere are some, including the sponsor of this amendment, who believe we \nhave not gone far enough. I don't want us to engage in a bidding war. \nIf $1.50 is acceptable, then why not $2 or $3 or $5, et cetera?\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\n  I point out to my colleagues a very important point here. The bill \nalready has a mechanism for increasing the price of tobacco if other \nmethods fail. That is what we call the look-back provisions. The look-\nback provisions are penalties that are both company specific and \nindustry wide, if there is not a decrease in teenage smoking.\n  If our goal is to reduce teenage smoking, which it is, then these \nlook-back provisions achieve what the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts seeks. I have not been around as long as some, but too \noften our fidelity to a cause is measured only by how high a price we \ncan extract and how much we are willing to bid up.\n\n  It was back in March when the Commerce Committee began work on this \nissue. We worked for a long time and we came out with a package by a 19 \nto 1 vote. As part of that package, it was determined that $1.10 was \nthe appropriate cost--the price of a pack of cigarettes. I might add \nthat was also the position of the White House, the administration, that \n$1.10 was the appropriate number.\n  Since then, we have toughened the look-back provisions. We have \nraised the cap on how much liability the tobacco companies would have \non an annual basis. We have toughened up this bill to the point where \nit has been of great concern on the other side of the aisle. The $1.10 \nwas part of a carefully negotiated package. In and of itself it was not \na magic number. The $1.10 was a tradeoff in return for a cap on \nliability, in return for the look-back provisions, in return for a \nnumber of other things--the language concerning the authority of the \nFDA. So, this was all put together in a package.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts that he was not part of those \nnegotiations because he is not part of the committee. That is very \nunderstandable, although I noted during the time we were doing those \nnegotiations the Senator from Massachusetts was very vociferous in his \nopposition to almost anything that we did. In fact, he was quoted in \nthe newspaper, much to my surprise, as criticizing the committee, which \nI chair. I was somewhat intrigued by that, but that certainly is the \nright of the Senator from Massachusetts to question the credibility of \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\n  I respect the commitment of the Senator from Massachusetts to the \nchildren of America. I respect his belief that $1.50 will do more than \nwill $1.10. But I urge my colleagues to understand that the $1.10 was \nnot plucked out of the air. The $1.10 was the best expert advice we \ncould get and with the concurrence of the administration. There are \nthose in the public health community who agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts that it is not high enough. There are others in the \npublic health community who say that $1.50 is not enough. There are \nthose on both sides of the aisle who think we should have no \nprotections of any kind nor anything for the tobacco industry. Frankly, \nI believe that would just kill the tobacco industry.\n  We are not in the business of trying to kill the tobacco industry. \nLet's keep that in mind. Because, if 40 million Americans are going to \nsmoke, they are going to continue to smoke, and we are not going to be \nable to prohibit that. We tried that with alcohol many years ago. But \nif we are trying to attack the issue of kids smoking, we do have a \nproblem with too high a cost for a pack of cigarettes. That has been \nhighlighted by the Senator from Utah concerning the possibility of \ncontraband. There is a problem, obviously, with too high a cost for a \npack of cigarettes, that there would be a black market that would \nspring up in America. We used the best advice that we could get from \nthroughout the administration, from the public health community, and \nfrom many others, which allowed us to come up with $1.10 as the cost of \na pack of cigarettes to achieve the goal of reducing teenage smoking, \nalong with the other aspects of this comprehensive settlement.\n  I point out again to my colleague from Massachusetts, we have a look-\nback provision in the bill. For every child over the quota in the \npercentage that is not reduced by the tobacco companies, there is a \n$1,000-per-child penalty provision in this bill. That effectively \nachieves the goal which I believe this amendment seeks.\n\n  Mr. President, I know there are many other speakers. We will probably \ndiscuss this some more between now and final passage.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2427 to Amendment No. 2422\n\n       (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to consumer taxes)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment. My \namendment addresses this massive tax that is to be imposed on the \npeople of this country, particularly on hard-working, poor people in \nAmerica. My amendment strips this legislation of the provisions which \nwill impose $755 billion in new taxes on the American people.\n  More precisely, my amendment strikes the upfront payment of $10 \nbillion. Tobacco companies won't bear the cost of this payment; \nconsumers will.\n  This bill, which purports to vilify the tobacco companies--and I am \ncertainly not here to defend them. As a nonsmoker, and having watched a \nnumber of my friends die as a result of smoking, I am not here to \ndefend the tobacco companies. But the bill specifically provides that \ntobacco companies will not bear the cost of these payments, consumers \nwill. This bill requires and would make law the fact that tobacco \ncompanies can't bear this cost of $755 billion. This bill requires that \nconsumers bear this cost. They will bear the cost in the form of higher \nprices, and there are actually penalties in this proposed law for the \ncompanies if they do not transfer to the consumers any of these costs.\n  ``Section 405. Payments to be passed through to consumers.'' Here is \nthe text of the law itself:\n\n       Target price. Each participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall use its best efforts to adjust the price \n     at which it sells each unit of tobacco products in the \n     domestic market or to an importer for resale in the domestic \n     market by an amount sufficient to pass through to each \n     purchaser on a per-unit basis an equal share of the annual \n     payments to be made by such participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer under this Act and the Master Settlement \n     agreement for the year in which the sale occurs.\n\n  The specific law of the statute requires that these so-called \npenalties are really not penalties on the tobacco companies at all--\nthat these so-called penalties penalize the consumers. It is strange, \nindeed, to say to individuals, ``The tobacco companies have been \nmisbehaving. For years, they have been targeting you unduly, they have \nbeen providing you with a product which is deleterious to your health, \nand what we are going to do to them is nothing, basically, except to \nprotect their markets, make sure their market shares are locked in, and \ngive them protection from civil prosecution. But because you have been \nthe recipient of the disease and the difficulty you have from smoking, \nwe are going to pass through the payments to you.''\n  This is adding insult to injury in the most classic of all ways. \nRemember, these are not penalties on tobacco companies, they are taxes \nlevied on the users of tobacco products.\n  Tobacco companies will still pay hefty penalties if teenage smoking \ntargets are not met, but consumers will be safe from hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in new taxes if my amendment is adopted.\n  The so-called look-back provisions of this proposed law say that \ntobacco companies are going to have stiff penalties to pay if teenage \nsmoking doesn't decline, and those stiff penalties are left in place by \nthe amendment which I am offering.\n  It is only the consumer, who is being asked to pay substantially \nhigher prices by way of what really amounts to a tax, who will be saved \nthe $755 billion which will otherwise be occasioned on those consumers \nin the event my amendment is not adopted.\n  Americans today are working longer and harder than ever to pay their \ntaxes. The Federal budget is in surplus. Congress should be debating \nhow to return money to the taxpayer, not how to siphon more out of the \npockets of working Americans.\n  This is nothing more, nor less, than a massive tax increase on the \nAmerican people--$755 billion, which the law requires to be passed \nthrough to consumers. Not that they receive $755 billion; the law \nrequires that consumers end up\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\npaying $755 billion more as a means of punishing the tobacco \ncompanies--three-quarters of a trillion dollars in penalties to \nconsumers whom we are trying to protect.\n  As currently drafted, the proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than \nan excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend money. It seems \nstrange that, in this town, virtually anything will be an adequate \nexcuse for raising taxes. Bad decisions by free people become excuses \nfor massive tax increases in this country.\n  This is the largest proposed increase in Government since President \nClinton proposed his health care scheme. Oddly enough, his health care \nscheme was greeted initially with a relatively high level of support. \nBut as the public learned more about the health care scheme, they \nunderstood that it was more scheme than health care, and, frankly, as \nthe public learns more about this so-called tobacco settlement, they \nwill realize that it is far more tax and Government than it is anything \nelse--17 boards, commissions, and agencies.\n  This huge tax increase will be levied against those who will be least \ncapable of paying. According to the Congressional Research Service, \nright now we know that tobacco taxes are perhaps the most regressive \ntax levied in America. Tobacco taxes are perhaps the most regressive \ntaxes levied in America. About 60 percent--60 percent, 59.4 percent I \nthink is the number; yes--59.4 percent of the new $755 billion tax will \nland on people who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  These are young families. They are working families. To take a three-\npack-a-day figure from those families, some $1,600 a year, is to take \ntheir capacity to provide for their families and require it to be spent \nin Government on something else, something that the bureaucrats in \nWashington will consume, something that will not go to benefit their \nfamilies.\n  Sixty percent of the tax will fall on families earning $30,000 a year \nor less. Households earning $10,000 will feel the bite of this tax \nincrease most of all.\n  Listen to this: The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these \nhouseholds will see their Federal taxes rise by 44.6 percent. As \ncurrently drafted, this legislation will cause someone who smokes two \npacks daily to pay the Government an annual additional fee of $803--an \nadditional $803. Smoking is already an expensive habit, and the \ncollection of this money is predicated upon the fact that people will \nnot quit, not that people will quit. You can't get these kinds of \nnumbers, $755 billion, from people who quit. You are going to get this \namount of money because you know people won't quit and can't quit, and \nthe reason by those who come forward with this tax is, it is necessary, \nthey say, because this is addictive.\n  They say people can't quit. That is what is wrong with tobacco. And \nyet they say that people will choose to pay this because they choose to \ncontinue to smoke. Whether they choose to or not, someone who earns \n$10,000 a year, already spending a couple hundred, maybe $1,000 of that \n$10,000 on cigarettes, now has to pay the Government of the United \nStates an additional $803 annually. Frankly, my amendment would prevent \nthat from happening.\n  As currently drafted, this legislation allows tobacco companies to \ndeduct the mandatory payments ultimately paid by consumers as a regular \nbusiness expense. So what we have here is really an implied subsidy of \nthe tobacco industry, tobacco companies being able to pass through \ncosts to the consumer which the tobacco company then gets to deduct.\n  Again, we find ourselves, here in this setting, subsidizing tobacco \ncompanies, megatobacco companies, the cash cows of American industry, \nwe are subsidizing these companies by placing on ordinary human beings, \nworking families--we are subsidizing them by placing this $755 billion \ntax on working families. Over 5 years, that write-off would be worth \nabout $36 billion to the tobacco industry. I cannot imagine anything \nmore inappropriate than to take money from the hard-working families of \nAmerica and then to use that money which we have taken from the hard-\nworking families of America to provide a $36 billion subsidy through \nspecial write-off provisions for the tobacco industry.\n  By eliminating the annual payments, my amendment would prevent the \ntobacco companies from claiming the deduction. I think we should stop \nthe subsidy for tobacco, in particular for tobacco companies, \nespecially providing a subsidy for them by allowing them to deduct \npayments that are not really going to be made by them--payments that \nare going to be passed through to consumers, hard-working families with \nchildren to feed and clothe, families with payments to make, families \nof individuals who might want to quit smoking but cannot. This bill is \npredicated upon the fact that these families will continue.\n  This massive Government bureaucracy that is planned and the massive \namounts of spending that are projected are all based on this \nwillingness expressed in this bill to tax ordinary working families--\nordinary working families--massive amounts. And 59.4 percent of the \nmoney will be paid by families under $30,000; 3.7 percent by families \nmaking $115,000 or more. This is the most regressive graph of taxation \nthat I have seen since I have had the opportunity to serve in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Before we consider passing a massive tax increase like this, it would \nbehoove us to review the Government's record thus far with respect to \ntaxes, spending, and Government employment. In Washington, DC, taxes \nand spending are more addictive than nicotine.\n  In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress passed 13 major tax \nincreases. Let me refer to the chart which has just been set up here. \nThe Crude Oil Windfall Profit Act of 1980; the Omnibus Reconciliation \nAct of 1980; the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982; the \nSocial Security Amendments of 1983; the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984; \nthe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985; the Omnibus \nReconciliation Act of 1986; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1987; the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988; the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1989; the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of \n1990; the Energy Policy Act of 1992; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1993--15 years, 13 major tax increases.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Didn't most of those also have tax cuts in them?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is pretty clear that the amount of money \nbeing taken from the American family is going up and up. This year, for \nexample, the average American family had to work until the 10th day of \nMay--we just passed it--for Government. That was the time it took for \npeople to satisfy the obligation to Government. That time has been \nextending into the year very rapidly through this entire time period.\n  It is true that very frequently the Congress gives a little bit here \nand takes a lot here, so that there are in this time setting different \nchanges in the taxes. But if you want to look over the period of time--\nand I think it would be a fair thing to do; and I will be happy to do \nthat; and I will bring information about that to the floor--that over \ntime--over time--the Congress of the United States has taken a bigger \nand bigger and bigger bite of the income of workers in the United \nStates. And, as a matter of fact, this would be another huge bite it \nwould take out of the workers, especially of low-income families.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator being willing to \nyield. And I just wanted to make it clear that the record was clear in \nhis answer that there were tax cuts of significance. You can make \nadjustments as to who might have benefited and who did not, but those \nwere not just tax increases. I think that is an important point.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  These items, which I have listed here, are times when the taxes were \nraised on American families and American industry. I think over time \nmost of us understand that we are paying more in taxes now than ever \nbefore. As a matter of fact, right now Americans work harder and longer \nin peace and prosperity than we have worked at any time in history to \npay our taxes.\n  So whether or not there were a few things in this list where someone \nwas\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\ngiven a tax break while someone else had a tax increase, that may have \nbeen the case, but the truth of the matter is, we have been taking two \nsteps backwards at least for every step forward. Government has been \ntaking a bigger and bigger and bigger share. And now Americans work \nfurther and further into the year every year in order just to satisfy \nthe appetite of Government rather than to provide for themselves.\n  Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first meaningful tax cut \nsince--well, since about 1981. And the tobacco tax increase would more \nthan erase every bit of what we did last year in terms of taking more \nfrom the American people. It seems to me that what we need to do is not \ngo back on what we did last year; we need to extend what we did last \nyear. We do not need to increase taxes. Taxes are at an all-time high.\n  Tax freedom day, as I mentioned, was May 10 this year. Federal, \nState, and local taxes claimed 37.6 percent of the income of a median \ntwo-income family in 1997. Now, these taxes were more than the couple \nspent on food, shelter, clothing, and transportation--more than they \nspent on their cars, their houses, their food, and their clothing.\n\n  It seems to me that we ought to be wondering about how we could \nreduce taxes. During Bill Clinton's first 5 years in office, the \nFederal Government collected 29 cents in taxes for every dollar \nincrease in the gross domestic product. According to the Joint Economic \nCommittee, ``The federal government is now taking a higher share of \neconomic growth than under any president in recent history.''\n  The Joint Economic Committee continues: ``The average rate during the \nentire era before President Clinton--from Presidents Eisenhower to \nBush--was 19%.'' We are now taking 29 cents of each dollar increase in \ndomestic product.\n  Obviously, the Federal Government has yet to reject the sentiment \nexpressed by King Henry IV nearly 600 years ago. He put it this way: \n``You have gold. I want gold. Where is it?''\n  Well, I think we have a bill here that says, ``You have gold. We want \ngold. And we don't care how poor you are. We don't care how you're \nstruggling to make ends meet.'' As a matter of fact, we will make a \nvery repressive tax, but we want to spend. Tax-and-spend as tax-and-\nspend--it does not matter which party sponsors it, who does it. Tax-\nand-spend is the invasion of Government in the province of the lives of \nindividuals, and we have every reason to want to reject it.\n  To collect this bounty, the Federal Government has developed a \ncomplex system. A recent report by the Heritage Foundation reveals just \nhow complex.\n  Mr. President, 136,000 employees at IRS and elsewhere in the \nGovernment who are responsible for the tax laws; $13.7 billion is the \namount of tax money spent by the IRS and other agencies to enforce and \noversee the code; 17,000 is the number of pages of IRS laws and \nregulations, 12,000 not including Tax Court decisions and IRS letter \nrulings--12,000.\n  And 5.5 million is the number of words in the income tax laws and \nregulations; 820, the number of pages added to the Tax Code by the 1997 \nBudget Act; 250 is the number of pages needed to explain just one \nparagraph in the Internal Revenue Code; 271 is the number of new \nregulations issued by the IRS in 1997; 261 is the number of pages of \nregulations needed to clarify the Tax Code's ``arms-length standard'' \nfor international intercompany transactions, and on and on and on.\n  Incidentally, 293,760 is the number of trees it takes each year to \nsupply the 8 billion pages of paper used to file income taxes in the \nUnited States.\n  Many years ago, Senator Everett Dirksen quipped, ``a billion dollars \nhere, a billion dollars there, and pretty soon you're talking about \nreal money.''\n  Unfortunately, because of Washington's profligate ways, what was once \nreal money has become little more than a rounding error. The budget \nresolution passed by the Senate last month recommended the Federal \nGovernment spend $9.15 trillion over the next 5 years. That is a 17.3-\npercent increase from the previous 5 years.\n  According to a recent Cato report, the Government's fiscal record is \nnothing to brag about. Over the past 10 years, the Federal domestic \nexpenditures have soared by 79 percent. After adjusting for inflation, \nthis is an enormous 34-percent increase. Over that same period, family \nincome adjusted for inflation has grown by 9 percent. There is the \ncontrast. There is the problem: a 34-percent increase in Government, \nFederal domestic expenditures; a 9-percent increase in the income of \nthe average family.\n  So today I provide an opportunity for this body, the Senate of the \nUnited States, I provide an opportunity for the Senate to say to the \nAmerican people, ``Enough is enough.'' Even if you make a bad decision \nas a free person to smoke, we are not going to decide that we are going \nto take from you the capacity to spend money and resources on your own \nfamily. We are not going to say that the tobacco companies are bad \noperators and bad companies, and as a result of their problems and \ntheir poor conduct, we are going to punish you, the individuals who \nsmoke.\n  We are not going to provide that 59.4 percent of all the $755 billion \nto be collected by individuals trapped in the habit of smoking is to be \nprovided by individuals who make less than $30,000. We are not going to \ncontinue to inflict that kind of harm on individuals who are low income \nand compound the problem. Now Government will come in and sweep from \nthem their capacity to provide for their own families.\n  That is not something that we are interested in doing. We are \ninterested instead of saying we don't really agree with this bill, in \nsaying that everything has to be passed on to the consumer, that as a \nway of punishing tobacco companies we will take money from consumers. \nWe are going to try to make it very difficult. If a guy smokes a couple \nof packs a day, we are going to make sure that he spends 800 bucks more \na year just for the Government, not to be able to address the needs of \nhis family, not to provide for his family, not to provide for himself. \nBut we are going to just say because tobacco companies have done things \nthat are improper, we are going to punish hard-working American \ncitizens.\n  My own view is that is a misplaced effort. If we really want to try \nto make sure that we curtail teen smoking, there are a lot of things we \ncould do. I don't even think this bill makes it illegal for teens to \npossess tobacco. I don't think it even makes it illegal to possess \ntobacco in the District of Columbia. This bill doesn't even curtail, in \nmy understanding, doesn't curtail smoking in the Capitol. We criticize \nJoe Camel, a cartoon character. We criticize a cartoon character for \nbeing a role model for young people who want to emulate and smoke. But \nwe don't curtail, I don't believe--and I would be glad to be \ncorrected--I don't think we stop smoking in the U.S. Capitol. In the \nDistrict of Columbia, we don't make it illegal for teens to possess \ntobacco. Now, it is virtually uniform around the country that it is \nillegal to sell tobacco to teens, but there are things we can and ought \nto do to curtail tobacco use among teens.\n  And I leave with this amendment, I leave in the bill the penalties on \ntobacco companies for failure to meet the targets. I simply, with this \namendment, take the penalties against consumers out of the bill. I \nsimply do not provide for the punishment of poor American families, \nworking families. I do not provide for their punishment for what the \ntobacco companies have done. I think it is inappropriate.\n  So I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2427 to amendment numbered 2422.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       (1) Amounts equivalent to penalties paid under section 202, \n     including interest thereon.\n       (c) Repayable Advances.--\n       (1) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to the trust fund, as repayable advances, such sums as may \n     from time to time be necessary to make the expenditures \n     authorized by this Act.\n       (2) Repayment with interest.--Repayable advances made to \n     the trust fund shall be repaid, and interest on such advances \n     shall be\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\n     paid, to the general fund of the Treasury when the Secretary \n     of the Treasury determines that moneys are available in the \n     trust fund for such purposes.\n       (3) Rate of interest.--Interest on advances made under this \n     subsection shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary of \n     the Treasury (as of the close of the calendar month preceding \n     the month in which the advance is made) to be equal to the \n     current average market yield on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States with remaining period to \n     maturity comparable to the anticipated period during which \n     the advance will be outstanding.\n       (d) Expenditures From Trust Fund.--Amounts in the trust \n     fund shall be available in each calendar year, as provided by \n     appropriations Acts, except that distributions to the States \n     from amounts credited to the State Litigation Settlement \n     Account shall not require further authorization or \n     appropriation and shall be as provided in the Master \n     Settlement Agreement and this Act, and not less than 15 \n     percent of the amounts shall be expended, without further \n     appropriation, notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, from the trust fund for each fiscal year, in the \n     aggregate, for activities under this Act related to--\n       (1) the prevention of smoking;\n       (2) education;\n       (3) State, local, and private control of tobacco product \n     use; and\n       (4) smoking cessation.\n       (e) Budgetary Treatment of Trust Fund Operations.--The \n     receipts and disbursements of the National Tobacco Settlement \n     Trust Fund shall not be included in the totals of the budget \n     of the United States Government as submitted by the President \n     or of the congressional budget and shall be exempt from any \n     general budget limitation imposed by statute on expenditures \n     and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States \n     Government.\n       (f) Administrative Provisions.--Section 9602 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply to the trust fund \n     to the same extent as if it were established by subchapter A \n     of chapter 95 of such Code.\n\n     SEC. 402. STATE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is established within the trust fund \n     a separate account, to be known as the State Litigation \n     Settlement Account.\n       (b) Transfers to Account.--From amounts received by the \n     trust fund under section 403, the State Litigation Settlement \n     Account shall be credited with all settlement payments \n     designated for allocation, without further appropriation, \n     among the several States.\n       (c) Reimbursement for State Expenditures.--\n       (1) Payment.--Amounts credited to the account are \n     available, without further appropriation, in each fiscal year \n     to provide funds to each State to reimburse such State for \n     amounts expended by the State for the treatment of \n     individuals with tobacco-related illnesses or conditions.\n       (2) Amount.--The amount for which a State is eligible for \n     under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year shall be based on \n     the Master Settlement Agreement and its ancillary documents \n     in accordance with such agreements thereunder as may be \n     entered into after the date of enactment of this Act by the \n     governors of the several States.\n       (3) Use of funds.--A State may use amounts received under \n     this subsection as the State determines appropriate.\n       (4) Funds not available as medicaid reimbursement.--Funds \n     in the account shall not be available to the Secretary as \n     reimbursement of Medicaid expenditures or considered as \n     Medicaid overpayments for purposes of recoupment.\n       (d) Payments To Be Transferred Promptly To States.--The \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer amounts available \n     under subsection (c) to each State as amounts are credited to \n     the State Litigation Settlement Account without undue delay.\n       (  ) Provisions Relating to Amounts in Trust Fund.--\n       (1) Certain provisions null and void.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the following provisions of this Act \n     shall be null and void and not given effect:\n       (B) Sections 402 through 406.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I \nhave been authorized by the majority leader to announce there will be \nno further votes this evening. The Senate will remain in session for \nthose Members interested in debating this important issue.\n  By mid to late morning tomorrow, I intend to move to table the \npending Ashcroft amendment and the Kennedy amendment, all in an effort \nto move this bill along. Again, the next vote should occur around 11 \na.m. on Wednesday.\n  While I have the floor, Mr. President, I make one comment. I am the \nfather of four children. I come from a high-income bracket. I love my \nchildren. I believe that low-income Americans love their children, as \nwell. And I have talked to many low-income Americans, both in person \nand by mail and on talk shows, who have said, ``Senator McCain, I \nsmoke. I wish I didn't smoke. My children are beginning to smoke. \nPlease do everything you can to stop it.''\n  Mr. President, to believe somehow that low-income families aren't as \nconcerned about their children and whether they are going to smoke or \nnot, frankly, is not something that I agree with, nor I believe is it \nfair to low-income families all over America. Low-income families in \nAmerica love their children as I love my children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2421\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this obviously is going to be a fairly \nlong debate. We are going to hear about everything from tax policy to \nlove of country to how we deal with our budgets. We are going to hear \nall kinds of things.\n  Mr. President, I join with my distinguished friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts in proposing the $1.50 amendment, if I can call it that, \nthat both he and I have had a longtime interest in. I want to make some \ncomments on the entire bill before I go into the specifics of the \n$1.50.\n  Senator Kennedy has been the leader in all matters of health and \nconcern for young people, always out in the front, helping to defend \nwhat is right in our country. I have great respect for him and I am \npleased to share this particular interest in reducing teen smoking.\n  Today we begin consideration of legislation that is long overdue. It \ntackles one of the most important health issues of our time, because \ntoday we begin the questions to finally reform the way tobacco products \nare sold in this country and the way the tobacco industry operates.\n  Getting to this point has not been an easy journey. Despite the fact \nthat the tobacco industry has for decades engaged in shameless \ncorporate conduct, the Congress has never acted in a comprehensive way \nto get this industry under control. However, we have now reached a \npoint where the American people no longer tolerate inaction on this \nissue.\n  I have been fighting to protect Americans from the dangers of smoking \nfor over a decade in the U.S. Senate, along with the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Durbin. We authored the first ban on \nsmoking in airplanes in 1987. Just a few weeks ago, we celebrated the \ntenth anniversary of the implementation of that legislation.\n  Frankly, I believe that ban, that opportunity for people to fly and \nto travel in that close space free of tobacco smoke, was a catalyst for \nfurther antitobacco activity. They saw how pleasant it was. When people \nrode on airplanes, they saw how nice it was to have smoke-free travel, \nfreedom from other people's tobacco smoke. Many who suffered from \nallergies, or had respiratory problems, or just couldn't endure being \ntrapped in a smoking airplane cabin finally felt free to travel by \nairplane in what they considered a personally safer environment.\n  But, despite the wishes of the American people, we had a tough time \ngetting that legislation in place. It was a long, tough battle. We \nargued. We negotiated. We finally settled for a 2-hour ban, with the \npromise that we would wait 18 months for studies to come in. But the \ninterest of the public was so overwhelming that we didn't have to wait \n18 months. It began to become a cry across the country: Please, if you \nare going to ban smoking in airplane flights for 2 hours, for goodness \nsake, if it is a 6-hour flight, give us a break. And we immediately \nchanged what had been a 2-hour ban to a 6-hour ban and now all flights \nacross this country and many across the ocean.\n  But despite the wishes of the American people, the tobacco industry \nhas been able to use its power and its influence to stop real reform of \ntobacco industry behavior until this week.\n  Now, we are poised to finally act in a comprehensive way to tackle \nthe major problems this industry has caused our Nation. First and \nforemost is the issue of teen tobacco use.\n  Mr. President, newly released industry documents show how the tobacco \nindustry specifically and deliberately targeted our kids for addiction. \nThey knew what they were doing. They put up fancy drawings and \nbeautiful pictures of healthy people riding horseback and playing \nsports. They knew what was happening. They knew very well they were \ncreating addiction for\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\nthe children. They were seducing them into picking up the smoking \nhabit.\n  In addition, the industry's very own documents talk about ways to \nfurther entrap young smokers into a lifetime of addiction by \nmanipulating the quality of nicotine in these cigarettes. The documents \nrecently revealed also contain strategies on how to spread fake science \nto confuse their customers about the health effects of tobacco \nproducts.\n  Mr. President, not only did the industry commit these acts but it \ncame before the Congress and lied about it. Now these very same \ncompanies have decided that they are going to fight back against the \npopular will. They are going to fight back against the Congress' final \nawakening to the evils of smoking and to do something about it. They \nhave decided that they are going to take a chance and spend $50 million \nor more for deceit with a misleading advertising campaign to stop the \nSenate action this week. You have seen it on TV. You hear it on the \nradio. You see it in print: After all, we were willing to pay $500 \nmillion. After all, we want to be proper citizens. But the Senate and \nthe House want to take away our right. They want to invade people's \nlives.\n\n  It is for that very reason that we have to act now and pass strong \ncomprehensive tobacco legislation. The Senate must prove to the \nAmerican people this week that we have broken from the past; we will no \nlonger trade the future of our children for cold, hard tobacco industry \ncampaign cash. This is effectively our Bastille Day. The reign of the \ntobacco industry on Capitol Hill must end today, now. We have an \nopportunity to prove to the American people that big tobacco's free \nride is over.\n  Mr. President, there are going to be lots of votes for us this week \nto prove our good faith.\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the \ncommittee itself have given us a foundation to build on. I congratulate \nthem and thank them for this and commend them for all of their hard \nwork.\n  But we have more heavy lifting to do, because what we see in front of \nus has to be amended and has to be expanded in order to do the job that \nwe want to see done. Our Nation's leading health experts tell us that \nwe have a way to go this week before this bill should be approved by \nthe U.S. Senate. Names that Americans trust, like Dr. C. Everett Koop, \nDr. David Kessler, tell us that this bill needs improvement.\n  That is why it is imperative that the Senate adopt amendments that \nwill be offered to put some more teeth into this bill. We will have \nvotes this week on the Kennedy-Lautenberg amendment that would call for \na $1.50 price increase on a pack of cigarettes to really discourage \nyouth smoking.\n  We will also vote on whether Congress should provide this industry \nwith special protections on legal liability. Additionally, we will \nlikely vote on look-back surcharges to see whether or not the companies \nwill use all of their skills and knowledge to reduce teen smoking. And \nwe will likely vote on preemption of local laws and on advertising \nrestrictions. These will all be key votes, and the American people will \nbe watching.\n  I will not make my final decision on this legislation until I see the \noutcome of these votes and see what difference the amendments make in \nthe quality and the extent of this bill. I hope, Mr. President, we can \nhead into the Memorial Day weekend proud of what we did this week.\n  As we remember our brave men and women who sacrificed their lives \nfighting for our country, I ask my colleagues to join the fight to \nprotect our people from premature death and sickness as we would have \nif a foreign invader was to declare war on us and in 1 year killed more \nthan 400,000 Americans--400,000 Americans. It is more deaths in 1 year \nthan all of the combat deaths in all of the wars fought by Americans in \nthe 20th century. We are looking at World War I, World War II, Korea, \nVietnam, and other wars fought in this century. Once again, more \nAmericans die each and every year from tobacco-caused disease than died \nin combat in all of the wars that I have just mentioned.\n  So we want to fight back against the attackers, as we should. What if \nwe were invaded by a foreign enemy? Now is the time to respond to a \ncall to arms.\n  Mr. President, this $1.50 amendment will test whether or not we are \nserious about cutting teen smoking or whether we are going to once \nagain appease the industry. If we are serious about cutting teen \nsmoking, then we must raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.50 a \npack. We have to get to that level quickly, within 3 years.\n  I want to point out on this chart what we understand. The source of \nthis is the Department of the Treasury. It says the number of children \nwho will be deterred from smoking based on these prices: A $1.10 \nincrease will stop 3 million kids from picking up the smoking habit; a \n$1.50 increase will stop 3.75 million children from picking up the \nsmoking habit. We know that once they start--we have seen it on the \nchart displayed by the Senator from Massachusetts about when people \nstart smoking at a very young age. I know I did. It took me some 25 \nyears to recognize what a foolish thing I was doing. I didn't recognize \nit until my youngest daughter said one day, ``Daddy, we learned in \nschool today that if you smoke, you will get a black box in your \nthroat, and I love you, and I do not want you to have a black box in \nyour throat. Daddy, please stop smoking.'' Within 3 days I stopped \nsmoking, after numerous attempts.\n  The number of children whose lives will be saved by the cigarette \nprice increases is 1 million at $1.10; $1.50, 1.25 million people--1.25 \nmillion children whose lives will be saved by responding to that \npressure from the price increase.\n  We have heard everything here today about tax increases and how we \nare taxing those unfortunate people of modest income.\n  The Senator from Arizona said everybody loves their children just as \nmuch regardless of their income class. The fact is we would like, all \nof us, to see the cessation of smoking or the reduction of smoking \namong children.\n  One of the things that happens as we discuss this $1.50-a-pack \npossibility is that we would then be extracting from those whose use \ncosts us more because of their habit to pay for some of the costs that \nthey incur. If someone wants to use their car more often, they buy more \ngasoline. They pay a higher price. If they want a bigger house, they \npay a higher price. If they want to use more fuel to warm or cool their \nhouse, they pay a bigger price. If they use more of the health care \nsystem, they should pay a bigger price. It is an unfortunate reality, \nbut smoking costs this country $50 billion a year in increased health \ncosts--$50 billion a year. And we are talking about something that is \nconsiderably less of a tax, less of a cost on those companies and the \nindividuals who pick up the smoking habit.\n  We want to stop people from smoking. Just think about it. We heard \ntalk about the fact that this is a tax increase on hard-working \nfamilies. Well, hard-working families ought to be interested in the \nmoney that they save. Imagine if we stopped people from smoking. Here \nwe say a million and a quarter people. It will cost them over $2,000 a \nyear, or they will save $2,000 a year as a result of dropping the \nsmoking habit. Two packs of cigarettes a day, estimated at the lowest, \nperhaps $4 a pack, if the $1.50 increase goes into effect. But let's \nsay it is $3 a pack. Three dollars a pack, twice a day; $6 times 7, $42 \na week, times 52 weeks a year; over $2,000 a year that poor, hard-\nworking families could very well use to buy other things they need far \nmore than cigarettes.\n  Smoking among children and teens has reached epidemic proportions. \nThree thousand children begin smoking each and every day, and a third \nof them, 1,000, will die prematurely as a result of the smoking habit. \nEvery year we lose over 400,000 Americans to tobacco-related illness \nand over 90 percent of them started as kids.\n  The managers' amendment claims to raise the price of a pack of \ncigarettes $1.10 in 5 years, but the public health community tells us \nthat $1.10 just won't do the job. The goal we have set in Congress is \nto cut teen smoking in half, and if you examine the $1.10 proposal, it \nis clear that it doesn't cut it. Independent economists tell us that a \n$1.10 increase will only result in a 33-percent reduction in teen \nsmoking over 5 years.\n  Hallelujah, I would love to see that happen--even that. But on the \nother\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\nhand, these same economists say a $1.50 price increase will result in \nthe 50-percent reduction target in 5 years. What an accomplishment that \nwould be. Imagine that in a few years when those kids who would have \nstarted smoking are not smoking. More than 200,000 Americans who would \nhave otherwise died would be alive. Families would not be grief \nstricken at the loss of someone they care about because of the smoking \nhabit, or watch someone who was a good athlete unable to function, \nunable to run, unable to breathe without lots of labor because we were \nin this early stage able to stop teen smoking.\n  The reason we are not focused on adults so much in this as teen \nsmoking is because it doesn't have the same impact on adult smokers. We \nhave over 40 million people who are addicted to tobacco. I never met \nanybody who is a smoker who will not tell me about the number of times \nthey stopped and how long. They remember those as key moments in their \nlife: I once stopped for 2 weeks, for 2 solid weeks I didn't have a \ncigarette. What do you think? And then I was watching the ball game or \nmy friend Charlie at the office had a problem and got sick and I \nstarted smoking again. And I will be darned; I just haven't been able \nto stop. But one of these days I am going to do it, I promise you that. \nI wish I could.\n\n  Talk to people who stand outside buildings all over America who are \nprohibited by the rules from smoking in the building and you see them \npuffing away. I was one. I don't make fun of them, I promise you that. \nSee them standing out there in the cold weather freezing to finally get \nthat puff on the cigarette.\n  The other day I took the train from Philadelphia to Newark, and I \nwatched a fellow get off the train, light up quickly on the platform, \ntake two or three drags on the cigarette and chuck it and get back in \nthe train. He is not happy with his habit. He may have been happy to \nhave a puff on that cigarette, but I assure you, when that man thinks \nabout what he is doing, he is not happy that he is an addict. No \naddict, whether illegal drugs or tobacco, is happy with the condition, \nbut they are committed to it.\n  And so our mission is to stop them before they start, because it is \nunrealistic to say stop after they have been doing it for a long time. \nYou can never get to it. So what we will do is make an investment now \nthat will start to pay off 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 20 \nyears from now, when we will see our costs for health care and our \ncosts for lost productivity will diminish considerably, and maybe even \nend, and we will be looking at a Nation that is considerably healthier.\n  Why should the Senate stand for half measures? Public health \norganizations and Drs. Koop and Kessler agree that the price of tobacco \nproducts must be increased by at least $1.50 in 3 years, and be \ncontinuously indexed, by the way, for inflation. Otherwise, we will \nfall short of meeting our goals of cutting teen smoking in half.\n  A variety of factors contribute to a teenager's decision to try that \nfirst cigarette or chew that first bit of spit tobacco, as we call it. \nBut the price of tobacco is a critical factor. The higher the price, \nthe less likely the child will be to continue to use tobacco.\n  Again, the U.S. Department of the Treasury says it--the number of \nchildren who will be deterred from smoking if we adjust the prices, \naccording to this chart.\n  I would also like to ask my colleagues not to be fooled by the \nindustry's deceptions that this price increase will bankrupt them. I \nremind my colleagues that these are the same folks who testified before \nCongress under oath that nicotine is not addictive. The tobacco \nindustry made $7.2 billion in profit in 1997. And according to an MIT \nanalysis, a $1.50 price increase would not bankrupt the industry by any \nstretch of the truth or imagination. In fact, the MIT analysis shows an \nindustry profit of $5.2 billion with a $1.50 price increase.\n  And further, the industry claims that this price increase will create \na black market. Well, this black market looks like a red herring to me, \nI must tell you. We can pass tough antismuggling laws that will prevent \na black market. It doesn't, unfortunately, hurt the tobacco companies \nif their product is sold in a black market. I want everybody to keep \nthat in mind. If company X sells its products and it gets by without \nthe $1.50 user fee imposed on it, they still get the same profit back \nin Winston Salem, NC, or wherever they are based. So that black market, \nso to speak, is not something that, frankly, I see making the tobacco \ncompanies very unhappy. In fact, the managers' amendment includes \nantismuggling language that I coauthored. This language is tough. It \nwill go a long way towards cracking down on smuggling--the same way we \nhave cracked down on alcohol smuggling in recent years.\n  This $1.50 proposal has bipartisan support. I offered it as a sense \nof the Senate in the Budget Committee, and it passed overwhelmingly. It \npassed in the Budget Committee. A similar proposal passed with a \nbipartisan vote last week in the Finance Committee. There is a \nbipartisan Hansen-Meehan bill in the House that also increased the \nprice by $1.50 over 3 years.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has bipartisan support because the \nAmerican people strongly support it. A recent poll by the American \nCancer Society showed that 59 percent of the American people support a \n$1.50 price increase--people who are going to be affected by it.\n  I think it is time for the full Senate to pass a $1.50 price increase \nand protect our children once and for all. We are going to see it in \nthe voting. That voting is a public document that everyone can see, a \npublic action that everyone can see.\n  I am going to close in just a couple of minutes here. I listened to \nthe debate. I listened to the cries that this is just another scheme, a \nscheme to tax the public so those of us who are responsible for \nlegislation and operation of Government can spend the money. That is \nthe biggest hoax in the world.\n  Nobody, this Senator or any other Senator, on the right, on the left, \nin the Republican Party or the Democrats, enjoys spending the public's \nmoney. That is pure baloney, as we say in polite circles. We don't like \ntaxing anybody. But people who smoke cause this society to spend $100 \nbillion a year as a result of their smoking. We have the unfortunate \nexperience of seeing a loved one die, or with a tracheotomy, as we saw \nlast week at a hearing here. We heard a woman who was induced to \nrepresent a tobacco company as a model when she was 17 years old, and \nshe said her employer said unless you smoke also, actually smoke, you \ndon't quite have the real action that shows the satisfaction a smoker \ngets. And now she smokes through a tracheotomy in her throat. She was \nbarely able to utter the sounds. It was pathetic, Mr. President, to see \nthat happen.\n  I also had the benefit of a hearing where we had a famous male model \nfor one of the tobacco companies who said he is dying. He said he was \nso ashamed of himself, when he went into the doctors office, went in \nfor surgery, and the doctor said to him, ``For goodness sake, don't \nsmoke for a couple of weeks before you get to the hospital, whatever \nyou do,'' and his doctor caught him smoking in the waiting room, \nwaiting to be admitted to the hospital so he could have a lung taken \nout. That is how addicting tobacco is.\n  We ought not feel sorry for the people who run the tobacco companies. \nThey ought to be ashamed. They ought to pay the price. It is time for \nthem to come clean with the American public and say, ``OK, we have done \nit wrong. We have made a mistake. We want to cooperate.'' Instead, they \nare mounting all kinds of spurious campaigns to try to deceive the \npublic that the Senate, that the Congress, is trying to hurt them or \nhurt their families. It is not true. We ought not let them get away \nwith it. So when I hear the stories, oh, we are going to just tax the \nAmerican public, and a recitation of when these tax increases go \nthrough--I would like to recite just a few numbers in response.\n  There has never been a time in the history of this country when the \neconomy is better than it is these very days, and it is better because \nwe took some specific actions. It is better because we had a balanced \nbudget on our agenda, and we approved one last year. I am a member of \nthe Budget Committee and we saw it happen. We decided we were going to \ncontrol our expenses. And the economy is booming. Look at the stock \nmarket. Look at interest rates--low; stock market, high. Interest \nrates, low; mortgage rates, low;\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nhome ownership high--we have not ever seen that kind of affluence in \nthis society.\n  Everybody is not participating. I am not saying that at all. But to \nsuggest that we have done things wrong in this country, in the \nmanagement of this economy, and that what we have done is just picked \npeople's pockets and taken the money and thrown it away is nonsense and \nthe public will see through it. They are not going to believe that \nstuff. They have heard it before. They have seen it before. They know \ntheir children have a chance at a good job, they have a chance to get \nan education, that health care for their grandparents is going to be \nmore assured, Social Security has moved up in its solvency-- 2032 is \nthe prospect. It is incredible. People can feel a lot better about \ntheir lives.\n\n  And longevity? Mr. President, I hate to admit how old I am, but I can \ntell you if you want to run or jog or go skiing or do all the other \nthings, I am there, because there is an opportunity in this country to \nhave a full life as one ages. I was a soldier in World War II. I served \n3 years in the Army. I count my blessings every day for the good health \nI have seen and the five--and sixth grandchild, maybe today or maybe \ntomorrow that child will arrive. I can't wait for my daughter to say, \n``Hey, Dad, we have a new one in the family.'' I can assure you that \nchild will never smoke if the parents or the grandparents have anything \nto say about it.\n  We want our children to be healthy. That is the purpose of this. It \nis to bring health to the younger part of our society so that, as they \nage they, too, can enjoy their grandchildren, enjoy their life, be in \ngood health, do whatever they want to do--run, dance, whatever, and \nfeel good about the life they have led. That is the kind of America we \nhave today. That is the kind of America that developed because it had \nleadership and a willingness to pay the price with some tough votes, \nsome which I didn't make that I wish I had.\n  So I want to see us pass this to tell the American people we are \nfinished fooling around. We mean it when we say we want to stop teen \nsmoking. We mean it when we say we are going to eliminate this scourge \nfrom our society. And we mean it when we stand up here and we vote and \nwe say: OK, let the public see how we are doing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Lautenberg, for offering this important amendment. I would like \nto start by answering some of what our colleague from Missouri, Senator \nAshcroft, was referring to in terms of tax increases. The Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, was referring to tax increases that have \noccurred. He was discussing what he termed the very high tax rates we \ncurrently face.\n  I wanted to bring some historical perspective to that question. This \nchart shows the outlays of the Federal Government in blue, the receipts \nof the Federal Government in red, over the last 20 years. As one can \nsee, the spending of the Federal Government as a percentage of our \nnational income has been coming down since President Clinton came into \noffice. Spending has been coming down. Yes, revenue has been going up. \nAnd the result has been balanced budgets. That is how you balance a \nbudget. We had $290 billion deficits, and it required cutting spending \nand, yes, revenue coming up to balance the budget.\n  We heard a lot of talk about balancing the budget before the 1993 \nbudget deal was passed that, in fact, cut spending and, yes, raised \nrevenue to balance the budget. But what happened? All we got was \nrhetoric. Let's just look at the record here. If we want to start \ntalking about budgets and deficits, if that is what this debate is \ngoing to be about, let's have the debate. Here is what happened under \nPresident Reagan. The deficit skyrocketed. We had a lot of rhetoric \nabout balancing the budget, but what we got were a lot of deficits, a \nlot of red ink, tripling the national debt. What we got under President \nBush was even worse. The deficit nearly doubled from already high \nlevels.\n  Now, what happened when President Clinton and the Democrats passed a \nbudget plan to reduce the deficit? Yes, we did cut spending. Yes, we \ndid raise revenue from the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this \ncountry to balance the budget. And that is what has triggered this \neconomic resurgence in this country--that is what I believe. I think \nthe record is absolutely clear. Here are the facts. The deficit each \nand every year came down after we passed that 1993 budget plan, and now \nthey are actually talking about budget surpluses this year.\n  That is the record. Those are the facts. But it doesn't tell the full \nstory. Because while revenues went up, overall revenues went up, what \nhappened to the individual tax burden--the individual tax burden? This \nshows, in 1984, the tax burden for a family of four with a median \nincome level of $54,900 in 1999.\n  This is income plus payroll tax burden. These are the Federal taxes \npeople are paying. In 1984, that burden on a family of four was 17 \npercent of their income. In 1999, it will be 15.1 percent. The tax \nburden on a family of four at the median income in this country has \ngone down. It has gone down, because while revenues are up, we have \nchanged the distribution by giving targeted tax relief to moderate-\nincome people.\n  That was our plan. That is what passed. That is what has made that \ndifference in the lives of American families. Their tax burden has gone \ndown, looking at the income and payroll taxes that they pay.\n  By the way, these are not Kent Conrad's figures, these are the \nfigures of the U.S. Treasury Department. That is for a family of four \nearning about $55,000 next year. That is what their tax burden is going \nto be.\n  For a family of four at half the median income, at $27,450, their tax \nburden will have been cut in half. These are facts. In 1984, a family \nof four earning $27,450 paid 13.2 percent. In 1999, they are going to \npay 6.5 percent. Their tax burden, income and payroll taxes combined, \nhas been cut in half. Now, those are facts.\n  Let's start talking about the issue that is in front of us.\n  The tobacco industry has a history of making statements that, \nfrankly, are false. I don't know how else to say it. I don't know how \nto say it diplomatically when somebody is saying something that just \n``ain't'' so. Let's look at the record.\n  I talk about these as the top 10 tobacco tall tales and the truths.\n  Tall tale No. 1: They came before Congress and they said tobacco has \nno ill health effects.\n  The truth: This is from their own documents. This is a 1950s Hill and \nKnowlton memo quoting an unnamed tobacco company research director. And \nhe said:\n\n       Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to \n     produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to the \n     competition.\n\n  This is the industry that says their products cause no ill health \neffects.\n  Tall tale No. 2: Tobacco has no ill health effects.\n  Truth: From a 1978 Brown and Williamson document:\n\n       Very few customers are aware of the effects of nicotine, \n     i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.\n\n  These are the industry's own words. This is why this industry has no \ncredibility anymore, when they come up with all this scare talk about \nblack markets and bankruptcy and all the rest. And we will get to those \nissues one by one. This is their record for credibility.\n  Tall tale No. 3: Nicotine is not addictive, they told the American \npeople.\n  The truth: From their own document, a 1972 research planning memo by \nR.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company researcher Claude Teague:\n\n       Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both \n     habituating--\n\n  Addictive--\n\n       and unique in its variety of physiological actions.\n\n  That is tall tale No. 3.\n  Tall tale No. 4: Again, the industry says nicotine is not addictive.\n  This is from a 1992 memo from Barbara Reuter, director of portfolio \nmanagement for Philip Morris' domestic tobacco business:\n\n       Different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons. \n     But, the primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their \n     bodies. Similar organic chemicals include nicotine, quinine, \n     cocaine, atropine and morphine.\n\n  I don't know how these guys can run around the country saying their \nproducts aren't addictive, which their own\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\ndocuments--which we only received through the disclosure of the lawsuit \nin Minnesota--reveal that they know perfectly well they are addictive. \nThey have known it a long time, and they have run around the country \nsaying things that just aren't so. That is tall tale No. 4.\n  Tall tale No. 5: Tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine \nlevels.\n  The truth, from a 1991 R.J. Reynolds report:\n\n       We are basically in the nicotine business. . . . Effective \n     control of nicotine in our products should equate to a \n     significant product performance and cost advantage.\n\n  They are in the nicotine business, and nicotine is addictive. Their \nprevious document, it is like cocaine, it is like morphine--who are \nthey kidding? We know better. We have read their documents. That is the \nproblem with the credibility of this industry. We have now actually had \na chance to read their documents that they had hidden away for so long.\n  This is tall tale No. 6: Tobacco companies did not manipulate \nnicotine levels.\n  The truth can be found in a 1984 British-American Tobacco memo:\n\n       Irrespective of the ethics involved--\n\n  That is an interesting way to begin a memo--\n\n       Irrespective of the ethics involved, we should develop \n     alternative designs (that do not invite obvious criticism)--\n\n  You've got to love these guys--\n\n       which will allow the smoker to obtain significant enhanced \n     deliveries of [nicotine] should he so wish.\n\n  ``Yeah, let's go out and give them double doses of nicotine so we \nhook them even further.''\n  Tall tale No. 7: Tobacco companies don't market to children.\n  They came up to Congress, and they said, ``We don't target children. \nWe wouldn't do that.''\n  Here is a 1978 memo from a Lorillard tobacco executive:\n\n       The base of our businesses are high school students.\n\n  They don't target kids? What is that? That is their own words in \ntheir own documents. Of course, they were hidden away a long time, but \nnow that we have them, we know what these folks have been up to. We \nknow what these companies have been up to.\n  Tall tale No. 8: Again, their claim tobacco companies don't market to \nchildren.\n  Let's just look at their own words again. A 1976 R.J. Reynolds \nresearch department forecast:\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-\n     year-old age group is an increasing segment of the smoking \n     population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in \n     this market if our position in the industry is to be \n     maintained over the long term.\n\n  I don't know what could be more clear than the industry's own words.\n  Tall tale No. 9: Again, their claim they don't market to children.\n  This is from a 1975 report from Philip Morris researcher Myron \nJohnston:\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers, 15- to 19-years-old. My own data shows \n     even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15- to 17-year-\n     olds.''\n\n  These are the industry's words. These are their words. This is their \ncredibility that they have shredded. I don't know how many more \nexamples we need to understand that this industry comes before us and \nthey don't have clean hands. They don't come here with credibility, \nbecause they have undermined their own credibility with their \nstatements of the past.\n  Tall tale No. 10: Again, their claim tobacco companies don't market \nto children.\n  This is from a Brown and Williamson document.\n  The truth:\n\n       The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting \n     their brand preferences, as well as the starting behavior of \n     children as young as 5 years old--\n\n  Five years old--\n\n       the studies examined young smokers' attitudes toward \n     ``addiction'' and contain multiple references to how very \n     young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, \n     only to later discover, to their regret, that they are.\n  Well, it seems to me the record on the credibility of this industry \nis quite clear.\n  So that brings us to the question of this amendment. And the \nimportance of this amendment has everything to do with reducing youth \nsmoking. That really is the reason for this amendment, because we have \nheld over 24 hearings in our task force and we have heard repeatedly \nfrom the experts. And we have looked at the evidence.\n  The evidence shows, first of all, that the percentage of teens who \nsmoked in the past month is going up. It has gone from 28 percent of \n12th graders in 1991 to this year, 36 percent. The pattern is the same \nfor 10th graders and 8th graders. Smoking among high school seniors is \nat unprecedented levels. The percentage of seniors who smoked in the \nlast month: in 1991, it was 28.3 percent; 1997, 36.5 percent. Teenage \nsmoking is going up. Eighth graders, 10th graders, 12th graders, the \npattern is the same.\n  The question before the body is, well, is there any indication that a \nprice increase will change that? And the evidence is overwhelming. Our \nown Congressional Research Service tells us for every 10-percent \nincrease in price, you will get about a 7-percent reduction in teen \nsmoking; a 10-percent increase in price, a 7-percent reduction in youth \nsmoking.\n  It is not just the Congressional Research Service. The studies that \nhave been done on the econometrics of demand versus price show the same \nthing. Dr. Chaloupka did the breakthrough study. He concluded much the \nsame thing as the Congressional Research Service: for every 10-percent \nincrease in price, about a 7-percent reduction in youth usage.\n  But we do not have to rely on studies. We do not have to look at \neconometrics analysis and we do not have to listen to the Congressional \nResearch Service. We do not have to listen to Drs. Koop and Kessler. \nAll we have to do is look to our neighbors to the north. Here is what \nhappened there. Youth smoking declined sharply when they saw a \nsignificant price increase. This isn't some academic study. This is \nwhat happened in the real world.\n  Well, the experts, as I have said, have all testified to precisely \nthat fact. And here is what two of the noted experts tell us about \ndifferent levels of pricing and what it will mean to reductions in \nyouth smoking.\n  The Treasury Department tells us over 5 years that under the proposed \nsettlement we would get an 18-percent reduction in youth smoking. Under \nthe legislation before us, by Senator McCain, we get a 32-percent \nreduction. Under the amendment before us, we would get a 40-percent \nreduction. Now that is the Treasury Department.\n  Dr. Chaloupka, who is perhaps the most widely recognized expert \nbecause he has studied all the studies, has concluded that the proposed \nsettlement would reduce teen smoking 20 percent, the work by Senator \nMcCain and the bill before us would reduce youth smoking over 5 years \nby 33 percent, but the amendment before us would reduce youth smoking \nby 51 percent. These are what the experts are telling us.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I have \njust received from Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler. It is addressed to me.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         The Advisory Committee on\n\n\n                             Tobacco Policy and Public Health,\n\n                                                     May 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: I am writing to urge that you and your \n     colleagues support an amendment to the Commerce Committee \n     bill to raise and accelerate the price increase on tobacco \n     products. I do so because I believe that such an increase \n     will be one of the most effective means available to the \n     Senate to reduce the number of children who start smoking or \n     using spit tobacco.\n       The Advisory Committee on Tobacco and Public Health Policy \n     that we chaired last summer recommended that the price per \n     pack increase by at least $1.50. This in itself was moderate \n     and realistic: Other studies have recommended that the price \n     increase by $2.00 or more. But the message is clear: Raising \n     prices reduces youth smoking.\n       It is as simple as this: Price affects demand, and price \n     affects demand steeply among children. Study after study has \n     demonstrated that when prices go up, fewer children start to \n     smoke. This is important because children are not yet \n     addicted and they can refrain from tobacco use. Moreover, \n     there is good evidence that if people do not start smoking by \n     the age of 18, they do not start at all.\n       And the size of the price hike matters. The most prominent \n     experts on tobacco sales, estimate that a price increase of \n     $1.10 will result in a 34% decline in children smoking, while \n     an increase of $1.50 will result in a 56%\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\n     decline. The amendment would result in a 22% further decline \n     in children smoking.\n       So we urge you to move decisively and to act on the behalf \n     of the Nation's children. Increase the price. Lower the \n     demand. Save children from this addictive and deadly product.\n           Sincerely,\n     C. Everett Koop, M.D.\n     David A. Kessler, M.D.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The letter says:\n\n       [We are] writing to urge that you and your colleagues \n     support an amendment . . . to raise and accelerate the price \n     increase on tobacco products. [We] do so because [we] believe \n     such an increase will be one of the most effective means \n     available to the Senate to reduce the number of children who \n     start smoking or use spit tobacco.\n\n  They go on to point out:\n\n       It is as simple as this: Price affects demand, and price \n     affects demand steeply among children. Study after study has \n     demonstrated that when prices go up, fewer children start to \n     smoke. This is important because children are not yet \n     addicted and they can refrain from tobacco use. Moreover, \n     there is good evidence that if people do not start smoking by \n     the age of 18, they do not start at all.\n\n  This is Dr. Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, \nand Dr. Kessler, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration. \nThey go on to say:\n\n       And the size of the price hike matters. The most prominent \n     experts on tobacco sales, estimate that a price increase of \n     $1.10 will result in a 34% decline in children smoking, while \n     an increase of $1.50 will result in a 56% decline. The \n     amendment would result in a 22% further decline in children \n     smoking.\n\n  That is from Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, men who have served both \nRepublican administrations and Democratic administrations, telling us \nto support this amendment.\n  Now, what does it mean when we talk about more teenagers not smoking? \nWhat does it mean in terms of lives? Well, here is what it means: A \n$1.50 price means 2.7 million additional teenagers not smoking, that is \nover the bill before us. And it means 800,000 children over time not \ndying because of the use of tobacco products.\n  What we are talking about in this amendment is not just dollars and \ncents. It is much more important than that. It is children's lives. We \nare talking about a vote that means 800,000 more people will live if we \npass it. So the choice before this body is really very simple: Do you \nwant 800,000 more people to live or do you want them to die?\n  This is going to be an important vote and an important question \nbefore every Member of this Senate. I hope it is on everybody's \nconscience tonight: What are we going to do? How are we going to vote? \nWhat difference are we going to make? What are we going to say? Are we \ngoing to save 800,000 people--800,000 children--or are we going to \ncondemn them to death by using the only legal product in America, when \nused as intended by the manufacturer, that addicts and kills its \ncustomers?\n  Mr. President, 400,000 people are going to die this year because of \ntobacco-related illnesses. It is by far and away the biggest health \nthreat that is controllable. So this vote tomorrow is going to be a \nvote on 800,000 American lives. Are we going to save them? Or are we \ngoing to condemn them to death? And it is an awful death.\n  At hearing after hearing we have heard the stories of those who have \nbeen through the agonizing experience of being told they are dying of \ncancer. The last hearing we had we had a man who had been a Winston \nmodel. Now he has lung cancer. We had a woman who had been a Lucky \nStrike spokesperson, and by the terms of her contract was required to \nstart smoking. Now she speaks through a voice box.\n  Over and over, we had the testimony of people, the devastation of \nusing tobacco products, what it has meant to their families and to \nthemselves.\n  I can remember very well being in New Jersey at a hearing Senator \nLautenberg organized. We had a young woman there named Gina Seagraves. \nAnd she testified telling of the effect on her family of the loss of \nher mother at an early age, how it devastated their family. She broke \ndown and cried. And she said, ``Please have the courage to stand up to \nthe tobacco companies and do what you can to keep kids from getting \nhooked.''\n  Well, that is what this debate is about. That is what this vote is \nabout.\n  And when the industry says, ``Well, you're going to bankrupt us,'' \nhere is what the experts at the Treasury--the secretary for Financial \nMarkets testified before our task force. And I quote, ``We do not \nbelieve that the proposed legislation will materially affect the \nindustry's risk of insolvency.''\n  He went on and said in the very next sentence, ``Even under \nconservative assumptions with respect to price, domestic sales volume, \nand operating margins, the tobacco industry will remain very \nprofitable.'' They are not going bankrupt. They are going to have their \nprofits nicked a little bit. They are not going bankrupt.\n  In fact, here is what is going to happen to them. When you do a \nfinancial analysis of these companies--this was done by the U.S. \nTreasury Department--under a $1.10 increase, their profits in the year \n2003 will be $5 billion. If, instead, we raise the price to $1.50, \ntheir profits will be $4.3 billion in the year 2003. They are not going \nbankrupt.\n  That is flawed. They run around the country saying they will be \nbankrupted. Every objective analyst has said they are not going \nbankrupt. Their profits will be somewhat reduced, but they will still \nenjoy massive profits. If fact, this industry is three times as \nprofitable as the average consumer goods industry in America today. \nTheir profit margins are 30 percent. The average consumer goods company \nhas a 10 percent margin.\n  Let's not cry any crocodile tears for this industry. When they come \nbefore us and say they will be bankrupted by $1.10 under the McCain \nbill or $1.50 under the Kennedy-Lautenberg amendment, they are not \ntelling the truth, just like they didn't tell the truth when they said \ntheir products didn't cause health problems, just like they didn't tell \nthe truth when they said their products weren't addictive, just like \nthey didn't tell the truth when they said they didn't market to kids, \njust like they didn't tell the truth when they said these products were \nnot manipulated to further addict young people.\n  Look, the record is clear on every issue: They are not telling the \nAmerican people the full truth.\n  When we investigate this question further, they say it will bankrupt \nthem. They say it will create this massive black market. Let's look. \nLet's look at where we fit in terms of tax and prices and where the \nrest of the industrialized world fits in.\n  This chart came out of the Washington Post last Saturday. These are \nnot my numbers; these are from the Washington Post last Saturday. \nPrices in Norway on a pack are well over $6, about $7 a pack in Norway. \nIn Britain, prices are about $5 a pack; in Denmark, just under $5 a \npack; in Finland, just under $5 a pack; in New Zealand, about $4.20 a \npack; in France, about $3.75 a pack; in Canada, about $3.50 a pack; in \nthe Netherlands, about $3.30 a pack; in Singapore, nearly $4 a pack; in \nBrazil, Thailand, and the United States, under $2. Our average price, \nabout $1.94.\n  So they talk about this massive black market. How is it that these \ncountries that have much higher prices don't have much of a black \nmarket problem? And even if we added $1.10 to $1.94--which is in the \nMcCain bill, taking it to $3.04--we would be well below most of the \nrest of the industrialized world in terms of a price. Even if we had \n$1.50, we would be well below the average price in the rest of the \nindustrialized world.\n  Again on this question of black market activity, we had an \ninternational expert before our task force. He provided us with this \nchart. It showed the price of cigarettes and the level of smuggling in \nthe countries of the European Union. It was a very, very interesting \nreport. This man is an international consultant to countries on how to \ncombat smoking. Here is what his report shows. Countries with high \nsmuggling levels are in red; medium are in yellow; low smuggling rates \nare in green. On this axis, we have the price per pack.\n\n  What you find is very interesting. The countries with the highest \nprices have the least smuggling. The countries with lower prices have \nthe smuggling problem. Spain has the lowest price, yet it has the \nhighest smuggling problem of any country in Europe. Portugal has a \nmedium level of smuggling and has among the lowest prices. You can see \nright up the line. But the countries with the highest prices have the \nlowest rates of smuggling--France, Ireland, U.K., Finland, Denmark.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  Now, these guys come around and say there will be this massive black \nmarket--massive black market. It hasn't developed in these other \ncountries in the European Union that have much higher prices than we \ndo. Why not? Because they have control mechanisms. They have labeling. \nThey have licensing of those who sell.\n  Here is what the Treasury Department, Larry Summers, Deputy \nSecretary, said just at the end of last month: ``The black market can \nand should be minimized through careful legislation.'' He said, ``By \nclosing the distribution chain for tobacco products, we will be able to \nensure that these products flow through legitimate channels and \neffectively police any leakages that do take place.''\n  I close as I began. This is a question of saving children's lives. \nThis vote tomorrow is a question of, do we save 800,000 lives or don't \nwe? A very simple choice--a profound choice, but it is very simple. \nThat is what this vote will be tomorrow. Are we going to keep an \nadditional 2.7 million kids from taking up the habit of smoking? That \ntranslates into 800,000 lives saved. Or do we miss the opportunity to \nthrow those kids a lifeline and prevent them from taking up a habit \nthat will addict them, that will create disease in them, and that will \nultimately kill a third of them? That is the record.\n  The factual base could not be more clear. Every health expert that \ncame before our task force said that is the issue. That is why Dr. Koop \nand Dr. Kessler have written us this day and urged us to have the \ncourage to act. I hope our colleagues will have the courage to act.\n  I want to commend Senator McCain. I want to commend Senator Kerry and \nthe other Members of the Commerce Committee who have done a Herculean \njob to get us an excellent package to begin deliberations on. They have \ndone a superb job and have shown remarkable public courage. I think \nevery American should stand up and commend them for what they have \ndone. They have brought to this floor the most sweeping, the most \ncomprehensive, the most profound bill in terms of tobacco policy we \nhave ever had before us. They have done it against long odds. We are in \ntheir debt. But it is also true we have an opportunity to make this \nbill somewhat better. I hope we take that chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank the Senator from North Dakota for not \nonly his kind remarks but for the enormous contributions he has made to \nthis effort. He has worked tirelessly. He has appeared with our \ncommittee--not before our committee, but with our committee, where we \nhad one of the most stimulating, I think, dialog and exchange of views \nsince I have been a member of that committee.\n  I want to thank him. I know there will continue to be areas where we \nare not in agreement. The fact is, we disagree very agreeably.\n  I also want to mention again our friends, the attorneys general who \nbegan this process. Forty of them settled a suit with the industry back \non June 20. This legislation that we are considering now is a direct \nresult of that initial effort on their part. They have been extremely \nhelpful as we moved this process along.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Massachusetts has agreed \nto conclude his remarks after the wrap-up. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I will be very brief. I join in \nthanking Senator Conrad for his very generous comments about the \nCommerce Committee and about Senator McCain's and my efforts in it.\n  The truth is that so much of the energy of the Senate has been \nfocused as a result of Senator Conrad's leadership. The task force \neffort that he put together was really exemplary. It reached every \ncorner of every community that has anything to do with this issue. It \nis one of the most thorough and exacting pieces of work that I have \nseen in the Senate. I think Senator McCain would agree with me that \nthere are significant components of the product that has been brought \nto the floor as a result of his efforts and leadership and his vision \nabout this issue. So I think the quality of the presentation he just \nmade to the Senate and to the country is a tribute to the groundwork he \nhas done in order to get us here.\n  Likewise, for years, my colleague from Massachusetts, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, has been at the forefront of all of the \nhealth issues with respect to children and, particularly, leading the \neffort with respect to the awareness of tobacco, and his leadership on \nthis has been essential to our ability to have this product. So I thank \nthem for that. I will say more about this particular issue tomorrow.\n  Very quickly, I might say to the Senator from North Dakota that a few \nweeks ago there was an article in the New York Times that showed that \nthe smuggling, to the degree there was a problem, has fundamentally \nbeen between countries, our cigarettes going out from the United States \nto Europe as a consequence of the price differential. If anything, as a \nresult of the increase in price, there is a potential of closing that \ngap, No. 1.\n  No. 2, with respect to those who worry about Mexico or an infusion \ninto this country, we have an increase in the law enforcement and \ninspection capacity. Most people in the law enforcement community \naccept that the returns on heroin and cocaine are so much more \nsignificant than the bulk difficulties of transferring cigarettes, and \nthat is a deterrent to those becoming a problem.\n  Most people want the quality of the American cigarette. They are not \nparticularly prepared to smoke Chinese or other kinds of cigarettes. \nThere are a whole lot of ingredients that work against the smuggling \nargument, and we will get to that.\n  I thank the Senator for his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5097-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REGARDING PLACEMENT OF THE REQUIRED INSCRIPTIONS ON QUARTER DOLLARS \n         ISSUED UNDER THE 50 STATES COMMEMORATIVE COIN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure medicare reimbursement for certain ambulance services, and to \nimprove the efficiency of the emergency medical system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           emergency medical services efficiency act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning on behalf of all those \nwho serve their fellow citizens through their active participation in \nthe Nation's emergency care system to introduce the Emergency Medical \nServices Act.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator who is deeply concerned about the ever-\nexpanding size and scope of the Federal Government, I have long \nbelieved Washington is too big, too clumsy and too removed to deal \neffectively with many of the issues in which it already meddles.\n  However, I also believe there's an overriding public health interest \nin ensuring a viable, seamless, nationwide\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nEMS system. By designating this week as National EMS Week, the Nation \nrecognizes those individual who make the EMS system work.\n  There is no more appropriate time to reaffirm our commitment to EMS \nby addressing some of the problems the system is presented with daily.\n  I have been privileged to get to know the men and women who dedicate \ntheir talents to serving others in an emergency. We have together \ndiscussed problems within the EMS system and concluded there are areas \nin which the Federal Government can help.\n  The original result of our discussions concerning the Federal role in \nEMS was S. 238, the Emergency Medical Services Act [EMSEA]. When I \nintroduced S. 238 on January 30, 1997, I acknowledged that it wasn't \nintended to solve all the problems EMS faces; it was merely a first \nstep toward a meaningful national dialog on EMs. Indeed, this first \nstep was a productive one.\n  Last summer, I assembled EMS and health care leaders in Minnesota, \nasked them to take another look at the EMSEA, and report back to me \nwith their thoughts. In January, I received a copy of their report.\n  I was extremely pleased with their efforts and have used those \nsuggestions as the basis for the legislative language comprising the \nnew Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act I am introducing today.\n  I have often said that Congress has a tendency to wait until there's \na crisis before it acts, but Congress cannot wait until there's a \ncrisis in the EMS system before we take steps to improve it. There is \nsimply too much at stake.\n  Whether we realize it or not, we depend on and expect the constant \nreadiness of emergency medical services. To ensure that readiness, we \nneed to make efficient and effective efforts to secure the stability of \nthe system.\n  This has been my focus in redrafting this legislation.\n  There are many similarities between S. 238 and the new bill I am \nintroducing today.\n  For instance, we continue to assert that the most important thing we \ncan do to maintain the vitality of the EMS system is to compel the \ngovernment to reimburse for the services it says it will pay for under \nMedicare.\n  In the meetings I have had with ambulance providers, emergency \nmedical technicians emergency physicians, nurses, and other EMS-related \npersonnel, their most common request is to base reimbursement on a \n``prudent layperson'' standard, rather than the ultimate diagnosis \nreached in the emergency room.\n  While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 [BBA] contained a provision \nbasing reimbursement for emergency services on the prudent layperson \nstandard, we have yet to see HCFA's interpretation of the provision and \nwhether it will include ambulance services.\n  I have written letters to HCFA and Senate Finance Committee Chairman \nWilliam Roth indicating my understanding that ambulance services would \nbe considered part of ``emergency services'' as defined in the BBA.\n  I have been given no assurances from HCFA that they intend to include \nambulance services as part of the ``emergency services'' definition in \nthe balanced budget agreement.\n  To illustrate how prevalent this problem is, I want to share with you \na case my staff worked on relating to Medicare reimbursement for \nambulance services. Please keep in mind that this is the fee-for-\nservice Medicare program.\n  It was back in 1994 that Andrew Bernecker of Braham, MN, was mowing \nwith a power scythe and tractor when he fell. The rotating blades of \nthe scythe severely cut his upper arm. Mr. Bernecker tried to walk \ntoward his home but was too faint from the blood loss, so he crawled \nthe rest of the way.\n  Afraid that his wife, who was 86 years old at the time, would panic--\nor worse, have a heart attack--he crawled to the pump and washed as \nmuch blood and dirt off as he could. His wife saw him and immediately \ncalled 911 for an ambulance.\n  He was rushed to the hospital where Mr. Bernecker ultimately had \northopedic surgery and spent some time in the intensive care unit.\n  In response to the bills submitted to Medicare, the Government sent \nthis reply with respect to the ambulance billing:\n\n       Medicare Regulations Provide that certain conditions must \n     be met in order for ambulance services to be covered.\n       Medicare pays for ambulance services only when the use of \n     any other method of transportation would endanger your \n     health.\n\n  The Government denied payment, claiming the ambulance wasn't \nmedically necessary.\n  Apparently, Medicare believed the man's wife--who was, remember, 86 \nyears old--should have been able to drive him to the hospital for \ntreatment. Mr. and Mrs. Bernecker appealed, but were denied, and they \nbegan paying what they could afford each month on the ambulance bill.\n  After several years of paying $20 a month, they finally paid off the \nambulance bill. Medicare however, later reopened the case and \nreimbursed the Berneckers.\n  I believe the experience this family had with Medicare's denial of \npayment for ambulance services happens far too often, and Congress \nneeds to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n  Another similarity between the two versions of this bill is the \ncreation of a Federal commission on emergency medical services to make \nrecommendations and to help provide input on how Federal regulatory \nactions affect all types of EMS providers.\n  EMS needs a seat at the table when health care and other regulatory \npolicy is made.\n  Few things are more frustrating for ambulance services than trying to \nnavigate and comply with the tangled mess of laws and regulations from \nthe Federal level on down, only to receive either a reimbursement that \ndoesn't cover the costs of providing the service or otherwise a flat \ndenial of the payment.\n  Mr. President, I came across this chart last year, the chart I have \nwith me on the floor this morning, that demonstrates how a Medicare \nclaim moves from submittal to payment, denial, or write-off by the \nambulance provider.\n  If you look at this chart, I ask you, tell me how a rural ambulance \nprovider who depends on volunteers has the manpower or the expertise to \nnavigate through this entire mess. And, in the event that it is \nnavigated successfully, ambulance services are regularly reimbursed at \na level that doesn't even cover their costs.\n  Now let us talk about how much it costs to run just one ambulance. \nThere is the cost of the dispatcher who remains on the line to give \nprearrival assistance, the ambulance itself, which costs from $85,000 \nto $100,000 to put on the road, the radios, beepers, and the cellular \ntelephones used to communicate between the dispatcher, the ambulance, \nand the hospital, the supplies and equipment in the ambulance, \nincluding defibrillators, stretchers, EKG monitors, and bandages, and \nthe two emergency medical technicians or paramedics who both drive the \nambulance and provide care to the patient, the vehicle repair, \nmaintenance, and insurance costs, and the liability insurance for the \nparamedics. As you can see, the list goes on and on.\n  Yes, the costs can be high, but it is clear to me that, with the \nuncertainty ambulance providers face out in the field each day, they \nneed to be prepared for every type of injury or condition. Mr. \nPresident, that is expensive, but we as consumers expect that in the \ncase of an emergency.\n  I am convinced those who complain about the high costs of emergency \ncare would be aghast if the ambulance that arrived to care for them in \nan emergency didn't have the lifesaving equipment needed for their \ntreatment.\n  Let us be honest with ourselves: We want the quickest and best \nservice when we face an emergency--and the bottom line is that costs \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, many of our political debates in Washington center \naround how to better prepare for the 21st century.\n  I have always supported research and efforts to expand the limits of \ntechnology and continue to believe technological innovations and \nadvances in biomedical and basic scientific research hold tremendous \npromise.\n  Under the new bill I am introducing today, Federal grant programs \nwill be clarified to ensure that EMS agencies are eligible for programs \nthat relate to highway safety, rural development, and tele-health \ntechnology.\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\n  Emergency medical services have come a long way since the first \nambulance services began in Cleveland and New York City way back during \nthe 1860's.\n  Indeed, the scientific and technological advances have created a new \npractice of medicine in just 2 short decades, and have dramatically \nimproved the prospects of surviving any serious trauma.\n  There is reason to believe further advances will have equally \nmeaningful results.\n  Innovations like tele-health technology may soon allow EMT's, nurses, \nand paramedics to perform more sophisticated procedures under a \nphysician's supervision via real-time, ambulance-mounted monitors and \ncameras networked to emergency departments in specific service areas.\n  By not considering EMS agencies for Federal grant dollars, we may \ncause significant delays in the application of current technologies. \nThat would be a mistake.\n  Perhaps the most dramatic departure the reintroduced bill takes from \nS. 238 related to the designation of a lead Federal agency for EMS.\n  In August of 1996, the National Highway Traffic and Safety \nAdministration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nMaternal and Child Health Bureau issued their report, ``Emergency \nMedical Services: Agenda for the Future.''\n  The report outlined specific ways EMS can be improved, and one of the \nstated goals was the authorization of a ``lead Federal agency.''\n  My original legislation instructed the Secretaries of Health and \nTransportation to confer on and facilitate the transfer of all EMS-\nrelated functions to the Department of Transportation.\n  While we recognized that there would be some who would applaud the \nnotion and others who would berate it, the suggestion compelled people \nto consider the issue and offer alternative approaches.\n  The recommendations of the advisory committee and the comments I have \nreceived from national groups indicate we have yet to reach a solution \nto the problematic designation of a lead Federal agency.\n  As such, under the new legislation, we call for an independent study \nto determine which existing agency or new board would best serve as the \nlead Federal entity for EMS.\n  The concerns expressed to me about designating the Department of \nTransportation as the lead Federal agency were virtually identical to \nthe concerns about granting lead-agency designation to the Department \nof Health and Human Services. It just didn't seem to fit.\n  Therefore, I believe the most appropriate action is to take our time \nand get it right by conducting this study.\n  Mr. President, in 1995, there were approximately 100 million visits \nto emergency departments across the country.\n  Roughly 20 to 25 percent of those visits started with a call for an \nambulance. Each one of those calls is important, especially to those \nseeking assistance and the responding EMS personnel.\n  The Nation owes a great deal to the EMS personnel who have dedicated \nthemselves to their profession because they care about people and they \nwant to help those who are suffering.\n  Nobody gets rich as a professional paramedic, and there is even less \ncompensation as a volunteer. The field of emergency medical services \npresents many challenges--but offers the reward of knowing you helped \nsomeone in need of assistance.\n  Every year, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS \npersonnel across the country for their contributions to the profession, \nand bestows upon them the Stars of Life Award.\n  This year, 124 individuals have been chosen by their peers to be \nhonored for demonstrating exceptional kindness and selflessness in \nperforming their duties.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed the 1998 American Ambulance \nAssociation Stars of Life honorees in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      1998 Stars of Life Honorees\n\n       Alaska--Monica Helmuth.\n       Arizona--Jeff Mayhew, Michael Norling, Tammy Smith, Karen \n     Deo, and Sharon R.

Mr. President, in closing I have talked with many EMT's, \nparamedics, and emergency nurses, and most tell me that they wouldn't \nthink of doing anything else for their chosen career.\n  So, in honoring them during this National EMS Week, I can think of no \nbetter way to recognize their service than through the introduction of \nlegislation that will help them to help others.\n  I ask my colleagues to support them by supporting the Emergency \nMedical Services Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Thomas, and \n        Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2092. A bill to promote full equality at the United Nations for \nIsrael; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n         EQUALITY FOR ISRAEL AT THE UNITED NATIONS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nrequiring the Secretary of State report on actions taken by our \nAmbassador to the United Nations to push the nations of the Western \nEurope and Others Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their group.\n  As you may know, Israel is the only nation among the 185 member \nstates that does not hold membership in a regional group. Membership in \na regional group is the prerequisite for any nation to serve on key \nUnited Nations bodies such as the Security Council. In order to correct \nthis inequality, I am introducing ``The Equality for Israel at the \nUnited Nations Act of 1998.'' I believe that this legislation will \nprompt our United Nations Representative to make equality for Israel at \nthe United Nations a high priority.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senators Wyden, Brownback and Thomas as \noriginal co-sponsors of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, Israel has been a member of the United Nations since\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\n1949, yet it has been continuously precluded from membership in any \nregional bloc. Most member states from the Middle East would block the \nvote needed to join their own regional group. The Western Europe and \nOthers Group, however, has accepted countries from other geographical \nareas--the United States and Australia for example.\n  Recently United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that \n``It's time to usher in a new era of relations between Israel and the \nUnited Nations . . . One way to rectify that new chapter would be to \nrectify an anomaly: Israel's position as the only Member State that is \nnot a member of one of the regional groups, which means it has no \nchance of being elected to serve on main organs such as the Security \nCouncil or the Economic and Social Council. This anomaly would be \ncorrected.''\n  I believe it is time to back Secretary General Annan's idea with \nstrong support from the United States Senate and I ask all my \ncolleagues to join me in sending this message to the UN to stop this \ndiscrimination against Israel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this legislation \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2092\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equality for Israel at the \n     United Nations Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFORTS TO PROMOTE FULL EQUALITY AT THE UNITED \n                   NATIONS FOR ISRAEL.\n\n       (a) Congressional Statement.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that--\n       (1) the United States must help promote an end to the \n     persistent inequity experienced by Israel in the United \n     Nations whereby Israel is the only longstanding member of the \n     organization to be denied acceptance into any of the United \n     Nations regional blocs, which serve as the basis for \n     participation in important activities of the United Nations, \n     including rotating membership on the United Nations Security \n     Council; and\n       (2) the United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     should take all steps necessary to ensure Israel's acceptance \n     in the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) regional bloc, \n     whose membership includes the non-European countries of \n     Canada, Australia, and the United States.\n       (b) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act and on a quarterly basis \n     thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report which includes \n     the following information (in classified or unclassified form \n     as appropriate):\n       (1) Actions taken by representatives of the United States, \n     including the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, \n     to encourage the nations of the Western Europe and Others \n     Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their regional bloc.\n       (2) Efforts undertaken by the Secretary General of the \n     United Nations to secure Israel's full and equal \n     participation in that body.\n       (3) Specific responses solicited and received by the \n     Secretary of State from each of the nations of Western Europe \n     and Others Group (WEOG) on their position concerning Israel's \n     acceptance into their organization.\n       (4) Other measures being undertaken, and which will be \n     undertaken, to ensure and promote Israel's full and equal \n     participation in the United Nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2093. A bill to provide class size demonstration grants; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the National \nSAGE Act. This legislation would authorize a limited number of \ninnovative demonstration grant programs to assist states in their \nefforts to reduce public school class size and improve learning in the \nearliest grades.\n  Mr. President, my own state of Wisconsin has been a leader in the \neffort to reduce class size in public schools. This legislation is \nmodeled after Wisconsin's successful pilot program, the Student \nAchievement Guarantee in Education of SAGE program. I am proud that my \nbill bears the same name as that groundbreaking program.\n  SAGE is a very appropriate acronym for this legislation, for a sage \nis a teacher who imparts knowledge and wisdom through direct engagement \nwith his or her students. By providing grants to states trying to \nreduce class size and implement educational reforms, the National SAGE \nAct would give students and teachers more opportunities to interact \ndirectly. The result will be better teacher morale, better student \nperformance and a happier, more successful school.\n  Mr. President, I have heard about the need for smaller classes from \nparents, teachers and school administrators around Wisconsin--including \nmy mother-in-law, who has been a 1st grade teacher for more than 20 \nyears in Waunakee. They all tell me by reducing class size students \nreceive more attention from teachers, and it stands to reason that more \nattention will translate into more learning.\n  When asked to evaluate the Wisconsin SAGE program, eight-year \nteaching veteran Shelia Briggs, of Glendale Elementary School in \nMadison, Wisconsin said, ``SAGE is just phenomenal. I have \nkindergarteners who are writing paragraphs. In addition, behavior is a \nhuge benefit of SAGE. With too many little bodies, you will have \ndifficulties. Things are so much more manageable.'' Additionally, \nsecond grade teacher Amy Kane says, ``I have taught second grade for \nnine years and never had this high a percentage of readers. Their \nwriting skills are much higher, and they are able to behave better. I \nmake contact with parents now that I could never make with 34 \nstudents.''\n  Wisconsin's SAGE program has again demonstrated empirically what we \nknow instinctively: students in smaller classes get more attention from \nteachers, and teachers with fewer students will have more time and \nenergy to devote to each child.\n  In addition to vital input from these Wisconsin educators, other \nstudies confirm that small class size promotes effective teaching and \nlearning. The leading scientific studies of the impact of small class \nsize, Tennessee's STAR study and its follow up, the Lasting Benefit \nStudy, found that students in small classes in the early years earned \nsignificantly higher scores on basic skill tests in all four years and \nin all types of schools. Follow-up studies have shown that these \nachievement gains were sustained in later years even if students are \nplaced in larger classes. While I certainly recognize that teacher \nquality, high expectations an parental involvement are important \nfactors in quality education, the significance of small class size \nshould not be underestimated and cannot be ignored.\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin is not the only state fighting to reduce \nclass size and implement educational reforms in its public schools. \nSeveral states have made small class size a priority, including \nCalifornia, Tennessee, Indiana and Nevada to name a few. My \nlegislation, the National SAGE Act, authorizes $75 million over a \nperiod of five years to fund a limited number of demonstration grants \nto state that create innovative programs to reduce public school class \nsize and improve educational performance, as Wisconsin has done. The \nSecretary of Education would choose the states to receive funding based \non several criteria, including the state's need to reduce class size, \nthe ability of a state education agency to furnish 50 percent of the \nfunds and the degree to which parents, teachers, school administrators \nand local teacher organizations are consulted in designing the program. \nThe funding for the National SAGE Act would be fully offset by cuts in \na wasteful federal program that subsidizes research and development for \na huge aircraft manufacturer. That's classic corporate welfare and by \neliminating it, we can fund this important SAGE program and still \nreduce federal spending by more than $1.7 billion over a five year \nperiod.\n  The National SAGE Act also includes a comprehensive research and \nevaluation component to document the benefit of smaller class size in \nthe earliest grades, and support efforts to reduce class size in \nschools all over America.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to say how pleased I am that \nthe Clinton Administration has been pushing the issue of class size to \nthe forefront of the education debate. In January I wrote to the \nPresident requesting that he make reducing class size a priority in his \nFY 99 education budget. I was pleased that the President's budget \nincludes an incentive to help schools provide small classes in the \nearly grades.\n  While I support the intent of the President's class size proposal, it \nis not funded. I was uncomfortable with the President's original \nproposal to fund a\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\nsmall class size initiative with money from a tobacco settlement that \ndid not yet exist. I am hopeful that Congress will soon pass tobacco \nlegislation, Mr. President, but it is best that we not tie class size \nlegislation to something as controversial and decisive as the tobacco \nbill.\n  My fear is that the end of the 105th session will come and Congress \nwill go home having done nothing to assist States trying to reduce \nclass size. My bill approaches this issue more directly, without the \nbaggage of the tobacco bill and without expanding the deficit.\n  I have been very active on the class size issue over the last year \nbecause again--I believe that there is a great national purpose of \nhelping our children to learn by doing all we can to reduce class sizes \nfor children in the earliest grades. While I embrace that national \npurpose, I do not seek a national mandate for smaller classes. That is \nnot a proper federal goal. Instead, I support smaller classes as a \nnational goal, to be achieved by the local school boards. I think we \nall can agree that there are no magic remedies to the problems in our \npublic schools and no instant fix to improve learning. However, I \nbelieve that targeting federal funds matched on a 50-50 basis by state \nfunding, to assist school districts moving toward smaller class size, \nis an effective use of federal dollars.\n  At its core, Mr. President, the small class size issue is really \nabout protecting pubic education. The promising achievements of state \nefforts in education reform merit strong federal support. We have an \nobligation to strengthen public schools, because they are the principal \ninstitution for educating American children.\n  Public schools are all-inclusive; they accept all students, \nregardless of income, race, religion or ethnicity. In introducing the \nNational SAGE Act today, I want to reiterate my strong commitment to \nquality public education. I am proud of the education I received from \nWisconsin's public schools; proud to have graduated from them, and \nproud that my children attend them. I am committed to helping our \npublic schools improve and adapt and respond to the increased burdens \nplaced on them. I feel strongly that the federal government has a \nlimited--but important role to play in public education.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post recently wrote an article about \nthe growing number of families in the Washington area deciding to \neducate their children at home, rather than participate in the public \nschool system. Mr. President, this trend is not happening in Washington \nalone, but around the nation.\n  The Post article states that one of their biggest complaints for \nfamilies opting out of the public schools is large class size. Parents \nunderstand the importance of a low teacher to child ratio in the \nclassroom. They understand the critical difference additional teacher \nattention can make for their child's educational achievement.\n  The parent's highlighted in the Post article, Mr. President, are fed \nup with public school classes made up of twenty-five to thirty students \nor more, fed up with the lack of individual attention their children \nare receiving in the classroom; and finally, Mr. President, parents are \nfed up with the discipline problems created by too many children and \ntoo few adults in one classroom.\n  While I support the choices of families who send their children to \npublic schools or home school their children, the growing trend to move \npublic resources away from the public schools, where more than 90% of \nour nation's children are educated, is disturbing. Instead of \nabandoning public education with tax breaks for private schools or \nspending time and energy designing a Constitutionally flawed voucher \nprogram, Congress should be working to ensure that we target federal \ndollars to meet the needs of local school districts. Those of us who \nbelieve a high quality public education system is essential to the \nproductivity of our nation should be very alarmed by this growing \neffort to move resources away from our public schools.\n  Mr. President, the federal government has a responsibility during the \n105th Congress to take a positive step toward helping school districts \nreduce class size as part of an overall effort to improve education and \nensure that our children have the best chance to excel and reach their \nfull potential. I look forward to continued debate on this issue and \nhope that my colleagues will consider the National SAGE Act as a \nreasonable, fiscally responsible proposal to assist states in their \nefforts to reduce public school class size and improve learning in the \nearliest grades.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2093\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Res. 232\n\n         \n       Whereas, in an unprecedented sale, the European Union \n     entered into a contract with a United States buyer to sell \n     heavily subsidized European barley to the United States;\n       Whereas the sale of almost 1,400,000 bushels (30,000 metric \n     tons) of feed barley was shipped from Finland to Stockton, \n     California;\n       Whereas news of the sale depressed feed barley prices in \n     the California feed barley market;\n       Whereas, since the market sets national pricing patterns \n     for both feed and malting barley, the sale would mean \n     enormous market losses for barley producers throughout the \n     United States, at a time when the United States barley \n     producers are already suffering from low prices;\n       Whereas the European restitution subsidies for this barley \n     amounts to $1.11 per bushel ($51 per metric ton);\n       Whereas the price-depressing effects of this one sale will \n     continue to adversely affect market prices for at least a 9-\n     month period as this grain moves through the United States \n     marketing system;\n       Whereas this shipment is part of about 2.1 million metric \n     tons of European feed barley that have been approved for \n     restitution subsidies by the European Union this year;\n       Whereas the availability of the additional subsidized \n     European barley in the international market not only \n     artificially depressed market prices, but also threatens to \n     open new import channels into the United States;\n       Whereas, as the world's largest feed grain producer and the \n     world's largest exporter of feed grains, the United States \n     does not require imported feed grains;\n       Whereas, at the same time that subsidized European barley \n     is being imported into the United States, some United States \n     feed grains are prevented from entering European markets \n     under European Union food regulations;\n       Whereas United States barley growers continue to suffer the \n     negative impacts of the sale, regardless of whether the \n     subsidized European barley was originally targeted for sale \n     into the United States and whether the subsidies comply with \n     the letter of current World Trade Organization export subsidy \n     rules; and\n       Whereas the sale not only undermines the intent and the \n     spirit of free trade agreements and negotiations, it also \n     moves away from the goals of level playing fields and \n     fairness in trade relationships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ADJUSTMENTS.\n\n       The applicable base amount under section 402(b) for a given \n     calendar year shall be adjusted as follows in determining the \n     annual payment for that year:\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the sixth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the adjusted \n     applicable base amount under section 402(b)(4) is the amount \n     of the annual payment made for the preceding year increased \n     by the greater of 3 percent or the annual increase in the \n     CPI.\n       (2) CPI.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (3) Rounding.--If any increase determined under \n     subparagraph (A) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase \n     shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n\n                           Amendment No. 2423\n\n       Add at the end the following new sections:\n\n     SEC. ____. CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should make \n     freedom of religion one of the major objectives of United \n     States foreign policy with respect to China. As part of this \n     policy, the Department of State should raise in every \n     relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the issue of \n     individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or otherwise \n     harassed by the Chinese Government on religious grounds. In \n     its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n\n     SEC. ____.

All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 \n     pro-democracy protests, sentenced on October 30, 1996, to 11 \n     years in prison on charges of conspiring to subvert the \n     government; Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison on \n     December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the victims \n     of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's verdict \n     constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an independent \n     labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-education \n     through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his activities in \n     connection with a petition campaign calling for human rights \n     reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan national, who was \n     arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after he returned from \n     a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan government in exile \n     is located, and following a secret trial was convicted by the \n     Government of the People's Republic of\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Wei Jingsheng, sentenced to 14 years in prison on \n     December 13, 1996, for conspiring to subvert the government \n     and for ``communication with hostile foreign organizations \n     and individuals, amassing funds in preparation for \n     overthrowing the government and publishing anti-government \n     articles abroad,'' is currently held in Jile No. 1 Prison \n     (formerly the Nanpu New Life Salt Farm) in Hebei province, \n     where he reportedly suffers from severe high blood pressure \n     and a heart condition, worsened by poor conditions of \n     confinement;\n       (B) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (C) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I joined the majority of my \nSenate colleagues in voting overwhelmingly in favor of the resolution \napproving the accession to NATO of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic. I believe that these three countries have made remarkable \nprogress in establishing\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\ndemocratic institutions and undertaking fundamental economic reforms. \nIn addition, for the United States to refuse their admission into NATO \nat this stage would undermine U.S. leadership both in the Atlantic \nAlliance and globally.\n  However, my support for the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic into NATO should not be interpreted as a green light for \nfurther rounds of NATO enlargement. I believe that there is no mandate \nfor further rounds of NATO enlargement. As the forty-one votes in \nsupport of the Warner Amendment indicate, more than enough Senators are \nconcerned about moving too fast on NATO enlargement to block approval \nof the accession of any additional states to NATO in the near-term. In \naddition, provisions of the NATO resolution makes clear that the Senate \nexpects to be closely consulted prior to any future negotiations on \ninviting other countries to join NATO.\n  We must get answers to critical questions before we even begin to \nconsider whether additional countries should be invited to join NATO. \nBefore any further enlargement is contemplated, the United States needs \nto know the costs of the first several years of integrating Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, and the burden sharing \narrangements for meeting those costs. In addition, the Alliance must \nfirst complete revising and updating its Strategic Concept, the \nstatement of NATO's fundamental military mission. This will allow NATO \nmembers, and countries potentially seeking membership, to judge for \nthemselves whether further expansion strengthens--or undermines--the \nAlliance's ability to carry out its strategic mission.\n  I continue to have serious doubts about the wisdom of any further \nenlargement of NATO. In rushing to bring the states of the former \nWarsaw Pact and the former Soviet Union into the NATO military fold, we \nrisk undermining our ability to work with Russia to reduce the most \nimmediate threats to our security. In particular, I am concerned about \nthe adverse impact that the consideration of the Baltic states for NATO \nmembership might have on on-going U.S.-Russian cooperative initiatives. \nThese initiatives address some of our highest security concerns, \nincluding the containment of the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, \nand biological technology and materials, and achieving mutual \nreductions in strategic nuclear forces. With regard to the Baltics, I \ndraw the attention of my colleagues to a colloquy between Sen. Biden \nand myself recorded in the Congressional Record of April 30th, on page \nS3888. This colloquy clarifies that the United States has not pre-\ncommitted, either in the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership or \nelsewhere, to support NATO membership for the Baltic states.\n  I hope now we can put the distraction of NATO enlargement behind us. \nIt has yet to be explained how the expansion of a military alliance, \nformed during the height of the Cold War to defend its members' \nterritory from external attack, serves our needs in today's changed \nsecurity environment. The threats we face today require careful \nconsideration of a full range of options--whether NATO, the Partnership \nfor Peace initiative between NATO and 28 countries of Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union, or other collective security arrangements--to \nincrease the security and stability of all democratic states.\n  The Senate, as well, needs to turn its attention to efforts that \nmutually enhance the security of the United States, its NATO allies, \nand the states of Eastern Europe, including Russia. These include \nlaying the groundwork for Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, supporting the elimination of Russian strategic arms under the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program, and encouraging acceleration of \nthe START process to further reduce Russian nuclear weapons. In the \nlong-run these initiatives offer valuable alternatives to NATO \nenlargement for addressing the highest security concerns in today's \npost-Cold War security environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5141-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE WILLIAM E. BIVIN FORENSICS SOCIETY: 1998 NATIONAL \n                      COLLEGIATE DEBATE CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating the William E. Bivin Forensic \nSociety--the debate team at Western Kentucky University, located in \nBowling Green, Kentucky--for their recent victories at the national \ncollegiate debate championships.\n  In mid-March, Western won the Delta Sigma Rho--Tau Kappa Alpha \nLincoln-Douglas Debate Championships at Miami University in Ohio. Two \nmembers of the team, Mike McDonner and Aaron Whaley--were co-national \nchampions in the individual competition.\n  Then, in April, Western also won at the National Forensics \nAssociation tournament at Western Illinois University, defeating Ohio \nState University by a 5-0 decision. Mike McDonner again captured the \nindividual title, and teammate Kerri Richardson was a semifinalist. In \naddition, Kristin Pamperin and Doug Morey were quarterfinalists. Other \nvarsity members of the victorious Western Kentucky team were Amanda \nGibson and Aaron Whaley. Novice debaters Mitchell Bailey, Jennifer \nCloyd and Brian Sisk also contributed to the team title.\n  These two debates comprise the national championships in college \ndebating circles, and it is extremely rare that one team wins both \nevents. Amazingly, this is second time in three years that Western \nKentucky has claimed both debates. The winning tradition being built in \nBowling Green is a testament to the strong leadership of the team's \ncoach, Judy Woodring.\n  Mr. President, Western Kentucky University's debate team is building \nquite a tradition. I offer my congratulations to Coach Woodring and to \nall the members of the Bivin Forensics Society for another great year. \nWith two national championships in three years, I expect that we may be \nseeing the beginning of a dynasty in Bowling Green.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5142-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MIGNON CLYBURN'S APPOINTMENT TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA PUBLIC SERVICE \n                               COMMISSION\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nMignon Clyburn, daughter of U.S. Representative James Clyburn, on her \nelection to the South Carolina Public Service Commission. The PSC--\nwhich overseas electricity, gas, phone, water, and sewer rates--is \ncrucial to safeguarding consumer rights for all the people of South \nCarolina. Its work will be especially important and complex now that \nthe telecommunications and utilities industries have been deregulated. \nIt is because the work of the Public Service Commission is so important \nthat I am glad to see someone as capable and dedicated as Mignon \nClyburn appointed to the Commission.\n  Public service flows in Mignon's blood. Her father, the first black \nRepresentative elected from South Carolina since Reconstruction, served \nSouth Carolina for many years in various community and state positions \nbefore entering the House of Representatives.\n  Mignon has worked for over a decade as the driving force behind The \nCoastal Times newspaper. Her tireless work writing, editing, and \nmarketing the magazine has earned it well-deserved praise as one of the \nbest community papers in the Southeast. Mignon also has served her \ncommunity through extensive volunteer work with the United Way and \nother organizations.\n  Mr. President, Mignon Clyburn will make an excellent Commissioner. \nShe understands the importance of the Public Service Commission for the \npeople of South Carolina. She said after accepting the position, ``I \nthink this is the most significant agency . . . in the state. What's \nmore vital or fundamental than your utilities?''\n  Mignon Clyburn will make a wonderful Public Service Commissioner. She \nis an intelligent, hard working, and committed to improving the life of \nevery South Carolinian. I am confident she will be a dedicated and \neffective guardian of South Carolina consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5142-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5142-S5143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS FOOD DRIVE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Last year \nalmost 5,000 pounds were collected in Horsham, Pennsylvania while some \n73 million pounds were collected nationwide.\n  On Saturday, May 9, letter carriers in Horsham and across the nation \nreached out to help their neighbors who fell on hard times by \ncollecting nonperishable food donations along their mail routes. Each \nyear, their efforts help to restock the shelves of local food pantries. \nLikewise, the donations raided through this annual event prepare \ncharities for the overwhelming demand for food during the Thanksgiving \nand Christmas holiday seasons.\n  Mr. President, I commend the letter carriers, the men and women of \nthe U.S. Postal Service, and the United Way for making this collection \npossible. On behalf of the United States Senate, I would like to \nrecognize the dedication of these public servants and the generosity of \nthe families who donated to this worthy cause. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to \nall those who participated in the National Association of Letter \nCarriers Food Drive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5142-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE NORCROSS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a dear \nfriend and treasured community leader in Southern New Jersey, George \nNorcross II.\n  George and I shared many experiences and values and each of us ended \nup in public service.\n  We both grew up in a poor, urban environment, he in Camden, and I in \nPaterson. We both lost our fathers at a very young age, but continued \nto attend high school while beginning to work. We both served in the \nmilitary during World War II, he in the Navy and I in the Army.\n  After George returned from the war, he built a career in union \norganizing efforts and community service. His was a voice of strength \nand determination for working families in Camden County--and what a \nloud voice it was! He fought tooth and nail for union workers, never \nwithout a cigar in hand. But his rough exterior was complemented by his \ncaring heart, and the effectiveness of his work with organized labor \nwas reinforced through his numerous philanthropic activities.\n  The Union Organization of Social Services, of which George became \npresident in 1955, reflected his marriage of organized labor and \ncharity work. The mission of UOSS is to deal with drug and alcohol \nabuse, job training, food banks, disaster relief, clothing drives and \nblood banks within its community.\n  George was also active in the United Way his entire life, serving as \nits general chairman in 1992 and as chairman emeritus after his \nretirement. His involvement with this organization led to the United \nWay's Labor Support Committee, which raised millions of dollars for \ncharity.\n  As a touch negotiator, a coalition builder, and someone who always \ngot the job done, George's unrivaled union leadership will never be \nforgotten. He served as president of the AFL-CIO Central Labor Union \nfor 16 years, was a member of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers Local 1448, and became the international \nrepresentative of the International Union of Electrical Workers.\n  George and I shared the conviction that educational opportunity is \ncritical to a robust and stable democracy. George's dedication to \nproviding educational opportunities to others led to his creation of \nthe Peter J. McGuire Scholarship Program in conjunction with the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers. These scholarships, presented every \nyear at New Jersey's Labor Day celebration, benefit children of \nSouthern New Jersey union members. And if my schedule didn't permit me \nto attend this annual event one year, I would get an earful from \nGeorge!\n  George's union leadership and sense of civic responsibility have \nbenefitted countless New Jerseyans, including students able to go \nschool on scholarship, people in need who receive help, and workers \nwith grievances whose rights are defended.\n  George Norcross will be dearly missed. I want to extend my heartfelt \ncondolences to Carol, George's wife of 43 years, and his four sons, \nGeorge III, John, Don and Phil. I know I will continue to cross paths \nand work with them on behalf of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5143-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GARY HIRSHBERG\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize Gary Hirshberg, president and chief executive officer of \nStonyfield Farm in Londonderry, New Hampshire, who is being honored \nwith the two most prestigious business leadership awards in New \nHampshire. Dedicated to social and environmental corporate \nresponsibility, Gary Hirshberg became the first New Hampshire \nentrepreneur to be named both ``Business Leader of the Year'' by \nBusiness NH magazine and ``New Hampshire's 1998 Small Business Person \nof the Year'' by the United States Small Business Administration.\n  A New Hampshire native and third-generation manufacturer, Gary's \nvision and commitment to social and environmental issues played an \nintegral role in the development of Stonyfield Farm. Gary Hirshberg was \nnamed CEO shortly after joining Stonyfield. Together, with founder \nSamuel Kaymen, they embarked on an educational project designed to \nrevitalize family farms in the New England dairy industry while \npositively impacting the environment and the local economy.\n  The same dedication and determination that prompted two individuals \nto do everything from milk cows to deliver products out of an old \nfarmhouse in Wilton, helped the Stonyfield Farm family to grow to its \ncurrent 150 employees and 21,000-square-foot, custom-designed ``Yogurt \nWorks'' in Londonderry. Having been raised on a farm myself, I can \nappreciate the hard work done by Gary and his partner over the years. \nAs Gary watched the company's distribution expand to all 50 States and \nGreat Britain and annual sales exceed $40 million, he never lost sight \nof his commitment to family-owned farms. Under Gary Hirshberg's \nleadership, Stonyfield Farm continues to promote awareness of the \nplight of the small farm through such programs as ``Adopt a Cow,'' and \nto raise environmental consciousness through the company's use of \noperationally efficient natural resources and its sponsorship of \nrecycling programs.\n  As a former small business owner, I appreciate the challenges faced \nby small business owners and understand that these businesses are the \nbackbone of our economy. Consequently, I have worked throughout my \ntenure in Congress to lift the tax and regulatory burden from the \nshoulders of small business so that the dreams and aspirations of \npeople like Gary Hirshberg and Stonyfield Farm may continue to grow and \nprosper. Gary's compassion and commitment to local communities, \nenvironmental awareness, and social responsibility embodies the true \nNew Hampshire spirit. I commend him for serving as a role model for not \nonly the youth of the Granite State but for all of us. It is with great \npride that I represent Gary Hirshberg in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5143-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5143-S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and \nbearing the sorrow that Floridians and Americans everywhere feel at the \ndeath of a national treasure--Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\n  Marjory Stoneman Douglas is and will always be the ``Mother of the \nEverglades.'' That title was made official in 1993, when President \nClinton presented here with the Presidential Medal of Freedom--our \nnation's most prestigious civilian honor.\n  Over 130 years ago, upon meeting Harriet Beecher Stowe for the first \ntime, President Abraham Lincoln greeted the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin \nwith this salutation: ``So this is the little woman who started the \ngreat war.''\n  Marjory Stoneman Douglas was equally influential in her own time. She \nwas the feisty woman who started the great effort to save the \nEverglades from mankind's abuse and neglect.\n  She was born on April 7, 1880 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Perhaps it \nwas this connection to ``The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes'' that was \nresponsible for her intense passion for environmental preservation. She \ngraduated\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nfrom Wellesley College just over two decades later with the prophetic \ntitle of ``Class Orator.''\n  These two characteristics--a love of nature and a powerful \ndetermination to make her voice heard--would soon come together to the \nbenefit of the Florida Everglades. In 1915, Marjory arrived in Miami \nand joined the staff of the Miami Herald. With the exception of a brief \nstint as a Red Cross worker during World War I, she spent the next \neighty-three years working to save the Everglades from destruction.\n  When Marjory Stoneman Douglas arrived in South Florida, many people \nthought of the Everglades as nothing more than another Florida swamp. \nIndeed, Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, who served from 1905 to \n1909, had proposed draining the Everglades to reclaim the land there.\n  Marjory did not brook ignorance about the Everglades. Instead, she \npoured time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears into re-educating the \npeople of Florida about the crowning jewel in Florida's collection of \nenvironmental treasures. Long before scientists became alarmed about \nthe effects on the natural ecosystems of south Florida, she was taking \npublic officials to task for destroying wetlands, eliminating the sheet \nflow of water across the Everglades, and upsetting the natural cycles \nupon which the entire South Florida ecosystem depends.\n  Marjory's oratory and hustle produced tangible accomplishments. Her \ncrusade to win federal protection for the wetlands scored a major \nvictory when President Harry Truman dedicated Everglades National Park \nin 1947.\n  That same year, she published the work that would jump-start the \nmodern era of Everglades restoration: The Everglades: River of Grass. \nTo this day, that tome stands as the definitive descriptive of the \nnational treasure she fought so hard to protect.\n  Visitors travel thousands of miles to see the Everglades. Scientists \nand naturalists spend entire lifetimes studying the Everglades' diverse \nhabitats and unique collection of plants and animal life. Today, public \nofficials from every ideological persuasion and geographic location \nline up to support efforts to protect the Everglades. None of this \nwould have been possible without Marjory Stoneman Douglas' Herculean \nefforts.\n  She supplemented her hard work and determination with a disarming \ncandor. Some people will remember that Marjory co-authored a 1920's \nanti-gangster play entitled Storm Warnings. That title was well-suited \nto the personality of its author. She would frequently blow in like a \nFlorida summer thunderstorm and give you her thoughts in no uncertain \nterms, leaving you dazed and drained but unmistakably sure of her \nintentions.\n  When I was a state legislator in the late 1960's, Marjory came to \nTallahassee to speak to the Dade County delegation. She conveyed one \nsimple, blunt message: we would safeguard the health of the Everglades \nand if we didn't, we would all spend an uncomfortable afterlife in \nhell.\n  I took those words to heart. When I was Governor from 1979 to 1987, \nMarjory and I teamed up to launch a campaign to safeguard the Florida \nEverglades. It is an effort that has attracted broad, bipartisan \nsupport over the years--a testament to Marjory's persuasive powers.\n  In 1997, I joined Senator Connie Mack and U.S. Representative Peter \nDeutsch in introducing legislation to name over 1.3 million acres of \nthe Everglades after its modern saviour. President Clinton signed that \nlegislation in mid-November, and I helped to dedicate the ``Marjory \nStoneman Douglas Wilderness'' on December 4, 1997--Everglades National \nPark's 50th Birthday. Marjory's ashes will be scattered over that \nwilderness area.\n  Marjory Stoneman Douglas was a friend and mentor to me for many \nyears. I will miss her greatly. I want to conclude today by reading \nfrom John Rothchild's introduction to her autobiography. Recalling her \nappearance at a 1973 public meeting in Everglades City, Mr. Rothchild \noffered this apt description:\n\n       Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and \n     she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy \n     hat made her look like Scarlet O'Hara as played by Igor \n     Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping \n     [mosquitoes] and more or less came to order. She reminded us \n     all of our responsibility to nature. Her voice had the \n     sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself \n     seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, \n     developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it \n     didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes.\n\n  Marjory Stoneman Douglas always got your attention--she was the most \neloquent spokesperson that the Everglades will ever have. The embattled \nwetland lost is ``Mother'' last week, but we must keep her memory and \nlegacy alive by continuing our efforts to preserve the Everglades for \nfuture generations of Floridians and Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5143-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO DR. ALVIN C. POWELEIT: A FIXTURE IN NORTHERN KENTUCKY FOR \n                             OVER 50 YEARS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to remember the \nlife of Dr. Alvin C. Poweleit. For nearly 50 years, the people of \nCovington were blessed to have Dr. Poweleit as a member of their \ncommunity, and few families were not touched by the kind gentleman \nknown as ``Pepa.''\n  Pepa Poweleit grew up in Northern Kentucky in the town of Newport. \nAfter earning his medical degree, Dr. Poweleit returned to Newport in \nthe late 1930s as general practitioner. Like most young men of his \ngeneration, he left his hometown behind when he signed up to serve in \nWorld War II. He soon found himself in the Philippines, where he was \nthe first U.S. medical officer to be decorated in the war, when he \nsaved personnel in a submerged Brenn Gun Carrier.\n  Dr. Poweleit spent over three years in Japanese POW camps in the \nPhilippines, and was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. After the \nwar, Dr. Poweleit returned to Northern Kentucky, where he opened up his \nown practice in Covington as an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist.\n  For the last 50 years, the Poweleit family has maintained the office \nat the corner of Eighth and Scott in Covington. It was a rare day that \nDr. Poweleit didn't work 14 hours. If there were sick patients to be \nseen, Pepa Poweleit would see every single one. At a time when most \npeople lived within walking distance of their family doctor, it wasn't \nrare to see Dr. Poweleit still in the office after midnight.\n  Pepa Poweleit retired from practice in 1981, leaving the family \npractice to his son Alvin D, an eye specialist known in the community \nas Dr. Alvin.

Mr. President, I join all of my colleagues in thanking \nour friend and colleague and chairman of our task force, Senator \nConrad, for the enormously informative presentation that was made in \nsupport of our proposal before the Senate now, which is to raise the \ncost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50.\n  I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Kerry, for his comments and \nfor all the work he has done, as well, in bringing us to where we are \nin this legislative session, so that we are having an opportunity to \ndebate these issues on the floor of the Senate and having an \nopportunity to express a judgment about these matters this afternoon, \nagain tomorrow, and the remainder of this week.\n  This is enormously important. Perhaps, in many respects, it is the \nmost important measure that we will have before the Senate in this \nterm--certainly one of the most important public health issues that we \nwill have before the Senate. I think it is important that the American \npeople give focus and attention to this issue and, in particular, to \nthe amendments we are now discussing and debating on the increase of \nthe per pack cost of cigarettes.\n  I also mention our colleague and friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator McCain. I, too, want to join in expressing \nappreciation for the fact that we had the opportunity to get to this \nlegislation through his leadership. Now we have an opportunity to \nstrengthen and improve it. We are grateful for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take a few moments to respond to the \nissue that Senator McCain spoke to when we were making the presentation \nabout the importance of increasing the price per pack by $1.50. Senator \nMcCain at that time talked about, what is magical about $1.50? What is \nreally the difference between that and $2 or $2.50 or $3?\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to understand why we do have \nthe $1.50. It is, as I mentioned earlier, and as Senator Lautenberg and \nSenator Conrad have pointed out, the recommended figure by not just the \nmajority, but the entirety of the public health community, to be \nessential if we are going to have some impact in reducing cigarette \nsmoking by teenagers in this country and also to achieve the goal that \nwas established by the attorneys general in their own proposal. They \nestablished a 10-year goal of 60 percent. That was in the initial \nproposal made by the attorneys general--the 60 percent.\n  In our Committee on Labor and Human Resources, which had the \nconsideration of this legislation for a short period of time--we had \nthe jurisdiction because of the responsibility that the committee has \nregarding the Food and Drug Administration, and we had a markup on the \nlegislation--we had a majority of the members who said, ``We don't want \nto see a reduction of 60 percent, we want a reduction of 80 percent.'' \nIf we are going to accept that, then we have to find out how we are \ngoing to get and reach that particular goal. That is really the \nfundamental issue. It doesn't do much good to say we are going to set a \ngoal of 30, 40, 50, or 60 percent and then not take the steps to be \nable to achieve it.\n  The attorneys general went with 60 percent. The goal established out \nof the Commerce Committee was 60 percent. So it is fair enough to ask \nourselves, will we reach that goal of 60 percent with the proposal of \nthe Commerce Committee? And what we are saying is that we will not. You \nwon't reach that with $1.10. You will get maybe into a 34, 36 percent \nreduction, but you are not going to get the 60 percent reduction, which \nhas been the goal--and I think a worthwhile goal--to see that 60 \npercent of the young people in this country are going to stop smoking \nover a period of 10 years. We will be able to reach that with $1.50. I \nwill come back and explain that in greater detail in a few moments. We \nwill be able to reach that and give the authority for that.\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee says we will get there, and if \nwe don't get there on the front end, we will get there on the back end \nby the requirements we have on the look-back provisions. But I think it \nis fair to say that with the look-back provisions, and the capping of \nthe payments on the look-back provisions of some $4 billion, that the \nbest estimate, even if you are going to have the violations of the \nlook-back provisions, you are only talking about perhaps 15 or 20 cents \nmore per pack.\n  So you get up to maybe $1.30 or $1.35. But you still are not getting \nto where the health economists and professionals say you have to get in \norder to have the significant reduction.\n  That is really the issue that is before the Senate. That is the \nquestion that we are going to decide on tomorrow.\n  What is the justification for not taking the recommendations of the \npublic health community? What is possibly the reason for not doing so? \nThere are those who can say, ``Well, if you do so you are going to pay \nfor the industry itself.'' Senator Conrad just responded to that.\n  I come back to the excellent testimony we had before the Judiciary \nCommittee and before the task force that responds to that which \nestimates that even with $1.50 as Jeffrey Harris, who is probably the \nmost thoughtful and competent unbiased health economist who has studied \nthis for the longest period of time, has estimated that even with an \nincrease of $1.50, that by the year 2003 the profits for the industry \nwill be in excess of $5 billion just on the domestic sales of product \nhere in the United States, a very, very generous profit for this \nindustry--a generous profit for the industry even at $1.50.\n  What is possibly the reason not to support the recommendation of the \npublic health community which says we ought to go to $1.50 a pack if we \nare serious about stopping young people from smoking?\n  That is overwhelming testimony. That is overwhelming presentation. It \nis overwhelming evidence. It has not been rebutted. It won't be \nrebutted. It hasn't been rebutted tonight. It won't be rebutted \ntomorrow. And it has not been rebutted by any of the publications, \nincluding the tobacco industry itself. It has not been rebutted.\n  We will come back to what the tobacco industry has been doing. So \nthis is the issue. Why wouldn't we want to do it? What is going to be \nthe argument against it? I don't find the arguments very persuasive. I \ndo not hear them. It is just, ``Well, we have a better way of doing \nit.'' But we are taking a very significant chance. Why do that when we \nhave such overwhelming and powerful evidence this amendment can make a \nsignificant difference, and based upon the human tragedy that is taking \nplace among our teenagers every single day across this country? It \nisn't a problem that is becoming less important. It is becoming more \nimportant. It isn't an issue that is resolving itself. It is becoming \nmore acute. That is the question that we can ask.\n  We in this body tomorrow can take a major step in improving the \nquality of life for young people in this country for years ahead. The \noverwhelming majority of the American people are for it.\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\n The powerful special interests of the tobacco industry are against it. \nAnd we are going to find out here on the floor of the Senate when that \nrollcall is going to be there whether we are going to stand with the \nfamilies and stand with the children of this country and stand with the \nfuture, or whether we are going to stand with an industry that has been \nso discredited in terms of its representations and presentations in \nthis whole discussion and debate and over the period of this past year. \nThat is the issue. I don't think we can have many that are more clearly \ndefined than the one we have before us and will have before us \ntomorrow.\n  According to University of Illinois Professor Chaloupka, the Nation's \nleading authority on the impact of higher cigarette prices on teenage \nsmoking, a $1.50 per pack increase in cigarette prices will reduce the \nteenage smoking by 56 percent over 10 years. A $1.10-a-pack increase, \non the other hand, will reduce youth smoking rates by only 34 percent. \nIn fact, the $1.15 increase will only return youth smoking to its 1991 \nlevel because of the recent surge in teenage smoking rates. That is \nclearly unacceptable.\n  FDA Commissioner David Kessler has called smoking a ``pediatric \ndisease with its onset in adolescents.'' In fact, studies show that \nover 90 percent of the current adult smokers began to smoke before they \nreached the age of 18.\n  It makes sense for Congress to do what we can to discourage young \nAmericans from starting to smoke during these critical years. A $1.50-\na-pack increase over 3 years is the right medicine. A $1.10 increase \nwon't do the job.\n\n  Youth smoking in America has reached epidemic proportions. According \nto a report issued last month by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, smoking rates among high school students soared by nearly a \nthird between 1991 and 1997. Among African-Americans, the rates have \nsoared by 80 percent. More than 36 percent of high school students \nsmoke, a 1991 year high.\n  With youth smoking at crisis levels and still increasing we cannot \nrely on halfway measures. Congress must use the strongest legislative \ntools available to reduce youth smoking as rapidly as possible.\n  Mr. President, let's take a look at what has been happening to the \nteenagers in this country over the period of the recent years. Tobacco \nuse, as mentioned, is a ``pediatric disease with its onset in \nadolescents.'' It is no coincidence that teenage smoking has continued \nto increase since the early 1990s. The industry has systematically \nreduced its prices on cigarettes and increased its spending on \nmarketing and promotional strategies targeted at youth.\n  A significant date in this cynical manipulation is April 2, 1993, a \nday which will live in infamy in the tobacco industry. On that day, \noften called ``Marlboro Friday,'' the Nation's largest tobacco company, \nPhilip Morris, fired the opening salvo in the new price strategy which \nreversed a decade-long decline in youth smoking in the United States. \nPhilip Morris slashed 40 cents off the price of Marlboro, its most \npopular brand of cigarettes among children. The strategy was defined to \nprotect its profits against generic and discount brands which were \ncapturing an increased share of the market.\n  Let me show this chart which gives the overall changes about what is \nhappening with teenage smoking here in the United States. In 1991, it \nincreased 27 percent; in 1993, 30 percent; in 1995, 34.5 percent; in \n1997, 36.4 percent; a yearly average of a 32-percent rise since 1991.\n  This is going up so rapidly that we have to ask ourselves what are we \ngoing to do to try to slow it down? What can we do to possibly stop it? \nAnd the goals that have been set by the attorneys general and by the \nCommerce Committee is 60 percent. Let's try to do that. The best way is \nwith the $1.50.\n  Teenage smoking on the rise. Just look at who has been the targets of \nthe tobacco companies.\n  Blacks and non-Hispanic increased 80.2 percent. They have been \ntargeted by the industry. They have been successful. Hispanic, up 34 \npercent, and white and non-Hispanic, 28 percent. They have been the \ntargets of the tobacco industry effort to expand their market to bring \nthese young people into addiction to be the source of profits for \nfuture years.\n  The tobacco industry looks at a child, and, says, ``This is my profit \nfor the future years. See what I can do to get that child addicted.''\n  You say, ``How can you say that, Senator? How can you make a \nstatement like that on the floor of the U.S. Senate?''\n  Listen to what the Philip Morris memo says in 1987 at the Minnesota \ntrial.\n\n       The `82-`83 round of price increases prevented 500,000 \n     teenagers from starting to smoke. This means that 420,000 of \n     the nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. We \n     were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again.\n\n  This isn't a statement made by the Senators from Massachusetts, North \nDakota or New Jersey. Here it is in the words of the tobacco industry. \nListen to what they say about an increase in price.\n\n       The `82-`83 price increase prevented 500,000 teenagers from \n     starting to smoke. This means that 420,000 of the nonstarters \n     would have been Philip Morris smokers.\n\n  That is their percent of the market.\n\n       We were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again.\n\n  Well, they will have a chance to have it happen to them again \ntomorrow at noontime when we do what the cigarette companies dread the \nmost, give them an increase in price. That is what they dread the most. \nWe will hear, oh, my goodness, all this fluttering around over this tax \nbill--can we afford it; it is regressive, and all the rest.\n  If you want to stop teenagers from smoking, there it is, according to \nthe industry itself. And now, Mr. President, we see what has happened. \nEvery parent in this country ought to be concerned about the explosion \nin the numbers of teenage smokers in this country with an extraordinary \nrise, the fastest rise we have seen really in the history of any kind \nof documentation about kids smoking.\n\n       Now, you can say let's look again at what was really the \n     reason for this.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I suppose it is all summarized best by this \nPhilip Morris memo. We can see now what they were talking about when \nyou look at what has happened to the real price--the impact on teen \nsmoking from 1980 to 1995. Here is the steep increase in the price, and \nhere is the decline in the teenage smoking.\n  That is what Philip Morris was talking about--the `1982-83 increase \nin the price and the decline in the teenage smoking, right there. There \nit is, Mr. President. And that represents the 420,000 Philip Morris \npotential smokers who didn't get started--in just that short line here.\n  But now let's look at what has happened with the price over the rest \nof the period of time. We had the gradual increase. And we will hear \nmore about that. That is basically the monitoring and increasing of \nwhat? You say, Senator, well, it is just the price that is going up. \nHow could they possibly--why would they do that?\n  Well, there is no question the price was on the rise all through here \nand look what was happening with teenage smoking, Mr. President. Look \nwhat was happening with teenage smoking. As the prices were going up \nhere, the number of teenage smokers was coming down here.\n  We are challenged: Well, who are these public health officials? Where \nare these studies? What kind of findings is Dr. Koop referring to?\n  Just look at this record. Just look at this record as to what is \nhappening out there in the countryside, the dramatic increases in the \nnumber of kids that are going ahead and smoking and look in the more \nrecent times. And then look what happened where you have the increase \nin the price and the decline here. And then we see the drop, the real \nprice right here corresponding to the dramatic increase and leveling \noff.\n  See the drop here, Mr. President. You see the drop in the real price \nand the explosion of teenage smoking. How many times do we have to make \nthis case?\n  Well, you know something. People can say, ``Well, look, it is \nflattened off.'' This hasn't flattened off.\n  Well, what happened in the interim? What happened in the interim is \nthe explosion of the tobacco industry in advertising, $5 billion a year \nin advertising. And that has made sure that these \n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nkids continued on with their smoking. They monitor this carefully, what \nthe price and the necessary advertising is. They take the focus groups; \nthey do their polling; they do their marketing surveys. And then they \nknow exactly what to do, how to calculate this, and that is what they \nare doing.\n\n  This whole group, increasing 30 percent a year during all of this \nperiod of time, are the kids that are being addicted to smoking. As we \nfound out in our Judiciary Committee, we are a Nation that is concerned \nabout what we are going to do about the problems of substance abuse, \nand just about every professional will tell you that the gateway in \nterms of the use of heroin, cocaine, the other substance abuse starts \nwith smoking--and starts with teenage smoking. And they can draw you a \ncorrelation about where those kids start getting off the straight and \nnarrow path almost by the time they begin to smoke as kids. That record \nis out there. I will put some of that in the Record and reference it \ntomorrow morning, Mr. President, but that is a fact and they can \ndemonstrate that to you. That makes the case about as well as it can be \nmade.\n  I don't know how much more convincing you have to be. I do not hear \nthe response from our colleagues and friends who are opposed to this. \nAccording to Jeffrey Harris, health economist at MIT, who is the most \nexperienced, thoughtful and knowledgeable, and certainly the most \nexperienced in terms of these issues, the profit even with $1.50 for \nthe industry itself will be $5.1 billion--$5.1 billion--$5.7 billion \nunder the McCain bill; with no legislation, $6.3 billion. Very, very \nprofitable industry. And another $2 billion to $3 billion per year from \ninternational cigarette sales and from nontobacco products--Miller, \nKraft, Nabisco.\n  We are talking about economic dynamite when we are talking about \nthese companies. And they shed these crocodile tears if we propose \nputting on a $1.50 per pack.\n  The thing we do know, Mr. President, is that we will have a \nsignificant impact in reducing teenage smoking. Why take a chance? Why \ntake a chance of not doing this job right? Why take a chance of not \ntaking the steps that are necessary to move ahead to make a difference \nfor all of these kids? I do not understand it.\n  We have heard about some of the reasons why we should not do it. I \nthink the Senator from North Dakota stated it well. If we do it, the \narguments have been made, they won't be profitable. That has been \nresponded to. If we do it, we are going to get into questions of \nsmuggling. We will have to deal with this issue. And as Senator Conrad \nhad pointed out, the smuggling is not taking place in the countries \nwith the highest costs, which you would normally think. Countries where \nsmuggling is the greatest is where the prices are, in some instances, a \nquarter or a third of the higher price, but fail to have effective law \nenforcement provisions. So you can say, ``Well, what are you going to \nhave in terms of law enforcement provisions?''\n  Mr. President, others will speak to this. But just to mention \nbriefly: Closed distribution systems; require licensing of everyone in \nthe cigarette distribution chain, manufacturer or wholesaler, \ndistributor and retailer; all cigarettes manufactured for export must \nbe clearly marked so they can be easily identified; additional law \nenforcement resources for Customs and ATF.\n  We hear excellent responses from those who have responsibilities for \nsmuggling, and they have answered to that. So we know we are going to \nhave minimal impact on the profits of the industry. We know it can work \neffectively on smuggling. And we know what group in our society is \ngoing to benefit the most.\n  Let me just continue about the teenagers and some of the things that \nhappen to these teenagers. Philip Morris reduced prices by 50 cents in \nmy own State of Massachusetts and New York, both of which had recently \nincreased their cigarette tax. This is some 3 years ago. A month later, \nR.J. Reynolds, the Nation's second largest cigarette company, which \nmanufactures Camel cigarette, responded by matching Philip Morris price \ncuts on its most popular brands with teenagers, and the price cuts came \nat the same time the Federal tax was being increased from 20 to 24 \ncents a pack and a larger tobacco increase was being considered to fund \nthe Clinton administration's proposal for health care reform. In \naddition to the price cuts, the tobacco industry continued to spend on \nadvertising, promotional giveaways, T-shirts, coupons, sports gear, \nbuy-some-get-some-free offers to increase sales.\n  And, as I mentioned, much of this advertising was targeted to \nchildren and adolescents, promising popularity, excitement, success, \nfor those who begin to smoke. It is no coincidence, then, that the \nprice cuts and increased advertising aimed at kids led to the rise in \nteenage smoking.\n  I just show that, time in and time out, if you lower the price and \nyou increase the advertising, you increase the teenage smoking. That is \nas clear as it is that we are standing tonight. You just cannot argue \nwith those facts; they are indisputable. And, still, we are having to \nmake this case for the increase, for $1.50. The $1.50 per pack will \naddress these problems. We will see this dramatic reduction in teenage \nsmoking. It has been stated by those who have studied and reviewed \nthis. The amendment we are proposing provides for the cigarette price \nindex of $1.50 a pack for the next 3 years. The $1.10 increase over 5 \nyears in the managers' amendment is not adequate to achieve the youth \nsmoking reduction goals.\n  If you had the $1.10 in 1 year, even $1.10 in 2 years, you would have \nsome impact. But $1.10 over 5 years is not going to have the kind of \nimpact, even with the look-back provisions, that those who support that \nproposal are supporting, particularly if you are talking about \nreductions of 60 percent. You cannot have it both ways. If you are \ngoing to reach 60 percent, you have to have the increase in the price, \nand it has to be fast. And you have to have the corresponding \ncounteradvertising measures and other supports, and a look-back \nprovision that is going to be worthy of the name. But just to say we \nare establishing a goal and then not to have the real teeth in that \nproposal I think diminishes what we are stating is our goal and what \nshould be our goal, and that is to pass legislation that is going to do \nsomething about kids smoking in our country and around the world.\n  By raising the price by $1.50 instead of $1.10, we will prevent an \nadditional 750,000 children from smoking over the next 5 years. That \nwill mean 250,000 fewer premature deaths from tobacco-induced diseases. \nWhat other step could we take here in the U.S. Senate, what could we \npossibly do in this session, so we could say we will save the lives of \n250,000 children in the action of a single day? You don't find it. We \nwon't have it. It is not there. But it will be tomorrow. We will have \nthat kind of impact. And that is the issue.\n  Public health experts have overwhelmingly concluded that the increase \nof $1.50 is the minimum price increase necessary to achieve our youth \nsmoking reduction. Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, the Academy of Sciences, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, American Lung \nAssociation, American Medical Association, the ENACT Coalition, Save \nLives Not Tobacco Coalition, have all stressed the importance of a \nprice increase of at least $1.50 per pack--some for $2, most for $1.50. \nAnd even those that were for $2 believe $1.50 with adequate look-back \ncan achieve the goal. It is the single most important step we can take \nto reduce youth smoking.\n\n  More than a third of the Members of the Senate have already \ncosponsored bills proposing $1.50 increase, because, as our colleagues \nknow, the Budget Committee endorsed a $1.50 increase on a bipartisan \nvote, 14 to 8, in March. Last Thursday, a bipartisan majority of the \nFinance Committee voted for a cigarette price increase of $1.50. Too \nmany young people are at stake for us to ignore the advice of all of \nour public health experts. Those efforts were bipartisan. Just as Dr. \nKoop speaks for Republicans and Democrats, those efforts were \nbipartisan in the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee. It should \nbe bipartisan tomorrow.\n  The American people have had enough of the tobacco industry's \ndistortions and denials about the addictiveness of nicotine. They have \nhad enough of the industry's cynical marketing of cigarettes to \nchildren. They have had enough of the industry's\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\ndecades-long coverup of the health risks associated with smoking.\n  This is an industry which once argued that cigarettes are no more \naddictive than Gummy Bears. This is an industry that used Joe Camel in \nadvertising, blatantly designed to hook children on smoking. Now they \nask us to believe that a $1.50 increase will lead to the bankruptcy of \nbig tobacco and a rampant black market for illegal cigarettes. That \nargument by big tobacco has no more credibility than any of the other \nfalse arguments that have been made over the past 30 years and more. \nOver the years, big tobacco has proved itself to be the master of the \nbig lie. Congress should have learned this lesson long ago, and it is \ntime to trust the Nation's public health leaders, not big tobacco's \npublic health prevaricators.\n  The tobacco companies have known these facts about addiction. For \nyears they have been fully aware that they need to persuade children to \ntake up smoking in order to preserve their future profits. That is why \nbig tobacco has targeted children, the billions of dollars in \nadvertising and promotional giveaways, their promise of popularity, \nexcitement, and success for young men and women who take up smoking.\n  The recent documents released in the Minnesota case against the \nindustry reveal the vast extent of the industry's marketing strategy to \nchildren. In the 1981 Philip Morris memo entitled ``Young Smokers, \nPrevalence, Implications, Related Demographic Trends,'' the authors \nwrote that it is important to know as much as possible about teenage \nsmoking patterns and attitudes. ``Today's teenager is tomorrow's \npotential regular customer and the overwhelming majority of smokers \nfirst beginning to smoke while still in their teens and the smoking \npatterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris. \nFurthermore, it is during the teenage years that the initial choice is \nmade.''\n  If nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimate 5 million of \ntoday's children will die prematurely from smoke-caused illnesses. Five \nmillion of today's children will die from smoke-caused illnesses. The \nAmerican public has had enough of the daily tragedy of death and \ndisease caused by tobacco use. The tobacco industry has literally had a \nlicense to kill for many decades. Now the license is being revoked and \nAmericans are demanding dramatic action by Congress to drastically curb \nyouth smoking.\n  This Congress will be judged, in large measure, by whether or not we \nrespond effectively to that challenge, and increasing cigarette prices \nby $1.50 is the most effective way to reduce teenage smoking. The \npublic health community agrees it is the minimum increase needed to \nachieve 60 percent over 10 years.\n  The $1.50 has the broad support of the health community, and it \ndeserves the broad support of the U.S. Senate as well.\n  In conclusion, I want to mention again what this issue is all about, \nand that is what this amendment will do for the young people of this \ncountry.\n  We have the $1.10 increase over a 5-year period that is in the \nmeasure that is before us this evening. The measure that we offer will \nraise the price of cigarettes by $1.50. The number of children whose \nlives will be saved by the cigarette price increase by $1.10, over what \nit would otherwise be, will be 1 million; increasing cigarettes by \n$1.50, an additional 1.25 million. There is for every 10 percent, some \n7-percent increase in reduced teenage smoking.\n  The difference from the $1.10 and the $1.50 is 750,000 in terms of \nthose teenagers who will smoke--750,000. Mr. Koop said today the new \nstudies would bring it up to 900,000. But we are talking between \n750,000 to 900,000 children, of which some 300,000 of those will die \nprematurely. We can save those children. We can save the 750,000 who \nwould otherwise smoke, and we can say to the 300,000 young people, the \nchildren in America today, ``We can save your lives as well.'' The \nquestion is, Are we willing to take that step to raise the cost by \n$1.50?\n  I certainly hope we will, Mr. President. I point out that even \nraising it by $1.50, we will be where most of the European countries \nare. Even with the $1.50 increase, the United States will be at $3.59; \nFrance at $3.50; United Kingdom at $4.40; Denmark at $5.10; and Norway \nat $6.82. We will be right in the middle of the industrial nations of \nthe world.\n  Let me say, the tobacco industry makes profits on all of those \ncountries. The tobacco industry makes generous profits from all of \nthese countries that are a good deal higher than even the $3.50, as \nwell as from the other countries.\n  Mr. President, this actually is a modest step, a very modest step, \nbut one that is necessary in order to protect the young people of this \ncountry. I hope we will do so tomorrow when the roll is called.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/19/senate-section/article/S5145-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
