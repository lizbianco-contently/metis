Mr. President, I will speak very briefly because I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], on the floor. But I \nwill reserve such time as I may need.\n  Mr. President, the Leahy-Hagel bill on antipersonnel landmines is the \nresult of years of work. I commend the Senator from Nebraska for his \nefforts in this. We have talked about the need to have a ban on these \nweapons, a need that is felt throughout the world, both by countries \nthat have used landmines, such as ours, and also by countries that have \nbeen devastated by what has become a plague of landmines. As I have \nsaid on the floor many times, this human disaster was described to me \nby a Cambodian I had in my office on a snowy winter afternoon at \nChristmastime in Vermont--one of the most beautiful times of year in \nour State--and it became far less beautiful as he said, ``We clear our \nlandmines in Cambodia an arm and a leg at a time.''\n  Fifty-seven Senators--Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, men and \nwomen alike--joined together last Thursday to introduce legislation to\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nban new deployments of antipersonnel landmines beginning in the year \n2000. Our purpose is to enable the United States to join other nations \naround the world that have already shown both the moral and strategic \ncourage and leadership by saying that they will ban unilaterally ban \nantipersonnel landmines. Senators like Bob Kerrey and John McCain, \nChuck Robb, and Max Cleland, decorated Vietnam veterans, along with \nSenator Hagel, know far better than I what landmines have inflicted on \nour own soldiers. Senator Hagel has even been injured by them.\n\n  All of us know that landmines have some marginal value, but so do \nchemical weapons. But we banned them. The problem with landmines is \nthat wars end, peace treaties are signed, armies march away, the guns \ngrow silent--but the landmines stay. To the child who steps on a mine \non the way to school a year after the peace agreement is signed, that \npeace agreement is no protection. To the farmer who cannot raise crops \nto feed his or her children because the fields are strewn with \nlandmines, that peace agreement is worth nothing. To the medical \npersonnel and humanitarian workers who cannot get polio vaccine to a \nvillage where it is needed because of the landmines, that peace \nagreement is useless.\n  What we have, Mr. President, is a weapon that has grown so grotesque, \nthe use of which has gotten so out of balance that most responsible \nnations are uniting in one voice to say: Stop the horror of landmines. \nThere are 100 million of them in the ground in some 68 countries that \nare waiting for a person to step on them and die, innocent civilians. \nThere were over 64,000 American casualties from landmines in Vietnam. \nIf that is not appalling enough, the majority of those landmines were \nbuilt here in the United States and were killing American men and women \nhalf way around the world. In Bosnia, 279 U.N. and NATO soldiers have \nbeen injured or killed by landmines. Every American casualty in Bosnia \nfrom enemy causes has been from a landmine. Then you have thousands of \ninnocent civilians that have lost arms, legs and so on.\n  Sixty-eight countries have a bridge to the 21st century, Mr. \nPresident, but that bridge is strewn with landmines. The United States \nhas the responsibility, as a moral leader, to help stop that. Great \nBritain, Canada, Germany, South Africa are all countries that can claim \na greater need for landmines than we can because they do not have the \npower of the United States. They have unilaterally renounced the use of \nthese landmines and are destroying stockpiles. But a White House \nofficial, who apparently has an extreme case of myopia--and I say that \nonly because in polite dialog we would not say he has an extreme case \nof stupidity--had the audacity to say that our legislation undermines \ntheir negotiations on a global ban rather than a unilateral measure.\n  Frankly, I don't think that he reflects the views of the President. I \nhave to tell you that this is the most asinine comment issued by the \nadministration yet on this issue. Why does the White House think a \ntreaty banning these weapons is going to be signed in Ottawa this \nDecember? Countries are coming together to sign a treaty banning \nantipersonnel mines in Ottawa, not because of the United States or \nbecause of this administration's negotiating strategy; to the contrary, \nthey are signing it in spite of the United States. While the United \nStates has sat on the sidelines and forsaken the kind of moral \nleadership we can bring, dozens of other countries have taken strong, \nunilateral action by renouncing the use of these weapons and are \npledging to sign a treaty in December. We showed great moral leadership \non the Chemical Weapons Convention and on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \nBut, Mr. President, far, far more civilians have died or have been \ninjured by landmines than nuclear weapons or chemical weapons. Every \nMember of this Senate who is a combat veteran from Vietnam is a \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  I have more to say, but the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, my \nchief cosponsor, is on the floor. I yield the floor to Senator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, I want to commend my distinguished colleague \nfrom Vermont for his leadership over the years. This has been an issue \nthat has been worked with some difficulty with a certain intenseness to \ndevelop, first of all, an awareness of the problem.\n  This is an issue that, like all difficult issues, should always come \nwith a certain amount of information. And through the process over the \nyears, Senator Leahy; my friend and colleague from Nebraska, Senator \nKerrey; and others, have been remarkable in their tenacity and their \neffort to focus on this issue of landmines. Today, I continue with my \nfriend from Vermont; my distinguished senior Senator, Bob Kerrey; and \nothers in our efforts to ban antipersonnel landmines. The legislation \nthat we are introducing this morning would permanently ban new \ndeployments of antipersonnel landmines.\n  Now, my colleague talked a little bit about why it is important. But \nI think there are a couple of primary reasons, Mr. President, that we \nowe this country the world leadership on this issue. First, America has \nalways taken the moral high ground over its brief 200-year history. \nThere is some debate and argument about the military necessity, the \nmilitary use, the viability of landmines. But as we enter a new \ncentury, a bold new century full of hope and promise, in my opinion--\nand I have some experience in this business--I do not really believe, \nnor do many former commanders and present commanders believe, that to \ncontinue to use antipersonnel landmines in our arsenal is in the best \ninterest of anyone.\n  So I take up this debate as a conservative Senator from Nebraska, a \ncombat veteran. There is no U.S. Senator in this body who supports more \nstrongly the U.S. military, what we must do to always arm our military, \nnever taking away the capabilities of our military. So I come at this \nas a very strong advocate of our national defense forces and the \nawesome responsibility our military has to protect our people and \nfreedom worldwide.\n  However, I believe the issue here regarding the banning of \nantipersonnel landmines is no longer the argument of whether we should \nor shouldn't. The issue now is when and how. I believe the time is now. \nThe time is now for this country and for this body to provide \nleadership, as so many other nations around the world are providing \nleadership on this issue.\n  We can change the face of warfare. We must not make the mistake in \nbelieving that this act alone will do away with landmines. It is a \nbeginning. We must understand and face the fact that there are over 110 \nmillion landmines in the ground today all over the world. This act \ntoday will not dig those 110 million mines up. But it is a beginning. \nIt is a moral beginning. It is a beginning that sends a message to the \nworld that we are a moral nation, that we will defend freedom as we \nalways have, and that we will defend the rights of individuals, but we \ndo not need indiscriminate killing machines like antipersonnel mines in \norder to defend those liberties.\n  Mr. President, there are colleagues other than Senator Leahy and I on \nthe floor, and I wish to ensure that they have time to express \nthemselves on this issue.\n  With that, I will summarize by saying that those of us in Congress--\nespecially those of us who have served in combat--have a responsibility \nto those Americans who now serve in our military to give our best \njudgment on all weapons systems, including landmines, to the future. We \nowe no less to the countless thousands of civilians, including many men \nand women who will yet suffer from the indiscriminate use of these \nweapons.\n  It is significant, as I see my friend and colleague, Senator Bob \nKerrey, the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, walk around \non the floor of the Senate, that my other five Vietnam combat veterans \nhave joined Senator Leahy and I in cosponsoring this important \ninitiative. It is time for America to lead.\n  Mr. President, thank you. I yield my time to Senator Leahy.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, could I have 5 minutes from either side \nto both speak to this issue and raise one other related issue?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am perfectly willing to, and I want to yield to the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nfrom Utah for that. We were sort of flipping side to side, if that will \nbe OK.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Absolutely. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the senior Senator from \nVermont and my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues Senator Leahy \nand Senator Hagel to express my strong support for a worldwide ban on \nthe use of land mines. Senator Leahy's bill, of which I am an original \ncosponsor, is an important step in this effort in that it will restrict \nthe use of funds for new deployments of U.S. anti-personnel land mines \nbeginning no later than January 1, 2000.\n  One only has to look at the statistics to realize that these weapons \ncarry a legacy that lasts far longer than the wars in which they were \nlaid. More than 26,000 people will be killed in the world this year by \nlandmines; the vast majority of these deaths will be civilians. In \nfact, every 22 minutes a man, woman, or child is killed or injured by a \nland mine. It is impossible to truly calculate the cost of 26,000 \ndeaths due to land mines in a single year.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there can be no better example of the \ndestructive nature of these weapons than Cambodia. It is estimated that \nover 10 million land mines remain in that country. After years of \nconflict and chaos, the people of Cambodia must still fear to walk \nalong footpaths or rice paddies; or to allow their children to play \nalong riverbeds or around villages. Mr. President, they have reason to \nbe afraid; current statistics show that 1 Cambodian in every 236 has \nlost an eye or a limb to a land mine.\n  Again, these are noncombatants, civilian individuals that are \nsuffering as a consequence of the indiscriminate placing of these \ndangerous weapons.\n  My interest in this issue also extends to not only protecting \ncivilians but protecting our own military forces.\n  The truth is, far too often the victims of these mines are the men \nand women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. The Department of Defense \nhas estimated that 33 percent of United States Army casualties in \nVietnam were caused by land mines. It is further estimated that 90 \npercent of those mines contained components made in the United States.\n  Today in Bosnia, the greatest threat to U.S. troops involved in the \nSFOR mission is not from hostile fire, but from the millions of land \nmines that were indiscriminately laid during the years of fighting in \nthat country. Mr. President, not only do I believe that we can continue \nto protect our national security without these weapons, I believe that \nridding the world of land mines would be a significant step toward our \nproviding greater protection to our forces stationed abroad.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his continued leadership in this \narea, because I believe the bill that we have sponsored is an important \nfirst step. However, it is also important for the United States now to \ntake the lead on a global scale. While I applaud President Clinton's \nsupport for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel land mines, I \nwould urge him to join our closest allies around the world by \nsupporting the so-called Ottawa process which seeks to negotiate a \ntreaty to ban land mines to be completed no later than December 1997. I \nfirmly believe that a treaty negotiated with U.S. leadership, and which \nwould include many countries where land mines have been used with \ndevastating results, would help to create the moral authority to \nestablish a global norm that would make these weapons unacceptable \nforever.\n  Again Mr. President, I believe now is the time for the U.S. exercise \nits leadership role in the world to stop the use of these devastating \nweapons.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Nebraska for \ntheir leadership on this issue. I hope that the President will change \nand begin to see the wisdom of adopting the Ottawa process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Nebraska \nand the Senator from Vermont for their leadership on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added to the bill as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, if I may, Mr. President, I would like to \ntake just a few minutes on a related but different subject. We have \nbeen talking about blowing people up here this morning with landmines. \nI would not intrude on that debate with another issue, except that it \nis hot off the press this morning.\n  Secretary Cohen has revealed that Chinese military companies have \nexported a dangerous new weapon to Iran. I have discussed this weapon \non the floor before. But this is a dangerous new development, and I \nwould like to call the attention of Senators to what Secretary Cohen \nhas revealed this morning.\n  We have here a drawing of the C-802 antishipping cruise missile that \nis designed by the Chinese on the basis of the Exocet missile. Here is \na picture of the U.S.S. Stark that was struck by an Exocet missile 10 \nyears ago, in which 37 American sailors were killed. The Stark was out \nof commission for a full year. Ten years later, the C-802 is considered \nto be a more lethal weapon than the one that struck the Stark.\n  Here is a picture of a Chinese freighter, on the fantail of which \nthey have loaded five missile boats which are being sent to Iran, each \none of them with missile launchers, and four tubes that can be used \nagainst American shipping in the gulf. I have shown this picture to the \nSenate before. I have also shown this next picture to the Senate, a \nland-based C-802 which has been exported to Iran by Chinese companies.\n  This morning Secretary Cohen told us that Chinese companies have \nadded a final dimension to their export. We have a picture from the \nChinese sales brochure of a helicopter equipped with the C-802, and the \nChinese sales brochure says: ``Air to Ship. The air-launched C-802, \nnamed C-801K, can be adapted to aircraft such as attackers and \nhelicopters.'' This picture out of the sales brochure shows this \nmissile as it has been exported to Iran.\n  Mr. President, there is a law against this kind of thing. It is \ncalled the Gore-McCain Act. Secretary Cohen now says that because of \nthe actions of Chinese companies, Iranian forces can threaten American \nservicemen and women literally from 360 degrees--land, water, and now \nair.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to the underlying legislation that we \nwill take up in just a few moments calling upon the administration to \nenforce the Gore-McCain Act against those Chinese companies that are \nexporting this technology to Iran in violation of American law. The \nSecretary of State has already invoked the other sanctions laws by \nbringing sanctions against Chinese companies that have exported poison \ngas to Iran. I want to, here, now, apply that same principle to the \nexportation of these missiles.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would not intrude on this debate on landmines \nwith this information if it had not just come up this morning with \nSecretary Cohen's announcement that this export has taken place and \nthat the dangerous new weapon is now has a dangerous new dimension in \nIran.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nvarious press releases on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Associated Press, June 1997]\n\n                    Cohen Says Iran Testing Missile\n\n                           (By Robert Burns)\n\n       Manama, Bahrain.--Iran's air force has conducted its first \n     test launches of a newly acquired anti-ship cruise missile, \n     Defense Secretary William Cohen disclosed today in arguing \n     that Iran is a threat to world commerce.\n       The United States is concerned about Iran's increasingly \n     sophisticated military\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\n     clout, particularly its arsenal of cruise missiles, Cohen \n     said at a news conference. Because they fly low, cruise \n     missiles are difficult to detect on radar.\n       ``Iran's words and actions suggest that it wants to be able \n     to intimidate its neighbors and to interrupt commerce in the \n     (Persian) Gulf,'' Cohen said. ``The United States will not \n     allow this to happen.''\n       The U.S. allies in the Gulf are urging a more accommodating \n     approach to Iran, despite U.S. misgivings. At each stop on \n     his five-nation Gulf tour, Cohen has stressed what he calls \n     Iran's threatening behavior and today said he had found the \n     Gulf states ``solidly united'' with the United States.\n       Iran has had shore-based cruise missiles for more than a \n     decade and last year acquired its first ship-launched \n     version, a Chinese-made missile called C-802. Now it has \n     begun testing a version that is fired from aircraft, Cohen \n     said.\n       A senior U.S. military officer who elaborated on Cohen's \n     disclosure on condition of not being identified by name told \n     reporters that Iran conducted an initial test of the air-\n     launched version on June 3 and a second test three days \n     later. The cruise missiles, called C-801K, were launched from \n     F-4 fighters, the officer said. He declined to predict when \n     they would be fully operational.\n       ``You have a 360-degree threat,'' the officer said, \n     referring to the combination of Iranian cruise missiles that \n     could be fired from land, sea or air.\n       Sophisticated radar aboard U.S. ships in the Gulf are \n     capable of detecting, identifying and tracking any cruise \n     missiles in Iran's arsenal, the officer said.\n       At his news conference, Cohen said the air-launched cruise \n     missile ``complicates somewhat'' the military operations of \n     U.S. forces in the Gulf, ``but not to the extent that it \n     can't be overcome.''\n       Bahrain and other U.S. allies in the Gulf have not made a \n     public issue of Iran's cruise missiles, but have long been \n     fearful of Iran's overall military strength.\n       Another senior American military officer, speaking Monday \n     on condition he not be further identified, said the moderate \n     Gulf countries are more optimistic than the Clinton \n     administration that the election in May of a more moderate \n     Iranian leader offers a chance to improve relations.\n       Cohen, on the other hand, has said the Clinton \n     administration will not ease its stance against Iran until \n     Iran ends its support for terrorism, gives up trying to \n     develop nuclear weapons and stops trying to undermine the \n     Middle East peace process. Iran denies such conduct.\n       After his news conference in Manama, Cohen flew today to \n     Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to meet with government \n     officials. He was winding up the day in Muscat, Oman, the \n     last stop on his Gulf tour.\n       At a news conference Monday morning in Kuwait City, Cohen \n     said it was too early to judge whether new Iranian President \n     Mohammad Khatami would bring demonstrable change. The United \n     States refuses to trade with Iran and has no diplomatic ties.\n       ``We would look favorably, obviously, upon changes that are \n     real, not simply paper promises,'' Cohen said, adding that he \n     remains to be convinced Iran will change. ``Iran continues to \n     pose a threat to the whole region,'' he said.\n       In Manama, in an unrelenting heat that topped 110 degrees, \n     Cohen strolled down a pier where three U.S. Navy ships and a \n     U.S. attack submarine were tied up. He chatted with sailors \n     and commanders and saw how a new remote-controlled \n     surveillance craft skims around the pier, scanning the \n     surface for potential security threats.\n       Aboard the USS Fitzgerald, a guided-missile destroyer home-\n     ported at San Diego and on its first-ever deployment, Cohen \n     heard the ship's commander explain current operations--\n     including Iraq embargo enforcement--by the 26 U.S. ships in \n     the area.\n       Cmdr. Charles Martoglio, the Fitzgerald's commanding \n     officer, told Cohen that the aircraft carrier USS \n     Constellation was operating in the northern Gulf near Iran's \n     territorial waters. He said Iranian land-based cruise \n     missiles could reach the Constellation in less than 10 \n     minutes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   [From the United Press International U.S. & World, June 17, 1997]\n\n                 Iran Tests Air-Launched Cruise Missile\n\n                           (By Eric Nordwall)\n\n       Manama.--Iran has successfully tested an air-launched \n     cruise missile, a development that officials say marks a \n     dramatic upgrade in its threat to American warships \n     controlling the Persian Gulf.\n       U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen made today's surprise \n     announcement at a news conference in Bahrain, where he was \n     visiting as part of a goodwill tour of Gulf states.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to retain the floor \nuntil such time as the Foreign Relations Committee Members are on the \nfloor and prepared to go forward, again with the assurance that I will \nyield the floor to them later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Vermont \nand my friend and colleague from Nebraska for their leadership on this \nvery important issue.\n  Mr. President, I am here to support, as an original cosponsor, the \nLeahy-Hagel landmine legislation, which would ban deployment of \nlandmines after January 1 of the year 2000. The fact that this \nlegislation has already acquired 56 cosponsors in the Senate is \ntestimony to the compelling force of their logic and their argument. We \nshould, in fact, ban landmines across the world, and we should begin \nwith this legislation.\n  Antipersonnel landmines have always been one of the greatest dangers \nfacing our troops--one of the most horrific weapons on the battlefield. \nIndeed, the only United States casualty we have sustained in operations \nin Bosnia was an individual who was killed by a landmine.\n  These landmines are scattered across the world. One hundred ten \nmillion active landmines are hidden in as many as 64 countries. And \nwhile 100,000 landmines a year are identified, deactivated and removed, \nanother 2 million to 5 million are planted. These landmines claim about \n2,000 victims a month. These are civilians. These are children. These \nare women. These are individuals who are not combatants but are simply \nat the wrong place at the wrong time.\n  In the military, there is a quite strict regime for using landmines: \nMapping them out, putting them in place, having the records so that, at \nthe conclusion of hostilities, they can be identified, deactivated, and \nremoved. But what has happened is that these landmines are now being \nused by renegade bands, by militias, by paramilitary units, and they \nare literally being scattered about those countries indiscriminately.\n  I was in the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia a few months ago visiting \nour troops and visiting Russians who are participating with us. \nLiterally within a few yards of the camp of these Russian soldiers is \nan area into which they cannot enter because it is strewn with \nlandmines. They are unidentified, unable to be removed. This is just \none example of the dangers that lurk because of the proliferation of \nlandmines throughout this world.\n  I hope that we will move aggressively to pass this legislation. It \nwill be a testament, I think, to those individuals who are sponsoring \nit. But also it will help highlight other initiatives that need to be \non the table. For example, in October 1996, Canada announced the goal \nof completing a treaty totally banning the use, production, and \nstockpiling of landmines by the year 2000. In addition to that effort, \ntwo months later the United Nations General Assembly, at the urging of \nthe United States, passed a resolution by a unanimous vote, to \nvigorously pursue a treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production and \ntransfer of antipersonnel landmines. These treaty negotiations will \nreceive, I think, tremendous impetus from the actions we take on this \nfloor.\n\n  I hope this bill will be passed quickly into law. I hope we can \nessentially begin here today to outlaw the use of landmines for the \nprotection, not only of our own forces, but for the hundreds of \nthousands of innocent civilians throughout the world who are, each day, \nsubject to the dangers of landmines. This will make the world safer. It \nwill not harm our military security. And it will give us, I think, a \ngoal and the momentum to move forward toward a more comprehensive \nlandmine ban.\n  Again I compliment and commend my colleagues, Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hagel, for their efforts and for their leadership on this \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Maine.\n  But I do want to note, this involves not just the Congress and other \ngovernments. Diana, Princess of Wales is in Washington today to support \nthe efforts of the American Red Cross in raising money to aid the \nvictims of landmines. I commend Elizabeth Dole, President of the \nAmerican Red Cross, and the Princess, for doing that. The Princess has \ndone so much, since she went to Angola and saw the terrible effects of \nlandmines there, to call attention to the plight of the victims and to \nspeak out in support of a global ban. What we all want to do, of \ncourse, is do everything possible to make sure that someday there will \nbe no such victims.\n  I yield to my good friend from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first let me say that I applaud the \nleadership and the determination of Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel to \nbring this very important issue of landmine deployment before the \nSenate. We speak today on behalf of people around the world whose lives \nare imperiled by deadly explosive devices each day as they till their \nfields, care for their livestock, or, most tragically of all, walk to \nschool. Antipersonnel landmines have been sown in the Earth in such \nnumbers and spread so broadly and indiscriminately over the planet that \nthey have become a very serious health and safety problem for \ncivilians. According to the International Red Cross, landmines kill or \nmaim someone, often children, every 22 minutes. There are an estimated \n100 million mines scattered throughout 68 nations. These weapons of \nterror inflict injury to little children, to farmers, and to our own \nservice men and women serving the cause of peace far from home. Thus \nfar, in Bosnia, landmines have injured more than 250 soldiers under \nUnited Nations or NATO command, and they have killed 29 peacekeepers. \nIn fact, landmines are responsible for every single death of American \ntroops in the Balkans.\n  I have cosponsored the Leahy-Hagel legislation because it is the \nright thing to do. Passing this legislation would be an act of moral \nleadership for this country. Although our attention may be focused on \nour own American men and women put in harm's way as international \npeacekeepers, the extent of the global epidemic of injury inflicted by \nthese devices is truly astounding and tragic. Each month, 800 people \nare killed and 1,200 others are maimed by small mines whose triggers \ncannot tell the difference between the foot of a child and the foot of \na soldier. As a Maine newspaper, the Kennebec Journal, pointed out in \nan editorial this weekend, the landmine is one of the most insidious \nand pernicious weapons ever created by man.\n  Across the globe, especially in Third World countries, landmines \nplaced during long-forgotten conflicts, some as much as a half-century \nago, continue to menace civilian populations. Senator Leahy's bill \nwould draw the line on the deployment of these weapons. This bill will \nhelp save the lives and limbs of American peacekeepers as well as of \nmany innocent children in countries around the world.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, who also wishes to speak about the Leahy-Hagel bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Nebraska for sponsoring this legislation. My own \nexperience in combat in Vietnam, having had over 100 of my men wounded \nand over 20 killed, seeing directly the impact of landmines and booby \ntraps, I know exactly the kind of devastation they can inflict. In my \ntravels around the world where landmines are a principal impediment to \nfarming and other civilian activities in areas where combat had been \npreviously conducted, I have seen its hideous effects, the maiming of \nmany, many individuals. I am pleased to join Senator Leahy and Senator \nHagel in this bipartisan effort to eventually eliminate antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  This legislation reflects a principled first step on our part to halt \nthe spread of these dangerous weapons. If an international consensus is \nto be achieved ultimately banning their manufacture and deployment, the \nUnited States will have to lead by example and restrict its own \nactivities in this area. During peacetime, most Americans reasonably \nassume that military weapons are safely stored away. That is not the \ncase, regrettably, with landmines. Many countries, particularly \ndeveloping countries, continue to actively lay mines with tragic \nconsequences. These devices indiscriminately kill or maim an average of \n70 individuals a week, or some 26,000 civilians annually. In Bosnia \nalone, over 250 soldiers of various countries have been injured by \nlandmines.\n  Mr. President, two-thirds of the Senate is formally on record \nsupporting a moratorium on our use of landmines. While this does not \nget to the heart of the issue, in my mind, beginning the process of \ndemining an estimated 100 or more million mines scattered across the \nworld today, and cutting off funds for new deployments, will sharpen \nthe debate on the utility derived from placing landmines, compared to \nthe damage they inflict.\n  I recognize this is a debate underway for expedited consideration of \na comprehensive ban treaty this year through what is known as the \nOttawa conference, or embracing the United Nations approach of \nnegotiating a multilateral agreement over a longer period of time. This \nlegislation steers clear of the controversy by formally endorsing \nneither, but noting each in hortatory language. Moreover, given the \nbelief of some that landmines continue to function as a useful \ndeterrent on the Korean Peninsula, the legislation creates a national \nsecurity exception for that particular situation.\n\n  We have a long way to go before we rid ourselves of these insidious \ndevices. Someday I look forward to considering a permanent and \ninternational treaty banning the production, stockpiling, sale, and use \nof these weapons. For now, the legislation proposed by Senator Leahy \nand Senator Hagel is a modest proposal, eliminating funding for new \ndeployments and, in my judgment, it heads us in the right direction and \nit has my full support.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I yield any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield as much time as necessary to the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the outset, let me say this is a \nserious matter and one in which I heartily concur with Senators Leahy \nand Hagel over the issue before us. In the recorded history of \nhumankind, there were many instances of conflict leading to wars of \ndevastation and great loss. Most people believe those wars come to an \nend, and with the end of the war there is at least some finality and \nsome peace. Those who have been injured, of course, carry those scars \nfor a lifetime. Those who lost their lives are remembered. Those who \nserved look back with sometimes horror, sometimes fondness, to the \nexperience.\n  We in the United States think at the end of the great wars, and after \nthe tickertape parades, the finality is finally evidenced by something \nas significant as a memorial. But what we are speaking of today is a \nlegacy of war that does not end. After the decisions are made, the \nforeign policy decisions which go awry and lead to a war or a conflict, \nthose decisions end up creating situations which live on forever. In \nthis case, we are dealing with a specific challenge and a specific \nissue of landmines.\n  In a visit to Central America about 7 years ago, I went to Costa \nRica, to a clinic which was being sustained by contributions from the \nUnited States. It was an orthopedic clinic where, primarily children, \nbut adults as well, were brought in to be fitted for orthopedic \ndevices. These are young men, children, young women who walked the \nstreets and the dusty roads in Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, \nand innocently stepped on a landmine and lost one of their limbs.\n  These were not combatants or soldiers, these were ordinary people. \nThe wars were over. Yet, for them, the war continued. Each and every \nday they faced hostilities, hidden hostilities in these landmines. We \nrallied, in the United States, as we do so often, to provide medical \nassistance, as we should.\n  The decisions of foreign policy that led to those conflicts meant \nnothing to these people, nothing whatsoever. The important thing is \nthat they had been maimed and had lost a limb because of that war and \nbecause of its legacy. Many of us think of someone losing a leg or a \nfoot and, of course, in the United States, assume they will go through \nrehabilitation, they will be fitted with some type of orthopedic \ndevice, and life will go on. But in a developing country, a poor \ncountry, that kind of injury can be devastating for a lifetime. People \nwho once had great potential can find themselves at that point \nrelegated to impoverishment, relegated to always being a ``cripple.'' \nWe take for granted that they will receive help, and many times they do \nnot.\n  There are now 110 million landmines in 64 countries around the world. \nThe conflicts which led to the planting of those landmines may have \nbeen long forgotten, but they still sit there, waiting for an innocent \ncivilian or passerby to come through and become a victim. The Leahy-\nHagel proposal is a good one, to put an end to this devastation and an \nend to this legacy of war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5719-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Members who have followed this debate will \nrecall that yesterday afternoon I offered\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nan amendment to the division C of this bill, that portion dealing with \nthe United Nations. Essentially, the task before the Senate, and before \nour Government as a whole, is how do we relate the United Nations as an \norganization we have supported, and one important to our foreign \npolicy. It is an international organization that has been under attack \nin this country. And, we have not paid our bills.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, the legislation before us attempts to \nremedy the situation over a 3-year period of time with 18 pages of very \nsubstantial conditions that must be met by the United Nations in order \nfor the United States debt repayment money to flow to that body.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. It substitutes \nfor the 18 pages of conditions in the bill my amendment which says \nthere are no conditions for our payment and we will, in fact, make the \npayment of $819 million in two installments in 2-years' time. The $819 \nmillion has been a sum the administration and the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has agreed that we owe. In addition, we would be receiving \napproximately $107 million back from the United Nations for \npeacekeeping services we have offered.\n  The two ideas before the Senate are important because this is a \nturning point of some significance in our foreign policy. In order to \nunderstand the amendment today and the bill that it amends, I think it \nis necessary to go back to square one and ask, why are we in such a \npredicament? How could the United States fail to pay the United Nations \nover $1 billion over the course of several years?\n  I think the answer, quite frankly, is that there has been a pervasive \nfeeling in the U.S. Senate which we, as Senators, thought were \nreflecting the country's antipathy to the United Nations, antipathy to \nbureaucracies and organizational inefficiencies. Many Americans have \nbeen told, at least in our Senate debates, that the United Nations \npreys upon the United States and that we are not in control. But, of \ncourse, the leadership the United States has exerted to obtain control \nof that body is certainly suspect.\n  Mr. President, to set the record straight at the outset, a number of \nnational polls have been taken that reflect a 2-to-1 majority of \nAmericans believing the United Nations is very important and that we \nought to pay our bills. The polling data goes for many years, but I \nfound especially instructive a poll that indicated on the question: \n``Do you believe that U.N. member states should always pay their full \ndues to the U.N. on schedule, or should a state hold back its dues to \npressure other members to agree to changes it believes are needed?'', \nAmericans, in a Wirthlin Group poll in 1989 conducted for the United \nNations Association, 60% of Americans responded that we should always \npay the United Nations, pay other countries, whoever. Only 14 percent \nsaid you ought to hold back.\n  In April 1996 jumping about 7 years ahead, 78 percent of Americans \nbelieve that a nation should always pay; 13 percent believe you ought \nto be able to hold back.\n  The American public understands what is fair. They understand what a \ncontract is, what our obligations are as a nation.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, they understand the work the United \nNations does, and by an overwhelming majority, the public believes we \nshould not only stay in the United Nations but, as a matter of fact, in \na polling item of a Times Mirror poll, the question was, ``Do you agree \nor disagree with the following statement: The United States should \ncooperate fully with the United Nations?,'' 65 percent of Americans \nagree, 29 percent disagree--well over two-thirds.\n  I make that point because I believe we have come to this particular \npass because public servants believe somehow it is popular to withhold \nmoney from the United Nations; to, in essence, say to the United \nNations, ``Reform, repent or we will not pay our dues.''\n  This is understandable, and the amount of reform needed by the United \nNations is sizable. The new Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has \nsupported the United States, who has come to visit with our own Foreign \nRelations Committee, has not only pledged to make reforms, he is doing \nthat job. Our Ambassador, Mr. Richardson, will have a full-time job \nworking with him to make certain that occurs.\n  There are 184 nations involved. We are one of them, ostensibly the \nmost powerful of those nations. Essentially, we are going to have to \nwork with that bureaucracy to pare it down, to pare the budget down. \nThe signs of progress are promising.\n  Let me make a major point I hope Members will follow. Of the more \nthan $1 billion the United States agrees that we owe, only 5 percent \nhas anything to do with the bureaucracy, the Secretariat of the United \nNations, only 5 percent, some $54 million.\n\n  Now, if Members ask, ``Well, then, what is the argument about?'' The \nargument is about $650 million or so of peacekeeping expenses that were \nassumed by our allies for which the United Nations is simply a \npassthrough for money that we, the United States of America, said we \nwould pay and now we owe to friendly countries.\n  Let me cite, so it is not obscure, who we owe money to. We owe money \nto France, $60.1 million; we owe Great Britain $41 million; the \nNetherlands $21.3 million; Pakistan $20.1 million; Germany $18.3 \nmillion we owe; Belgium $17.3 million; Italy $17.2 million; India $16.1 \nmillion; Canada our near neighbor, $14.2 million. This is money we owe \nto them, not to Kofi Annan, the Secretary General, or the U.N. \nSecretariat or the organization so frequently criticized on the floor \nof this body. We owe more than $650 million to other countries who sent \ntheir troops out to do work that we wanted them to do. We voted for the \npeacekeeping resolutions. We said we would send money if they would \nsend men and if they would take on the fighting obligations, or at \nleast the dangers that were involved in often hazardous duty that went \nbeyond simple peacekeeping. That is the money, Mr. President, that is \nat risk.\n  I am not certain Senators understand that we are, in essence, saying \nto our allies, we will not pay you unless you change the dues structure \nfor us, for the United States. In essence, we not only have failed to \npay our allies, but we have said, as a matter of fact, we are not going \nto pay you. This bill says we won't pay you unless you reduce our U.N. \ndues to only 20 percent of the budget, as opposed to 25 percent, and \nunless you reduce our peacekeeping dues to 25 percent as opposed to \naround 31 percent. Unilaterally, arbitrarily, take it or leave it. That \nis what is proposed in the legislation in front of us.\n  In addition, the legislation, Members will note if they read through \nthe 18 pages of agate type, has at least 38 conditions and hoops other \ncountries and the United Nations must go through in order for us to pay \nour debts.\n  Mr. President, it is strange that we came to this situation through, \nI think, a misperception of who ought to be paid. Most Americans who \nunderstand we owe Great Britain, France, Canada, and Italy, will say, \n``Why haven't we paid?'' And most Americans would understand that our \nfailure to pay will have consequences because we are dealing with these \nsame nations in NATO reform and NATO expansion in trying to determine \nwhat the fair shares will be. We are dealing with most of these \ncountries every day in terms of agricultural exports which are very \ndifficult bread-and-butter issues for America. Yet, we take an \narbitrary position with regard to the United Nations that we simply \nwill not pay until they go through the hoops of implementing the \nreforms we insist upon in this bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Excuse me. Will the Senator yield for a question on one \npoint on my time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator's amendment calls for the payment of $819 \nmillion over 2 years; is that correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That's correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How would the Senator's amendment pay our allies any more \nmoney than our mark, than this legislation does?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond to the distinguished Senator by pointing out, I \nhave doubts under the bill we are about to pass that very much money \nget through the United Nations to our allies. The money will most \ncertainly get to our allies through my amendment. I suspect, if the \nother conditions that are in title XXII are imposed, the odds are slim \nthat the money will get through.\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, I am sorry, I \ndidn't phrase the question well and clearly enough. Even if the money \ngets through, as the Senator is suggesting his amendment would \naccommodate, how would the Senator's amendment fully fund and pay the \narrearages the Senator believes we owe our allies? Is there enough \nmoney in the Senator's amendment to fully pay the money the Senator \nbelieves that we owe our allies through the United Nations as it \nrelates to the United Nations peacekeeping?\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will respond to the Senator by saying the money paid to \nour allies is our assumption of how much we owe. It is based upon the \n$1.021 billion that the administration and the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has agreed is the sum we owe. Many of our allies believe we \nowe a lot more.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield again, but the Senator's \namendment only provides $819 million, not $1.021 billion. What I am \nconfused about is, how does the Senator's amendment in this regard \ndiffer from the bill that the chairman and I have brought before the \nSenate?\n  We have $819 million in our bill, which you don't like, nor do I, and \nthe fact that we make the United Nations meet benchmarks before it is \nreleased. But assuming it was released, how does the Senator's \namendment provide any more money to pay the arrearages that the Senator \nbelieves that we owe?\n  Mr. LUGAR. My amendment would not provide more money. It simply \nprovides certainty that payment is received at all. Let me just \ncontinue--\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The distinguished Senator from Delaware yesterday, in \nresponding to a similar argument that I have made today, made the point \nthat, all things considered, he agrees that we ought to pay our debts, \nthat we ought to respond to our contractual obligations, that, in the \nbest of all worlds, this is a principled stand, as I recall his \ndescription of it. But the Senator from Delaware said the trail that I \nam following leads to no payment.\n  Now, if I were to ask with some incredulity why a fairly \nstraightforward amendment adopted by the Senate--obviously the House \nmust act and the President must sign the bill--why my course will lead \nto zero, as the Senator from Delaware characterized it. It is because, \nas the Senator from Delaware pointed out, he has been negotiating with \nthe chairman of the committee and the chairman of the committee has \nsaid, in essence, we are not going anywhere without accommodation of \nthese conditions--at least that was the characterization. Essentially, \nhe was saying that we have gone nowhere for several years, and that we \nhave accumulated debts and will continue to accumulate debts.\n  In short, the distinguished Senator from Delaware said, and he \ndescribed, very candidly, the negotiations that he came to the chairman \nsuggesting a sum of money the administration felt we owed, and the \nchairman took a very adverse view to that. The Senator from Delaware \nhas been negotiating for quite a long while in trying to get that \nfigure up.\n  The Senator from Delaware finally comes to the body yesterday and \nsays essentially, ``This is the best I can do. In essence, hopefully, \nthese conditions will be met. Countries, in fact, will meet them and \nthe money will flow, $100 million in the first year fairly easily,'' as \nthe Senator characterized, ``and it gets tougher in the second and \nthird years. But, nevertheless, somehow this is going to occur.'' That \nis the judgment Senators have to make.\n  I will just say very frankly, Mr. President, that we ought to face \nthe situation in a much more straightforward way, because this debate \nhas not occurred in private, nor have our failures to pay our debts \noccurred in private. It is a very public embarrassment in which the \nUnited States of America is stiff-arming our friends, quite apart from \nwhatever damage we are doing to the United Nations. If, in fact, we \nwant to get out of the United Nations, withdraw from it, saying \nessentially this is a group of people constantly preying upon us and we \nare tired of that, that is one basic decision Senators might want to \nmake. I am suggesting, Mr. President, this bill veers very close to \nmaking that decision for us.\n\n  What if the rest of the world, 183 nations, decides that our \narbitrary decision here in the Senate is not really where they want to \ngo? What if the United Nations goes bankrupt? What if our allies no \nlonger trust us with regard to peacekeeping, fearing they will not be \npaid any more than they have been in the past? What if, as a matter of \nfact, other nations begin to doubt our word and our ability to follow \nthrough on contractual obligations we undertake? There is a lot at \nstake, Mr. President.\n  It could very well be that there are some Senators who would say, \n``We ought to take advantage of our size and weight in the world now. \nThere's no point in worrying about the sensitivities of other nations. \nWe're paying 25 percent of the dues. Our share of the world's wealth \nright now is about 27 percent, but we don't want to pay that, we want \nto pay 20 percent. We're not going to take any fuss from any other \nnation about that.''\n  We're going to pay 20 percent of the U.N. dues arbitrarily. Not only \nthat, we are going to take our peacekeeping from 31 percent to 25 \npercent of the budget. It is too high to begin with. We are tired of \npaying that. We will pay that, take it or leave it. In essence there \nare two ``take it or leave its,'' Mr. President, as the Senator from \nDelaware characterized the debate yesterday. In essence he has said to \nthe Senate that we either take it or leave it or there will not be any \npayment at all. The chairman will not agree to it.\n  Second, after we get through this process, we say to the rest of the \nworld, ``Take it or leave it, because there won't be any payment unless \nyou take our word for what we want to pay and under the conditions that \nwe want to pay it.''\n  In essence, Mr. President, this is not very good foreign policy. It \nis not really a very good stance for the United States at all. I will \nsimply say, what will be the predicaments if we get our way and \narbitrarily reduce our dues, and countries either get their moneys or \nthey don't. I predict, Mr. President, the ramifications of this are \nlikely to be very expensive for the United States.\n  Not only is it the right thing to do to pay our debts, it is in fact \nthe most effective way of being persuasive at the United Nations to \nbring about reforms that we want there.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that not all Senators have followed all \nof the debate as extensively as those who have been debating this \nyesterday and today. But let me say already there is some doubt as to \nprecisely what this bill has to say.\n  For example, the Washington Post of Saturday, June 14, 1997, \nsuggested that Ambassador Richardson and our own colleague, Senator \nGrams of Minnesota, went to the United Nations on Saturday, after our \nmarkup on Thursday, and, according to John Goshko of the Post: They \ndenied that Congress wants to ``micromanage the United Nations,'' and \nthey insisted that the plan is ``not a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition.'' Instead, they said it is a set of ``suggestions'' aimed \nat helping the United Nations become, as Grams said, ``the best United \nNations it can be.''. . .\n  The two officials' assertions that the conditions or so-called \nbenchmarks in the plan are only suggestions ran counter, according to \nthe article, and also according to remarks by Chairman Helms on \nThursday.\n\n  Quoting Senator Helms:\n\n       This bill will prohibit the payment by the American \n     taxpayers of any so-called U.N. arrears until these \n     congressionally mandated benchmarks have been met by the U.N.\n\n  Then another quote from Senator Helms:\n\n       The message to the U.N. is simple but clear: no reform, no \n     American taxpayer money for arrears.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, in the Washington Times, Senator Grams is quoted \nas saying:\n\n       ``These are broad suggestions,'' said Sen. Rod \n     Grams, Minnesota Republican, architect of the reform \n     package and U.S. delegate to the United Nations. ``We're \n     not going to micromanage the U.N. by any means.''\n       At a press conference yesterday, both [Ambassador \n     Richardson and Mr. Grams] took pains to soften the edges of a \n     bill most here see as an imperious ``take it or leave it'' \n     offer. Mr. Grams plans to spend time at the United Nations \n     this summer, selling the package to foreign envoys [according \n     to the Washington Times of June 14, 1997].\n\n  So already, Mr. President, while we are debating the bill, our \nAmbassador\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nand a distinguished colleague are at the United Nations saying we are \nmaking some helpful suggestions that we do not want to micromanage. But \nback here at the Congress, the word is no reform, and according to the \n18 pages of conditions in this legislation, no money.\n  Senators will have to make up their minds. The suggestion has been \ntwo ``take it or leave its,'' in my own view. This is the reason I \npresented the amendment. We have obligations. In a straightforward way \nwe ought to meet them.\n  As the Senator from Delaware suggested in his question this morning, \nthe amounts of money in this bill are clearly in dispute. But I accept \nthe fact that the U.S. Government, both in its legislative and \nadministrative branches, estimates we owe $1.021 billion. After various \ndeductions, $819 million is on the table to be disbursed in both the \nForeign Relations Committee bill and in my amendment.\n  But there is a large difference in how the dispersal occurs, a very \nlarge difference in our attitude to other countries, our friends in the \nrest of the world, and a very large difference in our presumptions \nabout the United Nations and its usefulness to us.\n  Finally, Mr. President, word came yesterday in a debate that the \nUnited States of America has loaned countries a lot of money. We have \nspent a lot of money helping them defend themselves. And indeed we \nhave. Our foreign policy frequently--frequently--tries to make sure the \nfrontiers of conflict are as far away from our country as possible. We \nhave given a lot of military aid to others who we hoped would fight our \nbattles as our allies or as front lines for us. And that was prudent \nfor us to do.\n  But now we come to a situation, Mr. President, in which the United \nStates said we do not want to be involved in these front line \nactivities, or certain peacekeeping chores that were controversial, but \nwhich we think ought to be done. We voted for them. We sent others \nforward. We said we would pay. And now we have not paid nor will we pay \nunless the United Nations and the members in it reduce our dues, and \nunless they go through the hoops of even such suggestions that \ninternational conferences of the United Nations could be held in only \nfour cities. We even dictate the cities in which the conference might \noccur.\n  Members will be astonished, as they read through all the conditions, \nwhat is involved. But Members should read soon because we will have a \nvote shortly this afternoon on this amendment. I believe it is a \ncritical vote for American foreign policy. I hope the Senators will \nsupport my amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield such time as I have.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 40 seconds left \nunder his time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I rise in very strong support of this amendment. The \nSenator from Indiana stated the arguments in a very cogent and, I \nthink, persuasive fashion.\n  Mr. President, we just celebrated 50 years of the Marshall Plan. A \ncouple of years ago we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the \nestablishment of the United Nations. If you read that history, what is \nclear is the marked contrast between the United States' attitude at the \nend of World War II, at which time we demonstrated strong leadership, \nand the attitude that is reflected in this legislation.\n\n  This legislation imposes a host of arbitrary and burdensome \nconditions on the United Nations. If the United Nations fails to \nachieve them, I am sure the argument will be made, ``It's too bad they \ndidn't accede to the conditions we were imposing, and therefore it's \ntheir fault that we're not paying these arrears.'' Yet, I remind my \ncolleagues, these are arrears which we clearly owe and which we have \nbuilt up over the years.\n  This approach goes directly contrary to the one that was reflected in \nthe exercise of American leadership in both the United Nations and the \nMarshall plan--an approach which I think ought to characterize our \npolicy toward the United Nations today.\n  I think the able Senator from Indiana has rendered a distinct service \nby focusing the attention of the Senate on this issue. I very much hope \nmy colleagues will support his amendment. It relates solely to payment \nof arrearages, to dues we already owe. We agreed to pay them under the \nCharter of the United Nations. Now we are saying, ``Well, if you want \nus to pay our past dues, you've got to agree to reduce our future \ndues.''\n  Now, I support an effort to reduce our future dues, but I do not \nthink it ought to simply be imposed through this unilateral action on \nthe part of the United States.\n  The United Nations serves important interests of ours. I think it is \ncritical for the United States to help sustain and preserve a strong \nUnited Nations. I very much hope that the amendment of the Senator from \nIndiana will be adopted.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself as much time as I am able to consume. I \nthink I have about 20, 25 minutes left, in that range.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to state the obvious, there are no two \nSenators of whom I have higher regard than the two Senators who are \nproposing this amendment. We use those kinds of phrases around here, \nbut I know they both know that I mean it.\n  Now, I have a little difficulty with their approach here, not the \nprinciple that they are proposing, because, as I said from the outset \nand as the chairman will tell you repeatedly, and I suspect the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, who is on the floor, may tell you, and I know our \nnew colleague from Nebraska will tell you, I am not one who thinks we \nshould be attaching conditions. I am a minority in that view, along \nwith my two colleagues, but I am not one who thinks we should be \nattaching conditions. So I agree with them on that.\n  But I do think they overplay the point a bit in making it appear as \nthough the Senator from North Carolina has in effect co-opted the \nSenator from Delaware into signing on to these conditions and that this \nis something totally new. Let me remind people of a few historical \nfacts about conditions.\n  I have here--and I will ask in a moment that I be able to submit this \nfor the Record--the number of occasions on which the U.S. Congress or \nRepublican or Democratic Presidents have withheld the payment of moneys \nto the United Nations that were duly owed because of policy decisions \nmade by our Government, notwithstanding the fact that we owed it, that \nwe would not pay our dues unless the United Nations changed their \nview--conditions, conditions.\n  I will just list them all. The PLO and Palestinian-related condition \nthat we withheld funds of $16,556,000 because we voted on this floor--I \ndo not know how my colleagues voted, but I bet they voted the same \nway--we voted on this floor to say that as long as the PLO was getting \na special kind of treatment in the United Nations, which we viewed to \nbe unfairly against the interest of our ally Israel, we were going to \nwithhold funds. That is $16.556 million. SWAPO. Remember old SWAPO? \nWell, we had that. You know, that was the debate relating to Southern \nAfrica, Angola, South Africa, et cetera. We withheld $68 million. The \nLaw of the Seas preconference, another policy dispute, we withheld \n$7.56 million. The South African-Israel conference, we withheld \n$200,000. The Kasten amendment, we withheld $1,300,000. The \nappropriations shortfall of fiscal years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and \n1996 accounts for $168.64 million, there was those--anyway I will go \nback over this. The deficit-reduction plan withheld $12,860,000. The \nKassebaum-Solomon amendment withheld $42 million. And it goes on.\n\n  Guess what? We withheld, based on conditions that this body or \nRepublican or Democratic Presidents placed on the United Nations, \n$164,111,000. So of the arrearages, this body was complicit in over \n$100 million of those arrearages. Now, all of a sudden they look at the \nSenator from North Carolina and me and say, ``Oh, my lord,\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nwhat are you doing? You're attaching conditions?'' Mea culpa, mea \nculpa, mea maxima culpa.\n  I did not think we should attach conditions then or now. But this is \nnot anything new. And so of the money that we say is owed--our \nadministration says we owe $1.021 billion, and the United Nations says \nwe owe $1.361 billion. Of that, $1.021 billion, $164 million of it is \npreviously attached conditions.\n\n  Now, I would like my colleagues who think we should not attach \nconditions to look at this list, stand on the floor and acknowledge why \nwe should not have done any of this, and how they voted on it. I do not \nknow how they voted on it. I do not even know how I voted on every one.\n  So, I am a little bit surprised at the manner in which this argument \nis being presented as if oh, my lord, we are about to do this awful \nthing we have never done before, and the United Nations is going to \ncrumble when we do it. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, how did I arrive at $819 million, to badger my friend from \nNorth Carolina to say I would not sign on to this unless it got to $819 \nmillion? The way I arrived at that number--there is nothing original on \nmy part--I asked the administration, what do we need to pay our \nfriends, and what do we need to meet our obligations?\n  Let me tell you, and this gives my friend some ``agitato'' here, as \nthey say in the Italian communities in my State, let me tell you what I \nunderstand the facts to be. Let me point out that my friend from \nMaryland and my friend who is the leader of this effort, Senator Lugar \nfrom Indiana, are not providing one more penny than I am providing. So \nthis is all about principle. You ought to come and ask for all the \nmoney because you are doing the same thing I am doing, trying to get \nthe best deal you can--not that either one of them have suggested that \nwhat I am doing is unprincipled, I just point out that their approach \nis no more or less principled than what I am suggesting. We are trying \nto get a job done. They do not provide one more penny.\n  Now, how did they arrive at my $819 million? Why did they not arrive \nat $1.021 billion like they say we need? Because they know what I know, \nthat $819 million will pay our allies. Now, let's go back and talk \nabout how it is owed and what is owed. Peacekeeping arrears--that we \nacknowledge, the President acknowledges, and even if we paid more \nmoney, the President would not pay any more of it--peacekeeping arrears \namounts to $658 million; regular budget arrears amounts to $54 million; \narrearages in specialized agencies amounts to $254 million; and arrears \nto international organizations amount to $55 million. Let me repeat \nthat now: Peacekeeping $658 million; regular budget, $54 million; \nspecialized agencies, $254 million; and international organizations, \n$55 million.\n  Now, I share the same concern my friend from Indiana does. However, \nif we appropriate $819 million the way the Senator from North Carolina \nand I are proposing, there are relatively easy conditions that have to \nbe met the first 2 years. Let me make sure everybody remembers. The \nfirst year, we get about $100 million, and the second year we are up to \n$475 million. The United Nations owes us $107 million, and the United \nNations will pay the United States from a tax equalization fund, $27 \nmillion. Now, you got that? I do not want to turn this into a math \nclass but I want to be simple--these numbers are real important. Mr. \nPresident, $100 million goes out the first fiscal year this takes \neffect; $475 million the second year; the United Nations owes us, we \nsay, $107 million for peacekeeping; and $27 million for the tax \nequalization. You add up all that money and it pays virtually every \nsingle penny that we owe to all of our allies for peacekeeping and the \nonly thing it does not do in the first 2 years is it does not pay what \nwe are said to owe to an international organization called UNIDO, the \nU.N. Industrial Development Organization, from which we have formally \nwithdrawn. The Senator from Maryland, the Senator from Indiana, the \nSenator from Delaware, and the Senator from New Hampshire did not say \nyou had to withdraw from it. The President withdrew. Ambassador \nRichardson delivered the papers and said, ``We're out.'' That is the \nonly organization we do not have the money to pay but we are already \nout of it.\n  So, come on. Come on. I do not like doing it this way either, but it \ndoesn't come out the way you all are saying it comes out. Our allies \nhave nothing to fear. They reason they are not squawking, the reason \nthere are not yelling out there, the reason neither the United Nations \nnor the Secretary-General is holding a protest and jumping up and down \nand screaming, is because they know and we know and the administration \nknows that the money in year 1 and year 2 combined with the money owed \nus will pay the deal, will meet our obligations.\n\n  Now, the last point I will raise, and I will not use all my time \nbecause others wish to speak, the last point I will raise are these \nconditions. Let me just tick off what the conditions are that the \nchairman has graciously agreed will be the ones required in the first 2 \nyears to allow all of the money I just mentioned to be released. I may \nlose his vote if I keep pointing this out, but these are the facts.\n  First, a very difficult condition in the first year, the United \nNations has to acknowledge, we have to acknowledge, the President has \nto acknowledge that our sovereignty will not be diminished by \nmembership in the United Nations. That is a very difficult condition to \nmeet. Come on. Come on. That is the first condition for the first year. \nThen we have to get the United Nations to reduce--and they say they can \ndo this--our regular budget assessment from 25 to 22 percent, 25 to 22 \npercent in year 2, not year 1, year 2. So, we have 2 years to get that \ndone. I might add, it was Ambassador Richardson testifying before our \ncommittee that said it should be 20 percent, Madeleine Albright said it \nshould be 20 percent, the President has said it should be 20 percent. \nWe did not pick 20 percent out of the air. Granted, I would rather it \nnot be a mandate, but this is not something we are making up out of \nwhole cloth. This is what this administration thinks is a fair \nassessment. They do not want us to mandate it, but they acknowledge it \nis fair. Now, roughly $709 million in the first 2 years would be \navailable.\n  Another condition met which we already have unilaterally done and our \nallies have acknowledged is that we have been assessed 30 percent for \npeacekeeping. We do a whole heck of a lot of peacekeeping around the \nworld and no one else chips in on it at all. We say that is too high, \nit should be 25 percent. The administration says that is not a problem, \nwe can get it down there. So that is another condition. We only pay 25 \npercent, not from this point on, but from 2 years out. From that point \non, 25 percent for peacekeeping.\n  The administration says in testimony that these are easy conditions \nto meet. This is not something we are asking them to jump through some \nhoop they cannot meet. Now, when the condition of sovereignty, which is \nrestating the obvious, when the condition of 22 percent for our annual \ndues, and when the condition of 25 percent for peacekeeping are met, \nand they have 2 years in which to meet that, all the money needed to \npay all our allies, all the money we owe them will be released.\n  So what is the deal here? Neither of my colleagues said this, but \nsome have written that somehow I have made this pact with the ultimate \nenemy of the United Nations to undermine the United Nations and we are \njust going to rip its throat out and so on and so forth, and we \ncompromised. And isn't that a horrible thing? Look, anybody who comes \nover here looking to be bathed in the waters of legislative purity, \nSenator Lugar's amendment does not help you a bit, because he jumps \nright into that swamp with the rest of us. He is not asking for the \n$1.3 billion that the United Nations says we owe. He is not asking for \n$1.021 billion, the amount the administration says we owe. He is asking \nfor the same amount of money that the chairman of the committee and I \nare asking for. So much for the notion of paying everything they say we \nowe.\n  Now, there is a distinction, you should be aware of when you vote. \nThe distinction is that there are mandates in there, all of which can \nbe met, and, in my view, reasonably can be met and should be met. I \nwould rather not mandate them. That is the matter of principal \ndistinction between the Senator and I. I would rather not mandate\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\nthem, but they are mandated. Now, understand what the Senator from \nNorth Carolina has done here, and again I'm not being facetious when I \nsay this, and maybe it is not helpful to point out what he has done, he \nhas been eminently reasonable. In the first distribution scheme we had \nfor this $819 million, in the first distribution scheme we had, the way \nit was laid down is there would be $100 million, there would have been \n$419 million, and then the remainder in the third year. I went to him \nand said, look, I need $475 million in that second year, and he said \nOK, as the final element of compromise. The reason I needed $475 \nmillion was to do just what I just laid out for you. So there is a \ndistinction.\n\n  The Senator from Indiana says it all gets paid out of the $819 \nmillion and paid out in 2 years and he is worried about our allies. I \nam saying we pay out the $710 million if they meet the conditions in \nthe first 2 years and all our ally obligations are met. This is a \ndistinction without a gigantic difference here. There is, as they might \nsay, much ado about something, but it ain't much.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield.\n  I want to save 4 minutes for my friend from Virginia. I have how much \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Where does the Senator get the $710 million?\n  Mr. BIDEN. In three places. I get $100 million the first year, $475 \nmillion the second year on the arrearages.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator said we would have----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am going to explain that, I will tell you where I get \nthe rest.\n  I get $107 million from the money the United Nations acknowledges \nthey owe the United States for peacekeeping, and I get $27 million for \nmoney that the United Nations owes the United States for tax \nequalization.\n  That is how I get it. It is not out of the $819.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Where do I find this in the bill?\n  Mr. BIDEN. You find it in acknowledgments. It does not have to be in \nthe bill. They owe us $107 million for peacekeeping and $27 million for \ntax equalization. That is money the administration has to use to meet \nits obligations.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So these figures that are in the bill on page 180--$100 \nmillion, $475 million, and $244 million--are correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely correct, but I was making the point in response \nto the question will there be enough money to pay our allies in the \nfirst 2 years? And the answer is yes because of the $575 million out of \nthis bill and roughly $134 million that is owed to us.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, how does that enable them to pay our allies?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It's very simple.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They are operating on a deficit now. So if we forgive \ntheir debt to us, how does that give them money to pay our allies?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The reason is because, just like when the bank owes you \nmoney, they owe you money--the question is how much we owe them. You \nare saying we owe them $1.370 billion. My time is running out. Maybe \nlater the Senator from North Carolina might yield me a few minutes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for my friend from Virginia, \nSenator Robb. I am out of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have three Senators on the floor wishing to speak. I ask \nthem to stay as close as they can to 5 minutes. If they need to go a \nlittle over that, fine. First, Senator Hagel of Nebraska, then Senator \nGregg of New Hampshire, and Senator Grams of Minnesota, all three of \nwhom have been so helpful in the creation and production of this bill.\n  I yield to Senator Hagel and then automatically the floor is yielded \nto the other two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I will be brief, Mr. President. I know there are others \nwho want to speak on this issue. There is an old North Carolina adage \nthat goes like this: Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.\n  The Senator has heard that, I know. I think that is what we are \ntalking about this morning. This is rather remarkable. What has been \npieced together over 5 months of very diligent effort, leadership, and \nhard work, making something work based on a bipartisan foreign policy \neffort and a commitment made by Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, \nSecretary of State Albright, and the administration, who all have \nworked very hard on this. When you add to that Senator Grams from \nMinnesota, as the subcommittee chairman, who has put his imprimatur and \nworked hard and given his leadership to this effort, this is a \nremarkable effort.\n  Mr. President, I don't know about you or other Senators in this body, \nbut for years and years, as a private citizen, as a taxpayer, and as a \nbusinessman, I would hear constantly, and I have heard over the last 2 \nyears during my campaign: What about the United Nations? What are we \ndoing? The United Nations says we owe money. Do we owe money? How much? \nWhat about the peacekeeping efforts? Are our peacekeeping dollars \ncounted? How do we account for that? Isn't it true that we put American \nmen and women in harm's way and we paid the bill and we are in Bosnia \nand all over the globe?\n  So what is the correct way to assess our dues, our commitment to this \nvery important organization? The debate, ladies and gentlemen--don't be \nmistaken here--is not whether the United Nations is good, bad, or \nwhether we want to be in it or not. Of course it is good. The world is \nbetter because of the United Nations. But we need to get this issue \ncleared up. We need to take the negotiations that have been held by the \nleaders in this and hold negotiations. I think it was rather evident in \nour committee hearings and the subsequent markup of this bill last \nweek, when it was reported out 14 to 4. It said to me that, in fact, \nbipartisanship is in effect and, in fact, the commitment made by the \nadministration and Senators Biden, Helms, and others, will make this \nwork. We need to get this behind us and we need to address this issue. \nI think it is a fair resolution to the issue. We can then work on the \nbigger issues that this country and the world must face as we move into \na bold, new century.\n  Big issues. We have trade issues. We have treaty issues. I, for one, \nam not one Senator who wants to go back and replay this. I say this \nwith the greatest respect for Senator Lugar and others who have been \ninvolved in this. Hardly an individual in this body is as aware and \nprovided as much leadership on foreign relations as Senator Lugar. But \nI think the time is now to make what we came up with--the good effort \nof bipartisan leadership--the bill that we move forward with and, \ntherefore, allowing this body, the committee, and all those responsible \nfor policy in this country, as we move into the next century, the \nfreedom to focus on that. I rise today in strong support of the Helms-\nBiden bill. I hope my colleagues will take what I and my colleagues \nhave said this morning into consideration as they vote today.\n\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Nebraska and the \nSenator from North Carolina and the Senator from Delaware and the \nSenator from Minnesota in endorsing this really excellent effort that \nhas been developed through a great deal of negotiation between the \nSenators from North Carolina and Delaware, the Secretary of State, the \nAmbassador to the United Nations, the Senator from Minnesota, and the \nmajority leader.\n  This effort was not easy. There were a lot of disagreements as to how \nwe should address the U.N. arrearages issue. I am speaking from the \nperspective of the Appropriations Committee, where I chair the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over the funding of the United Nations. \nFrom my viewpoint, I and I think many of my colleagues were not really \nwilling to simply give carte blanche to the United Nations again.\n  The fact is that the United Nations has, regrettably, been fiscally \nmismanaged. That mismanagement has meant that American tax dollars have\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nbeen wasted. That is not right. We as a Senate have an obligation to \nmake sure that the tax dollars that are sent to us out of the hard \nearnings of our constituents are effectively spent. This proposal \nincludes in it conditions that will require the United Nations to \nfinally straighten out its fiscal house. Today, you really can't tell \nwhere a dollar goes that is sent to the United Nations. More \nimportantly, there is a distinct sense that when a dollar goes to the \nUnited Nations today, a great deal is misspent on patronage, on \npromised services that are not delivered, on programs that don't work, \nand on agencies which have an excessive amount of personnel.\n  So we are requiring, under this proposal, that the United Nations put \nin very basic accounting procedures, that they actually be able to tell \nus where the dollars go, that they have a personnel policy that is \naccountable, a system of accounting for the programmatic activity they \nundertake.\n  More importantly, we are requiring and putting in conditions that \nallow us to determine that their procedures and structures work well, \nfrom a GAO auditing of their procedures.\n  In addition, we have seen the other conditions outlined by the \nSenator from Delaware and, I am sure, will be outlined by other \nSenators here, which will make the United Nations fee system, or \npayment system, or dues system more reflective of the burdens of other \nnations, as well as the United States. We pay a disproportionate amount \nof the cost for peacekeeping and for the fees at the United Nations and \nthe dues of the United Nations. We are not talking about dramatic \nreduction in either our commitment to the United Nations, in \npeacekeeping, or in our commitment to the area of dues. But we are \ntalking about bringing it more in line with the fact that other \nnations, since the initiation of the United Nations, have risen in \ntheir economic capability to bear some of this burden. That is \nreflective in this amendment.\n  So this is a good amendment. It is an amendment that brought together \nthe various parties. And, believe me, when we started the negotiations, \nwe were a long way apart. There wasn't much expectation that an \nagreement would be reached. But through the good counsel of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, the Senator from Minnesota, the majority leader, \nand through the hard effort of the Secretary of State and the \nAmbassador to the United Nations, we have reached an accommodation and \nagreement. It is a positive one, one that will help the United Nations \nbe a stronger institution that people can have confidence in, \nespecially as to how and where it spends the dollars sent to it.\n  So it is a positive step forward to have these conditions in this \nbill. I, as an appropriator, would have a lot of problems passing any \nappropriation that didn't follow the outline set forth by this \ncommittee and set forth in the work of Senator Helms and Senator Biden.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the subcommittee chairman with \njurisdiction over the bill before us today, I worked diligently with \nmembers on both sides of the aisle, and with the administration, to \ncraft legislation which will strengthen America's leadership role in \nthe international arena. This package reorganizes our foreign relations \nbureaucracy, establishes benchmarks for the payment of U.N. arrears, \nand prioritizes our international affairs expenditures. We need a more \neffective foreign affairs apparatus, both at home and at the United \nNations, in order to confront the challenges to peace and security in \nthe future.\n  This bipartisan agreement is the result of a good-faith effort to \naccommodate conflicting perspectives on how we, as a nation, should \nmobilize our resources. There were tough, lengthy negotiations on this \npackage. We had to reconcile competing interests, and as a result, \nnobody is completely satisfied with the final product. I will be the \nfirst to say that this bill is not perfect. I would have preferred much \nmore in the way of reforms and budget discipline. But this is a good \nagreement; and in this case, we should not let the perfect be the enemy \nof the good. I want to reassure my colleagues that I am open to \noversight hearings that would address their concerns and closely \nexamine the implementation of the changes we have made.\n  In order to effectively safeguard the national interest, we must \nreorganize our foreign policy apparatus. This nation is saddled with an \nunwieldy Cold War foreign policy bureaucracy in which many of the \nfunctions of AID, ACDA, USIA and the International Development \nCooperation Agency could be better handled by the State Department. \nThis legislation does not go as far as I would like in consolidating \nour foreign relations bureaucracy. But for now, this package has a \nmajor advantage over a more complete consolidation--this package is \nachievable. It is a solid first step. Hopefully, these reforms will \nlead to further streamlining in the future--the American people want \nour Government to not only reflect their wishes abroad, but they want \nit to do so coherently. We are more likely to achieve our goals if we \nhave a single voice representing the administration's position in the \nconduct of foreign relations, rather than a number of competing \nfiefdoms which undercut the authority of the Secretary of State.\n\n  For example, under the new structure, we no longer should be stymied \nby a good-cop, bad-cop approach to foreign policy, whereby the entities \nwho hand out U.S. foreign aid maintain good relations with client \nnations, while the Department of State essentially holds the line in \nprotecting U.S. interests. We should not be handing out foreign aid to \na country at a time when that very country is clearly acting against \nour interests. When we distribute foreign aid, it should be with an \nunderstanding that the United States entity asking for cooperation from \na country in one arena is coordinating with the United States entity \nthat will be delivering assistance to that country. Under this plan, \nthe different parts of our foreign policy apparatus have a structural \nimperative to act in concert.\n  Granted, the United States is not alone in the need to downsize its \nbureaucracy and eliminate waste. The United Nations must do the same. \nMy visits to the United Nations as the United States Congressional \nDelegate to the U.N. General Assembly served to reinforce my commitment \nto salvage this organization. In this age, any organization burdened \nwith a bloated bureaucracy and no mechanisms to control spending, will \ncollapse under the weight of its own inefficiency. Most United Nations \nofficials recognize the need for reform, and have started to work to \nachieve some of them. Indeed, in her former position as Ambassador to \nthe United Nations, Secretary Albright was an outspoken critic of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse and was instrumental in initiating an oversight \nprocess. However, most of her efforts were stymied by an entrenched \nbureaucracy. True reform will only occur when there are tangible \nincentives to change. I believe that the United Nations needs the \ndiscipline of actual benchmarks tied to the arrears to provide the \nimpetus for fundamental change. We have seen how difficult it is to \nstreamline our own bureaucracy. It is even more difficult to streamline \nan international organization where each member is involved in these \ndecisions. We are not seeking to micro-manage U.N. reforms. We want to \nwork with our fellow U.N. members to make the organization the best it \ncan be.\n\n  This bill provides a 3-year payment of $819 million in arrears to the \nUnited Nations in conjunction with the achievement of specific \nbenchmarks that will help us enhance the vitality of the United \nNations. I joined Ambassador Richardson at the United Nations late last \nweek to brief Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Permanent \nRepresentatives of many of our allies' delegations on the details of \nthis package. I was repeatedly asked whether the $819 million was a \nfirm number. I indicated that it is a carefully negotiated figure that \nI believe will remain firm. I would like to remind my colleagues that \nthe House bill contains no provision at all for the payment of arrears. \nThe U.N. officials also wanted to know whether the benchmarks were \nconditions or suggestions. The benchmarks are what I call, somewhat \ntongue-in-check, ``mandatory suggestions.'' They are suggestions in the \nsense that the United Nations can\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nchoose whether or not to adopt them, and mandatory in the sense that if \nthe U.N. wants the money it will have to implement the reforms.\n  If the United Nations ignores the need for reform, than the United \nNations will have to forgo the $819 million.\n  I regret that a statement I made in New York last week was \nmisinterpreted to suggest that somehow benchmarks were negotiable or \noptional.\n  My intent was to indicate that the details regarding the \nimplementation of certain conditions could be worked out with our \nfellow U.N. members--as long as the benchmark goals are achieved.\n  You know, there is a difference here. Many of the benchmarks \nestablish broad parameters on the direction we believe the United \nNations should be going. The final small details and the micromanaging \nof how those are accomplished and reached will be the work of \nnegotiations between member states. We are setting out a macropackage \nof reforms that I believe most members at the United Nations recognize \nneed to be made. These reforms are heading the United Nations in the \ndirection that it needs to go in order to become a very efficient \norganization.\n  There is significant interest in the Congress to withhold the payment \nof arrears until there is tangible evidence that reform has occurred. \nAfter all, this is not the U.S. Government's money, it is the taxpayers \nmoney. Americans should be able to ensure that their hard earned money \nwill not be squandered.\n  I was greatly encouraged that the Secretary General remains committed \nto reforms and will work with us to achieve them.\n  I strongly believe that the United Nations is an important forum for \ndebate between member states and a vehicle for joint action when \nwarranted. It is not a world government.\n  However, the United Nations must endorse reforms that provide \ntransparency and accountability so it is embraced as the former, \ninstead of feared as the latter. I firmly believe that this package \nwill improve the United Nations to the point where the United Nations \ncan win back public support which has eroded over the years.\n  These reforms are critical to ensure the United Nations is effective \nand relevant.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the entire bipartisan package and, \nespecially, to understand how difficult it was to arrive at an \nagreement on the arrears.\n  I commend the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for their diligence and perseverance in effecting \nthis compromise, an effort which took many months. I am pleased that \nthe Administration has agreed, albeit reluctantly, to this agreement.\n  I look forward to the implementation of the measures which will \nenhance America's ability to exert leadership in the international \narena through the consolidation of our foreign relations apparatus.\n  I am hopeful that the United Nations will accept the reforms and in \ndoing so, will increase its ability to perform its mission. This \nagreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of the \nentire international community.\n  Thank you, very much. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, just for the Record, I think I should \nemphasize that Judd Gregg from whom we just heard, the chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, State Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, has worked with us every step of the way in crafting this \nU.N. reform provision.\n  Senator Grams, from whom we just heard, is chairman of the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and is our congressional delegate to the United Nations. He \nhas been so instrumental in negotiating the provisions on U.N. reform.\n  I believe that Senator Robb is prepared to speak. If he needs an \nextra couple of minutes, I will yield them to him.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, it's hard to argue with the spirit of Senator Lugar's \namendment. And indeed I don't argue with its spirit. We owe the United \nNations hundreds of millions of dollars. Our deadbeat status is an \nembarrassment for the country and undermines our standing and the vital \nwork of this international organization.\n  That said, the political reality of the situation we find ourselves \nin is that a majority of this body is prepared only to pay our debts \nconditioned on comprehensive reforms being implemented at the United \nNations. And I certainly don't disagree with reforming the United \nNations, and making it more efficient and effective. Still, we are \nholding hostage money already owed to changes being invoked that suit \nour unilateral demands.\n  But the will of the majority is clear. While I may disagree with my \nfriend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee on the \nunilateral means which he has chosen to affect reform at the United \nNations, the negotiated package providing $819 million over 3 years I \nbelieve is the best we can hope for. Half a loaf is better than no loaf \nat all. And that is the alternative. This is a classic example of a \nsituation where the perfect can become the enemy of the good.\n  Mr. President, I would favor an approach that pays our arrearages in \nfull, not in the 2 years proposed by the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana or the 3 years sought by our distinguished chairman while \nconditioning future payments on reform. But that strategy fails the \npolitical litmus test laid down by the majority. I understand that \nreality, and I want an authorization bill that can become law. Hence, \nthe circumstances persuade me that the only approach that can \naccomplish that objective, even though I may substantively disagree \nwith part of it--is the one negotiated between and offered by Senator \nHelms and Senator Biden.\n  It represents a compromise in good faith on both sides to achieve an \nobjective that we have not achieved in this body in some period of \ntime. And for that reason, I support the bill and I oppose with regret \nthe amendment that is offered by my distinguished friend, the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee for yielding me an additional minute.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator is quite welcome.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, just for the record, in 1985 a very distinguished \nSenator named Nancy Kassebaum, and Mr. Solomon on the House side, \noffered legislation using this very same approach. And it was in \nenacted into to law for the State Department Authorization Act for \nfiscal years 1986 and 1987. Who do you reckon was the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee at that time? It was my very good \nfriend, Senator Lugar of Indiana. If my memory serves me correctly, he \nsupported Nancy Kassebaum, I, and all the rest of us who were \ninterested in the same thing.\n  The Clinton administration never requested some of the larger amounts \nof money involved in the so-called arrearage. Through a normal process \nof budgeting, the Congress overlooked paying this enormous sum for \npeacekeeping, principally to our allies in Europe. In fact, the \nnonpayment of U.N. peacekeeping expenditures in Bosnia was an explicit \nrebuff by the Congress to a policy, and any suggestion to the contrary \nis simply not so. But the Clinton administration never requested most \nof the funds in that budget. It never received congressional approval. \nThe Congress to the contrary explicitly opposed these peacekeeping \nexpenditures. But through a flawed mechanism at the United Nations the \nClinton administration at that time could vote for the peacekeeping \nmission and then after the fact demand the Congress meet the so-called \nUnited States obligation to pay.\n  So it is a confusing set of circumstances. But the argument that we \nare somehow being less than honorable in applying some demands is just \nnot reasonable.\n  Let's look at another thing. Do we really want to start down the path \nof\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nwho has spent how much on Bosnia? This is an argument which our allies \nare not going to win. Less than 2 years ago two Cabinet-level officials \nfrom the Clinton administration told the Foreign Relations Committee, \nof which Senator Lugar is a member, and I believe he was present at \nthat time, that the cost incurred for the peacekeeping mission in \nBosnia is ``going to be in excess of $1 billion, probably $1.5 \nbillion.'' Just for the record, the United States has to date spent--\nguess how much on Bosnia? Mr. President, $6.5 billion. Who is going to \nreimburse our military and our taxpayers for this expenditure? So where \ndoes anybody get off saying we are doing something dishonorable, or \nunwise, or unreasonable if we are protesting a lot of this stuff that \nis going on at the United Nations?\n  Over $533 million of the so-called United States arrearages for \npeacekeeping is specifically related to the failed U.N. mission in \nBosnia. In support of the amendment, it has been said that the United \nStates did not have troops in Bosnia and, therefore, the United States \nhas an obligation to pay those who did. That argument is not correct \neither.\n  During the period of the U.N. effort in Bosnia, the United States \nmaintained an aircraft carrier battle group off the coast of the former \nYugoslavia, a substantial commitment of aircraft to police the no-fly \nzone over Bosnia, and a military hospital unit in Croatia at an \nestimated cost of at least $3 billion. Because the Congress prohibited \nPresident Clinton from associating our military with the U.N. disaster, \nthe United States did not seek reimbursement for our efforts to contain \nhostilities in Bosnia.\n  If we are going to start talking about paying bills for Bosnia and \nthings like that, we can really, really have a strong argument, and I \nam going to insist that our military and our taxpayers get reimbursed \nas well.\n\n  So, for me the alternative to the payment of these funds with the \nconditions in the reform package will not be the no strings attached \napproach advocated by the Lugar amendment. I will instead oppose any \namendment for any reimbursement for the failed U.N. peacekeeping effort \nin Bosnia. And that is a debate, Mr. President, if we have it, that \nwill be worth having.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that Senators support my amendment \nbecause it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to pay our \ndebts and to meet our contractual obligations in support of the United \nNations, a vigorous vehicle for the conduct of our foreign policy.\n  The dispute that we have today is over two different tacks on which \nthe Senators differ in terms of our effectiveness. I believe that the \nLugar amendment is not only the right thing to do but I believe it is \nthe most effective way to bring about reform, and to bring about \ncooperation with our allies, not only at the United Nations but in a \nhost of international trade issues, in NATO and NATO-related concerns, \nand all of the planning that is vital to our foreign policy.\n  It makes no sense, Mr. President, to deny our allies funds that we \nowe them and to expect that they are going to be generous or thoughtful \nin negotiating settlements with us in a range of agreements around the \nglobe.\n  So in terms of both the principle as well as its practicality, I \nbelieve the best course is to pay our debt and to do so promptly in a \nstraightforward way and to negotiate firmly for reform of the United \nNations, as we are doing, and as we will continue to do, after \nrecognizing that 183 other countries are involved. There must finally \nbe agreement with them, too.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senators from North Carolina \nand Delaware for bringing this very important piece of legislation to \nthe Senate floor. It has been many years since Congress has passed and \nthe President signed a State Department Authorization bill. U.S. \ninterests will be very well served if we are able to accomplish this \nvery difficult but important task.\n  I would like to address a key provision within S. 903, that being the \nU.N. reform plan. I have long had a deep interest in the world body, \nand this legislation offers the Senate an opportunity to better \nunderstand the many complex issues surrounding U.S. membership in the \nUnited Nations.\n  There have been a number of what I consider to be unfortunate \nmisconceptions raised about the United Nations in recent years that, in \nthe context of this legislation, ought to be addressed in a forthright \nmanner. American taxpayers deserve to know what benefits does the \nUnited States derives from its participation in the United Nations? A \nmisconception one hears repeatedly is that the United States pays \nbillions of dollars in U.N. dues, but gets little or nothing to show \nfor it in return. I think it is important to rebut this allegation in \norder to more effectively make a case for full payment of our \narrearages.\n  The United Nations advances U.S. foreign policy goals in a number of \nways, including isolation of nations that support terrorism, conflict \nresolution through diplomacy, the provision of humanitarian aid, and \nthe promotion of democracy and human rights. These many successful \nventures are too often overlooked as the more headline-grabbing \nfailures of the U.N. seem to receive more attention by the news media.\n  For example, U.N. economic sanctions serve to isolate and weaken \nregimes of nations such as Iraq, Libya, and others that routinely \nchallenge United States interests abroad. Although these outlaw regimes \nremain in power, their ability to influence world events and undermine \nour interests are greatly reduced. I note the now-lifted U.N. sanctions \non Serbia, which were instrumental in bringing that nation to the \nnegotiations that eventually resulted in the Dayton peace accords. And \nwe should also recall that Operation Desert Storm was conducted under \nthe authority of a U.N.-passed resolution.\n  The United Nations has also been instrumental in a number of \npeacemaking endeavors, including the brokering and implementation of \npeace agreements in the nearby, formerly war-ravaged nations of El \nSalvador and Guatemala. While I recognize and acknowledge the imperfect \nrecord of U.N. peacekeeping missions, particularly in Somalia and \nBosnia, there have been successes in a number of lesser known parts of \nthe world that are infrequently publicized. In any event, it should \nalso be understood that the number of troops involved in U.N. \npeacekeeping operations has been reduced two-thirds over the past 2 \nyears.\n\n  What's more, the United Nations has been a forum in which \ninternational norms and standards of conduct are debated and \nestablished. These standards put the weight of international unity \nbehind efforts to encourage good conduct on the part of all member \nstates, particularly those that seek to do otherwise. During the 51st \nU.N. General Assembly alone, a number of important resolutions were \nadopted, with U.S. support, that promoted our national security \ninterests. These resolutions sought to combat international crime, \npromote respect for human rights, and deplore the conduct of the \nrepressive Burmese Government. I also note the work of the U.N. Human \nRights Commission in Geneva, an important organization which, among \nother things, puts needed pressure on many nations to fully respect the \nfundamental rights of its citizens.\n  Mr. President, these are just some examples of how the United Nations \nand its affiliated organizations serve U.S. national security interests \naround the world. There are many more. It's vitally important that \nevery Member of Congress understand exactly what we are receiving in \nreturn for our substantial investment at the United Nations in order to \nmake the best judgment about how to proceed in addressing our unpaid \ndues.\n  Another important misconception about the United Nations is the \ncharacterization of it as a bloated, uncontrolled bureaucracy that is \nunresponsive to calls for restraint. It is true that the United Nations \nand its administrative activities had seen enormous growth during its \nfirst several decades of existence. This growth and associated \nbureaucracy led to justified calls for reform and reduction.\n  We must keep in mind that the United Nations has already undergone \nseveral reforms in the past decade, often at the urging of the U.S. \nCongress. Well\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nbefore Secretary-General Kofi Annan assumed office, the United Nations \nhad established an inspector general, reduced the number of high level \nposts, and cut both its peacekeeping and general budgets. And in the \nrelatively short time since Annan has been Secretary-General, he has \nannounced additional far-reaching reforms. On March 17, Annan specified \na series of 10 reform benchmarks involving further budget cuts and \nrestructuring. Included among these are a transfer of resources from \nadministration to programs, establishment of a code of conduct for U.N. \nstaff, and streamlining of his own office. Annan has done a great deal \nwith the authority he has, while proposing additional measures that \nmust be negotiated with member states.\n  So no one should be left with the understanding that the United \nNations is somehow immune from accountability and unresponsive to \ncriticism. The world body, especially through its new Secretary-\nGeneral, has heard the call for reform. Its leadership recognizes that \nit must be responsive to the concerns of member states, particularly \nits biggest donor, the United States.\n\n  This brings us to today's debate. It has been my longstanding view \nthat the United States absolutely must remain a full and active member \nof the United Nations. The many constructive activities of the United \nNations. I have discussed, and the many U.S. interests that are served \nby our participation in the world body warrant a continued and \nstrengthened U.S. role. Indeed, the 20th century has seen the \ntremendous consequences that result when the United States shrinks from \nits inevitable leading role in world affairs. In fact, I would argue \nthat the increasing complexity of the challenges confronting the United \nStates today make it more important than ever that we remain engaged \ninternationally by, among other things, fully participating in the \nUnited Nations.\n  And we certainly cannot adequately participate in the United Nations \nby continuing to carry an arrearage of around $1 billion. Because of \nthis arrearage, our respect and credibility there has diminished, \nthereby limiting United States ability to influence positively the \nUnited Nations' deliberations and activities. As the sole remaining \nsuperpower in an increasingly complex world, the United States simply \nmust play a leading and unimpeded role at the United Nations.\n  While I am extremely pleased about the willingness of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina to engage in negotiations to clear up our \narrearage, I believe that paying our back dues in full without the \nonerous conditions of title 22 is the appropriate course of action. It \nappears unlikely that the United Nations will, in fact, agree to this \npackage as a whole, particularly given the lukewarm initial reaction of \nits leadership. This reaction is certainly understandable. Could you \nimagine if every member state made demands such as this in return for \nfull payment of dues?\n  What would best serve U.S. interests is to pay off our arrearage now \nand encourage our diplomats to undertake a very serious effort to \nnegotiate further reforms with a Secretary-General who appears strongly \ncommitted to genuine change. I am greatly concerned that the \nsubstantial progress we have already made in working with Kofi Annan \ncould be jeopardized by enactment of these mandates. It is no surprise \nthat many member states of the U.N. have said that these conditions are \na mere starting point for further negotiations. Such an interpretation, \nif accepted by the body as a whole, would simply put us back at square \none with a $1 billion arrearage.\n  Rather than debating how best to pay our back dues, we should instead \nfocus on the more fundamental question of whether or not the United \nStates ought to be a member of the United Nations at all. If we do \ndecide that it's in our interests to remain there, then we should \nsimply pay our dues and move on. It is imperative that the United \nStates remain engaged, rather than withdraw, from world affairs and \ninstitutions such as the United Nations. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Lugar/Sarbanes amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President I rise to express my strong support for \nthe amendment introduced by Senator Lugar. The amendment accomplishes a \nnumber of things, including funding arrears to the United Nations \nwithin 2 years and fully funding fiscal year 1998 U.S. regular and \npeacekeeping dues to the United Nations. The full funding for fiscal \nyear 1998 is important in that it will help ensure that the United \nStates does not perpetuate U.S. arrears by not meeting current U.S. \nobligations to the United Nations.\n  But as commendable and desirable as these provisions are, what I \nbelieve is most important is Senator Lugar's proposal to strip from S. \n903 some 38 unilaterally imposed benchmarks or conditions that the \nUnited Nations would have to meet before we fully pay the debts we \nacknowledge we owe the organization. Included in these benchmarks are a \npermanent cut in our annual dues from 25 percent to 20 percent of the \nregular U.N. budget and from 31 percent to 25 percent of the \npeacekeeping budget.\n  When I first joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was \nasked by a ranking State Department official what my position was on \nU.S. arrears to the United Nations. I said my position could be summed \nup in two-words: ``pay up.'' At the time I had no inkling that the \nmajority of my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee would \nagree that our decision to finally pay up should be contingent on the \nU.N complying with numerous U.S. conditions. And the conditions \ncontained in S. 903 provide for payment of arrears over a 3-year \nperiod, with new conditions imposed each of the 3 years--conditions \nthat the United Nations will have to meet in exchange for U.S. \npayments. To other nations, including some of our allies, this formula \nis likely to be viewed as being tantamount to blackmail on the \ninstallment plan. Moreover, if implemented there is no question it \nwould greatly weaken the United Nations and undermine our leadership \nrole in the world body.\n  What would happen to the United Nations if other member States were \nto follow suit and impose some of the same provisions contained in this \nbill as conditions for paying their arrears? Thus, they might refuse to \npay their back dues and assessments until the United Nations agreed to \nmake reductions they specify in their assessed rate for the U.N. budget \nand share of contributions to peacekeeping operations. Or they might \ncondition repayment to specific reductions in the U.N. staff, reduced \nU.N job vacancy rates, or even providing their national counterparts to \nour GAO with access to U.N. financial data so that they may audit the \nU.N. books.\n\n  Is there any doubt that we would be enraged if the national \nlegislature of any other member state were to mandate that the United \nNations jump through a series of hoops before that state pays its debts \nto the United Nations? And we would have a right to be enraged, not \nonly because our own dues and assessments might consequently be \nincreased. But also because U.N. compliance with such a unilateral \ndiktat could well lead to the organization's collapse. No international \norganization can be viable if its members have the power to \nunilaterally determine what they owe the organization, the conditions \nunder which repayment should be made, and what their future financial \nobligations should be.\n  As Senator Lugar has pointed out, only 5 percent, some $54 million, \nof the $1.021 billion we acknowledge we owe is actually owed to the \nUnited Nations. It is important to note that the single largest portion \nof our arrears, almost two-thirds, is owed to countries who contributed \ntroops to peacekeeping operations which the U.S. backed in the U.N. \nSecurity Council. In most cases these were operations in which the \nUnited States refrained from participating with our own forces. The \nbulk of this peacekeeping debt is owed to our NATO allies, with the \nUnited Nations merely serving as a conduit to reimburse those countries \nwho supported peacekeeping operations with troops and equipment.\n  There is no doubt that international peacekeeping eases our burden \nbecause other nations share the costs and risks. In fact, the United \nStates will gain $107 million in reimbursements for U.N. peacekeeping \ncosts, which we will credit against our U.N. debt obligations.\n  In effect, by withholding our debt payments and making repayment \ncontingent on a host of conditions, we've imposed a double whammy on \nsome of our closest allies. We have yet to pay\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nthem what we owe for the costs of peacekeeping operations they carried \nout which we had deemed to be in our national interest. And by \nunilaterally reducing our own future obligations to the United Nations \nas a condition of paying our arrears, our NATO allies will wind up \npaying more for peacekeeping operations and the U.N. budget. To me, \nthis seems like a sure-fire formula for undermining our relations with \nour NATO partners.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important to stress that the Lugar \namendment enjoys strong and broad support. Among the backers is the \nEmergency Coalition for U.S. Financial Support of the United Nations \nwhich includes all the former Secretaries of State, and over 100 \nbusiness, labor, humanitarian, faith-based, and civic organizations. \nMoreover, the premises of the Lugar amendments are consistent with the \nviews of the American public. For example, a nationwide poll last year \nfound that almost two-thirds of Americans believe the United States \n``should always pay its full dues to the United Nations on schedule.''\n  Americans have long believed in having ``a decent respect for the \nopinions of mankind.'' I hope my colleagues will agree with me that \nimposing unilateral, take it-or-leave it conditions on the United \nNations hardly reflects ``a decent respect for the opinions of \nmankind.'' Therefore, I urge my colleagues to strongly back the Lugar \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 383, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to offer a perfecting amendment to Senator DeWine's amendment \nNo. 383. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Dodd. It amends \nthe pending amendment to add two additional categories of individuals \nwho may be excluded under this amendment: First, members of the Haitian \nhigh command; and, second, members of the paramilitary organization \nknown as FRAPH.\n  Both of these organizations were responsible for serious human rights \nabuses during the coup regime from 1991 to 1994.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the DeWine amendment be so modified to \ninclude the amendment which I send to the desk from Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 383), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of title XVI of division B of the bill, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . EXCLUSION FROM THE UNITED STATES OF ALIENS WHO HAVE \n                   BEEN INVOLVED IN EXTRAJUDICIAL AND POLITICAL \n                   KILLINGS IN HAITI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) At the time of the enactment of this Act, there have \n     been over eighty extrajudicial and political killing cases \n     assigned to the Haitian Special Investigative Unit (SIU) by \n     the Government of Haiti. Furthermore, the government has \n     requested that the SIU investigate on a ``priority basis'' \n     close to two dozen cases relating to extrajudicial and \n     political killings.\n       (2) President Jean-Bertrand Aristide lived in exile in the \n     United States after he was overthrown by a military coup on \n     September 30, 1991. During his exile, political and \n     extrajudicial killings occurred in Haiti including Aristide \n     financial supporter Antoine Izmery, who was killed on \n     September 11, 1993; Guy Malary, Aristide's Minister of \n     Justice, who was killed on October 14, 1993; and Father Jean-\n     Marie Vincent, a supporter of Aristide, was killed on August \n     28, 1992.\n       (3) President Aristide returned to Haiti on October 15, \n     1994, after some 20,000 United States troops, under the code \n     name Operation Uphold Democracy, entered Haiti as the lead \n     force in a multi-national force with the objective of \n     restoring democratic rule.\n       (4) From June 25, 1995, through October 1995, elections \n     were held where pro-Aristide candidates won a large share of \n     the parliamentary and local government seats.\n       (5) On March 28, 1995, a leading opposition leader to \n     Aristide, Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, and a client, \n     Eugene Baillergeau, were gunned down in Ms. Bertin's car.\n       (6) On May 22, 1995, Michel Gonzalez, Haitian businessman \n     and Aristide's next door neighbor, was killed in a drive-by \n     shooting after alleged attempts by Aristide to acquire his \n     property.\n       (7) After Aristide regained power, three former top Army \n     officers were assassinated: Colonel Max Mayard on March 10, \n     1995; Colonel Michelange Hermann on May 24, 1995; and \n     Brigadier General Romulus Dumarsais was killed on June 27, \n     1995.\n       (8) Presidential elections were held on December 17, 1995. \n     Rene Preval, an Aristide supporter, won, with 89 percent of \n     the votes cast, but with a low voter turnout of only 28 \n     percent, and with many parties allegedly boycotting the \n     election. Preval took office on February 7, 1996.\n       (9) On March 6,1996, police and ministerial security guards \n     killed at least six men during a raid in Cite Soleil, a Port-\n     au-Prince slum.\n       (10) On August 20,1996, two opposition politicians, Jacques \n     Fleurival and Baptist Pastor Antoine Leroy were gunned down \n     outside Fleurival's home.\n       (11) Other alleged extrajudicial and political killings \n     include the deaths of Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, and Jean-Hubert Feuille.\n       (12) Although the Haitian Government claims to have \n     terminated from employment several suspects in the killings, \n     some whom have received training from United States advisors, \n     there has been no substantial progress made in the \n     investigation that has led to the prosecution of any of the \n     above-referenced extrajudicial and political killings.\n       (13) The expiration of the mandate of the United Nations \n     Support Mission in Haiti has been extended three times, the \n     last to July 31, 1997. The Administration has indicated that \n     a fourth extension through November 1997, may be necessary to \n     ensure the transition to a democratic government.\n       (b) Grounds for Exclusion.--The Secretary of State shall \n     deny a visa to, and the Attorney General shall exclude from \n     the United States, any alien who the Secretary of State has \n     reason to believe is a person who--\n       (1) has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Antoine Izmery, Guy Malary, Father Jean-Marie \n     Vincent, Pastor Antoine Leroy, Jacques Fleurival, Mireille \n     Durocher Bertin, Eugene Baillergeau, Michelange Hermann, Max \n     Mayard, Romulus Dumarsais, Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, Michel Gonzalez, and Jean-\n     Hubert Feuille;\n       (2) has been included in the list presented to former \n     president Jean-Bertrand Aristide by former National Security \n     Council Advisor Anthony Lake in December 1995, and acted upon \n     by President Rene Preval;\n       (3) was a member of the Haitian presidential security unit \n     who has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Pastor Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, or \n     who was suspended by President Preval for his involvement in \n     or knowledge of the Leroy and Fleurival killings on August \n     20, 1996; or\n       (4) was sought for an interview by the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation as part of its inquiry into the March 28, 1995, \n     murder of Mireille Durocher Bertin and Eugene Baillergeau, \n     Jr., and were credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in those murders, per a June 28, \n     1995, letter to the then Minister of Justice of the \n     Government of Haiti, Jean-Joseph Exume.\n       (5) Any member of the Haitian High Command during the \n     period 1991-1994, who has been credibly alleged to have \n     planned, ordered, or participated with members of the Haitian \n     Armed Forces in the September 1991 coup against the duly \n     elected government of Haiti (and his family members) or the \n     subsequent murders of as many as three thousand Haitians \n     during that period;\n       (6) Any individual who has been credibly alleged to have \n     been a member of the paramilitary organization known as FRAPH \n     who planned, ordered, or participated in acts of violence \n     against the Haitian people;\n       (c) Exemption.--This section shall not apply where the \n     Secretary of State finds, on a case by case basis, that the \n     entry into the United States of the person who would \n     otherwise be excluded under this section is necessary for \n     medical reasons, or such person has cooperated fully with the \n     investigation of these political murders. If the Secretary of \n     State exempts such a person, the Secretary shall notify the \n     appropriate congressional committees in writing.\n       (d) Reporting Requirement.--(1) The United States chief of \n     mission in Haiti shall provide the Secretary of State a list \n     of those who have been credibly alleged to have ordered or \n     carried out the extrajudicial and political killings \n     mentioned in paragraph (1) of subsection (b).\n       (2) The Secretary of State shall submit the list provided \n     under paragraph (1) to the appropriate congressional \n     committees not later than three months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (3) The Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of aliens denied visas, and \n     the Attorney General shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of aliens refused entry to \n     the United States as a result of this provision.\n       (4) The Secretary shall submit a report under this \n     subsection not later than six months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and not later than March 1 of each year \n     thereafter as long as the Government of Haiti has not \n     completed the investigation of the extrajudicial and \n     political killings and has not prosecuted those implicated \n     for the killings specified in paragraph (1) of subsection \n     (b).\n       (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives and\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope that Senator DeWine would accept my \nperfecting amendment that I offer to his amendment. I understand that \nthe managers of the bill are prepared to accept it, if the sponsor of \nthe underlying amendment has no problem, which I understand he does \nnot.\n  I believe that those who use violence as a political tool should not \nbe rewarded with a United States visa for those actions. While his \namendment covers a number of categories of individuals who have been \ninvolved in political killings and other illegal acts, there would seem \nto be two categories of individuals who played a very prominent role in \nthe reign of terror that characterized Haiti between September 1991 and \nOctober 1994 when the duly elected government was restored to office \nwith the assistance of the international community. I am of course \ntalking about the High Command of the Haitian Armed Forces and the \nparamilitary organization known as FRAPH.\n  Clearly members of the Haitian High Command violated every norm of \naccepted international law with respect to their efforts to overthrow a \ndemocratically elected government. But more importantly, their \ntreatment of the Haitian people during the coup regime was \nreprehensible. Surely granting entry to the United States of such \nindividuals would serve no useful private or public purpose.\n  Similarly, the paramilitary organization which came to be known as \nFRAPH undertook such heinous acts as kidnaping, rape and murder as a \nconcerted effort to intimidate the Haitian people. Individuals who were \nmembers of this organization should also be excluded from entry into \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President I believe that this amendment adds the necessary \nbalance to the pending amendment and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware and I \nthank Senator Dodd for this effective amendment. It is consistent with \nwhat we are trying to do and trying to say and are saying in the DeWine \namendment. That simply is that the United States should not allow \npeople who have committed political murders in the country of Haiti \ninto the United States and whether these are from the left or the \nright, whether these occurred after Aristide or before Aristide, we \nshould be consistent.\n  So I support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from North Carolina \nhas 1 minute remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Lugar has repeatedly said it is the \nright thing to do, to vote for his amendment. It is the right thing to \ndo, almost implying that those of us who do not agree with him have, \nindeed, a character defect. Let me tell you about the Lugar amendment. \nThe effect of the Lugar amendment would be that the United Nations \nwould have absolutely no incentive to reform--none--no incentive to cut \nthe burden on the American taxpayers by reducing our regular budget \nassessment to 20 percent; no reduction in our peacekeeping assessment; \nno inspector general in the big three specialized agencies to root out \nwaste, fraud, and corruption; no U.S. seat on the U.N. budgetary \ncommittee; no budgetary reductions in the specialized agencies; no \nsunset provisions for obsolete programs; no GAO access to U.N. \nfinancial data; no budgetary reform, and so on and on.\n  It may be the right thing to do in Senator Lugar's opinion, but I \nexpect that it is going to be the wrong thing to do, to vote for the \nLugar amendment, when the tally is made in just a few minutes.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the amendments? I believe we \ndid that last night.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 383\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 383, as modified, offered by the Senator from \nOhio [Mr. DeWine].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

We have a contractual obligation to pay.\n  Our effectiveness in bringing about reforms in dealing with NATO \nexpansion, in dealing with a host of international trade issues depends \nupon our credibility with our friends. It is not an argument in favor \nof reform that unilaterally we decide not to pay or send our payments \nto other nations but insist on some with 38 conditions in 18 pages of \nagate type before we allocate the money. We have a straightforward \nvote, Mr. President. I believe it is the right thing to do. I think it \nis the most effective thing to do in terms of American diplomacy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield? I very strongly support the \nSenator from Indiana, and I very much hope our colleagues will vote in \nfavor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina has been \nkind enough to give me the minute to respond.\n  The Lugar amendment does not have one single penny more in it than \nthis bill. We do pay all of our allies the arrearages that we owe them \nwith the bill in the way it is drawn up. The administration has \nsupported this compromise we have come up with.\n  This basically is the way to get the job done. But I emphasize, there \nis not one additional penny in the Lugar amendment. There is no \ndistinction in how we get paid. The principle is, should there be any \nconditions placed on the United Nations? This bill does place \nconditions they can meet. The Senator, on principle, says none should\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nbe there. If you wish to put conditions at all, you should vote with \nus. If you want no conditions, vote with him. But it is the same amount \nof money.\n  I urge that you vote ``no'' on the Lugar amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 382 offered by the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] \nand the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, within a few short days, Charles Gentry \nwill be leaving his post as my administrative assistant after many \nyears of distinguished service in the legislative and executive \nbranches of government and 11 years in the U.S. Army.\n  Charles has served on my staff twice. First as my legislative \ndirector and now as my administrative assistant.\n  During his first tour of duty on my staff Congress enacted the \npartial deregulation of natural gas. It was a major undertaking. It was \ncomplicated. It was contentious. Charles masters every aspect of this \ncomplicated piece of legislation. Looking back, natural gas \nderegulation proved to the country that our Nation has massive \nquantities of natural gas and that market forces would work to \neveryone's advantage.\n  Then, as now, no matter what the task, Charles has always been a \nleader. He has always excelled. I could count on him. He knows his \nsubstance. He knows his politics, and he knows New Mexico.\n  During the last 4 years Charles helped me with the critical issues \nfacing New Mexico.\n  When Kirtland Air Force base was included on the Base Closure \nCommission preliminary list, Charles rolled up his sleeves, and in \ntypical Gentry analytical style found out the facts surrounding this \nrecommendation. It didn't take him long to pinpoint the shortcomings in \nthe Commission's evaluation of Kirtland, and to professionally get the \nfacts to the Commission so they could correct their error. Kirtland was \nsaved and the defense readiness of the country benefited from Charles' \nhard work.\n  The administration's grazing fee hike proposal threatened the way of \nlife for hundreds of hard working ranchers in New Mexico. Charles \nworked diligently to educate members of the Senate about the folly of \nthis proposal. I will always remember the warm welcome we received when \nwe visited southeastern New Mexico and the entire region turned out to \nthank us for delaying the fees.\n  Charles has a keen mind for complicated issues, and in New Mexico \ndealing with Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories the issues \ndon't get much more complicated. Charles was one of my key advisors on \nstockpile stewardship, inhalation toxicology, Nunn-Lugar, and Nunn-\nLugar-Domenici initiatives to minimize nuclear proliferation. He worked \nparticularly hard on the Industrial Partnership Program intended to \nprovide economic development to Russia. More importantly, this program \nis designed to keep Russian nuclear experts from moving to Iraq or \nLybia. This is probably one of the most important defense initiatives \nsince the Berlin wall came down.\n  He worked on minority contracting issues at Los Alamos and Sandia. \nWhen Lockheed Martin took over Sandia and initiated contract reform \nCharles ensured that small and minority contractors were able to \nmaintain their relations with Sandia.\n  Two years ago, when I rewrote the energy title of the DOD \nauthorization bill Charles initiated the negotiations with the Armed \nServices Committee and facilitated the friendly rewrite of more than 60 \npages of this important legislation.\n  Charles has a big heart. New Mexico veterans are developing a \nbeautiful Veterans' Memorial Park. When Charles heard about the effort \nduring a meeting with me and the sponsors of the park, Charles opened \nhis check book and bought the first commemorative tile.\n  Charles helped me start the Senate oil and gas forum. He is one of \nthe most knowledgeable oil and gas lawyers in the country.\n  For the past four years, Charles has been my administrative \nassistant, but our association began many, many years ago. He was \nraised in Roswell, NM, where he attended the New Mexico Military \nInstitute. While at NMMI, he was an extraordinary student and athlete. \nCharles was captain of the football team and the New Mexico Golden \nGloves heavyweight boxing champion. Before earning his B.A. in science \nand mathematics at NMMI, he received\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nmany academic and athletic honors. In fact, he graduated first in his \nclass. He later received a B.S. in civil engineering from the \nUniversity of Missouri and a J.D. from Texas Tech University's School \nof Law.\n  He previously served for 6 years as my legislative director, during \nwhich he became known for his special expertise in natural resources \nand energy issues.\n  In the private sector, he has practiced law in both Austin and \nDallas, TX, specializing in oil and gas, public lands, natural \nresources and environmental law.\n  No recounting of Charles Gentry's life of public service would be \ncomplete without noting nearly 11 years in the U.S. Army, where he \nserved with valor as a pilot of fixed and rotary-winged aircraft. When \nCharles's helicopter was shot down in combat in South Vietnam, he was \nseverely wounded and ultimately medically discharged with the rank of \nmajor. His combat decorations include the Bronze Star, Air Medal, Army \nCommendation Medal with two Oak Leak Clusters, and the Purple Heart.\n  Following his years of military service, Charles became a White House \nfellow and was assigned as a special assistant to the Attorney General \nof the United States, after which he became Director of the Office of \nSpecial Projects at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  To summarize our work together in the years that Charles has served \nme, this institution, and the people of New Mexico is a tough job, \nespecially since I know that our relationship will not end with his \nleaving my staff. This is not the end of a book, rather merely the \nclose of another chapter rich with memories and packed with \naccomplishment. I wish him much success and happiness as he opens the \ndoor to his new chapter in his life.\n  My wife, Nancy, and I look forward to many more years of friendship \nand send our best to Charles and his wife Gerrie, his parents, the Roy \nGentrys now retired in Albuquerque, his son Geoffrey and daughter \nCheryl.\n  For his fierce intellect, his incredible capacity for hard work, his \npolitical insight and his faithful friendship for so many years, I say \nfrom the bottom of my heart, ``Thank you, Charles, for a job well \ndone.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5734-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5735-S5736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN AFFAIRS REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1997, ASHCROFT \n                        ANTITERRORIST PROVISION\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the African nation of Sudan is a cradle \nand safe haven for the world's most vicious and violent terrorists. It \nis a country internationally renowned as a training base for terrorist \ngroups.\n  The Armed Islamic Group, Hamas, Abu Nidal, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, \nHezbollah, and the Islamic Group, all practice car bombing and hostage \ntaking on the sands of Sudan's deserts.\n  Sudan also harbors and protects elements of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman's \nJihad network, the terrorist organization that was involved in the \nbombing of the World Trade Center.\n  Furthermore, Sudanese diplomats at the United Nations conspired with \nJihad terrorists to bomb the U.N. complex. Sudan also reportedly \nprovided false papers and weapons for assassins who attacked Egyptian \nPresident Hosni Mubarak.\n  There is no doubt that Sudan is a state sponsor of terrorism, and the \nState Department is right to classify it as such.\n  Along with this classification, the State Department should also \nenforce strict sanctions on financial transactions with Sudan, as it \ndoes with other officially recognized state sponsors of terrorism. \nUnfortunately, the State Department has taken steps to relax sanctions \non financial transactions with Sudan. Congress passed legislation last \nyear, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, designed to \nprohibit all U.S. financial transactions with governments that support \ninternational terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, the manner in which the State Department implemented \nthe law exempted at least two terrorist states, Sudan and Syria, from \nthis ban. The State Department reads this seemingly clear legislation \nto prohibit only the financial transactions which might further \nterrorism in the United States. Transactions which furthered terrorism \noutside of the United States would be perfectly legal.\n  The bureaucrats at the State Department evidently believe that \ntransactions which further terrorism against citizens of foreign \ncountries or terrorism against Americans abroad--such as the Pan Am 103 \nflight which exploded over Scotland killing 270 people--should not be \nprohibited\n  In our debate over foreign policy and foreign affairs reform, we need \nto clearly define a consistent antiterrorism policy. The United States \nshould not allow financial transactions with state sponsors of \nterrorism, regardless of whether those financial transactions enhance \nterrorism in the United States or abroad.\n  Congress clearly intended to outlaw all financial transactions with \nthese rogue nations. Yet for reasons that have never been clearly \nexplained, the administration has chosen to allow U.S. companies to \ncontinue to do business with regimes that are intent on killing \nAmericans and terrorizing people around the globe.\n  For example, only mounting public concern and increasing \ncongressional pressure prevented this administration from allowing an \nAmerican petroleum company to participate in a $930 million oil deal \nwith the Sudanese Government. This oil deal would have provided \nhundreds of millions of dollars to this state sponsor of terrorism, \nmoney which could easily have funded attacks on U.S. citizens.\n  The State Department's implementation of last year's antiterrorism \nlaw leaves a loophole large enough to drive a truck bomb through, a \ntruck bomb similar to the one that killed 19 American military \npersonnel and injured approximately 500 more in Saudi Arabia last year.\n  One would expect the State Department to use every tool available to \nthem to curtail and smother terrorism, especially since lives are at \nstake. The terrorist groups that operate out of Sudan are responsible \nfor hundreds of attacks around the world and the deaths of thousands of \npeople, and yet our State Department refuses to use the full scope of \nthe law to aggressively isolate this criminal regime.\n\n  Abu Nidal alone has been responsible for 90 terrorist attacks in 20 \ncountries, killing or injuring almost 900 people. As I mentioned \nearlier, this terrorist organization uses Sudan as a base of \noperations.\n  I have introduced legislation, Senate bill 873, to close the \nadministration's loophole allowing most financial transactions with \nterrorist states to proceed. This legislation has been included in \nsection 1605 of the foreign affairs reform bill we are debating today \nand specifically prohibits all U.S. financial transactions with regimes \nclassified as state sponsors of terrorism, regardless of whether or not \nthe terrorist attack might occur in the United States or abroad.\n  There are some exceptions in the provision which allow certain \nfinancial transactions to proceed: transactions for humanitarian \nassistance; traveling journalists; and a national security waiver for \nclasses of financial transactions that are vital to the security \ninterests of the United States.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this is unfortunately the second time the \nSenate has had to consider legislation to prohibit financial \ntransactions with state sponsors of terrorism. If the Clinton \nadministration had chosen to implement this law correctly the first \ntime, all transactions between U.S. citizens and state sponsors of \nterrorism would already be illegal.\n  International terrorism is going to be a topic of discussion at the \nupcoming G-7 summit this weekend in Denver. The financial resources \navailable to international terrorists will be one area of discussion \nfor G-7 leaders. President Clinton will probably speak very forcibly on \nthis issue. I sincerely hope that he will also direct the State \nDepartment to implement the provisions in this legislation which \nundermine the financial resources of terrorist states. I hope the \nPresident interprets this legislation in accordance with congressional \nintent and limits the ability of American firms to provide financial \nresources to state sponsors of terrorism.\n  State sponsors of terrorism provide critical refuge and support to \nnefarious\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\norganizations committed to killing Americans and citizens of other \ncountries. Business as usual should not proceed with such regimes, and \nPresident Clinton should not have to be coaxed into aggressively \nenforcing U.S. antiterrorism laws to isolate these countries. This \nprovision will diminish the financial resources available to terrorist \nstates for their campaign of violence and hatred, and I urge the \nPresident's firm support for this anti-terrorism weapon contained in \nthe foreign affairs reform legislation before the Senate today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of any time I might have.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5735-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5736-S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CHICAGO BULLS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, \nand I would like to take the floor for 10 minutes to address an issue \nof great importance, one that is appropriate to consider as we debate \nthe foreign affairs bill, because this is an issue, to us, of worldwide \nsignificance.\n  Is there a spot in the world so removed, so distant, so isolated that \nif you would go there today and say that you were from Chicago, that \nthe people living in this far corner of the world would not immediately \nrespond: ``The home of the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan?'' I don't \nthink there is a spot in the world where you could find people who are \nnot aware of what happened in the great City of Chicago--for in 5 of \nthe last 7 years, our Chicago Bulls have won the championship of the \nNational Basketball Association.\n  We believe, quite modestly, that Chicago has become the world's \ncapital of basketball--of course, our chief of State none other than \nMichael Jordan. Those who watched the NBA finals, particularly that \nfifth game, will never forget the contribution made by this great \nathlete. Obviously suffering from some illness--flu or worse--he \nmanaged to muster the strength and courage to lead the Bulls to an \nimportant, absolutely critical victory. How many times we saw him \nrunning down that court, wondering if he could get from one end to the \nother, only to perform spectacularly when given the ball. That has been \nhis hallmark, but not just as an athlete, but as a person. He is truly \na good person. Unfortunately, in the game of sports, you can't say that \nabout all of the champions. You can certainly say it about Michael \nJordan.\n  Of course, the chief of intelligence in this world capital of \nbasketball is none other than Coach Phil Jackson. Michael Jordan and \nCoach Jackson have a rare relationship, and Michael Jordan has made it \nclear that when he plays basketball, it will be with Phil Jackson. Phil \nJackson, along with Jerry Reinsdorf as the owner, and others, can take \npride in what the Bulls have brought to professional sports and \nbasketball.\n  The Bulls' record of 171 victories and 30 losses over the last two \nseasons has set a new standard of excellence. Michael Jordan, in the \nlast five full seasons, has earned five championship rings and five MVP \nawards in the playoffs. The numbers speak for themselves.\n  You could go through the list of Chicago Bulls and find the greatness \nand sportsmanship and the kinds of leadership we in Chicago are so \nproud of. I would be remiss to not mention the contributions of Scottie \nPippen, Luc Longley, and so many others who are part of this great \nteam, and Steve Kerr's clutch shot in the last game made the \ndifference. He had had a tough time up to that moment, but when he was \ngiven the ball, he was there.\n  Yesterday, there was a big celebration in Chicago. The Sun came out \nfor a few minutes. People gathered for a great rally. I thought the \ncomment made by Michael Jordan was especially appropriate. He said \nyesterday:\n\n       This championship goes out to all the working people here \n     in the City of Chicago, who go out every day and bust their \n     butts to make a living.\n\n  Well, Michael Jordan reminded us that so many of us who take pleasure \nin watching professional sports can identify with all of the effort \nmade on the court and on the field. There are no two stronger fans of \nthe Chicago Bulls on the floor of the U.S. Senate than myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. We want to salute the Bulls. We \nare proud of them. We are proud of the city of Chicago, the city that \nworks. We are looking forward to making it a six pack next year under \nthe leadership of Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, and Scottie Pippen.\n  I yield to my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Illinois [Ms. \nMoseley-Braun] is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I just want to \nsay that the Chicago Bulls have been such a source of joy to those of \nus from Illinois. But also, because of their longstanding pursuit of \nexcellence and demonstration of excellence, they have become America's \nteam. I don't think there is a single team in this country that can \nboast 5 years of National Basketball Association championships. We won \nin 1991 against the Lakers; in 1992, against the Trailblazers; in 1993, \nagainst the Suns; in 1996 against the Supersonics; and, of course, \nrecently, against the Jazz.\n  It has been done because the players on the Chicago Bulls are--in the \nterms of a great football coach from our town--``Grabowski's.'' \n``Grabowski's'' are people who work hard and keep focused and give it \ntheir all and their best, even under adverse circumstances. Certainly, \nthat is what this team has proved over and over again that they can do. \nThey can win, whether it is at the old Chicago Stadium, in L.A., in \nPhoenix, or in the new United Center. It doesn't matter where they \nplay. They bring the same values, talent, and, most important, the same \nheart to the game. That is why they are world champions. That is why \nthey are America's team.\n  Of course, in this last game Steve Kerr can distinguish himself with \nthe 17-foot jumper, which was what some might call the ``Hail Mary'' \nplay. You just held your breath while it was going on. He drew on the \nspirit of John Paxon and made the game-winning play toward the end of \nthe game. But he could not do it alone; it was a team effort.\n  My colleague pointed to the special relationship between Michael \nJordan and Scottie Pippen, two very unique, very special players. I \nthink it can go without saying that Michael Jordan is the greatest \nplayer in the history of basketball, and we are really fortunate to \nhave him as a leader of this team.\n  In terms of leadership, certainly Coach Phil Jackson gets high marks \nfor the kind of calm, deliberative, thoughtful approach he brings to \nthe game, which is more than just a sport. It really is an exercise and \ndemonstration of human spirit and values that takes place out on the \nbasketball court.\n  I have a special place in my heart for Jerry Reinsdorf, who recently \nworked out a situation in correcting an injustice. He single-handedly \nwas able to encourage the baseball owners to award pensions to the \nplayers of the old Negro League that had been denied pensions, because \nwhen they went to the majors, there wasn't enough time to qualify for \npensions. At my request, he took that issue up and took it to the \nowners and, after all these years, they have awarded pensions to those \nold baseball players. Jerry Reinsdorf, I think, demonstrates the best \nin sports and sports owners. Again, I know he has every reason to be as \nproud of this team, as we all are.\n  At the same time, I think it must be said that the Utah Jazz played a \nphenomenal game. They were a dignified team, a disciplined team. Karl \nMalone and John Stockton were the equivalent of Scottie Pippen and \nMichael Jordan, in a way, from another part of the country. They \ndistinguished themselves in the gentlemanly way in which they handled \nthemselves throughout the series. Utah has nothing to be ashamed of. If \nanything, they have everything to be proud of in the kind of game they \nplayed in the championship competition in which they engaged. They \nsupported themselves very well. Utah and the rest of the country can be \nproud of them as well. Their coach, I think, has a great future. \nWorking with that team, he has a lot of good material to work with \nthere.\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\n  As my colleague pointed out, we are not satisfied with number 5. \nGrabowski's always want to do better, and we are looking for the six \npack, or No. 6, next year. I want to thank the Chair for this \nopportunity to commend the team and all the players. It is a team sport \nby definition. It doesn't happen just because we have superstars. They \nare all stars and they are all great. We are so proud of them, and our \ncountry has every reason to be proud of America's basketball team.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in closing, there are 102 counties in \nIllinois, and of the 12 or 13 million people in the State, most are \nBulls fans. There is one exception. Hamilton County, in southern \nIllinois, had a banner on its courthouse which said ``go Jazz go.'' Why \nwould this one county in the entire State be rooting for the Utah Jazz? \nBecause Jerry Sloan, the coach of the Jazz, came from McLeansboro, IL. \nHe played for the Bulls, and we think he learned a lot in that process.\n  I join my colleague in saluting the Jazz. What a fine team. They \nreally put up great competition. There were those in Chicago who said, \n``We are going to win this easily.'' Many of us had second thoughts. We \nknew the Jazz was a talented, dedicated team, and they played very \nwell. I salute Karl Malone and John Stockton, as well as Coach Sloan, \nand our colleagues, Senators Hatch and Bennett, the best fans the Utah \nJazz ever had. ``Wait until next year,'' they will say, and that is \nwhat we say to. Wait until next year for a six pack from the Chicago \nBulls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5736-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STARK was struck \n     by a cruise missile, causing the death of 37 United States \n     sailors.\n       (2) The China National Precision Machinery Import Export \n     Corporation is marketing the C-802 model cruise missile for \n     use against escort vessels such as the U.S.S. Stark.\n       (3) The China National Precision Machinery Import Export \n     Corporation has delivered 60 C-802 cruise missiles to Iran \n     for use by vessels of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Navy.\n       (4) Iran is acquiring land batteries to launch C-802 cruise \n     missiles which will provide its armed forces with a weapon of \n     greater range, reliability, accuracy, and mobility than \n     before.\n       (5) Iran has acquired air launched C-802 cruise missiles \n     giving it a 360-degree attack capability.\n       (6) 5,000 members of the United States Armed Forces are \n     stationed within range of the C-802 cruise missiles being \n     acquired by Iran.\n       (7) The Department of State believes that ``[t]hese cruise \n     missiles pose new, direct threats to deployed United States \n     forces''.\n       (8) The delivery of cruise missiles to Iran is a violation \n     of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1701 note).\n       (9) The Clinton Administration ``has concluded at present \n     that the known types [of C-802 cruise missiles] are not of a \n     destabilizing number and type''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to urge \n     the Clinton Administration to enforce the provisions of the \n     Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 with respect to \n     the acquisition by Iran of C-802 model cruise missiles.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I spoke on this amendment this morning \nwhen the bill was under consideration. So I will not repeat most of my \narguments at this point. It is stimulated by a report this morning from \nthe Secretary of Defense, which indicates that the Chinese Precision \nMachinery Import-Export Corp. has exported multiple versions of the C-\n802 missiles to Iran. I have notified the Senate in the past that this \ncompany has exported to Iran this particular missile for use first on \nships, then for land-based operations, and today with Secretary Cohen's \nannouncement we find that the missile will be made available to the \nIranians--indeed, is available to the Iranians for use from the air. It \ncan be fired either from an attacker or a helicopter.\n  This is a reproduction from the Chinese promotional material that was \nused to sell this missile.\n  One of the officers quoted in the briefing that the Secretary of \nDefense gave this morning said, with the addition of the air \ncapability, the 15,000 American service men and women in the gulf now \nface a 360-degree threat from land, from sea, and from air.\n  To demonstrate the power of the missile involved here, I remind the \nSenate that an Exocet missile 10 years ago struck the U.S.S. Stark and \nkilled 37 American sailors. This missile is a more modern, more \npowerful, and more deadly version.\n  Mr. President, I have been pressing the administration on this issue \nsince the first of this year, having asked questions of Secretary \nAlbright and submitting letters to Secretary Albright. All I have \nreceived is a comment from the State Department that they will \n``monitor'' the situation.\n  Mr. President, that is simply not good enough. There are 15,000 \nAmerican service men and women within the range of these missiles in \nthe Persian Gulf, and we need to stop this trade and stop it now. There \nis an ability to do this under what is called the Gore-McCain Act, \nwhich gives the President the opportunity to put sanctions on companies \nthat violate the law and says you will not export this kind of weaponry \nto Iran.\n  My amendment urges the administration to enforce the Gore-McCain Act \nand is nothing more complicated than that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, has the Senator from Utah concluded his \nexplanation of his amendment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have, but I will remain for questions, \nif there are any. It is my understanding that the Senator from Alabama \nhas a request for 5 minutes of morning business, for which I yield the \nfloor so that he can make that request. But if the Senator from \nMaryland wishes to ask questions about my amendment, I will be happy to \nremain on the floor and respond.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, actually I was going to seek a \nunanimous-consent request in order to continue the work on the bill and \noffer another amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have no objection to that request. It \nis my understanding that the Senator from Alabama has a unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama be recognized for 5 minutes to speak as if in morning \nbusiness, and that when the Senator from Alabama completes his 5 \nminutes, I ask unanimous consent that the current amendment be set \naside and that I be recognized to offer an amendment to the bill at \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for up to 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, last Thursday, June 12, I along with \nSenators DeWine, Faircloth, Hutchinson, Coats, Coverdell, and Ashcroft \nco-sponsored S. 891, Senator Spencer Abraham's Family Impact Statement \nAct of 1997. I rise today in strong support of this important piece of \nlegislation and to voice my complete disagreement with the recent anti-\nfamily action taken by President Clinton.\n  In 1987, President Ronald Reagan, realizing the importance of the \nAmerica family and the need to be constantly aware of the negative \nimpact that Federal laws and regulations can have on the family, signed \nExecutive Order 12606. The purpose of this order was to ensure that the \nrights of the family are considered in the construction and carrying \nout of policies by executive departments and agencies.\n  Mr. President, even though we are faced with the staggering increase \nin out-of-wedlock births, rising rates of divorce, and increases in the \nnumber of child abuse cases, apparently President Clinton does not \nbelieve that considering the impact of Government regulations on \nfamilies is good policy.\n  Much to my dismay, on April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed \nExecutive Order 13045, thus stripping the American family any existing \nprotection from harm in the formulation and application of Federal \npolicies.\n  President Reagan's Executive order placed special emphasis on the \nrelationship between the family and the Federal Government. President \nReagan directed every Federal agency to assess all regulatory and \nstatutory provisions ``that may have significant potential negative \nimpact on the family well-being.'' Before implementing any Federal \npolicy, agency directors had to make certain that the programs they \nmanaged and the regulations they issued met certain family-friendly \ncriteria. Specifically, they had to ask:\n  Does this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights of \nparents in educating, nurturing, and supervising their children ?\n  Does it strengthen or erode the stability of the family, particularly \nthe marital commitment?\n  Does it help the family perform its function, or does it substitute \nGovernment activity for that function ?\n  Does it increase or decrease family earnings, and do the proposed \nbenefits justify the impact on the family budget?\n  Can the activity be carried out by a lower level of government or by \nthe family itself?\n  What message, intended or otherwise, does this program send \nconcerning the status of the family?\n  What message does it send to young people concerning the relationship \nbetween their behavior, their personal responsibility, and the norms of \nour society?\n  The elimination of President Reagan's Executive order is just the \nlatest in a series of decisions that indicates the Clinton \nadministration's very different approach to family issues. From the \noutset of President Clinton's first term, it became clear that his \nadministration intended to pursue policies sharply at odds with \ntraditional American moral principles. White House actions have ranged \nfrom the incorporation of homosexuals into the military to the \nprotection of partial birth abortion procedures.\n  Mr. President, many have suggested it is community villages, in other \nwords Government, that raise children. But the real truth is, families \nraise children. Families are the ones who are there night and day to \nlove, to care for, and to nurture children.\n  Many bureaucratic regulations produce little benefit, but can have \nunintended consequences. The examples are too numerous to mention. What \nour legislation will do is require the regulators to stop and take a \nmoment to think through their regulations to make sure that, the most \nfundamental institution in civilization--the family, is not damaged by \ntheir actions. This is a reasonable and wise policy.\n\n  Mr. President, I find it very odd that of all the Executive Orders \nthat exist, President Clinton would reach down and lift this one up for \nelimination. This body should speak out forcefully on this subject and \nI am confident we will. The families of America deserve no less.\n  S. 819, The Family Impact Statement Act of 1997, is a sound and \nreasonable piece of legislation which will restore a valuable pro-\nfamily policy that has been established for ten years.\n  I urge all my colleagues to stand united, Republicans and Democrats, \nto show that the preservation of the family is not a partisan issue. \nOur voices united will send a loud and clear message to the President \nand to this nation that we consider family protection to be one of \nAmerica's most important issues and that we will not accept decisions \nwhich mark a retreat from our steadfast commitment to our Nation's \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that American families must be \nconsidered when the Federal Government develops and implements policies \nand regulations that affect families. Therefore, I am honored to be an \noriginal cosponsor S. 891 the Family Impact Statement Act of 1997 which \nwill reinstate the pro-family executive order of President Reagan.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Abraham, DeWine, \nFaircloth, Hutchinson, Coats, Coverdell, and Ashcroft for their \ndedicated work and help on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5738-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5738-S5789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FOREIGN AFFAIRS REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 393\n\n    (Purpose: To strike section 2101(g), limiting funding for U.S. \n  memberships in international organizations and requiring withdrawal \n            from organizations which exceed that limitation)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 393.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 160, strike line 18 and all that follows through \n     line 7 on page 162.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment, referring to pages 160 \nto 162 of the bill, takes out subsection (g), which is a subsection \nthat puts forward the possibility that the United States might withdraw \nfrom the United Nations. I am very frank to tell you that I don't think \nthe prospect of that eventuality ought to be raised in this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation, in effect, says that if the amount of funds made \navailable for U.S. membership exceed a certain figure, then withdrawal \nis required. Of course, we determine the amount of funds that are made \navailable. In any event, even if the figure is exceeded, I don't think \na withdrawal sanction ought to be incorporated in this legislation. If \nyou stop and think about it, that is quite a sweeping proposition.\n  Let me quote from paragraph (2) of that subsection:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United \n     States shall withdraw from an international organization. . . \n     .\n\n  It then goes on to set out the procedures for doing so, and the \ndeadline for doing so. Let me read for a second.\n\n       Unless otherwise provided for in the instrument concerned, \n     a withdrawal under this subsection shall be completed within \n     one year in which the withdrawal is required.\n\n  Then it requires the President to submit a report on the withdrawal.\n  I hope that the managers of the bill, upon reflection, will agree \nwith me that we ought not to be including in the legislation any \nprovisions that carry with them the implication of withdrawal from the \nUnited Nations.\n  The United Nations is too important an organization, and our \nparticipation in it is too critical a matter to include in this \nlegislation a provision of this sort. The provision on which I am \nfocusing runs from pages 160 to 162, providing for the withdrawal of \nthe United States from the United Nations.\n  My amendment is focused on a limited part of this bill. I have a lot \nof differences with other parts of this bill, as Members well know. I \nsupported the effort earlier in the day to take out the\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nconditionality of the payment of our arrearages, which did not prove \nsuccessful. But I am very frank to tell you that I find it a matter of \nvery deep concern--even of dismay--that this legislation should even \ninclude within it the possibility for the consideration of the \nwithdrawal of the United States from the United Nations. To suggest \nthat we are thinking of withdrawal, or that withdrawal would be \nrequired under certain circumstances, in my judgment is very \ndetrimental to our international leadership. It affects our credibility \nat the United Nations, and around the world.\n\n  What is sought in this bill, to stay within certain funding \nlimitations, is within the control of the Congress in any event. So \nthere would be other ways for the Congress, in making its decision on \nresources to be provided, to adhere to that standard. But I do not \nthink we should put it in this legislation.\n  If we are going to withdraw from the United Nations, we ought to have \na full-scale debate about withdrawing from the United Nations. \nWithdrawal from the United Nations is not some minor course of action \nto be taken lightly, not some form of discipline to address a problem \nthat can be addressed in other ways. It is a very serious matter. I \nthink even raising the prospect of withdrawal from the United Nations \nis harmful to American interests. I very much hope the managers of the \nbill will find it possible to accept this amendment.\n  I do not understand why we are, in effect, bringing in the most \nextreme remedy one could imagine, the one that most sharply affects our \ninternational leadership and our position in the United Nations, namely \nthe remedy of withdrawal. I do not think this legislation ought to have \nany mention of withdrawal from the United Nations and I very much hope \nwe will be able to take this particular section out of this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for immediate consideration of my \nmeasure.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is there not a pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 376.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 1301(a) of the bill, insert the \n     following new paragraph:\n       (6) ``Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange between \n     East and West'', $18,000,000 for the fiscal year 1998 and \n     $15,000,000 for the fiscal year 1999.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, in offering this amendment to restore funding for \nthe East-West Center in fiscal years 1998 and 1999.\n  Over the past 37 years, the East-West Center has established its \nreputation as one of the most respected and authoritative institutions \ndedicated to the advancement of international cooperation throughout \nAsia and the Pacific. The Center has played a key role in promoting \nconstructive American involvement in the Asia-Pacific region through \nits education, dialogue, research, and outreach programs. The Center \naddresses critical issues of importance to the Asia-Pacific region and \nU.S. interests in the area, including international trade, economic \ncooperation and politics, security, energy and natural resources, \npopulation, the environment, technology, and culture.\n  The achievements of the East-West Center bear repetition. Since its \ncreation by Congress in 1960, the Center has welcomed more than 53,000 \nparticipants from over 60 nations and territories to research, \neducation, and conference programs. Over 45,000 alumni have pursued \ndegrees and participated in research, training, and dialogue under \nEast-West Center grants.\n  Scholars, statesmen, government officials, journalists, teachers, and \nbusiness executives from the United States and the nations of Asia and \nthe Pacific have benefited from studies at the Center. These government \nand private sector leaders comprise an influential network of East-West \nCenter alumni throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The EWC alumni \nassociation has 35 chapters throughout Asia. I continually encounter \nproud Center alumni in meetings with Asian and Pacific island \ngovernment officials and business leaders.\n  The success of the Center as a forum for the promotion of \ninternational cooperation and the strength of the positive personal \nrelationships developed at the Center are reflected in the prestige it \nenjoys in the region. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Fiji, Papua New \nGuinea, Pakistan, and other American allies in the region--over 20 \ncountries in all--support the Center's programs with contributions. The \nCenter has also received endowments from benefactors in recognition of \nits contributions and value.\n  Mr. President, the countries of Asia and the Pacific are critically \nimportant to the United States and our political and economic interests \ninto the next century. By the year 2000, the Asia-Pacific region will \nbe the world's largest producer and consumer of goods and services. \nTheir markets for energy resources, telecommunications, and air travel \nare fast becoming the world's largest.\n  Future economic growth and job creation in the United States is \nclosely linked to our ability to identify and secure opportunities in \nthe world's fastest growing economies. The East-West Center provides \nleadership and advice on economic issues, including APEC [Asia Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation] and the U.S.-Pacific Island Joint Commercial \nCommission [JCC].\n  Mr. President, given the strategic and economic importance of the \nAsia-Pacific region to U.S. interests, and the credibility and trust \nenjoyed by the East-West Center in the region, I believe it is short-\nsighted to slash funding for the Center. While issues and developments \nin Asia are the focus of increased attention, and foreign affairs \nmandarins speak of the dawn of the Asian century, the United States has \nclosed AID offices in the region and slashed funding for programs and \norganizations--like the East-West Center. These institutions are \nvaluable to our Nation's understanding of Asia and the Pacific rim and \nour interaction with regional scholars, executives, and government \nleaders. Withdrawing our support sends signals to our friends and \nothers in the region that our commitment and engagement are tenuous.\n  For over three decades we have invested in the East-West Center, \ncreating an important resource that promotes regional understanding and \ncooperation, provides expertise on complex regional issues, and informs \nour foreign policy decisionmaking. The amendment we offer seeks to \nensure the continued existence of the East-West Center and the quality \nof its programs. If the Congress ends funding for the Center, its \nviability will be threatened and its future brought into doubt. This \namendment authorizes a modest, but essential, level of support for the \ncontinued operation of the East-West Center.\n  It communicates the importance our country places on exchange and \ncooperation with nations of the Asia-Pacific region and the lead role \nplayed by the East-West Center in promoting regional interaction and \ncooperation.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by thanking my friend and colleague \nfrom Hawaii for his leadership in this effort to preserve the mission \nand good work of the East-West Center. I also want to express my \nappreciation to our colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment and \nexpressed support for the East-West Center.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask this matter be temporarily set aside \nfor final disposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my amendment would ensure that American \ntaxpayers get a fair deal when it comes to the $900 million this bill \nauthorizes us to pay in dues to international organizations. My \namendment would ensure that the United Nations does not spend U.S. \ntaxpayer money to sponsor conventions that result in stricter--and more \nexpensive--environmental standards for Americans than other members \nhave to bear.\n  I know the chairman has worked very diligently to ensure that our \nmoney is carefully accounted for by these international organizations. \nHe has placed some strict limitations on the use of our funds, both at \nthe United Nations and by the various international boards in charge of \nspending our money, but frankly, I would like those limitations to be a \nlittle more explicit.\n  My amendment would prohibit the use of U.S. funds by the United \nNations or any affiliated international organization to propose or \npromulgate treaties that impose new environmental costs on the United \nStates--until, all other members of the United Nations have reached our \nlevel of environmental standards and enforcement.\n  Many Americans, and surely my constituents in Wyoming, have a hard \ntime understanding why we are writing a $1 billion check to \ninternational organizations and then exercising little oversight on how \nthe money is spent. I ask you to consider for a moment, the \naccountability requirements we place on our own citizens when it comes \nto use of public property or receipt of Government payments.\n  Ask a farmer what paperwork he or she had to fill out for the Farm \nServices Agency and the Natural Resource Conservation Service in order \nto get that corn or wheat payment last year-- or what bureaucratic \ntests disaster victims must endure to enlist support from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Ask an independent oil or gas producer how many reports they have to \nfile with the Minerals Management Service or with the Bureau of Land \nManagement in order to maintain a lease on Federal land.\n  Or ask a small business owner what records they have to keep in order \nto prove to Government inspectors that they are complying with OSHA \nregulations and with EPA regulations--or to prove they are complying \nwith the Family and Medical Leave Act or the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\n  Ask them how much it costs to have their taxes done. I raise these \nexamples to show how much we expect of our own citizens. We place \nenormous levels of accountability on anybody who takes initiative in \nthis country and we weigh them down with paperwork. We even hold them \naccountable to tell us exactly how much we will take from them in \ntaxes.\n  And then we turn around and hand out their money. We spread it \naround, far and wide. There are $900 million in payments to \ninternational organizations in this bill and there is almost no \naccountability. My constituents want fairness.\n  I am particularly concerned by our participation in the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and my amendment is \ndrafted to challenge that issue, among others. I am pleased that the \ncommittee wants to require the administration to tell Americans how \nmuch the treaty is going to cost. Americans should know how much it \nwill cost and who will have to pay for it. We are using their money to \nnegotiate this treaty. Let's be honest with them.\n  I think they might be surprised at what is being proposed. According \nto one independent estimate, complying with United Nations targets for \ngreenhouse gas emissions could cost this country as much as $350 \nbillion per year! That is nearly $1500 for every man, woman and child.\n  And while you are adding up that bill for the folks back home, don't \nforget to point out that we could also lose nearly 5 million jobs \ndirectly related to energy use and production. Then there will be \nseveral million more that are indirectly related.\n  That should make an impact on those hardworking American taxpayers in \nyour home State. But I'll tell you what will really get them--when they \nfind out that developing countries don't have to comply. Countries like \nChina, India, Brazil, and Mexico will only have to report on their \nemissions, not do anything about them.\n  All of this information may seem reasonable to some, but I will tell \nyou, they don't buy it in Wyoming. International organizations should \nnot be using American money to impose unfair requirements on Americans.\n  I understand the difficulty the chairman has had with these issues \nand I recognize his efforts in this bill to restrict the taxation \nauthority of the United Nations. I would like to direct a question to \nthe chairman from North Carolina, if I may.\n  Mr. Chairman, is it your belief that this bill adequately safeguards \nAmerican taxpayers from any unauthorized use of United States funds by \nthe United Nations or its affiliated environmental organizations?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his amendment and \nI, of course, share his concern with the increasing number of United \nNations treaties that impose regulatory burdens and, as he puts it, \ninfringe on the rights of the American people. In fact, the pending \nbill, S. 903, addresses many of his concerns. I demanded that this \nlegislation prohibit any funding to the United Nations until the \nSecretary of State certifies that the sovereignty of the United States \nhas not been violated.\n  A lot of people giggled about that. But as the Senator knows, it is a \nvery real problem, potentially. As the Senator also knows, many of us \nhave worked for months to develop this comprehensive United Nations \nreform package. I think the Senator will understand, and I find myself \nin a position where I simply must be faithful to the deal into which I \nhave made entry and participated. Senator Biden has been so \ncooperative. He is sticking to his bargain and I shall stick to mine. \nThis bill requires a number of key reforms at the United Nations, but \nit certainly does not require every reform that I wanted.\n  Let me say again to the Senator from Wyoming, I support his efforts \nbut I cannot support any amendment to change this package. But I will \nassure him that the Foreign Relations Committee this week will have \nhearings to consider United Nations climate change negotiations, and \nwill hold additional hearings on actions by the United Nations that \nimpose international regulatory burdens on the American people.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in light of the assurances I have received \nfrom the chairman of the committee, and from his staff regarding the \nPresidential reporting requirements contained in the bill, I will \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  I look forward to debating this issue again when we receive the \nPresidential reporting information.\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\n  Let me say before I close that this bill is a good example of a \nbipartisan effort to reduce the size of the Federal Government by \nconsolidating agencies into the State Department. Furthermore, reform \nof our policies with regard to the U.N. are long overdue. The chairman \nhas shown great leadership in negotiating this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The amendment (No. 394) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator and I assure him we will not forget \nhis interests.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 392\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Bennett offered an amendment which \nregular order would make the pending business, would it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order does put us back on the Bennett \namendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. Let me make a few comments before we \nconsider regular order.\n  On February 8 of last year, 1996, I sent a letter to President \nClinton urging that he no longer tolerate Chinese-Iranian missile \ncooperation and transfers. At that time I noted that U.S. \nnonproliferation laws provided ``a clear, legal requirement--and I am \nquoting from my letter--that sanctions be levied against China for its \nmissile sales to Iran,'' and I appealed to the President at that time \nto act decisively. In response, the President assured me that he would, \nin fact, and in deed, implement the missile sanctions law, and he used \nthe words, ``faithfully and fully'' when the United States had \ndetermined that sanctionable activities have occurred.\n  Senator Bennett and I were speaking about that a while ago. We have \nbeen waiting for more than a year. Meanwhile, repeated media reports \nhave confirmed beyond any peradventure whatsoever that Chinese-Iranian \nmissile cooperation continues apace, and that the United States is well \naware of these activities and that the administration has deliberately \nelected to ignore Sections 73 and 81 of the Arms Export Control Act, \nand the 1992 Iran-Iraq nonproliferation act.\n  In fact, an article in the Washington Times last November 21, I \nbelieve it was, purports to quote from a classified October 2, 1996 CIA \nreport entitled, ``Arms Transfers to State Sponsors of Terrorism.'' \nAmong the transfers reported are missile guidance components, 400 \nmetric tons of chemicals for Iran's chemical warfare program, and \nadvanced cruise missiles.\n  There can be no doubt that China's provision of advanced missile \ntechnology and equipment to Iran directly threatens our national \nsecurity interests and directly contravenes U.S. law. Over the past \nseveral years, Iran has purchased Sunburn, C-801 and C-802 antiship \ncruise missiles, fast attack missile boats, diesel submarines, and \nnaval mine warfare capabilities.\n  In addition, Iran has reportedly been constructing tunnels along the \ncoast of the Persian Gulf to shelter ballistic missiles. And Iran may \nhave deployed antishipping missiles on islands at the mouth of the \nPersian Gulf--which, as anybody who has been there knows, is a natural \nchoke point, useful for strangling our flow of oil through the gulf.\n  These new capabilities pose a serious risk to the U.S. naval presence \nin the region, and to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar's oil and natural \ngas refineries along the coast.\n  The point is, the White House should be prepared to, as it promised, \nfully and faithfully respond with the sanctions required by law for \nChina's proliferation activities, as the President assured me he would \nin a letter last year.\n  In closing, I welcome Senator Bennett's remarks and his amendment.\n  Let me inquire of the Chair if the yeas and nays have been obtained \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \namendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think this would be a good time to have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. How long will the Senator need?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I can ask the Senator if Senator \nWellstone and I can proceed as we had discussed for a few moments \noutside of the legislative business.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is what I am inquiring about.\n  Mr. KERRY. Somewhere, say, around 12 minutes I think we should be \nable to finish; 12 minutes, Mr. President, divided between the two of \nus.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone and I be permitted to proceed as in morning business, with \nthe interruption not to show in the course of the legislative day on \nthe foreign relations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object. Can I ask the \nparliamentary situation? I take it the Bennett amendment was offered \nand set aside, and then I offered an amendment and that was set aside. \nIs there another amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii offered an amendment, \nand that has been set aside, and the regular order is the Bennett \namendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply say to the chairman, I am quite happy to \ncooperate with the committee in setting aside the amendments, but I ask \nthe chairman if I can have the courtesy of being given a little bit of \nnotice--not much--just in order to get here when the chairman thinks he \nmay go back to considering my amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well. I give that assurance to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Just one moment, Mr. President. I suggest that the \nCloakrooms be notified of the proximity of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 918 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. In connection with the pending amendment to be voted on \nshortly by the distinguished Senator from Utah, I hope that my request \nwill be approved that we await the arrival of Senator Biden, because he \nmay want to have some comments on it, too.\n  So in that context, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest we go to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Utah, amendment No. 392. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kemp-\nthorne] is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. \nDaschle], the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Johnson] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] \nis absent to attend a funeral.\n  I also announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 103 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\n\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Daschle\n     Harkin\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n  The amendment (No. 392) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

The Inouye amendment No. 376.\n  Mr. HELMS. Just those two?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have just proposed to the majority leader we move in \ncycles of three amendments, certainly for rollcall purposes, and he \nthinks that would be a good idea. It may be that we will be able to \nhandle some of these on a voice vote, but I do not know.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nbusiness be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] and the Senator \nfrom Oregon [Mr. Wyden] and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 395.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 321 through 326 and insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 321.--International Broadcasting.--The Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors and the Director of the International \n     Broadcasting Bureau shall continue to have the \n     responsibilities set forth in title III of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and 1995 (22 \n     U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), except that, as further set forth in \n     chapter 3 of this title, references in that Act to the United \n     States Information Agency shall be deemed to refer to the \n     Department of State, and references in that Act to the \n     Director of the United States Information Agency shall be \n     deemed to refer to the Under Secretary of State for Public \n     Diplomacy.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 903, \nthe State Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. What my \namendment would do is strike the provisions in division A of the bill \nconcerning international broadcasting activities in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I find it rather extraordinary that in the very bill \nthat seeks to reorganize and consolidate the foreign policy apparatus \nof the U.S. Government, we find language to create a new independent \nFederal agency to administer the U.S. international broadcasting \nprogram. Let me be clear on this: This bill creates a new Federal \nagency. It grants that agency the authorities and mandates that all \nFederal agencies have under title 5. It also gives the agency the \nauthority to hire temporary workers and to grant them reimbursement for \ntheir services, and it also gives the agency the authority to receive \ndonations. So despite the claims you will shortly hear that are to the \ncontrary, make no mistake, Mr. President, this is a new agency.\n  Now, some will argue, of course, that there is no net increase in \nFederal agencies since at the same time that we create a new \nindependent agency to operate the international broadcasting \noperations, we are also abolishing the U.S. Information Agency. So you \nwill probably hear the argument that we are giving up one and adding a \nnew one. I am afraid, though, Mr. President, that that argument hardly \npasses the laugh test. It is a new agency. You can be sure of one \nthing: It is going to act like an agency, too.\n\n  This language simply makes no sense in light of the hard work that \nthe Congress invested in 1993 and 1994 in restructuring the United \nStates' role in overseas broadcasting. We consolidated various programs \nand we took some very clear steps to move Radio Free Europe and Radio \nLiberty down the road to privatization.\n  In the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994, the \nForeign Relations Committee took the lead in doing something that is \nall too unusual. It is unusual to find a program eliminated in \nWashington, but we, in that committee, and on this floor, Mr. \nPresident, actually wiped out a Federal agency. At the time, that \nagency was called the Board for International Broadcasting or the BIB. \nWe consolidated all of our Government's international broadcasting \nprograms, including the Voice of America, as well as the so-called \nsurrogate programs, such as RFE/RL. We did it within one Federal \nagency--the U.S. Information Agency, which is the government's public \ndiplomacy arm.\n  The 1994 act imposed tight fiscal controls on the two programs that \nwere rife with fiscal abuse and mismanagement. It mandated steps toward \nprivatization for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Very \nimportantly, it also ensured an active role by the inspector general. \nAs a result, Mr. President--and this is no small matter--of this one \nseries of actions and consolidation, we saved the Federal Government, \nthe taxpayers of this country, on this one change alone, close to $1 \nbillion over a 9-year period. This isn't me talking about what can be \ndone if we do something--we did it. We started in 1993 and we saved $1 \nbillion. That was my first bill here as a Member of the Senate. I am \nextremely pleased that the changes proposed in this bill cannot undo \nthe fiscal progress that we have made in the past. I add that, at this \ntime, when we are trying so hard to finalize our promising work on \nbalancing the budget that this $1 billion in savings was an important \nstep in that direction.\n  But there was more to the story--a story of abuse. At the time \nCongress took this action, the RFE/RL was spending 25 percent of their \nbudget on administrative costs, while the Voice of America was spending \nless than half of that--only 12 percent. Lavish salaries. Mr. \nPresident, there were salaries of $200,000 to $300,000, paid by the \nAmerican taxpayers; and perks for executives that were a deeply \ningrained way of life in these programs. These excesses are what \ninspired me and other Members of Congress to take a long hard look at \nhow to fix this problem. This, of course, is our role--to oversee the \nprograms of the executive branch and protect the dollars of the people \nwho elect us.\n  In this particular case, we actually did a pretty good job, after \nmany years. Now, though, Mr. President, I am concerned about what will \nhappen in the future. Now the Foreign Relations Committee has reported \nout a bill that includes language to recreate what, to me, looks \nvirtually identical to this old BIB, the agency we finally got rid of. \nIt creates an independent Federal agency, governed by a board of \ndirectors. Others may say that the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or \nthe BBG, under the arrangement assumed by this bill, is very different \nfrom the old BIB. I will agree that the BBG is a stronger, more \ndisciplined body than its predecessor; but because of its worldwide \npresence, international broadcasting is unfortunately an area that is \nalmost inherently vulnerable to mismanagement and abuse. It is very \nhard to oversee, especially if\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\nit is constituted through an independent agency.\n  In the past, the BIB fell prey to these vulnerabilities and exercised \nvirtually no control over the abuse of the radios under its \njurisdiction. There were two decades worth of GAO and inspector general \nreports noting fiscal and other problems with the radios, but the BIB \njust chose to ignore them. Spending abuses were brought under control \nunder the BBG structure because of very detailed congressional mandates \ncontained in the 1994 legislation. That didn't happen because the board \nsuddenly decided to clean up its act nor because of any inherent \nqualities of the BBG itself; it is because we here in Congress did our \njob and mandated that this organization clean up its act.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my view that recreating this independent \nstructure is a roadmap for a return to where we started out 3 years \nago. I find it simply incomprehensible that just as we are \nconsolidating our foreign policy apparatus under the reorganization \nplan in this bill, we would create a new Federal agency that is \nvirtually identical to the one we wiped out less than 3 years ago.\n  Mr. President, let me outline briefly the problems I have with this \nbroadcasting section of the bill. First, fiscal abuse. The structure \nproposed by the bill, as I have indicated, has historically been a \nbreeding ground for fiscal abuses. These weren't just uncovered 3 years \nago. I have a stack of GAO reports and IG reports going back two \ndecades documenting the fiscal abuses that this independent structure \ngenerated. It was this independent structure, sitting out by itself, \nnot being managed or controlled by any part of our Federal Government \ndirectly, that had these problems.\n  A colleague from many years ago, Senator John Pastore, in 1976, said \nof the problems of this organization, ``The abuse has reached the point \nof becoming almost scandalous * * *'' That is what we put an end to in \n1994. We put an end, finally, to two decades of abuse.\n  A second problem, Mr. President, is privatization. We made a clear \ncommitment in 1994 that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty would be \nprivatized by the end of this century, only 2\\1/2\\ years from now. Mr. \nPresident, why would we now recreate an independent agency to \nadminister the grants for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty for such \na short period of time? If we create this new entity, I can assure you \nthat somehow it will find a justification to continue. All of the hard \nwork and all of the consensus that was developed around the basic idea \nthat it is high time that RFE/RL be privatized will be under attack. We \nhave a chance to finally privatize something. We are almost there. But \nthis bill seeks to undo that.\n  Third, Mr. President, as I have indicated several times, and will \nagain, this bill creates a new Federal agency. I find it hard to \nbelieve that this Congress, which has been dedicated to downsizing the \nFederal Government and achieving deficit reduction, would choose to \ncreate today a new Federal agency--an agency that isn't even needed. \nThat is exactly what these provisions will do--create an unnecessary, \nnew Federal agency, with all the overhead, all the bureaucracy, and all \nof the trappings of a brand new agency.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to respond briefly to the arguments made \nby the proponents of this proposal and, in particular, my good friend \nand leader on these issues, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, \nwho cares deeply about this issue.\n  First, Mr. President, he asserts that the fiscal controls and \nmeasures designed to curb the kinds of flagrant abuses that plagued \nRFE/RL in the past will be retained under the new structure, and that \nnothing we achieved in terms of deficit reduction will be lost as a \nresult of the new structure he has proposed. I sure hope he is right; \nbut I doubt it. I appreciate the intent, but I am concerned that \nhistory has shown that just the opposite is going to happen, that what \nwe have achieved could well be undermined by recreating the kind of \nstructure and incentives that led to these problems in the first place.\n  Now, what do I mean by incentives? I mean the natural propensity of \nany institution--especially an entirely independent institution--to \nprotect itself, to try to expand itself, and to relentlessly try to \nfind a way to justify its existence. That is inherent in the nature of \nindependent agencies.\n  If the radios are actually going to be privatized by the end of 1999, \nwhat is this new Federal agency going to be doing in 2\\1/2\\ years? Are \nthey going to be running the Voice of America? Is there a reason, all \nof a sudden, after all these years, to create a new agency to run the \nVoice of America? I don't think so. I don't think the Senator from \nDelaware would be proposing this structure if his concern was the \nindependence of the Voice of America. Rather, his concern has been \nclearly stated in the past, and it is to house the surrogate radios, \nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and others that are scheduled to lose \ntheir Federal support in 1999.\n\n  Even Radio Free Asia, RFA, has a sunset date in the authorizing \nlegislation that terminates its authority in 1998. So what is the \nagency going to do after all these rather up and coming dates arrive? \nWhat are they going to do, Mr. President? Are they going to lobby \nMembers to extend these deadlines? I am concerned that they will. Is \nthere any doubt in the minds of anyone in this room that if we create a \nnew Federal agency, it will do all it can to find good reasons to argue \nthat it has to continue to exist.\n  Secondly, the proponents of these provisions will say that we are \ntalking about something different here because the broadcasting \nfunctions have been successfully consolidated into one agency. We \nmandated the consolidation intentionally, Mr. President, to save money \nand to eliminate duplication. Mr. President, if these provisions are \nadopted, the gains we made in both of these areas could be lost. Rather \nthan using, in the name of efficiency, the accounting, personnel, and \nsupport services that already exist in the State Department--as it has \nwith the services of USIA--this new entity will have to have its own \nlegal office; it will have to have its own personnel department; it \nwill have to have its own publication office, and who knows what else. \nThat is what you get when you set up a new Federal agency. That agency \nneeds all of those new things, instead of having the State Department \nhandle it under its current budget.\n  Again, these provisions--and, Mr. President, I hope I am making the \ncase--head in completely the opposite direction, not only of the whole \nspirit of the last couple of Congresses, but specifically in the \nopposite direction of the whole point of the bill the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has put forward in terms of \nconsolidation and reorganization.\n  Now, some may say that Congress can protect the taxpayer by \nmaintaining the spending caps we put into the 1994 legislation. I am \ncertainly glad those caps are still there, and that may be true for \nthose programs that are capped. But what is not clear is what happens \nwith administrative costs.\n  Mr. President, the comptroller's office of USIA has explained to my \nstaff that some $28 million in administrative services are currently \nprovided to the broadcasting operations by the United States \nInformation Agency. This represents expenditures that are over and \nabove the annual operating budget for the broadcasting operations. \nInstead, these costs are borne by USIA for property and for \nhousekeeping functions, such as payroll, the payment and vouchers, \naccounting, contracting, and security. On these latter items, \nbroadcasting ``borrows'' partial time from USIA employees to carry out \nhighly specialized tasks. If the broadcasting operations are to be \nseparated out from USIA, as is contemplated by this bill now, it \nremains very unclear how broadcasting would get these services. Would \nthe new public diplomacy bureau at the State Department have to provide \nthese services and, if so, how would that be calculated? Or what would \nconcern me the most is, will the new broadcasting entity, this new \nFederal agency, simply have to hire its own people, new Federal \nemployees, new Federal positions to carry out those services?\n  The point, Mr. President, is that the broadcasting operations \ncurrently appear to gain significant economies of scale by using the \ninfrastructure of the USIA. That is what we caused to happen a few \nyears ago. After decades of\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nabuse, we finally forced this Government to show some efficiency and \nconsolidation, and we got some economic benefit out of it. Instead, \ncreating a new agency may lead us to lose those savings and force this \nnew entity to come to Congress for new funds, or it may lead to a \nsituation in which the broadcasting activities lose out when, for every \nnew attorney, or office, or light bulb, and all the bureaucracy that \ngoes with it, there will be less broadcasting hours to some far-flung \nplace in the world to which we believe it is in our national interest \nto communicate. I guess this doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Third, Mr. President--and this is really the most philosophical of \nthe arguments--there are those who really passionately believe that an \nindependent structure is required or is necessary in order to protect \nwhat is called the ``journalistic independence'' of these programs, and \nreally this question gets to the core of what is going on.\n  Either you think it is our national interest to continue to pay for--\nnot just subsidize, but pay for--independent radio programs, or you \ndon't! I, for one, think it is essential to compare the surrogate \nradios to the Voice of America. VOA was created to be, and remains, an \nessential tool for the U.S. government to communicate U.S. policies and \nprerogatives to the rest of the world. Let me quote directly from the \nPresident's budget request concerning VOA's mission: ``The Voice of \nAmerica was founded in 1942 to provide accurate, objective and \ncomprehensive news and information about America and the world to \nlisteners in other countries.'' VOA now broadcasts in more than 50 \nlanguages. WORLDNET television similarly supports and explains U.S. \npolicy objectives to foreign audiences worldwide. VOA and WORLDNET \nemployees are U.S. government employees, and no one doubts that a \nprimary mission is to communicate the views of the U.S. government.\n  The surrogates--Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty--on the other \nhand, concentrate their resources on reporting and analyzing domestic \nand regional events in the countries to which they broadcast. As \nsomeone who believes strongly in the rights of free speech and \nexpression, I do not doubt that the development of independent media is \nperhaps one of the most important challenges for a newly democratizing \ncountry. And I do not question those who think that the United States \nshould actively support or encourage such outlets. But that does not \nnecessarily imply that we should bear the cost of running an entire \nservice! The fact that U.S. tax payers are still subsidizing RFE/RL \nbroadcasts to Poland astounds me. We are, in fact, subsidizing the \ncompetition in Poland and, in so doing, may even be preventing the \ndevelopment of other alternatives for this kind of activity in that \ncountry. But setting aside for a moment whether we should continue to \npay for broadcasting in countries like Poland, let me focus upon the \nissue of so-called ``journalistic independence.''\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly review some of the history.\n  First, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were established by the \nCIA, a fact widely known, for the purpose of undermining communist \ngovernments.\n  Second, they have been funded by the US taxpayers from their \ninception, a fact that is also widely known and not disputed.\n  Third, the Board of Directors for this new entity, like the current \none, is appointed by the President of the United States. I would like \nto know how you can be independent of the U.S. government when your \ngoverning board is appointed by the President of the United States!\n  Let me make sure everyone understands the bizarre relationship \nbetween the BBG and RFE/RL. This is an interlocking board of directors: \nthe members of the BBG are--by statute--identical to the members of the \nRFE/RL board. As bizarre as it may be to an outsider, the BBG gives a \ngrant to RFE/RL, even through they each have the same board. And these \nboard members are all appointed by the President of the United States!\n  Fourth, their budget is debated by Congress each year. Numerous \nCongressional committees call them up to account for how this money is \nbeing spent. We are even debating it right now.\n  So how can you even make any kind of claim to be independent on those \nfacts? No one is going to buy it.\n  In fact, as the fifth point, let us be honest. The rest of the world \nviews these radios as belonging to--guess who? The United States. \nWhatever games you want to play with their names or their governing \nstructures, everybody knows these broadcasts represent the views of the \nUnited States. U.S. officials parade through these facilities abroad \nall the time.\n  When President Clinton was in Prague in early 1994, the President of \nthe Czech Republic offered the United States facilities within Prague \nto house RFE/RL. The Czech President offered the buildings to the U.S. \nPresident, because he knew, as the whole world knows, that these radios \nare 100 percent owned by the US government, paid for by the US \ntaxpayers, and subject to oversight by the US Congress.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I do not see how these programs can ever \nreally be independent as long as they are dependent upon federal \nfunding. If they want journalistic independence, the best way is the \nold-fashioned way: stop taking Federal dollars.\n  If these programs need autonomy and independence, the best thing they \ncan do is to privatize.\n  Mr. President, I know the debate over ``journalistic independence'' \nand over how the United States can best support newly emerging \ndemocracies is one that can be highly emotional for many Members of \nthis Chamber. But whichever side my colleagues come out on, I urge you \nto consider what I find to be the most offensive part of this bill, and \nthat is the provision to create a new, independent federal agency.\n  I do not want to be repetitive, but I just can't believe that the \nSenate, that this body that is working so hard to eliminate \ninefficiencies and duplications in the Government, would have supported \nprovisions such as these in a bill such as this.\n  So Mr. President, let me point out that my amendment has been \nendorsed by groups who have worked hard to reduce the Federal deficit \nand eliminate unnecessary spending programs, including Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste and Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense regarding this amendment and in support of the \namendment be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, to conclude, the letter from Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense really did a good job of reiterating that the question \nunderlying this debate is whether the Senate is capable of following \nthrough on budget cuts. If we today recreate the same BIB structure we \nabolished just 3 years ago, the savings achieved in the 1994 act could \nbe jeopardized and the effort to privatize these radios could be \nundermined by this new agency as it desperately struggles to justify \nits existence.\n  I hope that the Members of the Senate will reject the creation of \nthis new Federal agency and adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Taxpayers for Common Sense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1997.\n     Attn: Foreign Relations L.A.--floor action Monday, June 16.\n\n                  Taxpayers Ask: Why Can't Senate Cut?\n\n\n        support feingold amendment on state dept. authorization\n\n  the 1994 law terminated the bib and said radio free europe will be \n                               privatized\n\n           why does committee bill create new agency for rfe\n\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers the State \n     Department Reauthorization bill, Taxpayers for Common Sense \n     strongly urges you to support the Feingold amendment.\n       In 1994, Congress passed legislation terminating the Board \n     of International Broadcasting (BIB), an independent federal \n     agency responsible for administering Radio Free Europe and \n     Radio Liberty [RFE/RL]. In doing so, the legislation mandated \n     that steps be taken to privatize RFE/RL. The legislation also \n     established a Broadcasting Board of Governors within the U.S. \n     Information Agency in order to curb extensive internal \n     problems that plagued the programs under the BIB structure.\n       Contrary to the law and to congressional intent--and \n     contrary to the House bill--the\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\n     version of the State Department Authorization Bill recently \n     reported by the Foreign Relations Committee would actually \n     create a new federal agency strikingly similar to the old \n     BIB. Congress terminated the BIB just three years ago with \n     overwhelming bipartisan support. The BIB structure fostered \n     rampant fiscal abuses, lavish executive salaries and \n     executive perks, despite numerous GAO and Inspector General \n     reports noting fiscal problems over the course of two \n     decades.\n       The Feingold amendment would strike the provisions that \n     would create a new federal agency and ensure that RFE/RL is \n     privatized by December 31, 1999, as indicated by the \n     International Broadcasting Act of 1994. TCS supports this \n     amendment. While the budgetary savings may be relatively \n     small compared to the entire federal budget, the questions at \n     stake are large: Can the Senate follow through on budget \n     cuts? Is the Senate incapable of maintaining even this tiny \n     budget cut? Is foreign spending exempt from the budget cuts \n     that impact Americans at home? The Feingold amendment is a \n     step toward restoring the confidence of American taxpayers \n     that U.S. international programs are wise expenditures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ralph DeGennaro,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I admire the Senator's tenacity, and I \nadmire his commitment to save the American taxpayers money. His \ntenacity on this score has exceeded his savings. Let me explain what I \nmean by that. He won. If this is about deficits, he won. He was right. \nHe saved the taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. He, through \nhis leadership, changed the way in which we used to deal with all these \nradios. He has won.\n  If I wouldn't be taken out of context--he would understand the humor \nin this--I wish he would take that old speech and send it home and say, \n``I won.'' I mean, take credit for what you did. You did a wonderful \nthing. You really did. You did a wonderful thing. But their ain't no \nmore money to save. You saved it. This doesn't cost another penny.\n  That is No. 1.\n  This is not about deficits. It was about deficits, but you won. You \ndid a good thing. You reorganized the radios.\n  It is like that famous line, I guess it was President Reagan's, ``The \nRussians just do not know how to take yes for an answer.'' You won. And \nI am not being solicitous when I say the Nation owes you a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Now, on the second point, your tenacity: Your tenacity is well known, \nbut I think in this case it is misplaced. This isn't about deficits \nanymore. Let's talk about what it really is about.\n  It is about whether or not Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are \nanachronisms or still have a relevance--no matter how well run they \nare, no matter how streamlined they are, no matter how efficient they \nare, no matter how cost effective they are.\n  That is the core of the debate between the Senator and I, although I \nsuspect he would characterize it differently. I think they are vitally \nimportant.\n  It is not communism now. It is chaos now. It is not communism. It is \nthe threat of totalitarianism. It is not communism. It is freedom, \nmarket economies, and it is about journalistic integrity and \nindependence.\n  Everything the Senator said is factually correct except one thing. \nHow do I explain it? I think the rhetorical question is: Tell me how \nthese are independent? I will tell you: Forty years of history. All of \nEastern Europe said, ``When I hear VOA, I hear the State Department. \nWhen I hear Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, I hear an independent \nvoice.'' That is literally how it worked.\n  I don't presume to compete with my friend from Wisconsin--and I am \nnot being solicitous when I say this--who is a Rhodes scholar and a man \nof significant accomplishment, with my knowledge of history. I am not \ntrying to play games and educate him, except I suggest to him that he \nask those Eastern European freedom fighters of the past 40 years. They \nknew that the Federal Government paid for Radio Free Europe or Radio \nLiberty. Why did they listen to it and take what it said as gospel and \nnot the Voice of America, or other pronouncements that came out? The \nreason was the same reason that exists today in China. We set up a \nthing called Radio Free Asia, the same category Radio Free Europe used \nto be in--still is in.\n  What is the difference? Our Ambassador in Beijing can say with all \nhonesty--and the Chinese Government knows that it is true--``I can't \ncontrol those guys.''\n  What do they do? Let me give you an example of what would not happen \nif these radios, as we call them, were within the State Department \nwhere we moved the USIA. They would not at this moment be able to read \non air the memoirs of Wei Jing Sheng, one of China's leading dissidents \nwho is in prison. It is driving the Chinese Government crazy that the \npeople of China can hear unobstructed his memoirs being read on air.\n  Do you think the Secretary of State--this one or the last one--would \nhave the nerve in the mix of negotiations with the Chinese on \neverything from proliferation to trade to upset the apple cart? I can \nsee it now. Beijing picking up the phone, and saying, ``Stop, or we do \nthe following with regard to these other negotiations.'' We have seen \nit happen a hundred times. But Beijing knows that the way we have set \nthis up means that the President cannot control it. He can come up to \nus and say, ``Don't fund it any longer.'' Or he can try to stack the \nboard to get people on the board who will not allow journalistic \nindependence.\n\n  But the reason why it works is that we have 40 years' experience--40 \nyears of watching it work. The bona fides of these radios have been \nproven.\n  So the Senator is correct. Absent this history, one would say this is \na veil. There are only four or five veils between the radios and \nindependence and they are nothing but veils. History indicates that \nthey are walls, and that they brought walls tumbling down--the Berlin \nwall.\n  I acknowledge that I probably feel more strongly about the radios and \ntheir independence than a majority of my colleagues. But I truly \nbelieve, Mr. President, if they were needed during the cold war, they \nare needed in this decade of chaos as much as they were then.\n  Look, what happens in China, in large part, is going to be a product \nof what the people of China know is happening.\n  My friend, Senator Kerry, who shares the view of my friend from \nWisconsin, says, ``Look, we have CNN.'' That is true. ``Look, we have \nthe Internet.'' That is true. They are all very positive and they are \nreal and they are genuine, but I would argue they make my case. Because \nreally what my friends are saying--I will speak for Senator Kerry--is \nthat, although the radios are independent, we don't need this other \nindependent voice now because we have this independent thing called CNN \nand we have this thing called the Worldnet. I say to you, things are \nbetter than they were because we do have CNN. I say to you things are \nbetter in the world in terms of the access to information throughout \nChina because we have the Worldnet. But I say to you, we will be, in \nthe ultimate sense, penny-wise and pound-foolish if we take what also \nis a proven, genuinely important, worldwide, respected vehicle called \nthe radios and do them in.\n  And what for? What money are we going to save? What are we saving \nhere? Let us get this straight--not that the Senator has not been \nstraight; he has been. But, for me, because I am kind of simple-minded, \nlet's reorganize this and lay it out. For me, it is important to \nunderstand the pieces. The first piece of this is, the Senator says \nthat there is all this bloated bureaucracy in this board that used to \nrun the radios. He is right. There was leadership. We changed that. We \ncut these bloated salaries. We cut out the fat. We made them use the \nsame transmitters. We consolidated the ability to transmit these \nmessages over the air. We literally moved our operation in Europe into \nPrague from Germany. We did a lot of things. This bill does not change \none single solitary bit of the reform that has taken place.\n  Then my friend says we are going to spend more money. We put caps--\nthrough his leadership--on the amount of money that could be spent in \nthese functions. We maintained these caps. If I can find my place in my \nnotes here, I will find out exactly what the caps are. What page am I \non? The caps for RFE/RL are $75 million a year; Radio Free Asia, $22 \nmillion a year. These caps are kept on this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\n  My friend says we have created this new bureaucracy. We have created \nno new bureaucracy. We created this new board in 1994 through his \nleadership. It upsets my friend that I am not sucking that board into \nthe State Department. There is USIA. It is sitting out here and it has, \nwithin USIA, that board. In the reorganization, led by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, we take all the agencies that are sitting outside there \nand bring them into the State Department. So we take all of the USIA \nout except for one thing: We leave this board sitting there. We do not \nrecreate it. We just leave it where it was, independent. But still with \nall the strings attached as to how much money it can spend, all the \nrequirements for RFE and RFL regarding privatization. They all remain, \nbut what also remains is the journalistic integrity, the inability of \nthe Secretary of State to say, hey, don't--don't broadcast those \nmemoirs.\n  I am not suggesting this Secretary would say that. I do not know what \nshe would say. But there is nothing she can do about that, or that a \nfuture Secretary can do about that.\n  The Senator suggests there is going to be a new bloated bureaucracy. \nWe have a thing in the law that exists right now called the Economy \nAct, which means that any lawyers that are needed by RFE/RFL, any \nlawyers needed by the board that is going to conduct overseas radios, \ncan be lawyers that can be borrowed from the existing lawyers in USIA. \nThere is no requirement to hire anybody new. And you have caps on what \nwe can spend on them anyway.\n  That is how it works right now. VOA--my friend always talks about RFE \nand RL, Radio Liberty. There is the Voice of America, Radio and TV \nMarti, and Radio Free Asia. They are sitting there. We have to \nprivatize, under the law, RFE and RL, by the same date required in the \noriginal legislation. We kept that in. But we still have these other \nthree major pieces out there. So the notion of the board's \nresponsibilities rests in the management of those as well, even when \nprivatization occurs.\n\n  The other rhetorical question I would ask my friend is, he says this \nundermines privatization, that this proposal to privatize the European \nradios, which we urged in the sense of Congress in 1994, would be \nundermined. This provision remains intact. Moreover, the Senator is \nsponsor of an amendment asking for periodic reports toward this \nobjective, which the committee included in this bill. And, as I said, \nthe board oversees more than the European radios, so they will have \nplenty to do after privatization. The others are not part of the \nprivatization scheme.\n  Keep in mind the overarching rationale for privatization. It is, hey, \nwe don't need this message going into Eastern Europe or Central Europe \nor the former Soviet Republics.\n  I want to tell you, I sure would like that message going into \nByelarus. I am glad it is going in now. I sure like the idea the \nmessage is going into Bosnia. I sure like the messages going into these \nformer Soviet states or Soviet-client states. But I acknowledge that is \na debate for another day, whether or not these radios make sense \nanyway. I think they make a great deal of sense.\n  But make no mistake about it, that is the core of the distinction \nbetween what the Senator from Wisconsin and I view to be the right \ncourse of action. You notice that the Senator is always painfully \nhonest. He points out and acknowledges he had the privatization \nlanguage still in here, but he presumes it will not be privatized now \nthat the board is sitting out here and staying out here. I would argue \nthat the likelihood of privatization occurring is in direct proportion \nto how much light is shed on the process. When you have this board \nsitting out here by itself, justifying its existence and its actions, \nit is a lot more likely that we are going to pay attention to it, \nparticularly when we have to confirm the head of the board. As a matter \nof fact, the whole board requires Senate confirmation.\n  The Senate worries about the radios not going toward privatization. \nHow many members of the board are there, eight? He is going to have \neight shots, plus Mr. Duffy, who is going to be the new Under Secretary \nof State for Public Diplomacy. He has plenty of chances. He has nine \nchances in confirmation hearings before our committee. Put the board \ninside and it's a different story.\n  The other point I would like to raise--and there is so much to say on \nthis, but you have heard me so many times I will try not to say all \nthere is to say. The cost will go up, is the second argument. He \nindicates that the cost will increase by $25 to $30 million. He said \nthe board and the radios now receive $28 million in administrative \nservices from the USIA, the U.S. Information Agency. All this is true, \nbut who does he think is paying the $28 million now? The $28 million \nthat went for them administering the agency will not go to them now. \nThe net cost to the American taxpayer will not change. Chairman Helms \nand I received a letter from David Burke, the chairman of the board. I \nask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Broadcasting Board of Governors, United States of \n           America,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Helms and Senator Biden: I have been advised \n     of the provisions related to international broadcasting \n     contained in Division B of S. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform \n     and Restructuring Act of 1997, as reported by the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations.\n       My colleagues and I agree with Senator Biden that, under \n     any reorganization scenario, an independent, bipartisan \n     governing board, nominated by the President and confirmed by \n     the Senate, is essential to ensuring the coherence, quality, \n     and journalistic integrity which preserves the credibility, \n     and therefore effectiveness, of the broadcasting services.\n       Further, with respect to concerns about additional costs \n     expressed by Senators Feingold and Kerry during the \n     Committee's markup last Thursday, the Board believes that a \n     transfer of existing broadcasting support costs and personnel \n     from USIA to the international broadcasting entity would be a \n     ``cost neutral'' transaction within the foreign affairs \n     budget function. Such a transfer would cover space costs and \n     management support services currently provided by USIA, \n     including security, accounting, payroll, training, and \n     procurement. This transfer from USIA to the international \n     broadcasting entity would coincide with the consolidation of \n     USIA into the Department of State, and would not represent a \n     net increase in total funds or employment.\n       The BBG is committed to ensuring that America's \n     international broadcasting services remain a cost-efficient, \n     highly effective means of promoting this nation's interests \n     abroad.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David W. Burke,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. This is just one paragraph from it.\n\n       . . . the Board believes that a transfer of existing \n     broadcasting support costs and personnel from USIA to the \n     international broadcasting entity would be a ``cost neutral'' \n     transaction within the foreign affairs budget function. Such \n     a transfer could cover space costs and management support \n     services currently provided by USIA, including security, \n     accounting, payroll, training, and procurement.\n\n  This notion that salaries would explode isn't realistic. We can't \neven get a raise for judges here, which most of my colleagues tell me \nwe should get. They have to come with an appropriation every year. You \nthink these salaries are going to explode and that this is going to be \na sitting duck?\n  My view is, if I can see it, if I can feel it, if I have to confirm \nit and it is not buried in an organization, I have a lot more impact on \nit. Look, as I said, there is a lot to say, but the former VOA \ndirectors, the Voice of America directors, they do not argue, Democrat \nand Republican, that we should put the radios and VOA into the State \nDepartment. They say keep it where it is.\n  So, I really admire the Senator. I will say again, the people of \nWisconsin should be thankful and appreciative that he kept his \ncommitment. He saved them money. Like in that movie, ``Show me the \nmoney.'' You saved them the money. Now, move on, Senator. There ain't \nno more money to save unless you are eliminating all of the radios. And \nif you move them into the State Department, which your amendment would \ndo, that will be the effect.\n  I asked my colleague, because we are good friends, I asked, how long \nare you\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\ngoing to go on this? He said, well, I am going to make my points and \nthen go as long as required to have to respond to your responses. I \nsaid, you mean if I don't keep responding, you won't respond?\n  I think he implicitly said yes. So I am going to stop responding to \nhis responses in the hope that he will stop responding and we can get \non with the vote. Hopefully, the vote will be like it was in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, overwhelmingly, a majority of Democrats \nand majority of Republicans staying committed to the savings he has \ninitiated and staying committed to the radios.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am enjoying this debate and also \nenjoying the Senator's command of popular culture. I think this has \nbeen a very instructive thing for me over the past few years to work \nwith him on this. I admire his passion. It is born of a lot of \nexperience and knowledge of foreign policy over the years, to which I \ndefer. So I do respect him on this and appreciate the kind words about \nthe savings we have achieved. The Senator is right. And I do try to be \nstraightforward. The Senator from Delaware would say, in fact, he is \ncorrect. We have made those savings working together, including with \nthe chairman, whose good support also made that possible.\n  That is a victory that we can be happy about. But I can't just look \nat this bill and feel this is the end of the story. Whatever analogy \nyou want to use, winning the inning but not winning the game, it is not \nterribly satisfying if you achieve something and then find out a few \nyears later that you set up a scenario--not a fact, I again give you \nthat, but a scenario--where you have the feeling that it might come \nundone, that there is a good chance it will come undone. Because we are \nmaking what appear to be the same mistakes that were made in the past, \nin terms of how this was set up, that led to the abuses, that led to \nthe need for the agreement that the Senator and I put together several \nyears ago.\n  It reminds me of the expression, I still can't find out who said it, \nI don't know if it was President Reagan or President Bush, something \nalong the lines that ``the only thing that is immortal in Washington, \nDC, is a Federal agency,'' this concern that somehow we can't ever wean \nourselves from the structure of an independent agency, that once they \nexist they have their own constituency and they exist forever.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for one point on that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, again, the Senator is always \nstraightforward. He indicates he worries that this is a scenario for \nreenacting a set of circumstances, putting in place a set of \ncircumstances, that will allow the abuses that took place before to \ncome around again. I am not being smart when I say this, but you, \nSenator Feingold are going to be here. The likelihood of that happening \nwith you sitting here in this Chamber and with it sitting out there by \nitself is zero, unless all of a sudden you go back to Wisconsin and \ndecide that you don't like your--and I mean this positively--your \ncrusade for fiscal responsibility anymore.\n  I pointed out in the beginning, one thing I have found out about you \nis your tenacity. I can't believe there is any reasonable prospect that \nthe scenario you fear has any prospect of occurring while you are here. \nI don't think it is occurring period, but in terms of what is likely to \nhappen, I don't want to be a board member when they come back and tell \nyou, ``By the way, we're not privatizing,'' and ``By the way, we want \nmore money,'' and ``By the way, we're increasing our salaries,'' all of \nwhich would have to come through here.\n  I will argue again, if it is buried inside the State Department, you \nhave a much better chance of it occurring there than if it is sitting \nout in the cold light of day, and I mean that sincerely.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, to answer the Senator's question, I \nappreciate his very positive political prognosis for me, and I hope he \nis right. I would rather not, after all the work I have done on this \nand all the work he has done on this, simply leave this issue to the \nhope that I or others in the future will have the time, the energy and \nthe interest to focus on this particular matter. There are so many \nthings we need to work on to cut the fat out of the Federal Government. \nIt is incredible.\n  We go home and tell people we finally passed a bipartisan balanced \nbudget, and they look at us skeptically. The first thing I say to them \nis, ``Don't kid yourself, there is still an awful lot of fat in \nWashington, an incredible amount.'' The energy it takes to focus on \nthis one particular piece and clean it up is very, very taxing. I can't \nsimply hope that my own ability to pursue this will last forever.\n  Let's face it, these radios have been there for 50 years. I know \nthere are Members here who approach that kind of tenure, but for most \nof us, we have to try to set something up that we hope will last after \nwe are gone.\n  This is relevant to an interesting point that the Senator from \nDelaware was making where he eloquently outlined the past, the \nimportant role that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty played during \nthe cold war. But in so doing, he made an interesting comment about how \nthings are different now. He said ``We have gone from cold war to \nchaos.'' I think that was well said.\n  But the problem is that this new world that we are living in is much \nmore complicated than it used to be, involving a lot of different \nforums for different ideologies, different constellations in power. But \nthere are also different technologies, technologies that did not exist \nat the time the assumptions that the Senator from Delaware was speaking \nabout were made. Things like the BBC, things like CNN, things like the \nInternet.\n  That is not to say that radios do not have an important role, and \nperhaps a unique role, as you were indicating, in a number of these \nsituations. But, Mr. President, it is a different world than the world \nthat required us to set up Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in the \nway that we did as a surrogate radio.\n  Who is to say that we cannot at this point, without using Federal \ndollars, have our official Government broadcasting done by the Voice of \nAmerica and then have these alternatives that we have described \nfunction as they are doing and didn't in the past, such as BBC, CNN and \nthe Internet and then, yes, perhaps, and here I actually do not \ndisagree with the Senator from Delaware, perhaps have a fully \nprivatized Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, a fully privatized \nRadio Free Asia, and whatever else can be established, be a part of \nthat combined effort to make sure that people who live under any kind \nof authoritarian government, such as China or any other type of \ngovernment like that, whether Communist or not, would have the \nopportunity to get the information they need?\n\n  Mr. President, what the Senator from Delaware has really pointed out \nby his excellent description is what I said from the beginning. This \nRadio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, as a Government-funded entity, not \nas an entity on its own, but as a Government-funded entity, based on \nthe notion of a need for a surrogate, is a cold-war relic. The concept \nof the surrogate that is somehow a part of the Government but not \nreally part of the Government is, in my view, a relic. It is a fact and \nimportant part of the history of the 20th century. It is not a \nguidepost for the 21st century.\n  But the most important point is this. The Senator cleverly tries to \ntake the argument as to whether or not I think radios are needed for \nfreedom. I am not necessarily disputing that at all. Let's for the sake \nof argument agree that some kind of radios of this kind are a part of \nthe constellation of services and technologies that are needed for \nfreedom. The question here today is whether we need an independent, \nfederally funded agency to get that job done, this sort of hybrid that \nclaims to be independent but, obviously, isn't because it is funded by \nthe taxpayers and the President of the United States appoints the \nboard. This isn't independence. No one thinks it is independence, \nalthough, yes, as the Senator from Delaware points out, perhaps during \nthe heart of the cold war, in that context at that time, there may have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\nthis mythical distinction which I question just how many people \nactually believe.\n  So the question here isn't do we need the radios--let's concede that \nfor the moment--the question is, do we need a new independent agency to \nrun the radios when the Senator himself just said this whole thing is \nsupposed to be completely privatized by 1999 anyway. How important can \nit be to have an independent agency to do this funded by the Federal \nGovernment when he himself just said we are going to privatize the \nwhole thing by 1999?\n  What it comes down to is this. The Senator from Delaware has given a \ngreat speech, a very accurate speech, but it is most appropriately a \nspeech given to people in this country who have a lot of money, who \nwant to privatize and pay for a privatized Radio Free Europe and Radio \nLiberty. That is to whom these words should be spoken, people like \nSteve Forbes who would be able to put in this kind of money and is \ninterested in it. That is who should hear the plea, not the U.S. \ntaxpayers who have paid enough already in this area.\n  Let's just review the facts about independence and lack of \nindependence.\n  Fact: The Board for International Broadcasting was an independent \nagency, and during its tenure as an independent agency, there were \nhorrible revelations of fiscal abuse. That is the fact. The Senator \nfrom Delaware says, what would you rather have, an agency that stands \nout there alone or one that is in the State Department? The fact is, \nwhen the Board for International Broadcasting stood alone, that is when \nthe huge abuses, the $200,000 and $300,000 salaries paid by the \nAmerican taxpayers, occurred, when it was independent.\n  Fact No. 2: That there has been a time period when this board was not \nindependent, when, under our agreement, it went under the United States \nInformation Agency. And what happened during that tenure when it was \nnot independent, when it was supervised, when it did have to submit its \nbudget to the head of USIA? What happened is we achieved these things, \nwe achieved these efficiencies. That is when it happened.\n\n  So I will go with the same test the Senator from Delaware has \nsuggested: When it was on its own, it failed and was abusive; when it \nhas been under the supervision of another agency that is dedicated to \ncontrolling it, it has been under control. We cannot simply create a \nnew pleader here in the form of a new Federal agency. It will need its \nown staff and personnel. The Senator from Delaware says it won't be \nrequired to, but it is allowed to.\n  I simply cannot understand how any of us believe after the record of \nRadio Free Europe and Radio Liberty under the Board for International \nBroadcasting, that letting it be free--subject only to appointment and \nconfirmation hearings--that somehow that will lead to a better \nsituation. That is the history, two different scenarios: the record, \nwhen it was independent, which is one of terrible fiscal abuse, and the \nrecord since it was put under another department under the USIA, which \neveryone has conceded has been much better.\n  Mr. President, I strongly suggest we should avoid this step of \ncreating a new Federal agency. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I always enjoy debating my friend from \nWisconsin. It has been a hundred years since I have been a trial \nlawyer, but one of the things a fellow I used to work for, a great \ntrial lawyer in Delaware named Sid Balick, used to say was, when you \nhave said what you wanted to say, you made the points the best you can, \nit is best to sit down. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \npublic diplomacy conducted by the United States Information Agency, \nwhich, under the terms of the legislation before us, will be folded \ninto the Department of State, USIA, as we are all aware, oversees the \nVoice of America and, more recently, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n  It has often been pointed out that, after the guns fall silent, the \nUnited States rushes to disarm. Many in this chamber would argue that \nsuch disarmament is being undertaken once again in the wake of the \ndemise of the Soviet Union and consequent end to the cold war. We are \nnot here, however, to debate issues of military strategy and force \nstructure. That discussion will take place in the near future when the \ndefense authorization bill comes to the floor.\n  The issue I wish to address today, however, is closely related to the \nphenomenon involving large-scale reductions in the size and aggregate \ncapability of our Armed Forces in times of peace. There is another \nelement to what has been called the arsenal of democracy that is vital \nto our national defense, yet which receives little attention and \noperates with minimal funding. That instrument of foreign policy is \npublic diplomacy--the conveyance of accurate, objective news to people \nwho otherwise are not exposed to a free flow of information, who have \nthe misfortune of living in countries ruled by dictatorial regimes.\n  Mr. President, there is little that an authoritarian or totalitarian \ngovernment fears as much as the dissemination of truth. Whether \nbroadcasts into German-occupied France or Radio Free Europe and Radio \nLiberty transmissions behind the Iron Curtain, the truth is a powerful \nweapon when wielded with fortitude in the struggle against tyranny. The \nimages of individuals and families hiding in darkened basements, \ngathered around a radio, volume kept low so as to avoid detection, is \ncompelling. It is an image that has captured millions over the decades. \nDistribution of radio sets and literature can play as important a role \nin the fight for freedom as the aircraft, tanks, and ships on which we \nexpend billions of dollars.\n  The post-cold-war era coincides with the explosion in what has come \nto be known as the ``Information Age.'' As portable and home computers \nbecome more readily available, the ability to disseminate information \nhas reached levels previously only imagined. It is very important that \nthe United States not ignore this potential in the continuing fight for \nself-determination and democratization.\n  I remain a strong supporter of the public diplomacy activities of the \nU.S. Government. It is true that the end of the cold war has diminished \nthe need for Radio Free Europe. It has not, however, eliminated that \nneed, as political turmoil in Albania and the ongoing problems in \nBosnia-Herzegovina, as well as in Serbia itself, attest. Furthermore, \nwhile I am a strong supporter of maintaining open ties with China, \nincluding in the area of trade, the advent of Radio Free Asia is an \nessential element in our long-term effort at facilitating a \ntransformation in that country toward a more liberal political system \ncharacterized by free speech.\n  The bill currently before us restructures our public diplomacy \napparatus to both streamline the bureaucracies and ensure their \ncontinued vitality and independence. Those are worthy goals deserving \nof our support. While I am concerned about the effort to retain Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty within the U.S. Government rather than \nprivatize it as directed in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for \nfiscal years 1994-1995, the attention afforded public diplomacy in the \nState Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1998 is highly \ncommendable.\n  Public diplomacy remains an important instrument of our foreign \npolicy. The free flow of information will never wane as an essential \nelement of our national security apparatus. Truth remains the greatest \nenemy of tyranny, and until liberal democracies are firmly entrenched \nin every country of every region of the world, we must continue to \nsupport such activities.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I inquire of the Senator if he desires a rollcall vote on \nthis?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin. I think he knows that. I know his mother-in-law and I \nput in every personal reference I can, but he is simply wrong on this. \nHe is operating in perfectly good faith, but this is wrong. This \nprovision does not create a new Government agency. What it does is \nsimply keep a current function of USIA and move the rest of them out. \nIt is the only thing left.\n  The radios--Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia \nand Radio Free Iran, the Voice of America and the Cuban radio, Radio \nMarti--will be separate from the Department of State. No new missions \nare created, no new bureaucracies are established. We simply maintain \nthe independence and editorial integrity of the already-existing \nradios.\n  Warnings that this bill will return us to the old age of corruption \nand mismanagement are simply not so. As a matter of fact, I was dealing \nwith these radios a long time before the Senator came to the Senate. As \nthe saying goes, I fought the Battle of Jericho many times on this and \ngenerally I won.\n  This bill simply extends the authority of the State Department \ninspector general giving the inspector general full oversight over the \nradios and the entire bureau of broadcasting and gives the Under \nSecretary of State for Public Diplomacy a permanent seat on the \nbroadcasting Board of Governors, ensuring that their management will \ncome under the scrutiny of the State Department. And under this \nlegislation, the Director of broadcasting will serve not at the \npleasure of the board, as he does today, but rather at the pleasure of \nthe President with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Lastly, I have heard from the head of every one of these radio \nentities. And to a man, to a woman, they are opposed to the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I am tempted to move to table, but because of my \naffection for the distinguished Senator I shall not do that. I will let \nhim have an up-or-down vote.\n  I thank the Chair. And we may proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 395. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], the \nSenator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthone], and the Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nRoberts] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] \nand the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] \nis absent attending a funeral.\n  I also announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate the good \nwork that has been done on this legislation. It is truly a bipartisan \ncompromise. The distinguished chairman and ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Delaware, have really worked hard and have come together, I think, \non a good bill. It is obvious that the bill is going to be supported by \nthe overwhelming votes that we have seen here today.\n  It is important that we finish this bill tonight. There are not a lot \nof amendments left. I hope that the Senators who have amendments they \nare seriously interested in will come to the floor right away and talk \nto the chairman so that we can finish this up in the next hour and a \nhalf or 2 hours.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky, who is acting as leader in the \nabsence of our good friend, Senator Daschle. Let's really stay behind \nthis and see if we can't finish in the next couple of hours. I wanted \nto make that point.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the regular order would bring up the \nSarbanes amendment. We have worked that out. I think we have two others \nthat we are willing to accept and are agreeable to accept. That would \nbe Senator Dan Inouye on the East-West Center and Senator Smith of \nOregon on China.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for those three to be \nhandled in tandem.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, is the Sarbanes amendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest by the Senator from North Carolina?\n  The Senator from North Carolina has sought consent to consider these \namendments in the following order: The Senator from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes; the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye; and the Senator from \nOregon, Senator Smith.\n  Is there objection?\n  There being no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 393, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 393), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 160, strike line 21 and all that follows through \n     line 7 on page 162, and insert in lieu thereof the following: \n     ``international organizations under the heading `Assessed \n     Contributions to International Organizations' may not exceed \n     $900,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000.''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. This modification has been worked out with the managers \nof the bill. I appreciate their accommodation on this.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section, and renumber the remaining sections accordingly:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIAN \n                   MINORITIES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Chinese law requires all religious congregations, \n     including Christian congregations, to ``register'' with the \n     Bureau of Religious Affairs, and Christian congregations, \n     depending on denominational affiliation, to be monitored by \n     either the ``Three Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the \n     Protestant Churches of China,'' the ``Chinese Christian \n     Council,'' the ``Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association,'' or \n     the ``Chinese Catholic Bishops College;''\n       (2) the manner in which these registration requirements are \n     implemented and enforced allows the government to exercise \n     direct control over all congregations and their religious \n     activities, and also discourages congregants who fear \n     government persecution and harassment on account of their \n     religious beliefs;\n       (3) in the past several years, unofficial Protestant and \n     Catholic communities have been targeted by the Chinese \n     government in an effort to force all churches to register \n     with the government or face forced dissolution;\n       (4) this campaign has resulted in the beating and \n     harassment of congregants by Chinese public security forces, \n     the closure of churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and \n     criminal and administrative sentences. For example, as \n     reported by credible American and multinational \n     nongovernmental organizations,\n       --in February 1995, 500 to 600 evangelical Christians from \n     Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces met in Huaian, Jiangsu \n     Province. Public Security Bureau personnel broke up the \n     meeting, beat several participants, imprisoned several of the \n     organizers, and levied severe fines on others;\n       --in April 1996 government authorities in Shanghai closed \n     more than 300 home churches or meeting places;\n       --from January through May, 1996, security forces fanned \n     out through northern Hebei Province, a Catholic stronghold, \n     in order to prevent an annual attendance at a major Marian \n     shrine by arresting clergy and lay Catholics and confining \n     prospective attendees to their villages.\n       --a communist party document dated November 20, 1996 \n     entitled ``The Legal Procedures for Implementing the \n     Eradication of the Illegal Activities of the Underground \n     Catholic Church'' details steps for eliminating the Catholic \n     movement in Chongren, Xian, Fuzhou and Jiangxi Provinces and \n     accuses believers of ``seriously disturbing the social order \n     and affecting [the] political stability'' of the country; and\n       --in March 1997, public security officials raided the home \n     of the ``underground'' Bishop of Shanghai, confiscating \n     religious articles and $2,500 belonging to the church;\n       (b) It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to release from incarceration all those held for \n     participation in religious activities outside the aegis of \n     the official churches, and cease prosecuting or detaining \n     those who participate in such religious activities;\n       (2) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to abolish its present church registration process;\n       (3) the government of the People's Republic of China fully \n     adhere to the religious principles protected by the U.N. \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and\n       (4) the Administration should raise the United States' \n     concerns over the persecution of Protestant and Catholic \n     believers with the government of the People's Republic of \n     China, including at the proposed state visit by President \n     Jiang Zemin to the United States, and at other high-level \n     meetings which may take place.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, one of the threshold rights that \nwe as Americans hold dear is the right to worship God according to the \ndictates of one's own conscience. It is for that reason that many \nChristians and people of all faiths are disturbed by news headlines \nabout the persecution of Christians, specifically, and other religious \nminorities generally in the nation of the People's Republic of China.\n  This body is about to engage in a great debate on the issue of China \nand how the religious minorities of that great nation are treated by \nits government. Many of us are concerned about this issue and find it \nappalling to read accounts of the persecution of Christians in that \nnation. I, for one, believe that the best way to help China change its \ninternal affairs toward religious minorities is not by escalating a \ntrade war or military competition with them, but rather to engage them \nand to focus the spotlight upon this issue in every forum that we can \nfind. I think businesses have an obligation to do that, and I believe \nwe, as U.S. Senators, have an obligation to do that.\n  For that reason, today, I rise to offer this amendment, which is a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment, that will focus on the issue of \nreligious persecution in the People's Republic of China. Specifically, \nit says that:\n\n       It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to release from incarceration all those held for \n     participation in religious activities outside the aegis of \n     official churches, and cease prosecuting or detaining those \n     who participate in such religious activities;\n       (2) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to abolish its present church registration process;\n       (3) the government of the People's Republic of China fully \n     adhere to the religious principles protected by the United \n     Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and\n       (4) the Administration should raise the United States' \n     concerns over the persecution of Protestant and Catholic \n     believers with the government of the People's Republic of \n     China, including at the proposed state visit by President \n     Jiang Zemin to the United States, and at other high-level \n     meetings that may take place.\n\n  I believe this amendment has the approval on both sides. I thank the \nChair and the managers of the bill for this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FORD. Does the manager want to pass this amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nI be added as a cosponsor to the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we agree to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 396) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on the \nState Department authorization bill. I am afraid that too often we \nminimize the importance of legislation that deals with foreign policy \nbecause it is an issue that fails to capture the interest of our \nconstituents. In my opinion, this lack of interest is a sign of failure \non our part to explain to our constituents the importance of sound \nforeign policy to their lives.\n  At the same time, more and more people in my home State are coming to \nknow the importance of trade in developing our economy and creating new \nmarkets for Nebraska agricultural and industrial products. Essential to \na profitable trade environment is a stable diplomatic relationship. It \nis our State Department that takes a leading role in creating the ties \nthat will lead to\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nnew markets and prosperous trade relations. We must do a better job of \nexplaining the link between foreign policy and a healthy economy based \non free trade.\n  Mr. President, it is also important that we remember that failure of \nforeign policy can have deadly consequences. Our investment in the \nState Department and international organizations such as the United \nNations represents a fraction of the monetary investment required for \nthe United States to respond militarily to a threat to our interests \nthat may have been averted through diplomacy, not to mention the \ninvestment in human lives.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a significant improvement over similar \nlegislation that has come before the Senate in that it addresses very \ndifficult and contentious issues with fewer of the controversial policy \nprovisions that have doomed past legislation. This is not to say that \nthis bill is void of provisions that cause me concern, but I am hopeful \nthat as the process moves forward these issues will be worked out.\n  Division A of this bill addresses the consolidation and restructuring \nof our foreign policy agencies. Aside from streamlining these agencies, \nI am hopeful this legislation will help us construct a foreign policy \nstructure better prepared to respond to the challenges it will face in \nthe post-cold-war world. By consolidating the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency into the State \nDepartment, we are not saying that arms control and public diplomacy \nare less important than during the cold war. Instead, we are \nreaffirming their importance by placing these tasks under the direct \ncontrol of the Secretary of State. On this point, I would like to \npraise the administration, the chairman, and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee for pursuing a reorganization plan that \nwill strengthen U.S. foreign policy by strengthening the role of our \nSecretary of State. I do share the concerns expressed by the \nadministration and believe that it is important for the President and \nthe Secretary of State to have a sufficient amount of flexibility \nduring the process of restructuring in order to ensure the greatest \namount of efficiency and ability to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n\n  Division B of this bill contains the authorizations of appropriations \nfor the State Department and related agencies. I recognize the fiscal \nconstraint under which we are operating, but I am very concerned by the \nfailure of this bill to fully fund our foreign policy agencies. While \nthe $6.08 billion authorized in the bill is close to the $6.15 billion \nrequested by the President, funding levels fall short in several key \naccounts.\n  First, this bill authorizes $59 million less than was requested by \nthe President for contributions to international organizations; there \nis also a $40 million shortfall from the amount requested for \ninternational peacekeeping. Finally, the bill reduces ACDA's \nauthorization level from $46 million to $39 million. At a time in which \nwe are calling for ACDA to be integrated into the State Department, it \nis important that we not shortchange this agency. Each of these funding \nshortfalls threatens the effectiveness of agencies and calls into \nquestion our commitment to maintaining a strong foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, the final section of the bill, division C, is of \nparticular interest and concern to me. Once again, I am pleased that \nthe Senate has finally chosen to address the issue of US arrears to the \nUnited Nations, but I am concerned about the approach that is taken in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, let me first state that I fully support U.S. \nparticipation in the United Nations. In helping to create the United \nNations in 1945, the United States sought to create an organization of \ncountries that could work together to achieve common goals. Today, the \nUnited Nations remains an important forum of consultation and \ncooperation in which the United States can work with other nations to \nadvance our interests. However, I fear that the ability of the United \nStates to use its power in the United Nations will be jeopardized by \nour inability to pay our bills.\n  I do not disagree with those who push for continued reforms within \nthe United Nations. However, I am concerned that many of the benchmarks \nand conditions contained in this bill play to the unfounded fears of a \nfew in our society and go too far in dictating policy to the United \nNations. Mr. President, I do not believe that the United States should \nput itself in the position of micromanaging the United Nations. While \nthe United States remains the most influential country in the United \nNations we must recognize the need to work with, rather than dictate \nto, the remaining 183 countries. We in the United States are groping \nwith our own fiscal problems, we should not be so quick to assume we \nhave a monopoly on reform.\n  It is for this reason that I supported Senator Lugar's amendment. \nAside from fully funding the $819 million in arrears payments over 2 \nyears, Senator Lugar's amendment would have deleted the benchmarks and \nconditions contained in the bill. In my opinion, we must live up to our \ninternational commitments or be prepared to face the consequences of \nsurrendering our leadership role in the world.\n  Mr. President, while I have many concerns, and I believe that this \nbill could have been crafted in a way that would have further advanced \nour foreign policy goals, on balance I believe this bill represents a \npositive step forward and I will vote in favor of final passage. By \nradically reorganizing our foreign policy apparatus, we better prepare \nourselves to meet the foreign policy challenges we are certain to face \nin the future. Finally, despite the concerns I have about our approach, \nI believe that this bill will move us toward paying our debts to the \nUnited Nations and reestablishing U.S. leadership.\n\n\n                              section 2108\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the section of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee report on S. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1997 (Report No. 105-28), describing section 2108 \non the Organization of American States was inadvertently left out of \nthe printed report. In order to establish the legislative history of \nsection 2108 of S. 903, I ask unanimous consent that a description be \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Section 2108--Organization of American States\n       Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State \n     should make every effort to pay the United States assessed \n     funding levels for the Organization of American States (OAS).\n       The Committee recognizes the unique relationship and \n     importance of the OAS to the United States. The Committee \n     also notes that the OAS is disproportionately reliant on the \n     United States assessed contribution, with the United States \n     providing 59 percent of the organization's assessed budget.\n       The Committee has encouraged reform of international \n     organizations. The OAS, to its credit, has taken a number of \n     positive steps to reform, including establishing an \n     independent Inspector General, mandating annual independent \n     financial audits, establishing a Unit for the Promotion of \n     Democracy, while holding the line on the budget and reducing \n     personnel from 1700 to 600. Section 2108 acknowledges the \n     progress made by the OAS in streamlining the institution and \n     maximizing its resources.\n       The Committee also takes note of the work of the OAS, \n     especially in promoting democratic processes and \n     institutions, most recently in Nicaragua and the Dominican \n     Republic, and in contributing to reconciliation in Central \n     America, most notably the work of the International Support \n     and Verification Commission (CIAV) in Nicaragua.\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZATION OF AU PAIR PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, section 1314 of the State Department \nauthorization bill reauthorizes the Au Pair Cultural Exchange Program \nin the United States Information Agency.\n  Over the years, this program has won broad support in Congress and \nacross the country, helping working families with their child care \nneeds while providing valuable experience of life in America for young \nmen and women from overseas.\n  However, earlier this year, the people of Massachusetts were stunned \nby the tragic death of a child in Newton at the hands of a participant \nin the program. I wrote to USIA immediately, requesting an urgent \nreview of current procedures for screening participants in the program \nand requesting USIA's recommendations for strengthening them.\n  As the Senate votes today to approve this legislation, USIA is in the \nprocess of promulgating new regulations for\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nthe au pair program which will be published in the next few days. I \nbelieve that these regulations will provide greater assurance to the \nthousands of American families who have come to rely on this program \nthat the au pairs who participate are better trained and better \nscreened. I understand that the new rules will enhance the training and \nexperience requirements for au pairs to qualify for the program. The \nregulations should enhance the involvement of American families in \nselecting the au pairs to care for their children. In addition, new \nregulations will ensure that au pairs are not overworked and are able \nto participate in educational programs that strengthens the cultural \nand educational exchanges at the heart of this important program.\n  Finally, this program will remain under periodic review. In fact, \nevery fifth year, a comprehensive re-examination of the program is \nrequired to determine whether the program will be continued.\n  These are welcome improvements in the au pair program. They will \nbenefit American families with child care needs, and benefit the \ncultural exchange programs that are such an important aspect of ours \nwith other countries. This reauthorization is a key part of this \noverall bill, and I urge members of the Senate to support it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to congratulate \nSenator Helms, Senator Biden and the members of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee for the bipartisan spirit reflected in the Foreign \nAffairs Reform bill, and particularly for their efforts to restructure \nthe foreign affairs agencies for the 21st century.\n  When a proposal to consolidate agencies came to the floor last year, \nI offered an amendment that would have struck provisions integrating \nthe United States Information Agency into the Department of State. At \nthat time, there appeared to be a serious risk that the valuable \nmission of USIA, public diplomacy, would be harmed in a consolidation \nprocess overly inspired by a zeal to slash budgets and bureaucracies. I \nwill continue to watch this closely.\n  Those of us who shared this concern are pleased that the effort being \nmade now will strengthen and not diminish public diplomacy by keeping \nthe focus on the team responsible for its conduct. Despite the \nwonderful capabilities of technology, we cannot count on it alone to \ncarry America's message to foreign countries. There will always be the \nproblem that Edward R. Murrow described as taking the message ``the \nlast three feet.''\n  What I imagine Murrow meant was that foreign publics will be open to \nunderstanding America's case only when they know us and respect us, and \nwhen we know enough about them to relate to their interests and values. \nThis means more than shouting at them through technology's \nloudspeakers. It means ``being there,'' having foreign service \nprofessionals in the field whose work it is to cultivate relationships \nthat go beyond government-to-government communiques.\n  American interests and values will be served through effective use of \nthe international media, the internet, and government broadcasting \ncapabilities such as the Voice of America. But we must not allow these \ntools of mass communications to become separated from the professionals \non the ground who follow the pulse of the people, whether in the market \nor at the University. American foreign policy needs engagement, up \nclose and personal, now more than ever.\n  And so I am heartened by the efforts this legislation makes to \nadvance public diplomacy and I encourage my colleagues here in \nCongress, and the Administration, to remain focused on the importance \nof the mission at hand rather than on the potential for modest savings \nlater on.\n  In that same vein, Mr. President, I also would like to thank Senator \nLugar for introducing in this legislation a foreign affairs review \nprocess as a necessary corollary to agency reorganization. Senator \nLugar and I worked together to craft this approach because we believe \nit is time to examine systematically what our diplomacy must do for us \nin the 21st century. The review, which has been endorsed by a large, \ndistinguished, and diverse group of foreign affairs experts and others \nwith a great deal of public and private international experience, will \nlook at the functions of all the federal departments and agencies with \ninterests and assets overseas.\n  Some describe the way we do America's business abroad as ``a 40 \nagency conundrum.'' Dozens of agencies, in addition to State, USIA, AID \nand the other ``traditional'' members of the foreign affairs community, \npursue separate overseas agendas with little coordination or \ncooperation between them. It is an inefficient and, as the world \ncontinues to change from the stark East-West split of the Cold War, an \nineffective way to advance our interests and values around the globe.\n  The end of the Cold War has brought new challenges and opportunities \nto our international relations. We have seen how these can erupt into \nconflicts that disrupt economic life, produce waves of desperate \nrefugees, threaten public health and the environment, and sometimes \nprovoke horrible violence. We cannot respond to these new circumstances \nby relying on old methods.\n  Streamlining bureaucracies is an important step in the right \ndirection. But we need to do more. It will not serve our interests to \ndo the wrong things more efficiently. We need to look inside the \norganizations themselves to see what they do and how they do it. We \nneed to evaluate both the necessity and the manner of their work. Our \nrepresentatives overseas often are locked in mind-numbing endeavors \nwith no discernible value apart from feeding an insatiable Cold War \ndinosaur. Jurassic Park was a terrific movie; but it's a lousy model \nfor foreign policy.\n  This legislation addresses that problem. It creates an outside \ncommission to examine the way America conducts its international \nrelations and it reinforces that effort with parallel study by the \nSecretary of State. Ultimately, the Secretary, the official with \nresponsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, will reconcile \nthe reviews and make proposals to the Congress for any needed changes. \nOur goal here is not just to improve the way we organize foreign \npolicy. It is to improve the way we conduct foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, the key to continued American leadership in the 21st \ncentury will be our ability to create more options. Not just to \nidentify the trends and possibilities that circumstances present to us, \nbut to create the opportunities for action that reflect our values and \nadvance our interests. We are the world's indispensable country because \nwe are the only nation with the resonating ideals, the geographical \nsize and location, the economic and military strength, and the \npolitical and social diversity to make our presence felt and to exert \nour influence in every corner of the globe. No other nation can provide \nthat leadership to the world's democratic nations, the leadership to \nshape a world in which our people can pursue their destiny less \nencumbered by the unnecessary divisions among the world's people. We in \nCongress have the privilege and responsibility of safeguarding and \nenhancing America's moral and material leadership around the world. We \ndo that, in part, by supporting and renewing the agencies and people \ncharged with representing us overseas. We do that by focusing on their \nmission, and giving them the resources to carry it out.\n  This bill is a an important step forward. It recognizes that we need \nmore money for aggressive, smart diplomacy--that we cannot continue to \nconduct it on a frayed shoestring. It recognizes that our world has \nchanged, and is continuing to change, by directing that we begin to \nconduct our diplomacy more effectively and to begin to think seriously \nabout what our foreign affairs agencies must be able to do so that the \n21st century will not be, in the words of one diplomat, a repeat of the \n20th century. And by resolving a serious, lingering conflict over the \nUN, it recognizes that we are an inseperable part of the family of \nnations, and that we must work to make the only global organization for \nthis family better--not withdraw from it.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this historic, bipartisan deal was the \nresult of arduous, delicate negotiations--nearly 5 months of \npainstaking talks with the chairman, the administration, Senator Biden, \nand his staff. After all that work, after all that effort, we have \nsucceeded in hammering out a fragile bipartisan deal--a deal which \nsaves the American taxpayers money, reforms\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nour foreign affairs apparatus, and requires much needed reform at the \nUnited Nations. None of us got everything we wanted. All of us had to \nmake concessions. But the result is a package that, while far from \nperfect, is something we should all be able to live with.\n  I strongly support the U.N. reform measures. These reforms will help \nthe American taxpayer, and help the international community by creating \na United Nations that works. History shows that reforms at the United \nNations only happen when Congress mandates those reforms by making its \nU.N. payments conditional on the implementation of reforms. Consider \nthe recent record: Congress withheld funding until the United Nations \nestablished an Independent Office of Internal Oversight--and it \nhappened, and Congress withheld funding until the United Nations \nappointed an inspector general--and it happened.\n  Under the terms of this legislation, we reduce our regular budget \nassessment to 20 percent. We reduce our peacekeeping assessment to 25 \npercent. We reimburse the American taxpayers for U.S. assistance to \nU.N. peacekeeping operations. We establish an inspector general in the \nbig three agencies to root out waste, fraud, and corruption. We ensure \na U.S. seat on the budget committee. These are some of the conditions \nwhich must be accepted by the United Nations in order to receive the \npayment of the $819 million in arrears. They are not radical; they are \nnot extreme; they provide a framework for change so the United Nations \ncan become more effective. We have crafted a reform package that is \nnecessary. This is a package that will work.\n  This is a historic piece of legislation. We are dismantling our cold \nwar foreign relations bureaucracy; we are creating a more effective \nUnited Nations, and we are prioritizing our international affairs \nexpenditures. We need a more effective foreign affairs apparatus, both \nat home and at the United Nations, in order to confront the challenges \nto peace and security in the future. This bill will help us to provide \nthe structure that we will need for America to secure its leadership \nrole in the international arena.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we are trying to assemble a list, and there \nis a fair hope that we can finish in maybe an hour, hour and a half if \nSenators who have made indications that they have amendments will let \nus know if they really intend to offer the amendments.\n  So while that is working, I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD. If the Senator will withhold that, Mr. President, I \nunderstand there are basically no amendments on this side, maybe a \ntechnical amendment or two. So we are very close to being ready to move \nforward with third reading and final passage. So anything we can do to \nencourage others to do that or anything we can do to help, please let \nus know.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee and have his agreement that I might \ninterrupt, since we are about to go into a quorum call anyway, to ask \nunanimous consent for up to 5 minutes to introduce a separate piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 923 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we have about six or eight possible \namendments remaining. Some of them were submitted by staff. We have not \nheard anything from any of the Senators involved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that by 25 minutes until 6--which is about 20 \nminutes from now--if we have not heard from Senators themselves that \nthey wish to call up an amendment or an amendment on the list, we will \nassume they no longer are interested in such an amendment, and we will \nproceed to third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask that the distinguished Senator from Texas be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 397\n\n(Purpose: To express the Sense of the Congress that the North Atlantic \n    Treaty Organization should consider a formal dispute resolution \n                                process)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 397.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI, add the following (and conform the \n     table of contents accordingly:)\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NORTH ATLANTIC \n                   TREATY ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The West's victory in the Cold War dramatically changed \n     the political and national security landscape in Europe;\n       (2) The unity, resolve, and strength of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization was the principal factor behind that \n     victory;\n       (3) The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in April 1949 and \n     created the most successful defense alliance in history;\n       (4) The President of the United States and leaders of other \n     NATO countries have indicated their intention to enlarge \n     alliance membership to include at least three new countries;\n       (5) The Senate expressed its approval of the enlargement \n     process by voting 81-16 in favor of the NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996.\n       (6) The United States is bound by Article Five of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty to respond to an attack on any NATO member as \n     it would to an attack on the United States itself;\n       (7) Although the prospect of NATO membership has provided \n     the impetus for several countries to resolve long standing \n     disputes, the North Atlantic Treaty does not provide for a \n     formal dispute resolution process by which members can \n     resolve differences among themselves without undermining \n     Article Five obligations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should consider a \n     formal dispute resolution process within the Alliance prior \n     to its December 1997 ministerial meeting.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I believe is \nagreed to by both sides. I am very pleased that both sides have agreed \nto this because it deals with NATO expansion and is something that I \nthink will strengthen our ability to expand NATO, will make sure that \nwe have considered many of the potential problems that could arise, and \nhave a dispute resolution process to deal with those so that we will \nnot have to call on Article Five.\n  As everyone knows, Article Five says that any attack on any NATO \ncountry is an attack on the United States or any of the other NATO \nallies.\n  We want to make sure that, if there is a border dispute or some sort \nof internal dispute within a country or between two neighboring \ncountries or between any two countries who are members of NATO, we have \na dispute resolution process so that we can have a way for people to go \nto the bargaining table, and the process is a binding arbitration--much \nlike binding arbitration in labor negotiations in the United States--so \nthat rather than have a question about whether we are going to be on \none side or the other in a military conflict, that we have a process \nthat everyone who is a present member of NATO and any future members of \nNATO would agree to that would be perhaps--this is not in the agreement \nyet--perhaps where each country in the dispute would pick one other \ncountry in NATO as their representative. Those two representative \ncountries would then pick a neutral representative to arbitrate the \ndifferences.\n  The important thing is there would be an agreement for binding \narbitration. So, if there was a flare-up between two present members of \nNATO--\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\nsay Greece and Turkey, or a future member of NATO, Hungary and Romania, \nfor instance--there would be a way for us to have a process that \neveryone agreed to before there were new members added and that could \nbe brought into fruition right at the time of the dispute so that there \nwould not be a problem, so there would be no dilution of Article Five.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment is a sense of Congress that NATO \nwould consider a formal dispute resolution process and that it would do \nso within NATO prior to the December 1997 ministerial meeting. It is a \nsense of Congress that says to our NATO allies, let's sit down and \nthink of all the ramifications of the NATO organization as it is now \nand any future members that would come in. Let's look at any of the \nramifications that might come--a border dispute, or disputes among \ncountries--let's have a process that does not include warfare where \neveryone agrees to abide by the decision as the process is set.\n  I am very pleased that this sense of Congress will be accepted. I \nthink it will strengthen any future members coming into NATO. And, \nfrankly, Mr. President, best of all, I think it will strengthen the \nalliance as it stands today because I think this will avoid many future \nconflicts. I think the more we can do today to settle questions that \nmight arise, the stronger this alliance will be.\n  Mr. President, I do think NATO is the best defense alliance in the \nhistory of the world. I want to keep it strong.\n  So I appreciate the acceptance of this amendment.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nstreamlining her amendment. I appreciate it very much. It is acceptable \nto the minority.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 397) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am considering pursuing an amendment \nwhich would take a firm stand against the terrorism of the Palestinian \nAuthority, Chairman Yasser Arafat, and I have thought through the \npossibility of offering an amendment on this bill. But after consulting \nwith members of the Administration, I have decided to await a remedy of \nreprogramming, with my option remaining to offer this amendment on the \nforeign aid bill which will be marked up in the Appropriations \nCommittee this week and offered on the floor sometime in the near \nfuture. But I do want to make a comment or two about it, as to what I \nthink needs to be done on the modification of U.S. law as it relates to \nfunding for the Palestinian Authority.\n  In existing law, under an amendment offered by the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, and myself, the $500 million in aid to the \nPalestinians, the Palestinian Authority is conditioned on a maximum \neffort by Chairman Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians to fight \nterrorism and also to change the PLO charter to rescind the provision \ncalling for the destruction of Israel. Certain events have occurred in \nthe immediate past which, in my view, raise a question as to whether \nthere is compliance with the Specter-Shelby amendment and whether there \nis a need for further statutory language to act against terrorism which \nhas been promoted by the Palestinians.\n  The two specific matters that I have referred to are the bombing of \nthe Tel Aviv restaurant resulting in the murder of three Israelis and \nthe wounding of many more on March 21, 1997, where Prime Minister \nNetanyahu made a statement that Chairman Arafat had given a green light \nfor that act of terrorism. When Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, \nwas before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations Appropriations a few \nweeks ago, I questioned her about that, and she said that there had not \nbeen a green light, but said that Arafat had not given a red light \neither.\n  I do not want to become involved in what shade of amber, what shade \nof red, there is in using the expression of ``lights given by Chairman \nArafat.'' But I believe it is indispensable, if the United States is to \ngive assistance to the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority, that \nthere be a maximum effort made by the Palestinian Authority and by \nChairman Arafat to stop terrorism. Short of that, it is my view that we \nought not to be providing U.S. funds.\n  The amendment that I have in my hand that I have been considering \noffering--I have had discussions with the distinguished chairman and \nranking member and members of the Administration--calls for \nconditioning payment to the Palestinian Authority on the determination \nby the State Department that Chairman Arafat did not act in a way which \nfailed to give a red light to stop terrorism.\n  The second factor of concern to me is a report by Deputy Minister of \nEducation of Israel, Moshe Peled, that Arafat had knowledge of the \nproposed bombing, a terrorist act against the Trade Center in 1993, \nwhich resulted in the killing of six United States citizens and the \nwounding of many, many more people, and that, if in fact that \nallegation is true, then Arafat--Mr. President, the Senate is not in \norder. May we have the Senate be in order please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If it is in fact true that Chairman Arafat had knowledge \nof that proposed bombing before it occurred, that would make him an \naccessory before the fact and a co-conspirator and subject to \nextradition under the so-called long-arm statutes which we enacted in \n1984 and again in 1986. I think that ought to be done.\n  Upon learning about Chairman Arafat's possible knowledge of that \nbombing, I wrote to the Attorney General, asking for an investigation, \nreceived back a vacuous answer from a subordinate, wrote again asking \nfor a detailed investigation, and I am awaiting a response from the \nDepartment of Justice on that point.\n\n  The amendment which I have been considering offering on this bill and \nmay offer on the foreign aid bill would condition payment to the \nPalestinian Authority on the determination by the Department of Justice \nthat Chairman Arafat was, in fact, not involved, having prior knowledge \nof the Trade Center bombing. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will \nmake part of the Record, the exchange of correspondence on this issue.\n  I then placed a telephone call to Moshe Peled, the Deputy Minister \nfor Education of Israel, to find out more about his assertions. I found \nout that he spoke Hebrew and not English, and I spoke English and not \nHebrew. Then I had one of my deputies, David Brog, who speaks Hebrew, \ntalk to him. The upshot of that conversation was that Mr. Peled stood \nby what had been reported but referred us to Israeli authorities to \nfind out more about it. That, obviously, is a matter for the Department \nof Justice, perhaps for the Department of State. It is my view that \nbefore we make these payments, there ought to be a certification that \nChairman Arafat was not in fact involved as an accessory before the \nfact nor was he a co-conspirator having knowledge of that matter.\n  In conversations with the Administration, it may be that this \nobjective can be achieved by a reprogramming of the funds which are \ngoing to the Palestinian Authority, some $10 million, and that this \nwould, in fact, not affect some of the other funding going to the \ninfrastructure, which is not in Chairman Arafat's control and not in \nthe control of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority. It may be that my \nobjective can be achieved without offering this amendment.\n  I am informed by the distinguished Senator from Delaware that my \nproposed amendment is opposed by the Administration, and the President \nwas\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nsending a letter over, because it would complicate the peace process. \nIf the Administration is prepared to deal with the Palestinian \nAuthority and Chairman Yasser Arafat in the context where there are \noutstanding allegations that Arafat was an accessory before the fact or \na co-conspirator on the Trade Center bombing, then I think the \nAdministration is dead wrong. If the Administration is prepared to deal \nwith Arafat, give him U.S. money in a context where he has given a \ngreen light or has failed to put up a red light, there again, I think \nthey are dead wrong--maybe totally wrong. Dead wrong would be a bad \nexpression, in the light of all the people killed by PLO terrorists.\n  In any event, I am prepared not to resolve the issue this afternoon \nin light of the fact that we may be able to accomplish it by \nreprogramming and in light of the fact that we may be able to bring the \nmatter to a head if it is necessary for the Senate to vote on the \nforeign aid bill, which will be up before the Senate in the very near \nfuture.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we are awaiting just a few more items of \ninformation to be included. No Senator has appeared as of 5:35, so it \nis presumed that there will be none.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the one remaining \namendment to be offered by the Senator from Alaska, let me pay my \nrespects to the young people on the staff of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, both Republican and Democrat. But I will speak to \nand about the young people on the Republican staff, headed by the one \nand only Admiral James Wilson Nance, moreover known as Bud Nance, who \nis the chief of staff of the committee, a gentleman whom I have known \nsince we were little boys in Monroe, and who has built that staff to \none of the best that has ever been in charge of the foreign affairs \nside of the Foreign Relations Committee down through the years.\n  Then there is Tom Klein, himself a remarkable young man; Chris \nWalker, he is delightful; Marshall Billingslea, he is my anchor when \nthe wind begins to blow; Ellen Bork, and, yes, she is the daughter of \nhim, and I tell him that the daughter is smarter than he is; Dan Fiske; \nGarrett Grigsby; Patti McNerney, who you have seen working so \ndiligently this afternoon and on previous occasions; Dany Pletka; Marc \nTheissen; Beth Wilson; Michael Westphal.\n  While I am thanking the Republican staff, I thank Joe Biden for his \nexceptional cooperation. It has been sort of an arduous task to do all \nof the detail work that had to be done, but he and I and our mutual \nstaffs, our respective staffs, really, spent many, many hours working \ntogether, and here we are almost to the point of asking for third \nreading.\n  The reason I paused, Mr. President, is that we are finishing a fairly \nlong list of en bloc amendments, technical amendments, which is not yet \nready. In the meantime, the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nMurkowski] is on the floor. I welcome him and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend for accommodating my schedule. I am \nmost appreciative of him allowing a few moments so that I may offer \nwhat I assume is the concluding amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 398\n\n (Purpose: To establish within the Department of State the position of \n  Coordinator of Taiwan Affairs for the coordination of United States \n  Government activities relating to the American Institute on Taiwan)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that would \nincrease dramatically cooperation between the Congress and Department \nof State on issues relating to Taiwan.\n  There have been a lot of problems over the last few years relative to \nExecutive Branch-Congressional dealings with regard to Taiwan. We had a \nsituation back in 1993, I think, when President Lee of Taiwan attempted \nto overnight in Hawaii on a flight from Taiwan that was traversing the \nPacific Ocean to a Central American destination. Unfortunately, that \nwas not handled very well, and I think that it reflected poorly on U.S. \nhospitality. I recognize the sensitivity of the issue, but, \nnevertheless, I think most Americans agree that it was poorly handled \nby the State Department.\n  The administration, at that time, refused to work with the Congress \non this issue until 1994, when an amendment which I offered went to a \nvote and prevailed.\n  More recently, some in this Chamber might remember the controversy \ncreated by the selection of the Director of the American Institute in \nTaiwan, Director James Wood.\n  It is important to note that this directorship is not a formal \nambassadorial position. It is our recognition of the uniqueness, if you \nwill, of the existence of Taiwan that the President selects a \nRepresentative to Taiwan.\n  Mr. James Wood resigned from his position on January 17, 1997. There \nwere various charges and countercharges with regard to foreign \ncontributions during the election campaign, and the legitimacy of that \nI will leave to the investigators. However, a February 10 Los Angeles \nTimes story quoted a U.S. investigator as saying the variety of \nallegations constituted the ``most bold and blatant'' example veteran \nState Department officials could recall of the abuse of a diplomatic \npost.\n\n  I am not going to argue the merits of Mr. Wood. But the Senate knows \nvery little about Mr. Wood or any other official with direct \nresponsibility for Taiwan affairs, because they do not come before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee for confirmation.\n  In the case of Mr. Wood, it is not for lack of effort on the part of \nthe Senate. My very good friend and chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms, is very familiar with the lack of \nconsultation between the State Department and Congress over Mr. Wood's \nappointment. After receiving information from outside sources regarding \nthe qualifications of Mr. Wood for this sensitive post, both Senator \nHelms and I asked the State Department to allow us to have a meeting \nwith Mr. Wood before his appointment. For reasons that have never been \nmade clear, the State Department did not arrange the meeting prior to \nthe appointment. Instead, Mr. Wood's appointment was announced while, I \nbelieve, the chairman was on the floor debating the 1995 version of the \nvery same bill we are debating today, regarding State Department \nAuthorization.\n  It is important to note that our request for consultation was \ncertainly consistent with the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, which \nis a very unusual but workable agreement. The TRA requires the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations to oversee the implementation of the act \nand the operations and procedures of the American Institute in Taiwan. \nI repeat that. The act itself requires the Committee on Foreign \nRelations to oversee the implementation of the act and the operations \nand procedures of the American Institute in Taiwan.\n  Now, ``procedures'' certainly suggests an oversight on the Director. \nFurthermore, then Secretary of State Vance at that time assured the \nForeign Relations Committee in a letter to then Chairman Frank Church \nthat--and I quote--``the names of prospective trustees and officers \nwill be forwarded to the Foreign Relations Committee. If the Committee \nexpresses reservations about a prospective trustee, [the Department of \nState] will undertake to discuss the matter fully with the Committee \nbefore proceeding.''\n  Well, that is fine. The only problem is, the State Department did not \nseem to be able to get around to it. So what I am proposing is that the \nSenate more formally assert, or reassert, I should say, itself into \nthis process by passing my amendment, which would require--it is very \nimportant now, Mr. President, we get this--require the coordinator for \nTaiwan affairs, a position that now exists at the State Department, to \nsimply be subject to Senate confirmation.\n  The administration would maintain the flexibility of the appointment, \nbut\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nwe would have the opportunity for confirmation.\n  So let me make it clear. Although I would have liked to propose an \namendment that would have made the AIT Chairman and AIT Director \nsubject to Senate confirmation, I have been advised that because of the \nparticular and unusual nature of the American Institute in Taiwan, it \nwould violate the Constitution to make these officers subject to advise \nand consent.\n  Instead, therefore, I am trying to at least get more accountability \nfrom the State Department in our Taiwan policy. It has nothing to do \nwith the sensitivity between Taiwan and PRC. This has to do about \nSenate perogative to have consent and accountability associated with \nthe process. After all, Taiwan is our eighth largest trading partner. \nIt is an important ally. I think we should have someone at the State \nDepartment who is more accountable to the Congress as we move forward \non important issues like Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I urge you to support my amendment.\n  I would be happy to respond to questions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I really have no question, just a \nstatement.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for the way he is handling this. I \nliterally just got off the phone with the Secretary of State, who said, \nknowing you were speaking now, that when you finished, or at any time \nthat is convenient for you, she is willing to personally assure you, \nand authorized me to tell you as well, that she makes a personal \ncommitment that she will coordinate more closely with you and any \nMember of the Senate on Taiwan policy in a contemporaneous fashion. She \nis willing to assert that to you.\n  I know no one here doubts her word. But I realize time is close in \nterms of the schedule here. But she is prepared and ready and willing \nto take your call and anxious to personally make that commitment to \nyou. But she authorized me to be able to say what I just said on the \nfloor.\n  I thank the Senator for the way in which he has concluded to handle \nthis matter, and I appreciate the Secretary's willingness to be \navailable and contemporaneously discuss these issues with the Senator \nfrom Alaska, who, obviously, along with the Senator from North \nCarolina, I do not know of any two people that have shown a greater \ninterest in Taiwan than those two of my colleagues.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend from Delaware can advise me \nsince he recently just talked to the Secretary, does he interpret her \nintention to provide an opportunity for the Committee on Foreign \nRelations to review the potential director so that there would be some \noversight?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The answer to that question is, I do not know. I did not \nask her that specific question, so I do not want to give a specific \nanswer, except to suggest to you I am confident that she would be \nwilling to come before you in your capacity as the chairman of that \nsubcommittee and/or you and the committee, or you personally, to \nindicate to you how that process of coordination would be carried out. \nBut I do not want to put words in her mouth. I did not ask that \nexplicit question.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Maybe if I put the Senate in a quorum call very \nbriefly while I talk to the Secretary and see what kind of assurance I \ncan get.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think that would be appropriate. I gave your staff her \nphone number. She is literally waiting by the phone.\n  And I might note, Mr. President, I have not found, in my 25 years \nhere, a more accommodating Secretary of State. So she is literally \nwaiting for your call, as they say. If there is business we can conduct \nin your absence--I do not know if there is any--if there is, maybe we \ncan do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside, if there is an \namendment--is there an amendment at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been proposed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I assure the Senator that after the Senator has his \nconversation, we can go back to this and he can have the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I offer the \namendment for its consideration at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And I would propose that we lay it aside after it is \nread.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 398.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . COORDINATOR FOR TAIWAN AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6 of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 3305) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c)(1) There shall be in the Department of State a \n     Coordinator for Taiwan Affairs who shall be appointed by the \n     President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       ``(2) The Coordinator shall be responsible to the Secretary \n     of State, under the direction of the President, for the \n     coordination of all activities of the United States \n     Government that relate to the American Institute on \n     Taiwan.''.\n       (b) Executive Schedule Level IV.--Section 5315 of title 5, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end of the \n     following:\n\n                  ``Coordinator for Taiwan Affairs.''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the Murkowski amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 399\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a series of amendments \non behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nBiden, and I ask that these amendments be considered en bloc. And these \nen bloc amendments make technical conforming changes to the bill. I \nunderstand there is no objection to these technical changes to the \nbill. I now ask unanimous consent that these amendments be adopted en \nbloc. I know that the distinguished Senator from Delaware will be \ndelighted to say OK.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection, I say to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself \n     and Mr. Biden, proposes amendment numbered 399.\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senator Murkowski \nto have his conversation, I would ask if the Chair will indulge me for \njust 2 minutes here.\n  It is remarkable, quite frankly, that we have made the progress that \nwe have as rapidly as we have. I want to publicly thank the chairman, \nfor we both stuck with this compromise notwithstanding there are \nindividual amendments we would have liked to have voted for. I want the \nrecord to show that the chairman did the same thing.\n  But there is one issue which I realize we cannot resolve now, and \nthat is this issue of whether or not we could work out the ability of \nthe administration to negotiate how to handle the $107 million that is \nowed from the U.N. We cannot do that now, I agree.\n  I just want to suggest to the chairman that although I will not \nchange anything, that between now and the dance, now and the \nconference, we will be working hard with the chairman and his \ncolleagues to see if we can figure out some solution to that. But I \nunderstand there is no commitment to that at all.\n  As we move toward final passage, Mr. President, of this bill, I would \nlike to acknowledge the tremendous work and help that the chairman and \nI have received from the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  On the chairman's side--he will obviously thank people; and it is \nusually the tradition for us to thank our own staff--but I must tell \nthe chairman that everything he ever advertised about Admiral Nance is \ncorrect, and more. I hope he will forgive me for thanking his staff \nfirst on this, but Admiral Nance and Tom Kleine, who has been sitting \nwith the chairman the whole time, Patty McNerney and Chris Walker of \nhis staff have been a pleasure to work with. I guess when staffers come \nup to the Hill they wonder whether or not they are going to get to deal \nwith the principals. I am probably one of the principals they hope they \ndo not have to deal with. They have seen more of me than their families \nover the last 4 months, but I want to thank them for their \nconsideration.\n  I would also like to thank the minority staff. Especially I want to \nthank my staff director, Ed Hall, who has had--and this is the way it \nworks here. It is not sufficient here that the Members have a good \nrelationship. It is also important that the corresponding staffs have a \ngood relationship. I know that Ed Hall has an inordinately high regard \nfor Admiral Nance. I know the feeling is mutual. I want to particularly \nthank Ed Hall, if you excuse the point of personal privilege here, for \nagreeing to stay on. He was the former chairman's and former ranking \nmember's staff director. And I asked him to stay in that capacity for \nme, and he was incredibly useful to me, and, thankfully, he decided to \nstay on.\n  I also want to thank my minority counsel, Brian McKeon. Brian came to \nwork with me, I might point out, Mr. President, right out of college, I \nguess almost 18 years ago. While he was working with me, he went to law \nschool at night. He was a first-rate student at Georgetown, went off to \nthe Court, clerked for the Court, was going to practice law, and I \ntalked him into coming back here. And I just want to thank him. He \nhandled all of the details of this bill.\n  I was kidding the other day, if we have an MVP on my side, it is \nPuneet Talwar. Puneet was the guy who, along with Tom on your staff, \nMr. Chairman, got stuck with the detailed negotiations on chemical \nweapons, on the U.N., on everything else. And on my team, if there is \nan MVP, Puneet is going to get it.\n  Mike Haltzel, a professor, has been invaluable to me on European \nmatters. Frank Jannuzi, Munro Richardson, and Ed Levine of my staff, \nand Diana Ohlbaum, Nancy Stetson, and Janice O'Connell on my \ncolleagues' staff--that is, Dodd, Kerry and Sarbanes--have been \nincredibly helpful to me.\n  I also want to thank Dawn Ratliff, Kathi Taylor, and John Lis, who is \none of our fellows, and also thank Ursula McManus and Erin Logan, and \nour interns who have given up their valuable time.\n  Let me conclude--and I will do it now while we are waiting so that I \ndo not take the time of my colleagues. For my colleagues who are \nlistening, I am not holding up your plans. We cannot move anyway until \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska finishes his conversation with \nthe Secretary of State.\n  But, Mr. President, the passage today--and I am hoping and expecting \nthat we will pass the Foreign Relations authorization --represents a \nsignificant bipartisan commitment to the United States' continued \nengagement in the world.\n  First, the basic authorization legislation for the Department of \nState, the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms Control Disarmament Agency \nand the Peace Corps marks a bipartisan commitment to restore funding \nwhich will enhance our diplomatic readiness abroad.\n  We all know that funding for foreign policy spending is the lowest it \nhas been in 20 years. Today's action by the Senate is a heartening \nexpression of bipartisan support for our diplomats on the front lines \nof American engagement abroad.\n  We have restored full funding for the State Department's core \nmissions, fully funded the education and cultural exchange programs, \nthe National Endowment for Democracy, the Peace Corps, and \ninternational broadcasting. We have increased the funding for Radio \nFree Asia at a critical time in that region's history. We have done a \ngreat deal.\n  Second, the Senate has passed landmark legislation that provides a \nframework for reorganization of the foreign affairs agency that is \ntotally consistent with the plan announced by the President of the \nUnited States on April 18. Like the President's plan, this bill \nprovides for integration of ACDA within the State Department within 1 \nyear, the integration of the USIA within 2 years, and the partial \nintegration for the Agency for International Development in the State \nDepartment.\n  Additionally, it maintains the current structure for U.S.-sponsored \ninternational broadcasting but keeps it outside the Department of State \nso as to ensure its journalistic independence.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Senate enacted a bipartisan comprehensive \npackage--is about to, I hope--which provides for payment of $819 \nmillion in U.S. arrearages to the United Nations. This proposal, Mr. \nPresident, will go a long way toward restoring the fiscal health of the \nUnited Nations while spurring needed reforms for that world body.\n  Equally important, this agreement, a bipartisan plan supported by the \nadministration, will allow us to get a very difficult and contentious \nissue behind us so we can move forward on the important issues on the \nforeign policy\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\nagenda. Ideally, we should not have attached the conditions, but I am a \npragmatist and I recognize, as does the administration, that there will \nbe no approval of U.N. arrearages in Congress absent some conditions, \nand the conditions which the chairman has asked for are reasonable.\n  So we had a choice. We can continue to press unconditional payment \nfor arrearages and let this issue fester for another Congress or agree \nto a reasonable set of conditions that permits us to pay our debts. I \nbelieve the action the Senate is about to take will be a correct \ndecision, one in the best interests of the United States. It has been a \nlong time and it is time to end the long-festering feud between the \nUnited Nations and Washington and our unpaid back dues, and it is time \nto bring up needed reform to that world body so it can more efficiently \nperform its missions. It is time to move forward together to restore \nthe bipartisan commitment to the United States which has been part of \nthat Nation's proud heritage for 50 years.\n  Mr. President, the people in my State--small, I acknowledge--are used \nto bipartisanship. Senator Roth and I are close political allies and \nfriends. Our lone Congressman Mike Castle, who is a Republican, our \nDemocratic Governor, we are all used to getting things done in a \nbipartisan way in my State. I have always felt if that tradition could \nbe carried back to the Senate, it would better serve our Nation.\n  I want to say I did not doubt it, but I am sure a number of neutral \nobservers would have doubted it, the Secretary of State is not only a \nfriend of the chairman, so am I. The idea that Joe Biden, a Democratic \nSenator from Delaware, and Jesse Helms, a Republican Senator from North \nCarolina, could operate in this way does not surprise either of us, but \nI am sure it surprises the living devil out of an awful lot of other \npeople.\n  I am reminded of something that was said to me once by Jim Eastland. \nIt is a true story. I was in a difficult campaign fight in the late \n1980's, and I saw Chairman Eastland. I was flunking, you might say, \nwhat I call the slope-of-the-shoulder test. When you ask a candidate \nhow they are doing in a race and they go, ``Oh, I am doing fine,'' you \nknow they are not doing very well. I guess I had that look like I'm \nlosing. The Chairman pulled me aside and said, ``Joe, what could Jim \nEastland do for you in Delaware?'' I said, ``Mr. Chairman, in some \nplaces you would help and some you would hurt.'' He said, ``I will make \na commitment. I will campaign for you or against you, whichever will \nhelp the most.''\n  I realize my saying nice things about the chairman may not help him, \nbut I mean it sincerely when I say that he has been an absolute \ngentleman. He has kept his commitment, which I never doubted he would, \nand this is evidence of the fact that if reasonable men are willing to \nsit down and talk--we had a real sit-down meeting, when I took over \nthis committee for the Democrats, with the chairman of the full \ncommittee, and we agreed on the broad outlines of each of our agendas. \nThe most important one was to make the committee work and make foreign \npolicy function and be a positive force. He has kept every one of those \ncommitments. He has won some and lost some. I have won some and lost \nsome. But I think the Nation is better served for it.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, with this last comment. If Senator Helms \nand I had come to the floor in January and said to this body, ``By the \nway, by midsummer we will present to you a bipartisan plan on the floor \nof the five most contentious issues to face the U.S. Senate in foreign \npolicy,'' I think you would have thought that it was time for both of \nus to leave because we might have been certifiable. We knew we could do \nthat, and with the great help of the staff that I have mentioned, we \nhave been able to do that, and with the cooperation and assistance of \nthe administration.\n  So I want to thank the President for committing his administration to \ndeal forthrightly and in detail with us, and I want to thank the \nchairman and his staff for accommodating an arrangement by which we \nhammered these things out. We produced a significant package here. \nNeither one of us are naive enough to suggest we know what will happen, \nif and when it passes here, with any degree of certainty, but we each \nkept our commitment to one another. I think the body, based on the \nvotes we have seen today, I hope it reflects the feeling on the part of \nour colleagues that we have, that a bipartisan foreign policy is in the \nbest interests of the United States.\n\n  I again thank the chairman, and I yield the floor. I will not say any \nmore at the end of the process after Senator Murkowski comes out.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the committee, \nand I look forward to working with him. He is a good guy.\n\n\n                    Amendments Nos. 400 through 411\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a series of amendments \nwhich have been agreed to on both sides of the aisle. These include two \namendments from Senator Murkowski regarding United States-Japan \nrelations, an amendment offered by Senator Graham of Florida regarding \ninternational aviation safety, an amendment offered by Senator Abraham \nregarding the U.S. policy toward China, an amendment offered by Senator \nFeinstein regarding rule of law in China, an amendment by Senator \nD'Amato regarding the Middle East, an amendment offered by Senator \nHollings regarding embassy construction, an amendment by Senator \nFeingold regarding broadcasting, an amendment offered by Senator Grams \nregarding victims of torture, an amendment by Senator McCain regarding \nVietnamese refugees, and an amendment by Senator Coverdell regarding \nnarcotics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AVIATION SAFETY.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the need for cooperative \n     efforts in transportation and aviation safety be placed on \n     the agenda for the Summit of the Americas to be held in \n     Santiago, Chile, in March 1998. Since April 1996, when \n     ministers and transportation officials from 23 countries in \n     the Western Hemisphere met in Santiago, Chile, in order to \n     develop the Hemispheric Transportation Initiative, aviation \n     safety and transportation standardization has become an \n     increasingly important issue. The adoption of comprehensive \n     Hemisphere-wide measures to enhance transportation safety, \n     including standards for equipment, infrastructure, and \n     operations as well as harmonization of regulations relating \n     to equipment, operations, and transportation safety are \n     imperative. This initiative will increase the efficiency and \n     safety of the current system and consequently facilitate \n     trade.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 403\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding United States \n policy toward the People's Republic of China, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end of title XVI of division B, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD \n                   THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the followings findings:\n       (1) As the world's leading democracy, the United States \n     cannot ignore the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China's record on human rights and religious persecution.\n       (2) According to Amnesty International, ``A fifth of the \n     world's people are ruled by a government that treats \n     fundamental human rights with contempt. Human rights \n     violations continue on a massive scale.''.\n       (3) According to Human Rights Watch/Asia reported that: \n     ``Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted \n     by the government during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at \n     forcing all churches to register or face dissolution, \n     resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of \n     churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In \n     Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or \n     meeting points were closed down by the security authorities \n     in April alone.''.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China's compulsory family \n     planning policies include forced abortions.\n       (5) China's attempts to intimidate Taiwan and the \n     activities of its military, the People's Liberation Army, \n     both in the United States and abroad, are of major concern.\n       (6) The Chinese government has threatened international \n     stability through its weapons sales to regimes, including \n     Iran and Iraq, that sponsor terrorism and pose a direct \n     threat to American military personnel and interests.\n       (7) The efforts of two Chinese companies, the China North \n     Industries Group (NORINCO) and the China Poly Group (POLY), \n     deserve special rebuke for their involvement in the sale of \n     AK-47 machine guns to California street gangs.\n       (8) Allegations of the Chinese government's involvement in \n     our political system may involve both civil and criminal \n     violations of our laws.\n       (9) The Senate is concerned that China may violate the 1984 \n     Sino-British Joint Declaration transferring Hong Kong from \n     British to Chinese rule by limiting political and economic \n     freedom in Hong Kong.\n       (10) The Senate strongly believes time has come to take \n     steps that would signal to Chinese leaders that religious \n     persecution, human rights abuses, forced abortions, military \n     threats and weapons proliferation, and attempts to influence \n     American elections are unacceptable to the American people.\n       (11) The United States should signal its disapproval of \n     Chinese government actions through targeted sanctions, while \n     at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and cultural \n     exchanges that can lead to positive change in China.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) limit the granting of United States visas to Chinese \n     government offices who work in entities the implementation of \n     China's laws and directives on religious practices and \n     coercive family planning, and those officials materially \n     involved in the massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen \n     square;\n       (2) limit United States taxpayer subsidies for the Chinese \n     government through multilateral development institutions such \n     as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund;\n       (3) publish a list of all companies owned in part or wholly \n     by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Chinese \n     government who export to, or have an office in, the United \n     States;\n       (4) consider imposing targeted sanctions on NORINCO and \n     POLY by not allowing them to export to, nor to maintain a \n     physical presence in, the United States for a period of one \n     year; and\n       (5) promote democratic values in China by increasing United \n     States Government funding of Radio Free Asia, the National \n     Endowment for Democracy's programs in China and existing \n     student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs between \n     the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Helms for \naccepting my Sense of the Senate amendment. This amendment expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that Congress should impose certain, targeted \nsanctions against officials and companies working for the Government of \nthe People's Republic of China. The purpose is to express the \nindignation of our country at the abuses of human rights going on now \nin that country, as well as recent attempts by entities controlled in \nwhole or in part by the Chinese Government to violate American laws and \ninfluence American policy.\n  Mr. President, everyone knows that the Chinese Government is \nviolating basic human rights and international norms of behavior. The \nquestion is, what should the United States do about it? Until now the \ndebate has focused almost exclusively on whether we should extend or \nrevoke China's Most Favored Nation trading status [MFN]. It is time, in \nmy view, to move the discussion out of the MFN ``box'' and find common \nmeans to achieve common American goals.\n  Revoking MFN would punish Americans with higher prices without \nsignificantly affecting the Chinese Government. And it would punish \ninnocent Chinese citizens by withdrawing economic opportunities \nprovided by U.S. trade and investment. Even in the short term, in my \nview, we should not underestimate trade and investment's positive \nimpact. Already, writes China expert Stephen J. Yates of the Heritage \nFoundation, Chinese ``employees at U.S. firms earn higher wages and are \nfree to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate and care \nfor their children.''\n  Regardless of their views on MFN, Americans should be able to agree \non measures pressuring the Chinese Government to stop its current \npolicies while encouraging greater openness in that country.\n  The list of objectionable Chinese Government practices is long. It \nincludes religious persecution, abuses against minorities, forced \nabortion, military threats and weapons proliferation, and attempts to \nimproperly influence American elections.\n  Mr. President, to pressure China's Government to stop these policies \nwithout punishing average citizens, I have introduced S. 810, ``The \nChina Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act.'' This bill would \nimplement the findings of the current Sense of the Senate Resolution. \nLet me discuss the provisions of this bill. Under S. 810, the United \nStates Government would refuse visas to human rights violators, \nincluding high ranking Chinese officials implementing and enforcing \ndirectives on religious practices. The same would go for those involved \nin the massacre of students in Tianenman\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\nSquare. To allow a proscribed individual into the United States, the \nPresident would have to send Congress written notification explaining \nwhy this would be in America's national interest and override United \nStates concerns about China's human rights practices.\n  The bill also would require United States representatives to vote \n``no'' on all loans to China at the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, \nand International Monetary Fund. An exception would be made for \nhumanitarian relief in the event of natural disaster.\n\n  In addition, for every dollar a multilateral development bank or \ninternational family planning organization gives to China, S. 810 would \nsubtract out a dollar in American taxpayer funding to those bodies. \nSimply put, instead of raising taxes on Americans, we should stop \ntaxpayer subsidies to the Chinese Government. If China continues its \ncurrent behavior, it can fund development programs by reducing \nexpenditures on its military and State enterprises.\n  The legislation also targets Chinese companies engaged in improper \nconduct. The Clinton administration already has imposed sanctions on \ntwo companies found to have sold chemical weapons components to Iran. \nTop executives from two other Chinese companies--Polytechnologies \nIncorporated [POLY], and China North Industries Group [NORINCO]--have \nbeen indicted for attempting to sell automatic weapons to California \nstreet gangs. This bill would ban POLY and NORINCO from exporting to or \nbeing physically present in the United States for 1 year.\n  Even as we implement these tough measures, we should maintain \nvaluable interchange with China. That is why the legislation doubles \nfunding for United States-China exchange programs, Radio Free Asia, and \nprograms in China operated through the National Endowment for \nDemocracy.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the President to file an annual \nreport on whether China has improved its human rights record, including \nits behavior during the transition to Chinese control in Hong Kong. The \nsanctions sunset after 1 year, allowing Congress to evaluate the \nsituation and determine whether and in what form sanctions should \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, the United States must stay engaged with China, and \ntrade and investment provide a valuable avenue for that engagement. But \nsignaling our disapproval and refusing to subsidize oppressive policies \nneed not interfere with expanding basic interaction between the \nAmerican and Chinese people.\n  America can stand with the Chinese people, and stand by the \nprinciples of political, religious, and economic liberty on which our \nNation was founded.

Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     pursuant to section 1101 in this Act, up to $90,000,000 are \n     authorized to be appropriated for the renovation, acquisition \n     and construction of housing and secure diplomatic facilities \n     at the United States Embassy Beijing and the United States \n     Consulate in Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Helms and \nSenator Biden for accepting this amendment regarding facilities to \nsupport our men and women serving in the United States' Diplomatic \nService in the People's Republic of China.\n  Our United States diplomatic facilities in China are in poor shape. \nThe housing is in disrepair and for our chancery we occupy a building \nthat formerly was used as the Pakistani Embassy. We spend years \ntraining our diplomatic personnel to be China hands who speak Chinese \nfluently. They are the best and the brightest in our foreign service. \nAnd, then we send them and their families to live and work in \nsubstandard facilities. It sends the wrong message.\n  Mr. President, it hurts morale and retention. With the fall of the \nwall, these Americans are our front-line--our State Department economic \nofficers, our commerce Department commercial officers, our consular \nofficers who help Americans in distress overseas, our Customs Service \nemployees who enforce our trade laws, and other agency personnel.\n  Regardless of what your position is with China, on human rights or \ntrade, the fact remains that the United States and China have and will \nhave one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. \nThe People's Republic of China is our fifth largest trading partner and \nthe Chinese economy is growing at over 10 percent per partner and the \nChinese economy is growing at over 10 percent per year. They are \nbecoming the preeminent geo-political power in Asia.\n  I have raised this issue with former Secretary Christopher and \nSecretary of State Albright. I have discussed it with Ambassador \nSasser. They all agree that something must be done to invest in our \nfacilities to support our people who are serving in China. This \namendment provides that from within the total amounts authorized in \nthis bill, up to $90 million is provided for renovation, acquisition, \nand construction of housing and secure diplomatic facilities at the \nUnited States Embassy in Beijing and the consulate in Shanghai. It does \nso without adding additional funds. It requires the Appropriations \ncommittee, on which I serve as ranking member on the Commerce, Justice \nand State Subcommittee, to actually scrub the budget and find the money \nand address this issue.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is the right thing to do. It is \ncosponsored by Senator Murray from Washington who has been to Beijing \nrecently and who has seen firsthand the need for modernization of \nfacilities.\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\n  Again, I thank Chairman Helms and Senator Biden for their support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 407\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for an independent Inspector General for the \n                    Broadcasting Board of Governors)\n\n       On page 20, beginning on line 4, strike all through page \n     24, line 8, and insert the following:\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``the United States \n     Information Agency'' and inserting ``the Broadcasting Board \n     of Governors''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``the United States \n     Information Agency,'' and inserting ``the Broadcasting Board \n     of Governors,''.\n       (c) Executive Schedule.--Section 5315 of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking the following:\n       ``Inspector General, United States Information Agency.''; \n     and\n       (2) by inserting the following:\n       ``Inspector General, Broadcasting Board of Governors.''.\n       (d) Amendments to Public Law 103-236.--Subsections (i) and \n     (j) of section 308 of the United States International \n     Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6207 (i) and (j)) are \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Inspector General of the United States \n     Information Agency'' each place it appears and inserting \n     ``Inspector General of the Broadcasting Board of Governors''; \n     and\n       (2) by striking ``the Director of the United States \n     Information Agency,''.\n       (e) Transfer of Functions.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), there \n     are transferred to the Office of the Inspector General of the \n     Department of State and the Foreign Service the functions \n     that the Office of Inspector General of the United States \n     Information Agency exercised before the effective date of \n     this title (including all related functions of the Inspector \n     General of the United States Information Agency).\n       (2) Transfer to inspector general of broadcasting board of \n     governors.--There are transferred to the Inspector General of \n     the Broadcasting Board of Governors the functions (including \n     related functions) that the Office of Inspector General of \n     the United States Information Agency exercised with respect \n     to the International Broadcasting Bureau, Voice of America, \n     WORLDNET TV and Film Service, the office of Cuba \n     Broadcasting, and RFE/RL, Incorporated, before the effective \n     date of this title.\n       (f) Transfer and Allocations of Appropriations and \n     Personnel.--The Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is \n     authorized to make such incidental dispositions of personnel, \n     assets, liabilities, grants, contracts, property, records, \n     and unexpended balances of appropriations, authorizations, \n     allocations, and other funds held, used, arising from, \n     available to, or to be made available in connection with such \n     functions, as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 315.

Mr. President, this amendment would establish an \nindependent inspector general for the new agency. Under the committee-\nreported legislation, the State Department's IG would assume \nresponsibility for the new agency.\n  An independent IG was designated for the Board for International \nBroadcasting in the 1988 inspector general legislation. When we \nconsolidated BIB into USIA in the 1994 broadcasting legislation, those \nfunctions were assumed by the USIA Inspector General. More recently, \nthe USIA inspector general's office was merged with the State \nDepartment inspector general.\n  Because of the problems that had plagued the BIB and the role that \nthe then-BIB inspector general's office had played in bringing those \nproblems to public attention through a series of well-documented \nreviews, I authored provisions in the 1994 legislation that required \ncontinuous on-site monitoring by the inspector general of the \nactivities of RFE/RL.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I have been disappointed at the level of \nattention and quality of work that has been provided by the State \nDepartment IG since that office assumed responsibilities for the \nbroadcasting programs. History has demonstrated, over and over, that \nthese programs have been fertile grounds for fiscal abuses and \nmismanagement. Between 1988 and 1994, the independent IG assigned \nsolely to the BIB produced detailed reports to Congress every 6 months \non the problem areas, in addition to a series of special reports that \nhelped identify the abuses in the areas of excessive salaries, deferred \ncompensation, housing allowances, travel improprieties, and other \nproblem areas within BIB.\n  If we are going down the path of recreating the BIB structure, then I \nthink it is very important that we recreate the watchdog entity that \nhelped bring to light what fiscal abuses were rampant in these programs \nunder the independent agency structure.\n  I am very concerned that the IG's office in the State Department may \nhave little incentive to provide the broadcasting programs the kinds of \nscrutiny that is warranted, given the history of abuse.\n  Therefore, the amendment that I am offering will reestablish the \nindependent IG's office within the new agency in the same manner that \nits predecessor, BIB, had an independent IG.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the managers to accept this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 408\n\n  (Purpose: To assist victims of torture by providing funding for the \n         United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture)\n\n       At the end of section 2101(a) of the bill, insert the \n     following: ``Of the funds made available under this \n     subsection $3,000,000 for the fiscal year 1998 and $3,000,000 \n     for the fiscal year 1999 are authorized to be appropriated \n     only for a United States contribution to the United Nations \n     Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 409\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify that unmarried adult children of Vietnamese \n reeducation camp internees are eligible for refugee status under the \n                       Orderly Departure Program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIGIBILITY FOR REFUGEE STATUS.\n\n       Section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, \n     and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law \n     104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-171) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``For purposes'' and inserting \n     ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes''; \n     and\n       (B) by striking ``fiscal year 1997'' and inserting ``fiscal \n     years 1997 and 1998''; and\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\n       (2) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Aliens Covered.--\n       ``(1) In general.--An alien described in this subsection is \n     an alien who--\n       ``(A) is the son or daughter of a qualified national;\n       ``(B) is 21 years of age of older; and\n       ``(C) was unmarried as of the date of acceptance of the \n     alien's parent for resettlement under the Orderly Departure \n     Program.\n       ``(2) Qualified national.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the term `qualified national' means a national of Vietnam \n     who--\n       ``(A)(i) was formerly interned in a reeducation camp in \n     Vietnam by the Government of the Socialist Republic of \n     Vietnam; or\n       ``(ii) is the widow or widower of an individual described \n     in clause (i); and\n       ``(B)(i) qualified for refugee processing under the \n     reeducation camp internees subprogram of the Orderly \n     Departure Program; and\n       ``(ii) on or after April 1, 1995, is accepted--\n       ``(I) for resettlement as a refugee; or\n       ``(II) for admission as an immigrant under the Orderly \n     Departure Program.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is basically a technical \ncorrection to language that I had included in the Fiscal Year 1997 \nOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. That language, and the \namendment I offer today, are designed to make humanitarian exceptions \nfor the unmarried adult children of former re-education camp detainees \nseeking to emigrate to the United States under the Orderly Departure \nProgram. Despite what I considered to have been pretty unambiguous \nlegislation in both word and intent, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService and Department of State interpreted my amendment to the 1997 \nbill so as to exclude the very people to whom the provision was \ntargeted.\n  Prior to April 1995, the adult married children of former Vietnamese \nre-education camp prisoners were granted derivative refugee status and \nwere permitted to accompany their parents to the United States under a \nsub-program of the Orderly Departure Program [ODP].\n  This policy changed in April 1995. My amendment to FY1997 Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Bill, which comprises part of the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act, was intended to restore the status quo ante \nregarding the adult unmarried children of former prisoners. My comments \nin the Congressional Record from July 25, 1996 clearly spelled this \nout.\n  Unfortunately, certain categories of children who, prior to April \n1995 had received derivative refugee status and whom Congress intended \nto be covered by last year's amendment, are now considered ineligible \nto benefit from that legislation.\n  To ask these widows to come to the United States without their \nchildren is equal to denying them entry under the program. Many of \nthese women are elderly and in poor health, and the presence of their \nchildren is essential to providing the semblance of a family unit with \nthe care that includes.\n  The second problem stemming from INS and the State Department's \ninterpretation of the 1997 language involves the roughly 20 percent of \nformer Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners resettled in the United \nStates who were processed as immigrants, at the convenience of the \nUnited States Government.\n  Their unmarried adult children, prior to April 1995, were still given \nderivative refugee status, however, the position of INS and State is \nthat these children are now ineligible because the language in the FY \n1997 bill included the phrase ``processed as refugees for resettlement \nin the United States.''\n  That phrase was intended to identify the children of former prisoners \nbeing brought to the United States under the subprogram of the ODP and \neligible to be processed as a refugee--which all clearly were--as \ndistinct from the children of former prisoners who were not being \nprocessed for resettlement in the United States.\n  The fact that a former prisoner, eligible to be processed as a \nrefugee under the ODP subprogram, was processed as an immigrant had no \neffect prior to April 1995, and their children were granted refugee \nstatus. The intention of last year's legislation was to restore the \nstatus quo ante, including for the unmarried adult children of former \nprisoners eligible for and included in this subprogram but resettled as \nimmigrants.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 410\n\n (Purpose: To facilitate the counterdrug and anti-crime activities of \n                        the Department of State)\n\n       On page 89, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1128.

Mr. President, as the cold war fades into memory, our \nforeign affairs establishment must aggressively target and confront the \nnew\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nthreats facing America. The crime and violence sown by international \nnarcotics mafias requires a new thinking and focus. While diplomatic \nefforts for most of our Nation's history have focused on checking \nunfriendly governments, the challenge of narcotics trafficking and \norganized crime forces us to grapple with a more shadowy and elusive \nadversary. These cartels are not confined by borders and operate \noutside of the bright scrutiny of international affairs. They respect \nno nation's laws or ethics, outmaneuver government bureaucracies with a \nruthless efficiency and have financial resources which dwarf many \nnational budgets. In the face of this great menace, our State \nDepartment cannot hope to make progress without a forward looking \nstrategy, clearly defined goals, and the ability to learn from \nexperience and agilely adapt to match this constantly changing threat.\n  Far too often our diplomatic structures have not adopted to address \nthese new, transnational problems and remained locked in a bilateral \nmind set. The State Department's strong efforts in an individual \ncountry can be easily foiled as these elusive mafias shift operations \nacross borders. In order to effect a new transnational mind set and \ngive the threats of narcotics and international crime the focus they \ndemand, direction must come from the highest levels of the State \nDepartment. The various bureaus and country teams under the State \nDepartment must operate under coordinated plan with specific goals \nwhich they are held responsible for achieving. Like the adversaries \nwhich it must confront, our diplomatic effort must learn from its \nmistakes and recalibrate its strategies to adjust to new situations.\n  Mr. President, the Coverdell-Kerry amendment seeks to do just that. \nThis amendment does not seek to dictate the policy of the State \nDepartment or expand its role in counterdrug matters. It merely \nrequires that the State Department formulate its own plan of action in \ncoordination with the dictate of the President's National Drug Control \nStrategy. If, as some have claimed, the State Department is already \nfollowing a clear strategy, this amendment will ensure that its goals \nand objectives are clear to the Congress which is responsible for its \noversight and funding. In any event, it is crucial that we defend \nAmerica's children and our national interest in the most effective \nmanner possible. As we work to regain ground in our international \nstruggle against drug trafficking, it is our responsibility to ensure \nthat our resources are focused on strategic objectives and are \nspecifically targeted to have an impact in the war on drugs.\n  This amendment also calls on the State Department to work with \nFederal law enforcement agencies to further shield Americans from \ninternational criminals. Currently the failure of our Federal agencies \nto coordinate has allowed terrorists and other violent criminals to \nslip into our Nation. The establishment of the new information sharing \nsystem called for in this amendment will help ensure that our State \nDepartment has the information necessary to keep violent international \ncriminals off America's streets.\n  The reforms called for in the Coverdell-Kerry amendment are just \nfirst steps in what must be a thorough rethinking of how our national \npolicies should be adapted to protect Americans from these new threats. \nI look forward to working with Senator Kerry and others as we approach \nthe difficult task of preparing our Nation to meet these important \nchallenges.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment by \nthe Senator from Georgia and I congratulate him for leading this effort \nto get the State Department to better focus its counternarcotics \nresources.\n  For too long our fight against drugs has suffered from a lack of \nquantifiable goals by which to measure progress. Year after year we \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars on our international drug control \nprograms without a clear idea of how these programs fit into the \noverall counterdrug effort and with no way to determine whether these \nprograms are having the desired effect.\n  This amendment will require the State Department to come up with a \nplan for implementing its portion of the President's national strategy \nand to establish specific goals that will allow us to know how well we \nare doing. This is a very simple concept that anyone who has been in \nprivate business understands. You devise a strategy and then you set \ngoals and objectives that will let you know that you are on target in \nimplementing that strategy. That is what we want the State Department \nto do.\n  I want to emphasize that the amendment requires the Secretary of \nState to submit to Congress a long-term strategy that is consistent \nwith the national drug control strategy. This is not an attempt to \nundermine the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy \n[ONDCP] and its role in devising the national drug control strategy. \nGeneral McCafferey has done a good job at defining the national \nstrategy and setting broad national objectives. I know that he is \nworking to develop a comprehensive performance measurement system that \nwould give us a better sense of how well programs are working. This \namendment supports that effort.\n  We want the State Department to follow the lead of the drug czar's \noffice and to develop a long-term plan that supports the national \nstrategy. Likewise we want to see quantifiable measures of performance \nthat conform to whatever comprehensive measurement system that ONDCP \ndevelops.\n  The second part of this amendment is also straight forward. For \nseveral years the State Department has used a database to identify \nnarcotics traffickers and deny them visas. This amendment expands that \neffort to include other international crime figures.\n  Finally, the amendment seeks to strengthen the coordination of U.S. \ncrime fighting efforts by designating an officer in every U.S. Embassy \nthat will be responsible for ensuring the fullest possible cooperation \nwith the host nation on these issues. This is particularly, important \nin countries where we do not have a full-time law enforcement officer \nassigned to the embassy.\n  These may seem like modest steps but they are the kinds of \ninitiatives that will greatly enhance the effectiveness of our efforts \nto battle the international criminal organizations. Again I thank the \nSenator from Georgia for his leadership and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 411\n\n                   (Purpose: To clarify section 1166)\n\n       On line 17 on page 110, delete ``knowingly assists or has'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof: ``is known by the Department of \n     State to have intentionally''.\n       On line 20 on page 110, delete ``is providing or has \n     provided'' and insert in lieu thereof: ``is known by the \n     Department of State to be intentionally providing''.\n       At the end of line 3 on page 111 insert the following: ``as \n     designated at the discretion of the Secretary of State,''.\n       On line 7 on page 111 before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, and such person and child are permitted to \n     return to the United States. Nothing in clauses (i) or (ii) \n     of this section shall be deemed to apply to a government \n     official of the United States who is acting within the scope \n     of his or her official duties. Nothing in clause (i) or (ii) \n     of this section shall be deemed to apply to a government \n     official of any foreign government if such person has been \n     designated by the Secretary of State at the Secretary's \n     discretion''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have had the \nopportunity to work with my colleagues and the administration to \nperfect section 1166 of this bill, relating to the inadmissibility of \npersons supporting international child abductors.\n  This section of the bill, which was included at my request in the \nchairman's mark considered last week by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, was inspired by the case of Patricia Roush, a constituent of \nmine whose two daughters were abducted by her ex-husband and taken to \nhis home country of Saudi Arabia 11 years ago in direct violation of \nthe custody order of an Illinois court.\n  Since then, she has seen the girls only once for 2 hours. All efforts \nto negotiate a resolution have been rebuffed by the father.\n  This section attempts to address tragic situations like Ms. Roush's. \nCurrent law, section 212(a)(10)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, says that any alien who holds a child overseas in violation of a \ncustody order of a U.S. court may not receive a visa to come to the \nUnited States until the child has been returned to the parent with \nrightful custody.\n  This new section would expand the visa restriction to three \ncategories of\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\npeople: Anyone who helped carry out the abduction of the child; anyone \nproviding material support or safe haven to the abducting parent; and \nimmediate family members of the abducting parent.\n  Any of these people already in the United States would also be \ndeportable.\n  This law would not apply if the child is located in a country which \nis a signatory to the Hague Convention, which is an international \nagreement designed to resolve international child abduction cases.\n  The goal of this legislation is to expand the circle of people \naffected when an American child is abducted. There can be no doubt that \npersons who assist in the abduction of such a child should be subject \nto the same restrictions as the abductor him or herself. The same goes \nfor those who support and protect the abductor subsequent to the \nabduction.\n  The only area that has raised questions is the provision applying the \nrestriction to immediate family members of the abductor. We decided to \nproceed in this fashion because of Ms. Roush's experience during the \ntenure of the previous United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ray \nMabus.\n  After years without any progress toward a resolution, Ambassador \nMabus implied to relatives of Ms. Roush's ex-husband that he might \nwithhold their visas to the United States unless the case was solved. \nHe never actually threatened to withhold the visas, which he lacked the \nauthority to do, but he hoped to at least get information about the \ngirls' condition and the father's thinking throught this tactic.\n  Ambassador Mabus discovered that even the implied threat of \nwithholding visas from family members produced a new spirit of \nflexibility on the part of the father. By the time he returned to the \nUnited States, they had come close to negotiating a resolution, but \nthat fell through after Mabus left.\n  But this experience suggests that withholding visas from family \nmembers and other associates of the abducting parent is an effective \nway to put pressure on that parent to negotiate a resolution.\n  There is a precedent for withholding visas from family members. In \nthe Helms-Burton law on Cuba passed in 1996--Public Law 104-114, \nspouses and minor children of officers of corporations doing prohibited \nbusiness with Cuba were made excludable.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, for their \ncooperation and for helping perfect this amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise today, while we are just about to finish up on \nthis historic State Department reorganization bill, to say a couple of \nthings about it and the people who have been involved.\n  I was in the House of Representatives on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee where we started the attempt to reorganize the State \nDepartment. We were able to pass it through, and the bill got vetoed by \nthe President. I think that is what is historic and taking place here.\n  We are now working together to do the thing we need to do, which is \nto make the overall operation run more efficiently, to eliminate some \nof the apparatus created by the cold war, and to try to create a \nforeign policy agency and a setup that is more forward looking, more \norganized, and that I think can represent our interests better in this \npost-cold-war atmosphere.\n  I think it is a real tribute to the people who have been involved in \nthis that we have been able to get this done. Overhauling the American \nforeign policy bureaucracy needed to be done, and this bill will \nabolish agencies and bureaus born of the cold war imperatives that are \nno longer necessary. Achievement was hard won and something the \nAmerican people can be proud of. Now we can reduce the size of the \nFederal Government, something I have certainly long supported. I want \nto thank those people involved.\n  There are two other things I want to quickly note that have taken \nplace in here as well. I chair the Middle East Subcommittee. One of the \nthings we have been focused on is how do we contain some of the radical \nelements of that region that seek to terrorize us around the world? One \nof the things that is contained in this bill is Radio Free Iran, and \nthat will be broadcast into the Iranian airwaves to send forward clear \nand accurate information about what is taking place around the rest of \nthe world.\n  I think this is a very important tool that we can use to be able to \nwork with the Iranian people, who are some of the most repressed around \nthe world. They have recently voted to elect a more moderate leader, \nyet most have said they will not really be able to express what they \nwant to do because the leader they elected will not have the power or \nthe authority to get that done.\n  Yet, I think we can continue to fight for the Iranian people by \nputting forward good information, true information, of how much we \nsupport what they are doing on the cause in the battle of freedom. I \nthink Radio Free Iran will be a very helpful signal, something \nimportant, as we move forward in working to contain those terroristic \nelements in the world that seek to do us harm and seek harm in much of \nthe rest of the world.\n  Also, I look forward in the future to encouraging other countries to \nfurther engage with us in initiatives to expand democracy, free markets \nand capitalism around the world. I look forward in the future to \nworking with Central Asian countries to link them more with the \ndemocracies and the democracy movement and free markets that are \ngaining strength all around the world. Some dub this a silk road \nstrategy, and I think it is important that we do this in moving forward \na positive agenda, not just one that is always negative toward others \nbut one that is very open and positive toward encouraging the rest of \nthe world.\n  I look forward to working with other chairmen, including Chairman \nSmith, also on the Foreign Relations Committee, as we seek to open up \nthe Central Asian regions to further democracy, to free markets, to \ncapitalism, to liberty. I think that is a good move on our part. Part \nof it is going to be contained in the future of the world. Radio Free \nIran is in this bill and I think that is a positive move. It doesn't \ndiminish the act of privatizing Radio Free Europe. It is important to \nmove forward in that regard. This is a win for the American people, and \na win for people around the world who seek freedom for themselves and \ntheir marketplace, their future and their families. With that, I yield \nthe floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 398 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe I have an amendment that is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I just had a conversation with the \nSecretary of State, Madeleine Albright, relative to the reasons why I \nhave offered an amendment which would require that the Foreign \nRelations Committee confirm the coordinator of Taiwan affairs at the \nState Department.\n  As the Chair is aware, the Taiwan Relations Act requires the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations to oversee the implementation of the TRA \nand the operations and procedures of the American Institute in Taiwan. \nAnd, furthermore, then Secretary of State Vance assured the committee \nin a letter to then Chairman Frank Church that ``the names of \nprospective trustees and officers will be forwarded to the Foreign \nRelations Committee. If the Committee expresses reservations about a \nprospective trusteer, [the Department of State] will undertake to \ndiscuss the matter fully with the Committee before proceeding.''\n  The Secretary of State assured me that she will put into a formal \nletter that the State Department will agree to consult with the Foreign \nRelations Committee prior to appointing any director or chairman of the \nAmerican Institute in Taiwan. The letter will, of course, be directed \nto the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. A copy will be \ngiven to the minority, as well as to me, and Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright agreed to refer,\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nspecifically, in her letter, to the assurance that Chairman Frank \nChurch received from Secretary of State Vance regarding the intent and \ninterpretation of the committee's role under the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  So as a consequence of that assurance, Mr. President, and with thanks \nto the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I think that \nSecretary Albright has met my concern by assuring the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee that, indeed, the State Department will put \ninto writing its agreement to consult with the committee prior to \nappointing the director or chairman of the American Institute in \nTaiwan. As we all know, and the concern we have is that, previously, \nthe appointments took place before the consultations took place. That \nwill not be the case. I thank Senator Biden for his role in taking the \nfirst call from the Secretary and, again, I appreciate Senator Helms' \nindulgence in providing me with the time to come to the floor, as well \nas to talk to the Secretary. As a consequence of that, Mr. President, I \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 398 is withdrawn.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield, I think he has done a good \nday's work. I commend him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to discharge H.R. 1757 from \nthe committee, and all after the enacting clause be stricken and that \nthe language of S. 903, as amended, be inserted, and the bill be read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], the \nSenator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], and the Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nRoberts] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] \nand the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] \nis absent attending a funeral.\n  I also announce that the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 90, nays 5, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 105 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--90\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--5\n\n     Bingaman\n     Byrd\n     Harkin\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Daschle\n     Enzi\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Roberts\n  So the bill (H.R. 1757), as amended, was passed as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 1757) entitled ``An Act to consolidate international \n     affairs agencies, to authorize appropriations for the \n     Department of State and related agencies for fiscal years \n     1998 and 1999, and to ensure that the enlargement of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) proceeds in a \n     manner consistent with United States interests, to strengthen \n     relations between the United States and Russia, to preserve \n     the prerogatives of the Congress with respect to certain arms \n     control agreements, and for other purposes.'', do pass with \n     the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has prevailed after a half-century of \n     Cold War and must now redesign diplomacy to meet the \n     different challenges of a new and changed international \n     context.\n       (2) The security of the United States requires that the \n     United States maintain an effective, professional diplomacy, \n     working in concert with the national intelligence and defense \n     forces of the United States.\n       (3) With modern communications and accelerating \n     technological change, the world is ever more interdependent.\n       (4) Because 30 percent of the United States gross domestic \n     product is trade-related and every one billion dollars of \n     United States exports represents 20,000 American jobs, \n     national prosperity requires assured access to foreign \n     markets and our diplomacy promotes and defends that access.\n       (5) American consumers and American industry count upon the \n     availability of foreign goods and raw materials.\n       (6) The new international agenda includes the following \n     pressing issues, which the Cold War diplomatic structure of \n     the United States is not framed to address adequately: \n     intellectual property rights, refugee migrations, runaway \n     immigration, ethnic conflict, narcotics, international \n     terrorism, epidemic disease, human rights, the advancement of \n     democracy and of market economic systems in developing \n     countries, and a hospitable natural environment.\n       (7) The United States, as the one remaining global power, \n     must provide global leadership to address these issues that \n     affect Americans.\n       (8) It is in the national interest to review the functions, \n     conduct, and structure of United States foreign policy for \n     the 21st century.\n\n     SEC. 702. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     Commission on the Functions, Conduct, and Structure of United \n     States Foreign Policy for the 21st Century (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 703.

Furthermore, the government has \n     requested that the SIU investigate on a ``priority basis'' \n     close to two dozen cases relating to extrajudicial and \n     political killings.\n       (2) President Jean-Bertrand Aristide lived in exile in the \n     United States after he was overthrown by a military coup on \n     September 30, 1991. During his exile, political and \n     extrajudicial killings occurred in Haiti including Aristide \n     financial supporter Antoine Izmery, who was killed on \n     September 11, 1993; Guy Malary, Aristide's Minister of \n     Justice, who was killed on October 14, 1993; and Father Jean-\n     Marie Vincent, a supporter of Aristide, was killed on August \n     28, 1992.\n       (3) President Aristide returned to Haiti on October 15, \n     1994, after some 20,000 United States troops, under the code \n     name Operation Uphold Democracy, entered Haiti as the lead \n     force in a multi-national force with the objective of \n     restoring democratic rule.\n       (4) From June 25, 1995, through October 1995, elections \n     were held where pro-Aristide candidates won a large share of \n     the parliamentary and local government seats.\n       (5) On March 28, 1995, a leading opposition leader to \n     Aristide, Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, and a client, \n     Eugene Baillergeau, were gunned down in Ms. Bertin's car.\n       (6) On May 22, 1995, Michel Gonzalez, Haitian businessman \n     and Aristide's next door neighbor, was killed in a drive-by \n     shooting after alleged attempts by Aristide to acquire his \n     property.\n       (7) After Aristide regained power, three former top Army \n     officers were assassinated: Colonel Max Mayard on March 10, \n     1995; Colonel Michelange Hermann on May 24, 1995; and \n     Brigadier General Romulus Dumarsais was killed on June 27, \n     1995.\n       (8) Presidential elections were held on December 17, 1995. \n     Rene Preval, an Aristide supporter, won, with 89 percent of \n     the votes cast, but with a low voter turnout of only 28 \n     percent, and with many parties allegedly boycotting the \n     election. Preval took office on February 7, 1996.\n       (9) On March 6,1996, police and ministerial security guards \n     killed at least six men during a raid in Cite Soleil, a Port-\n     au-Prince slum.\n       (10) On August 20,1996, two opposition politicians, Jacques \n     Fleurival and Baptist Pastor Antoine Leroy were gunned down \n     outside Fleurival's home.\n       (11) Other alleged extrajudicial and political killings \n     include the deaths of Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, and Jean-Hubert Feuille.\n       (12) Although the Haitian Government claims to have \n     terminated from employment several suspects in the killings, \n     some whom have received training from United States advisors, \n     there has been no substantial progress made in the \n     investigation that has led to the prosecution of any of the \n     above-referenced extrajudicial and political killings.\n       (13) The expiration of the mandate of the United Nations \n     Support Mission in Haiti has been extended three times, the \n     last to July 31, 1997. The Administration has indicated that \n     a fourth extension through November 1997, may be necessary to \n     ensure the transition to a democratic government.\n       (b) Grounds for Exclusion.--The Secretary of State shall \n     deny a visa to, and the Attorney General shall exclude from \n     the United States, any alien who the Secretary of State has \n     reason to believe is a person who--\n       (1) has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Antoine Izmery, Guy Malary, Father Jean-Marie \n     Vincent, Pastor Antoine Leroy, Jacques Fleurival, Mireille \n     Durocher Bertin, Eugene Baillergeau, Michelange Hermann, Max \n     Mayard, Romulus Dumarsais, Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, Michel Gonzalez, and Jean-\n     Hubert Feuille;\n       (2) has been included in the list presented to former \n     president Jean-Bertrand Aristide by former National Security \n     Council Advisor Anthony Lake in December 1995, and acted upon \n     by President Rene Preval;\n       (3) was a member of the Haitian presidential security unit \n     who has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Pastor Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, or \n     who was suspended by President Preval for his involvement in \n     or knowledge of the Leroy and Fleurival killings on August \n     20, 1996;\n       (4) was sought for an interview by the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation as part of its inquiry into the March 28, 1995, \n     murder of Mireille Durocher Bertin and Eugene Baillergeau, \n     Jr., and were credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in those murders, per a June 28, \n     1995, letter to the then Minister of Justice of the \n     Government of Haiti, Jean-Joseph Exume;\n       (5) any member of the Haitian High Command during the \n     period 1991-1994, who has been credibly alleged to have \n     planned, ordered, or participated with members of the Haitian \n     Armed Forces in the September 1991 coup against the duly \n     elected government of Haiti (and his family members) or the \n     subsequent murders of as many as three thousand Haitians \n     during that period; or\n       (6) any individual who has been credibly alleged to have \n     been a member of the paramilitary organization known as FRAPH \n     who planned, ordered, or participated in acts of violence \n     against the Haitian people.\n       (c) Exemption.--This section shall not apply where the \n     Secretary of State finds, on a case by case basis, that the \n     entry into the United States of the person who would \n     otherwise be excluded under this section is necessary for \n     medical reasons, or such person has cooperated fully with the \n     investigation of these political murders. If the Secretary of \n     State exempts such a person, the Secretary shall notify the \n     appropriate congressional committees in writing.\n       (d) Reporting Requirement.--(1) The United States chief of \n     mission in Haiti shall provide the Secretary of State a list \n     of those who have been credibly alleged to have ordered or \n     carried out the extrajudicial and political killings \n     mentioned in paragraph (1) of subsection (b).\n       (2) The Secretary of State shall submit the list provided \n     under paragraph (1) to the appropriate congressional \n     committees not later than three months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (3) The Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of aliens denied visas, and \n     the Attorney General shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of aliens refused entry to \n     the United States as a result of this provision.\n       (4) The Secretary shall submit a report under this \n     subsection not later than six months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and not later than March 1 of each year \n     thereafter as long as the Government of Haiti has not \n     completed the investigation of the extrajudicial and \n     political killings and has not prosecuted those implicated \n     for the killings specified in paragraph (1) of subsection \n     (b).\n       (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 1615.

Stark.\n       (3) The China National Precision Machinery Import Export \n     Corporation has delivered 60 C-802 cruise missiles to Iran \n     for use by vessels of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Navy.\n       (4) Iran is acquiring land batteries to launch C-802 cruise \n     missiles which will provide its armed forces with a weapon of \n     greater range, reliability, accuracy, and mobility than \n     before.\n       (5) Iran has acquired air launched C-802K cruise missiles \n     giving it a 360 degree attack capability.\n       (6) 15,000 members of the United States Armed Forces are \n     stationed within range of the C-802 cruise missiles being \n     acquired by Iran.\n       (7) The Department of State believes that ``[t]hese cruise \n     missiles pose new, direct threats to deployed United States \n     forces''.\n       (8) The delivery of cruise missiles to Iran is a violation \n     of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1701 note).\n       (9) The Clinton Administration ``has concluded at present \n     that the known types [of C-802 cruise missiles] are not of a \n     destabilizing number and type''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to urge \n     the Clinton Administration to enforce the provisions of the \n     Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 with respect to \n     the acquisition by Iran of C-802 model cruise missiles.\n\n     SEC. 1616. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIAN \n                   MINORITIES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Chinese law requires all religious congregations, \n     including Christian congregations, to ``register'' with the \n     Bureau of Religious Affairs, and Christian congregations, \n     depending on denominational affiliation, to be monitored by \n     either the ``Three Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the \n     Protestant Churches of China'', the ``Chinese Christian \n     Council'', the ``Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association'', or \n     the ``Chinese Catholic Bishops College'';\n       (2) the manner in which these registration requirements are \n     implemented and enforced allows the government to exercise \n     direct control over all congregations and their religious \n     activities, and also discourages congregants who fear \n     government persecution and harassment on account of their \n     religious beliefs;\n       (3) in the past several years, unofficial Protestant and \n     Catholic communities have been targeted by the Chinese \n     government in an effort to force all churches to register \n     with the government or face forced dissolution;\n       (4) this campaign has resulted in the beating and \n     harassment of congregants by Chinese public security forces, \n     the closure of churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and \n     criminal and administrative sentences. For example, as \n     reported by credible American and multinational \n     nongovernmental organizations--\n       (A) in February 1995, 500 to 600 evangelical Christians \n     from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces met in Huaian, Jiangsu \n     Province. Public Security Bureau personnel broke up the \n     meeting, beat several participants, imprisoned several of the \n     organizers, and levied severe fines on others;\n       (B) in April 1996 government authorities in Shanghai closed \n     more than 300 home churches or meeting places;\n       (C) from January through May 1996, security forces fanned \n     out through northern Hebei Province, a Catholic stronghold, \n     in order to prevent\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\n     an annual attendance at a major Marian shrine by arresting \n     clergy and lay Catholics and confining prospective attendees \n     to their villages;\n       (D) a communist party document dated November 20, 1996 \n     entitled ``The Legal Procedures for Implementing the \n     Eradication of the Illegal Activities of the Underground \n     Catholic Church'' details steps for eliminating the Catholic \n     movement in Chongren, Xian, Fuzhou and Jiangxi Provinces and \n     accuses believers of ``seriously disturbing the social order \n     and affecting [the] political stability'' of the country; and\n       (E) in March 1997, public security officials raided the \n     home of the ``underground'' Bishop of Shanghai, confiscating \n     religious articles and $2,500 belonging to the church.\n       (b) It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to release from incarceration all those held for \n     participation in religious activities outside the aegis of \n     the official churches, and cease prosecuting or detaining \n     those who participate in such religious activities;\n       (2) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to abolish its present church registration process;\n       (3) the government of the People's Republic of China fully \n     adhere to the religious principles protected by the United \n     Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and\n       (4) the Administration should raise the United States \n     concerns over the persecution of Protestant and Catholic \n     believers with the government of the People's Republic of \n     China, including at the proposed state visit by President \n     Jiang Zemin to the United States, and at other high-level \n     meetings which may take place.\n\n     SEC. 1617. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NORTH ATLANTIC \n                   TREATY ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The West's victory in the Cold War dramatically changed \n     the political and national security landscape in Europe.\n       (2) The unity, resolve, and strength of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization was the principal factor behind that \n     victory.\n       (3) The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in April 1949 and \n     created the most successful defense alliance in history.\n       (4) The President of the United States and leaders of other \n     NATO countries have indicated their intention to enlarge \n     alliance membership to include at least three new countries.\n       (5) The Senate expressed its approval of the enlargement \n     process by voting 81-16 in favor of the NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996.\n       (6) The United States is bound by Article Five of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty to respond to an attack on any NATO member as \n     it would to an attack on the United States itself.\n       (7) Although the prospect of NATO membership has provided \n     the impetus for several countries to resolve long standing \n     disputes, the North Atlantic Treaty does not provide for a \n     formal dispute resolution process by which members can \n     resolve differences among themselves without undermining \n     Article Five obligations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should consider a \n     formal dispute resolution process within the Alliance prior \n     to its December 1997 ministerial meeting.\n\n     SEC. 1618. JAPAN-UNITED STATES FRIENDSHIP COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Relief From Restriction of Interchangeability of \n     Funds.--\n       (1) Section 6(4) of the Japan-United States Friendship Act \n     (22 U.S.C. 2905(4)) is amended by striking ``needed, except'' \n     and all that follows through ``United States'' and inserting \n     ``needed''.\n       (2) The second sentence of section 7(b) of the Japan-United \n     States Friendship Act (22 U.S.C. 2906(b)) is amended to read \n     as follows: ``Such investment may be made only in interest-\n     bearing obligations of the United States, in obligations \n     guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United \n     States, in interest-bearing obligations of Japan, or in \n     obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by \n     Japan.''.\n       (b) Revision of Name of Commission.--\n       (1) The Japan-United States Friendship Commission is hereby \n     designated as the ``United States-Japan Commission''. Any \n     reference in any provision of law, Executive order, \n     regulation, delegation of authority, or other document to the \n     Japan-United States Friendship Commission shall be deemed to \n     be a reference to the United States-Japan Commission.\n       (2) The Japan-United States Friendship Act (22 U.S.C. 2901 \n     et seq.) is amended by striking ``Japan-United States \n     Friendship Commission'' each place it appears and inserting \n     ``United States-Japan Commission''.\n       (3) The heading of section 4 of the Japan-United States \n     Friendship Act (22 U.S.C. 2903) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n\n                  ``united states-japan commission''.\n\n       (c) Revision of Name of Trust Fund.--\n       (1) The Japan-United States Friendship Trust Fund is hereby \n     designated as the ``United States-Japan Trust Fund''.

AVIATION SAFETY.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the need for cooperative \n     efforts in transportation and aviation safety be placed on \n     the agenda for the Summit of the Americas to be held in \n     Santiago, Chile, in March 1998. Since April 1996, when \n     ministers and transportation officials from 23 countries in \n     the Western Hemisphere met in Santiago, Chile, in order to \n     develop the Hemispheric Transportation Initiative, aviation \n     safety and transportation standardization has become an \n     increasingly important issue. The adoption of comprehensive \n     Hemisphere-wide measures to enhance transportation safety, \n     including standards for equipment, infrastructure, and \n     operations as well as harmonization of regulations relating \n     to equipment, operations, and transportation safety are \n     imperative. This initiative will increase the efficiency and \n     safety of the current system and consequently facilitate \n     trade.\n\n     SEC. 1620. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD \n                   THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the followings findings:\n       (1) As the world's leading democracy, the United States \n     cannot ignore the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China's record on human rights and religious persecution.\n       (2) According to Amnesty International, ``A fifth of the \n     world's people are ruled by a government that treats \n     fundamental human rights with contempt. Human rights \n     violations continue on a massive scale.''.\n       (3) According to Human Rights Watch/Asia reported that: \n     ``Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted \n     by the government during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at \n     forcing all churches to register or face dissolution, \n     resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of \n     churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In \n     Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or \n     meeting points were closed down by the security authorities \n     in April alone.''.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China's compulsory family \n     planning policies include forced abortions.\n       (5) China's attempts to intimidate Taiwan and the \n     activities of its military, the People's Liberation Army, \n     both in the United States and abroad, are of major concern.\n       (6) The Chinese government has threatened international \n     stability through its weapons sales to regimes, including \n     Iran and Iraq, that sponsor terrorism and pose a direct \n     threat to American military personnel and interests.\n       (7) The efforts of two Chinese companies, the China North \n     Industries Group (NORINCO) and the China Poly Group (POLY), \n     deserve special rebuke for their involvement in the sale of \n     AK-47 machine guns to California street gangs.\n       (8) Allegations of the Chinese government's involvement in \n     our political system may involve both civil and criminal \n     violations of our laws.\n       (9) The Senate is concerned that China may violate the 1984 \n     Sino-British Joint Declaration transferring Hong Kong from \n     British to Chinese rule by limiting political and economic \n     freedom in Hong Kong.\n       (10) The Senate strongly believes time has come to take \n     steps that would signal to Chinese leaders that religious \n     persecution, human rights abuses, forced abortions, military \n     threats and weapons proliferation, and attempts to influence \n     American elections are unacceptable to the American people.\n       (11) The United States should signal its disapproval of \n     Chinese government actions through targeted sanctions, while \n     at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and cultural \n     exchanges that can lead to positive change in China.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) limit the granting of United States visas to Chinese \n     government offices who work in entities the implementation of \n     China's laws and directives on religious practices and \n     coercive family planning, and those officials materially \n     involved in the massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen \n     square;\n       (2) limit United States taxpayer subsidies for the Chinese \n     government through multilateral development institutions such \n     as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund;\n       (3) publish a list of all companies owned in part or wholly \n     by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Chinese \n     government who export to, or have an office in, the United \n     States;\n       (4) consider imposing targeted sanctions on NORINCO and \n     POLY by not allowing them to export to, nor to maintain a \n     physical presence in, the United States for a period of one \n     year; and\n       (5) promote democratic values in China by increasing United \n     States Government funding of Radio Free Asia, the National \n     Endowment for Democracy's programs in China and existing \n     student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs between \n     the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n\n     SEC. 1621.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at \nlearning of the passing of Barry Sklar, a long-time staffer on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, who died unexpectedly on Sunday. \nBarry was well known to a number of Members and staff who had occasion \nto work with him during the more than a decade he served on the \nprofessional staff of the Committee, as an able advisor on Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean affairs.\n  In a recommendation for Barry just a few short months ago, I wrote \nthat he ``demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the issues and great \nprofessionalism and integrity in his work.'' But that only describes \nthe qualities that led to his intellectual accomplishments and career \nsuccess. It does not begin to tell why Barry won the personal \nadmiration, friendship and esteem of all who came to know him.\n  Barry Sklar was a warm, gentle, kind and unassuming man who was \ndevoted to upholding moral principles in his work and his personal \nlife. Despite his involvement in issues and policies that made frequent \nheadlines, Barry maintained a sense of modesty and great humility. He \nnever forgot that his family came first.\n  Throughout the turbulent decade of the 1980's for Latin America, \nBarry worked for peace and conflict resolution through international \ncooperation. Due to his work on human rights, as was noted at his \nfuneral, many children today have mothers and fathers and sisters and \nbrothers who might otherwise have been forgotten by the world when they \ndisappeared from their villages. Barry's life reveals his commitment to \nkeeping families safe and together, in his own case and around the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I would like to extend to Barry's wife, Judith, and \nhis sons Joel Mark and Adam Benjamin my deepest condolences. I am sure \nI speak for my colleagues in expressing these sentiments. He will be \ngreatly missed by all of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5789-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING ART RYNEARSON\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before we wrap things up here today, let me \nexpress my appreciation to a very special gentleman for his tireless \nefforts, his hard work and cheerful disposition throughout the entire \nprocess of the drafting of the bill just approved by the Senate. Art \nRynearson is legislative counsel to the Foreign Relations Committee, \nand we have truly overworked that gentleman during this year with the \ndrafting sessions on the resolution of ratification for the CWC, often \nlasting until 2 a.m., and when we finished that we called upon Art to \nhelp the committee prepare the resolution of ratification for the CFE \nFlank Document.

Currently, \nthese machines are not manufactured in the United States nor is a \nsubstitute readily available. Therefore, suspending the duties on these \nitems would not adversely affect domestic industries.\n  Mr. President, suspending the duty on these machines will benefit the \nconsumers of earthmoving tires.

Madam President, today, I, along with Senator Thurmond, \nintroduce duty suspension legislation designed to permit the import of \ncertain tire manufacturing equipment into the United States duty free. \nU.S. companies do not manufacture the custom equipment to be imported, \nand therefore its importation will not displace domestic sourcing. \nMoreover, because the product at issue is manufacturing equipment, it \nwill assist in the creation of additional jobs in the tire \nmanufacturing industry.\n  I believe that this is the most appropriate use of duty suspension \nlegislation. The custom imported product will not displace any product \nmanufactured in the United States. Moreover, the imported product will \nassist in creating more productive capacity in the United States. This \nequipment will be used to manufacture a product that heretofore was not \nmade in the United States. I am therefore hopeful that this new \ncapacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will \nincrease employment in the tire manufacturing industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 916. A bill to designate the U.S. Post Office building located at \n750 Highway 28 East in Taylorsville, MS, as the ``Blaine H. Eaton Post \nOffice Building''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n    THE BLAINE H. EATON POST OFFICE BUILDING DESIGNATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ndesignating the U.S. Post Office facility located in Taylorsville, MS, \nas the ``Blaine H. Eaton Post Office Building.''\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\n  A native of Smith County, Mississippi, Mr. Eaton attended Jones \nJunior College from 1932-34 and was named Alumni of the Year in 1984. \nHe also attended the University of Mississippi and George Washington \nLaw School.\n  He began his professional career as a farmer and cotton buyer for \nAnderson-Clayton Co. and in 1942, he became the first executive \nsecretary to my predecessor in the Senate, U.S. Senator James O. \nEastland. Blaine Eaton served our Nation in the U.S. Navy from 1944 to \n1946. Upon returning home from the war, he was elected to serve in the \nMississippi State House of Representatives, and he effectively served \nthe people of Smith County for 12 years. His leadership as chairman of \nthe Highway and Highway Finance Committee resulted in the successful \npassage of the Farm-to-Market legislation that is still benefiting \nMississippians today as the State Aid Road Program. After leaving \npublic office in 1958, Blaine became the manager of the Southern Pine \nElectric Power Association. His outstanding service and accomplishments \nwere recognized by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association \nwith the Clyde T. Ellis Award for distinguished service and outstanding \nleadership.\n  Although retiring from his professional career in 1982, Blaine \nremained active in community service and enriched the lives of many by \nvolunteering his time and leadership abilities to such organizations as \nthe Lions International, the Hiram Masonic Lodge, the Southeast \nMississippi Livestock Association and the Economic Development \nFoundation. He was also a loyal member of the First Baptist Church of \nTaylorsville where he taught Sunday School classes for 25 years.\n  With the death of Blaine Eaton in 1995, our State lost one of its \nfinest citizens. Designating the Taylorsville Post Office as the \n``Blaine H. Eaton Post Office Building'' will commemorate the public \nservice of this extraordinary Mississippian who dedicated his life to \nthe betterment of the community and State he loved so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 916\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF BLAINE H. EATON POST OFFICE \n                   BUILDING.\n\n       The United States Post Office building located at 750 \n     Highway 28 East in Taylorsville, Mississippi, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Blaine H. Eaton Post Office \n     Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the United States \n     Post Office building referred to in section 1 shall be deemed \n     to be a reference to the ``Blaine H. Eaton Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 917. A bill to amend section 6105 of title 38, United States Code, \nto expand the range of criminal offenses resulting in forfeiture of \nveterans benefits; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE NATIONAL CEMETERIES SANCTITY ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Terrorism Subcommittee Senator \nFeinstein, to introduce the Protection of the Sanctity of National \nCemeteries Act.\n  In so doing, I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to close a \nhuge loophole in our laws, which will allow Timothy McVeigh a hero's \nburial in a national cemetery--even after the Federal Government puts \nhim to death for his heinous act of terrorism.\n  Mr. President, current law lists a whole host of criminal acts by \nwhich even an honorably discharged veteran loses the right to burial in \na national cemetery. These acts include espionage, treason, sedition, \nsabotage, rebellion and disclosure of national secrets, among other \noffenses.\n  But for some reason, the use of a weapon of mass destruction against \nthe property or persons of the U.S. Government is not included in this \nlist. Nor is the murder of Federal law enforcement officers or the rest \nof the offenses already included in the definition of a Federal crime \nof terrorism. Each of these offenses is as clear a threat to the \nNational Security of the United States as the crimes already listed, \nand should clearly disqualify the perpetrator from an honorable burial \nat Government expense.\n  Because of this gaping loophole in the law, Timothy McVeigh--\namazingly--remains entitled to burial next to true national heroes--men \nand women who have fought and died to defend this country and \neverything it stands for. He remains entitled to this hero's burial \ndespite having committed the worst act of terrorism ever perpetrated on \nAmerican soil.\n  This situation is unacceptable. It is an insult to the memories of \nthe 168 victims killed in the Oklahoma City blast. It is an insult to \nthe memories of the truly courageous men and women who have earned and \nmaintained the right to a hero's burial by the Federal Government. And \nit is an insult to justice, plain and simple.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to close this loophole once and for \nall. My bill would amend current law to include every crime listed as a \nFederal crime of terrorism, including McVeigh's crimes, in the list of \ndisqualifiers for military burial. We should not provide honorable \nburials for persons who commit acts of terrorism against the U.S. \nGovernment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, I ask unanimous-\nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Cemeteries Sanctity \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES RESULTING IN \n                   FORFEITURE OF VETERANS BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6105 of title 38, United States \n     code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by inserting ``32, 37, 81, 175,'' before ``792,''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``831, 842(m), 842(n), 844(e), 844(f), \n     844(i), 930(c), 956, 1114, 1116, 1203, 1361, 1363, 1366, \n     1751, 1992, 2152, 2280, 2281, 2332, 2332a, 2332b, 2332c, \n     2339A, 2339B, 2340A,'' after ``798,'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) by striking out ``and 226'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``226, and 236'';\n       (ii) by striking out ``and 2276'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``2276, and 2284''; and\n       (iii) by striking out ``and'' at the end;\n       (C) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and\n       (D) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new \n     paragraph (4):\n       ``(4) sections 46502 and 60123(b) of title 49; and''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence of subsection (c), by striking \n     out ``or (4)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``(4), or (5)''.\n       (b) conforming Amendments.--(1) The section heading for \n     such section is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 6105.

A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                  THE CLEAN MONEY CLEAN ELECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Fourth of July will occur in a little \nover 2 weeks. That is the date by which the President challenged the \nCongress to act on campaign finance reform in this first session of the \n105th Congress. I regret I must announce the obvious: not only has \nneither house of the Congress addressed this issue in serious floor \ndebate and legislative action; there is virtually no prospect that \neither house will do so by the time we leave for the July 4 recess. Nor \nis it clear when or if the 105th Congress will address this issue.\n  The Fourth of July has other implications, of course, Mr. President--\nand\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nsome of these, too, are related to campaign finance reform. This is a \npeculiarly American holiday, when Americans throughout the Nation take \ntime out to gather in parks and back yards, at barbecues and picnics \nand family reunions and community parades, to celebrate our democracy, \nour freedom.\n  But I think there would be widespread agreement, as we do this in \n1997, that there is an unease across the Nation about the political \nprocess. The American people are concerned. Their concern is not \nprimarily about who their elected officials are. Their frustration, \ncynicism, and anger run deep and broad--directed, as most of us \nrealize, at the entire political system.\n  Americans believe that their Government has been hijacked by special \ninterests, that the political system responds to the needs of wealthy \nspecial interests, not the interests of ordinary, hard-working \ncitizens. They sense, in many ways, that the Congress is not \nnecessarily ``the people's house.''\n  We see evidence of this in the feeling of powerlessness described by \nmany Americans, and in the great gulf that grows wider between the \nAmerican people and their elected officials. You can see it expressed \nfrequently in town meetings and in various polls. The people feel that \nCongress all too often fails to represent the real concerns of real \nAmericans, and they sense that they are being left out.\n  The result is that more and more Americans are checking out of the \nsystem. If their democracy isn't going to respond to their concerns, \nthen they ask themselves why they should respond to the request that \nthey participate meaningfully in the political process. The reason for \nthe disconnect is very simple, Mr. President. The amount of money in \npolitics--money given to office seekers to campaign for office--\ndisenfranchises the average person who knows that he or she can never \nhope to have the same kind of access as that money achieves for those \nwho give it.\n  Special interest money is moving and dictating and governing the \nagenda of American politics, and most Americans understand that.\n  A few findings from a bipartisan poll tell the story: 49 percent of \nregistered voters believe that lobbyists and special interests control \nthe Federal Government; 92 percent of registered voters believe that \nspecial interest contributions affect the votes of Members of Congress; \nand 88 percent believe that people who make large campaign \ncontributions get special favors from politicians.\n  The evidence of public discontent could hardly be more compelling, \nyet the Congress drifts on, with no apparent sense of urgency in trying \nto respond to that discontent. We all understand there are differences \non each side of the aisle about the best way to address the problem, \nbut I do not see how anyone can say in good conscience that there is a \nbona fide effort under way involving the leadership of both parties in \nthe U.S. Congress to even try to work out those differences.\n  If we want to regain the respect and confidence of the American \npeople and if we want to reconnect to them and reconnect them to our \ndemocracy, we have to get the special interest money out of politics. \nAs my friend Ross Perot says, ``It's just that simple.''\n  The American people, however, are skeptical about either our \nwillingness or ability to do that, and it doesn't help that the 105th \nCongress has yet to take up campaign finance reform. It doesn't help \nthat the President and the Speaker of the House shook hands in a very \npublic way 2 years ago and promised to do something about campaign \nfinance, and nothing has transpired between then and now to fulfill \nthat commitment, and from the perspective of the ordinary citizen who \nwants to see the special interest money removed from politics, it \nreally looks like a conspiracy of inaction. Those who profit from the \ncurrent system --special interests who know how to play the game, and \npoliticians who know how to play the game--seem to be shutting down any \nprospect of real change.\n\n  Mr. President, I know why people feel that way. I have been working \non campaign finance reform since I came to the Senate. I have worked \nfor years with my colleagues Joe Biden and Robert Byrd and others, and \nwith former Senators such as George Mitchell, David Boren, and Bill \nBradley--searching for the right equation to bring about change. \nAlthough from my arrival in the Senate I have advocated sweeping \noverhaul of the system, in recent times I have been a strong supporter \nof the proposal advanced by John McCain and Russ Feingold, even though \nit is incremental in design, because they succeeded in assembling a \npackage of reforms that bridged the party divide that so often has been \npermitted to poison this debate and prevent meaningful action--and \nbecause I believe so fervently that we must succeed to whatever extent \nit is possible in moving toward what should be our objective.\n  Throughout these years of activity--the 12 years of my service as a \nSenator--my goal has always been the same, to get special interest \ninfluence and special interest access out of politics.\n  Mr. President, we come to the floor this afternoon on an auspicious \nday--or, perhaps more accurately, an inauspicious day. In any event it \nis a red-letter day for America. It was the day 25 years ago that was \nthe beginning of two very difficult years in American history. It was \n25 years ago today that the famous burglary at the Watergate complex \noverlooking the Potomac in Washington, DC, took place, followed by \ncoverup activities that reached into the Oval Office and resulted in \nthe resignation in disgrace of an American President.\n  During the investigation of the illegal activities, there were \nmultiple revelations of huge amounts of cash moving in brown paper bags \nand leather briefcases. The public revulsion triggered real reform, \nalthough that reform, sadly, was directed primarily toward only the \nPresidential election financing system. But even that spirit of reform, \nand the significant alterations of the system to which it led, has been \nbroken by those who want to trample it with the exploitation of every \nloophole possible in the campaign finance system.\n  It is unfortunately fitting, then, Mr. President, that we return our \nattention on this day to that nemesis of the democratic process, the \ncorrosive effect of money in politics.\n  This time, 25 years later, it is the no-holds-barred pursuit of quite \nstunning amounts of money by both parties in the 1996 Presidential and \ncongressional elections that captures the attention and the \ncondemnation of the American people--and the allegations that many of \nthose who gave large sums to one or the other party, or one candidate \nor another, expected favors in return, ranging from the trivial to the \nsignificant.\n  The American people are not stupid. They know that there is no such \nthing as a free lunch. They believe--with considerable justification--\nthat the scores of millions of dollars that flow from well-to-do \nindividuals and special interest organizations usually are not donated \nout of absolute disinterested patriotism, admiration for the \ncandidates, and support for our electoral system.\n  They watch repeatedly as public policy decisions made by the Congress \nand the Executive Branch appear to be influenced by those who have made \nthe contributions. They conclude--again, I fear, with considerable good \nreason--that either those contributions directly affected the decision-\nmaking process, or, at the very least, purchased for those contributors \na greater degree of access to the elected officials who make the \ndecisions, so that the contributors can more effectively and \npersuasively make their case.\n\n  During this past election, 1996, not only in congressional races but \nalso, distressingly, in the Presidential campaign--and it is especially \ndistressing because many of us thought the Watergate reform legislation \nof 1974 had suitably repaired the system of presidential campaign \nfinance--we saw a flood of special interest money the likes of which \nhave never previously been seen here or anywhere.\n  Every day during the past year, it has been impossible to open a \nnewspaper or turn on a television without being confronted by yet \nanother new revelation about an alleged campaign finance irregularity \nor abuse--or a defense of the actions at which the charges are leveled.\n  And, I must say, the defenses are generally pretty lame. Those \nagainst whom the allegations are leveled may be able to find protection \nin the letter\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\nof the law, but they are unsuccessful in avoiding the opprobrium of the \nAmerican people and consequent cynicism about our government system.\n  I am one who believes we absolutely must do something to reverse the \ntrend if we are to save our precious democratic system. And I also have \nconcluded that the forces arrayed against the kind of partial public \nfinancing approaches we previously have pushed are so strong that we \nmust find a new approach behind which it will be possible to develop \nsuch strong consensus support across the nation that the Congress will \nbe unable to resist it.\n  To the extent competent polling and other public opinion assessment \ntechniques can make a reliable determination, the evidence is \npersuasive that, while the American people are willing to embrace \nradical change of campaign financing--to take all special interest \nmoney and heave it over the side and shoulder all reasonable campaign \ncosts--they have only passing interest and precious little enthusiasm \nfor half-way measures. Their judgment appears to be that it would be a \nwaste of effort and tax dollars to invest public resources in a system \nthat retains any significant degree of special interest funding. They \nsee such an approach as playing them for chumps--while the influence of \nspecial interests would remain as strong as it currently is.\n  What does seem to capture the attention and imagination--and \nsupport--of a significant majority of Americans is sweeping reform of \ncampaign finance that removes all special interest money from the \nsystem. This is not a notion dreamed up here in Washington--either here \non Capitol Hill or in an organization's office downtown. Activities to \nimplement such an approach to campaign finance reform have been \nunderway in a number of States, including my own State of \nMassachusetts. Maine voters took the boldest step, approving such a \nconcept for State elections. Now Vermont has followed suit with a \nprovision applying to the Governor's office, and Governor Howard Dean \nis poised to sign the proposal into law. Other State-level efforts are \nin various stages of advancement.\n  Paul Wellstone and John Glenn came early-on to the same conclusion to \nwhich I came--that we want to champion such an approach at the federal \nlevel. And we have been joined by Joe Biden and Pat Leahy, and other \nSenators are studying the idea carefully and we hope and trust we will \nbe joined by some of them in the near future.\n  We come to the floor today to introduce the Clean Money, Clean \nElections Act, a bill that, as its most important feature, takes all \nspecial interest money out of Federal elections. This initiative will \noffer a set amount of funding, based on a State's voting-age \npopulation, to each candidate who agrees to foreswear private \ncontributions. It not only removes all special interest money from the \nsystem, but also removes the necessity for candidates to spend a huge \namount of time fundraising and to pour massive amounts of the money \nthey do raise into further fundraising efforts.\n  In addition, this legislation will shut down the so-called soft \nmoney, or unregulated money, loopholes that have permitted massive \namounts of special interest money to enter the electoral process around \neven those restrictions that now exist.\n  This process takes a major step forward today with the introduction \nof this legislation. Comparable efforts are underway in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I understand a similar bill will be introduced \nthere in coming weeks.\n  We believe the people are, once again, ahead of Washington--and, once \nagain, ahead of the politicians. And we believe that ultimately this or \na derivative approach is the only way effectively to restore people's \nconfidence that, in America, anybody truly can run, and win--not just \nthose who have access to wealth or who are wealthy themselves.\n  This is a bill to restore our own democracy and preserve what we \nthink is the heart of our precious system. We hope and believe that--\nwith a strong assist from their constituents--increasing numbers of our \ncolleagues, over time, will come to recognize this and support the \nbill.\n  This will not be a rapidly completed process, Mr. President. We \nintroduce this bill with the knowledge that it would not attract more \nthan perhaps a quarter of the votes in the Senate today. This will be a \njourney, a journey of mobilizing the American people to require their \nelected representatives to take needed action. Our bill will be the \nobjective, and it also will be the rallying point. And with the \ncommitment of the organizations and individuals who advocate this \napproach, a movement will develop which cannot be stopped. Just as in \nMaine and now in Vermont, the support will grow to critical mass and \nthese reforms will succeed.\n  I look forward to walking this road with all who support this \napproach--both my colleagues in the Senate and friends outside the \nSenate. We who introduce this bill are committed to fundamentally \nchanging our electoral system, and returning control of our elected \nofficials and their agenda to the people after wresting it back from \nthe special interests.\n  I believe we will succeed, and can look back on this day--the 25th \nanniversary of a lamentable event in American history--as an important \nbeginning point in that endeavor.\n  I want to commend those colleagues who join in introducing this \nlegislation today--Senators Wellstone, Glenn, Biden, and Leahy. I \nparticularly want to compliment Senator Wellstone's capable staff, \nespecially Brian Ahlberg, who have invested countless hours in the \neffort that is so essential but often unnoticed, of transforming \ncomplex policy objectives into legislative language, working hand-in-\nhand with Senate Legislative Counsel staff and representatives of \norganizations which have been developing this idea at the State level. \nMy staff has greatly appreciated their contributions to this effort and \nenjoyed working with them, as I have enjoyed the cooperative efforts \nwith Senator Wellstone and my other colleagues.\n  Mr. President, before I yield to Senator Wellstone and then, in turn, \nto other Senators who may wish to make remarks about this legislation, \nI ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks, followed by a summary of \nthe bill and a chart depicting the qualifying contribution requirement \nand the ``Clean Money'' allocation and spending limit for a general \nelection that would apply to a candidate participating in the ``Clean \nMoney, Clean Election'' system in each State.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 918\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the Senate undermines democracy in the United States by--\n       (1) violating the democratic principle of ``one person, one \n     vote'' and diminishing the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (2) diminishing a Senator's accountability to constituents \n     by compelling legislators to be accountable to the major \n     contributors who finance their election campaigns;\n       (3) creating a conflict of interest, perceived and real, by \n     encouraging Senators to take money from private interests \n     that are directly affected by Federal legislation;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory outcomes shaped by unequal access \n     to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) driving up the cost of election campaigns, making it \n     difficult for qualified candidates without personal fortunes \n     or access to campaign contributions from monied individuals \n     and interest groups to mount competitive Senate election \n     campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers, because large campaign \n     contributors tend to give their money to incumbent Senators, \n     thus causing Senate elections to be less competitive; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Clean Money.--The \n     Senate finds and declares that the replacement of private \n     campaign contributions with clean money financing for all \n     primary, runoff, and general elections to the Senate would \n     enhance American democracy by--\n       (1) helping to eliminate access to wealth as a determinant \n     of a citizen's influence within the political process and to \n     restore meaning to the principle of ``one person, one vote'';\n       (2) increasing the accountability of Senators to the \n     constituents who elect them;\n       (3) eliminating the inherent conflict of interest caused by \n     the private financing of the election campaigns of public \n     officials, thus restoring public confidence in the fairness \n     of the electoral and legislative processes;\n       (4) reversing the escalating cost of elections and saving \n     taxpayers billions of dollars that are currently misspent due \n     to legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the influence \n     of contributions;\n       (5) creating a more level playing field for incumbents and \n     challengers, creating genuine opportunities for all Americans \n     to run for the Senate, and encouraging more competitive \n     elections; and\n       (6) freeing Senators from the constant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Short title; table of contents.\n\n      TITLE I--CLEAN MONEY FINANCING OF SENATE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS\n\n           (pp 2-32)\n\n     SECTION 101. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n          Section 101 states the premises for the legislation.\n\n     SECTION 102. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND BENEFITS OF ``CLEAN \n                   MONEY'' FINANCING OF SENATE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.\n\n       Section 102 of the bill would create a new Title V in the \n     1971 Federal Election Campaign Act (2 U.S.C. 431). It defines \n     ``clean money;'' establishes the requirements for a major \n     party or other candidate to qualify to receive clean money; \n     establishes the dates and methods for receiving clean money; \n     places restrictions, including spending limits, on clean \n     money candidates; establishes the amounts of clean money to \n     be provided\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n     to candidates for primary and general elections; and allows \n     for providing additional clean money to match expenditures by \n     and on behalf of an opponent which exceed a trigger-amount \n     above the voluntary spending limit adopted by the clean money \n     candidate.\n       The section defines clean money as the funds provided to a \n     qualifying clean money candidate. Clean money will be \n     provided from a Senate Election Fund established in the \n     Treasury and composed of unspent seed money contributions, \n     qualifying contributions, penalties, and amounts appropriated \n     for clean money financing of Senate election campaigns.\n       The clean money candidate qualifying period begins 270 days \n     prior to the date of the primary election. To qualify for \n     clean money financing for a primary or a general election, a \n     candidate must be certified as qualified by 30 days prior to \n     the date of that election. Prior to the candidate receiving \n     clean money from the Senate Election Fund, a candidate \n     wishing to qualify as a clean money candidate may spend only \n     ``seed money.'' Seed money contributions are private \n     contributions of not more than $100 in the aggregate by a \n     person. It is the only private money a clean money candidate \n     may receive as a contribution, and spend. A candidate's seed \n     money contributions are limited to a total of $50,000 plus an \n     additional $5,000 for every congressional district in the \n     state over one. Seed money can be spent for campaign-related \n     costs such as to open an office, fund a grassroots campaign \n     or hold community meetings, but cannot be spent for a \n     television or radio broadcast or for personal use. At the \n     time that a clean money candidate receives clean money, all \n     unspent seed money shall be remitted to the Commission to be \n     deposited in the Senate Election Fund\n       To qualify for clean money financing, a major party \n     candidate must gather a number of qualifying contributions \n     equal to one-quarter of 1 percent of the state's voting age \n     population, or 1,000 qualifying contributions, whichever is \n     greater. A qualifying contribution is $5, made by an \n     individual registered to vote in the candidate's state, and \n     is made during the qualifying period. Qualifying \n     contributions are made to the Senate Election Fund by check, \n     money order or cash. They shall be accompanied by the \n     contributor's name and address and a signed statement that \n     the purpose of the contribution is to allow the named \n     candidate to qualify as a clean money candidate.\n       A major party candidate is the candidate of a party whose \n     candidate for Senator, President or Governor in the preceding \n     5 years received, as a candidate of that party, 25 percent or \n     more of the total popular vote in that state for all \n     candidates for that office.\n       Clean money candidates qualify for clean money for both the \n     primary and the general election. A qualifying candidate will \n     receive clean money for the primary election upon being \n     certified by the Commission, and once the ``primary election \n     period'' has begun. A candidate will be certified within 5 \n     days of filing for certification if the candidate has \n     gathered the threshold number of qualifying contributions, \n     has not spent private money other than seed money, and is \n     eligible to be on the primary ballot. The primary election \n     period is from 90 days prior to the primary election date \n     until the primary election date. The qualifying period begins \n     180 days before the beginning of the primary election period. \n     A candidate must be certified as a clean money candidate by \n     30 days prior to the primary election in order to receive \n     clean money financing for the primary election.\n       A clean money candidate who wins the party primary and is \n     eligible to be placed on the ballot for the general election \n     will receive clean money financing for the general election. \n     A candidate not of a major party who does not qualify as a \n     clean money candidate in time to receive clean money \n     financing for the primary election period may still qualify \n     for clean money financing for the general election by \n     gathering the threshold number of qualifying contributions by \n     30 days prior to the general election and qualifying to be on \n     the ballot.\n       The amount of clean money a qualified candidate receives \n     for the primary and the general election is also the spending \n     limit for clean money candidates for each respective \n     election. The clean money amount for the general election for \n     a qualified clean money candidate is established according to \n     a formula based on a state's voting age population. The \n     formula results in clean money financing for primary and \n     general elections for major party candidates in contested \n     elections which equals 80 percent of the spending limits for \n     primary and general elections established by S. 25, the \n     McCain-Feingold bill.\n       The section establishes a clean money ceiling for the \n     general election of $4.4 million, and a floor of $760,000. \n     The clean money amount for a contested major party primary is \n     67 percent of the clean money amount for the general \n     election. In the case of an uncontested primary or general \n     election, the clean money amount is 25 percent of the amount \n     provided in the case of a contested election.\n       To qualify for clean money financing, a candidate who is \n     not a major party candidate must collect 150 percent of the \n     number of qualifying contributions that a major party \n     candidate in the same election is required to collect. A \n     candidate who is not a major party candidate must otherwise \n     qualify for clean money financing according to the same \n     requirements, restrictions and deadlines as does a major \n     party candidate. A candidate who is not a major party \n     candidate who qualifies as a clean money candidate in the \n     primary election period will receive 25 percent of the \n     regular clean money amount for a major party candidate in the \n     primary. A candidate who is not a major party candidate who \n     qualifies as a clean money candidate will receive the same \n     clean money amount in the general election as will a major \n     party candidate.\n       Additional clean money financing, above the regular clean \n     money amount, will be provided to a clean money candidate to \n     match aggregate expenditures by a private money candidate, \n     and independent expenditures against the clean money \n     candidate or on behalf of an opponent of the clean money \n     candidate, which are, separately or combined, in excess of \n     125 percent of the clean money spending limit. The total \n     amount of matching clean money financing received by a \n     candidate shall not exceed 200 percent of the regular clean \n     money spending limit.\n       The section establishes penalties for misuse of clean money \n     and for expenditure by a clean money candidate of money other \n     than clean money.\n\n     SECTION 103. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATE MONEY \n                   CANDIDATES.\n\n       Section 103 requires private money candidates facing clean \n     money opponents to report within 48 hours expenditures which \n     in aggregate exceed the amount of clean money provided to a \n     clean money candidate. A report of additional expenditures, \n     in aggregate increments of $1,000, will also be required.\n\n     SECTION 104. TRANSITION RULE FOR CURRENT ELECTION CYCLE.\n\n       Section 104 allows a candidate who received private \n     contributions or made private expenditures prior to enactment \n     of the Act not to be disqualified as a clean money candidate.\n\n     TITLE II--INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES; COORDINATED EXPENDITURES.\n\n         (pp 33-47.)\n\n     SECTION 201. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDEPENDENT \n                   EXPENDITURES.\n\n       Section 201 amends Section 304 (c) of the 1971 FECA (2 \n     U.S.C. 434 (c)) to require reporting of independent \n     expenditures made or obligated to be made in support of an \n     opponent of or in opposition to a clean money candidate. \n     Prior to 20 days before the date of the election, each such \n     independent expenditure which exceeds in aggregate $1,000 by \n     a person shall be reported within 48 hours. After 20 days \n     prior to the date of the election, each such independent \n     expenditure made or obligated to be made which exceeds in \n     aggregate $500 shall be reported within 24 hours.\n\n     SECTION 202. DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE.\n\n       Section 202 amends section 301 of the 1971 FECA (2 U.S.C. \n     431) to create a new definition of independent expenditure. \n     An independent expenditure would be an expenditure made by a \n     person other than a candidate or candidate's authorized \n     committee: That is made for a communication that contains \n     express advocacy; and is made without the participation or \n     cooperation of, and without coordination with, a candidate.\n       The section defines express advocacy as a communication \n     that is made through a broadcast medium, newspaper, magazine, \n     billboard, direct mail or other general public communication \n     or political advertising and that: Advocates the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate, including a \n     communication that: Contains a phrase such as ``vote for'', \n     ``re-elect'', ``support'', ``cast your ballot for'', ``(name \n     of candidate) for Congress'', ``(name of candidate) in \n     1998'', ``vote against'', ``defeat'', ``reject''; or contains \n     campaign slogans or individual words that in context can have \n     no reasonable meaning other than to recommend the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate; or involves \n     aggregate disbursements of $5,000 or more; refers to a \n     clearly identified candidate; and is made within the last 60 \n     days before the date of a general election.\n       The section provides a fall back definition of express \n     advocacy should a portion of the above definition not be in \n     effect. The fall back definition would be in addition to any \n     portion of the above still in effect. The fall back \n     definition establishes that express advocacy would be a \n     communication that clearly identifies a candidate and: Taken \n     as a whole, with limited reference to external events, \n     expresses unmistakable support for or opposition to the \n     candidate; or is made for the clear purpose of advocating \n     the election or defeat of the candidate, as shown by a \n     statement or action by the person making the \n     communication, the targeting or placement of the \n     communication, and the use by the person making the \n     communication of polling, demographic or other similar \n     data relating to the candidate's campaign for election.\n\n     SECTION 203. LIMIT ON EXPENDITURES BY POLITICAL PARTY \n                   COMMITTEES.\n\n       The section amends section 315(d)(3) of the 1971 FECA (2 \n     U.S.C. 441a(d)(3)) to limit a party's coordinated \n     expenditures in a race involving a clean money candidate. In \n     the case of any Senate election in which 1 or more candidates \n     is a clean money candidate, the amount that any party may \n     spend in connection with that race or in coordination with \n     that candidate is limited to 10 percent of the amount of \n     clean money a clean money candidate is eligible to receive \n     for the general election.\n\n     SECTION 204. PARTY INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES AND COORDINATED \n                   EXPENDITURES.\n\n       The section, modeled after S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill, \n     strictly tightens the\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n     definition of party coordination with a candidate in numerous \n     ways. The section also requires a party which makes a \n     coordinated expenditure in connection with a general election \n     campaign for Federal office in excess of $5,000 to file a \n     certification that the party will not make any independent \n     expenditures in connection with that campaign. The section \n     further strictly tightens the definition of coordinated \n     expenditure by persons other than a party. And it establishes \n     that coordinated expenditures shall be considered to be \n     contributions made to a candidate (with an exception that \n     allows the limited party coordinated expenditures on behalf \n     of a clean money candidate as provided in Section 203).\n\n                     TITLE III--VOTER INFORMATION.\n\n           (pp 47-57)\n\n     SECTION 301. FREE BROADCAST TIME.\n\n       The section provides clean money candidates with 30 minutes \n     of free broadcast time during the primary election period and \n     60 minutes of free broadcast time during the general election \n     period. The broadcasts shall be between 30 seconds and 5 \n     minutes in length, aired during prime time for television or \n     drive time for radio. Any one station shall not be required \n     to provide a clean money candidate with more than 15 minutes \n     of free time during an election period.\n\n     SECTION 302. BROADCAST RATES AND PREEMPTION.\n\n       A clean money candidate in a contested election shall be \n     charged 50 percent of the lowest charge described in section \n     315(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.315(b)) \n     for purchased broadcast time during the 30 days preceding \n     the primary and 60 days preceding the general election.\n\n     SECTION 303. CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING.\n\n       The section requires that campaign advertisements contain \n     sufficient information clearly identifying the candidate on \n     whose behalf the advertisements are placed. The information \n     shall include an audio statement by the candidate where \n     applicable which states that the candidate approves the \n     communication, and a clearly identifiable photographic or \n     similar image of the candidate where applicable. Private \n     money candidates shall include the following statement: \n     ``This candidate has chosen not to participate in the Clean \n     Money, Clean Elections Act and is receiving campaign \n     contributions from private sources.''\n       The section also establishes new reporting requirements for \n     issue advertisements, including the amount of the \n     disbursement for an issue advertisement, the name and address \n     of the person making the disbursement, donors of $5,000 or \n     more to the person during the calendar year, and the purpose \n     of the advertisement. An issue advertisement is an \n     advertisement which is not an independent expenditure or a \n     contribution, that contains the name or likeness of a Senate \n     candidate during an election year, and recommends a position \n     on a political issue.\n\n     SECTION 304. LIMIT ON CONGRESSIONAL USE OF THE FRANKING \n                   PRIVILEGE.\n\n       The section prohibits franked mass mailings during an \n     election year by a Senate candidate who holds Congressional \n     office, except for a notice of public meeting which contains \n     only the candidate's name, and the date, time and place of \n     the public meeting.\n\n           TITLE IV--SOFT MONEY OF POLITICAL PARTY COMMITTEES\n\n           (pp 57-71)\n       This title prohibits political party soft money and is \n     taken from S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill.\n\n     SECTION 401. SOFT MONEY OF POLITICAL PARTY COMMITTEE.\n\n       The section prohibits national parties from soliciting or \n     receiving contributions or spending funds not subject to the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act. It prohibits state, district \n     or local committees of a political party from spending money \n     during an election year for activity that might affect the \n     outcome of a Federal election unless the money is subject to \n     the FECA. The section establishes certain activities excluded \n     from the above prohibition, which are legitimate or necessary \n     activities of the committees.\n       The section prohibits parties or their committees from \n     soliciting funds for, or making any donation to, a tax-exempt \n     organization. It also prohibits candidates and Federal \n     officeholders from receiving or spending funds not subject to \n     the FECA.\n\n     SECTION 402. STATE PARTY GRASSROOTS FUNDS.\n\n       The section allows establishment of state party grassroots \n     funds solely for the purpose of generic campaign activity, \n     voter registration, other activities specified in the FECA \n     and the development and maintenance of voter files. The fund \n     shall be separate and segregated\n\n     SECTION 403. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The section establishes new reporting requirements for \n     national parties and congressional campaign committees for \n     all receipts and disbursements.\n\n   TITLE V--RESTRUCTURING AND STRENGTHENING OF THE FEDERAL ELECTION \n                               COMMISSION\n\n           (pp 71-81)\n\n     SECTION 501. APPOINTMENT AND TERMS OF COMMISSIONERS.\n\n       The President shall appoint 6 members of the Commission \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate and 1 member from \n     among persons recommended by the Commission.\n\n     SECTION 502. AUDITS.\n\n       The section authorizes random audits and investigations by \n     the Commission to ensure voluntary compliance with the FECA. \n     The subjects of such audits and investigations shall be \n     selected on the basis of impartial criteria established by a \n     vote of at least 4 members of the Commission.\n\n     SECTION 503. AUTHORITY TO SEEK INJUNCTION.\n\n       The section authorizes and sets out standards for \n     initiation by the Commission of a civil action for a \n     temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.\n\n     SECTION 504. STANDARD FOR INVESTIGATION.\n\n       The section grants the Commission greater discretion in \n     opening an investigation.\n\n     SECTION 505. PETITION FOR CERTIORARI.\n\n       The section allows petition to the Supreme Court on \n     certiorari.\n\n     SECTION 506. EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.\n\n       The section allows the Commission to order expedited \n     proceedings based on clear and convincing evidence that a \n     violation of the FECA has occurred, is occurring, or is about \n     to occur, to avoid harm or prejudice to the interests of the \n     parties.\n\n     SECTION 507. FILING OF REPORTS USING COMPUTERS AND FACSIMILE \n                   MACHINES.\n\n       The section instructs the Commission to require the filing \n     of reports in electronic form in certain cases, and instructs \n     the Commission to allow the filing of reports by facsimile \n     machine.\n\n     SECTION 508.

Mr. President, I join my colleague today, Senator \nKerry, as well as Senators Glenn, Biden, and Leahy, in introducing the \nClean Money Clean Elections Act of 1997.\n  One of the most important ethical issues of this Congress is the way \nin\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nwhich money has come to dominate politics. That is why we are \nintroducing this legislation to address what has become a systemic \ncorruption, a corruption which results from the sharp disparity of \npower between those who are able to mobilize and invest large amounts \nof campaign cash on one hand, and ordinary citizens on the other. Our \nproposal would provide sweeping and simple reform. It would sever the \ndirect connection between big-money special interests and Senate \ncandidates.\n  American democracy needs elections, not auctions. But our current \ncampaign finance system locks most citizens out of participation. Most \ncitizens don't believe they can be players when it comes to the really \nimportant policy decisions that affect their lives. They don't believe \nthey have a real voice. They are not even sure that their vote counts \nfor much.\n  At the same time, our current system makes sure that big givers and \nheavy hitters always have a seat at the table. That is why so many \nbelieve, with reason, that we have a pseudo-democracy, not authentic \ndemocracy. They see the subversion of democracy, the loss of the \nprinciple of one-person, one-vote. They are losing faith in the idea \nthat Government is supposed to be on their side.\n  In this system, what's legal is a scandal.\n  To address this mix of money and politics which is corrupting our \npolitics, my colleagues and I are proposing an approach to reform \ncalled ``Clean Money, Clean Elections.'' I believe our proposal is \nambitious and innovative. I am sure that it is needed.\n  Citizens around the country are turning up the heat in a push for \nthis vision of real reform. Voters in Maine chose this approach to the \nfinance of election campaigns. And now legislators and the Governor in \nVermont have decided to pursue it. A number of States will be \nconsidering the Clean Money Clean Elections approach during the coming \nmonths. I strongly endorse these actions at the State level. And I hope \nthat citizens around the country will continue to keep comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform at the front of the Nation's political agenda.\n  This Congress needs pressure. It needs a jolt. What it needs is a \ncounterbalancing pressure to ensure that the voices who believe in \nreform are heard above the voices of those who march on Washington \nevery day--the monied interests who far too often determine what issues \nare on the table in American politics, and who far too often shape the \noutcomes within that agenda. The American people should turn up the \nheat. This is the only way reform will happen.\n  Reform can happen. When we passed lobby reform and a gift ban during \nthe last Congress, despite great resistance, it was because Members of \nCongress were forced to vote, with the people of America watching. Now, \nwe plan to take this proposal to the American people--State by State, \ntownhall by townhall, to build the support needed to enact true reform. \nThe people are watching. When the time comes to vote, Members of \nCongress will need to vote the right way.\n  We all know that campaigns currently cost far too much money. Our \nbill will set a voluntary spending limit on the campaigns of clean \nmoney candidates. The spending limit is based on a formula tied to each \nState's voting-age population. We have adopted the McCain-Feingold \nbill's formula, except that we subtract 20 percent from the upper \nlimit. We subtract 20 percent because that is approximately the amount \nmost candidates now spend to raise money. Under our bill they won't \nhave to spend that time and money to raise money. In Minnesota, the \nclean money amount, which also is the spending limit for a clean money \ncandidate, will be about $1.14 million for the general election. In a \ncontested primary, the amount will be about $764,000. That adds up to \na total clean money amount of $1.9 million in Minnesota for a clean \nmoney Senate candidate.\n\n  Less than $2 million is enough in Minnesota:\n  If we also ban soft money to the parties, which this bill does; and \nif we close loopholes on independent expenditures and so-called \n``issue'' ads which are really election ads, which this bill does.\n  Our provisions on these items are similar to those in S. 25, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, a bill which I am proud to have co-authored. I \ncontinue to support that bill.\n  But we really need to go further. The Clean Money Clean Elections Act \ndoes so. It takes special-interest money out of campaigns. It gives the \ncountry's electoral system back to the people.\n  Americans know that the current campaign finance system works for the \nmonied special interests, not for them. They're paying too much now for \nour elections. Too much in special favors, whether it's tax breaks for \nhuge companies, tobacco politics that threaten the health of children, \nunneeded spending, and misdirected national policy. These result in the \nsystemic corruption that is enshrined in our present system of \nfinancing campaigns. That's why we need to change it.\n  We need to take the special interest money out, and replace it with \nClean Money Campaigns. Clean Money Campaigns would:\n  Level the playing field for non-incumbents, including those who are \nnot major party candidates; allow candidates to focus on seeking office \nand serving the public once in office, rather than spending an \ninordinate amount of time raising money; and utilize free media time to \nallow candidates to get their message out.\n  Candidates who meet our bill's rigorous standard for showing serious \npublic support will receive full public financing in contested primary \nand general elections. They will receive the full amount of the \nspending limit for their State. In Minnesota, to qualify as a clean \nmoney candidate, a major-party candidate would have to gather about \n8,500 signatures, each accompanied by a $5 check to the Senate Election \nFund. That is a tough standard of seriousness, but it is realistic. A \ncandidate who is not seeking the nomination of, or who has not received \nthe nomination of, a major party can also receive clean money financing \nfor his or her campaign. That candidate must gather 150 percent of the \nqualifying contributions that a major party candidate needs to gather \nin the same State. Again, it requires that a candidate demonstrate \ngenuinely broad support, but it is an achievable threshold.\n  The American people can no longer afford what has been called ``The \nBest Congress Money Can Buy.'' That is why we have to take special-\ninterest money out of campaigns. The roughly $160 million of annual \ncost of Senate elections under our proposal can be easily offset with \nreductions in current corporate welfare or other unneeded expenditures.\n  Are Americans willing to fight for and put in the budget clean \nelections that really belong to them--that belong to the people? I \nbelieve they are. So do the many groups endorsing our bill: Public \nCampaign, Public Citizen, League of Women Voters, Citizen Action, \nUSPIRG, National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, United \nChurch of Christ, Office for Church and Society. Still other \norganizations support our approach, even if they do not endorse \nspecific pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Senate needs to consider comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform soon--before we leave this summer. This bill shows us \nthe direction to go. It is workable, and it is needed. I urge my \ncolleagues who have not yet read the bill to consider cosponsoring it. \nI am hopeful that this bill and a similar proposal to be introduced \nduring the coming weeks in the House of Representatives will contribute \nto real momentum for genuine reform during this Congress.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday with my colleagues, Senators Kerry, Glenn, Biden, and Leahy. And \nI am confident there will be other Senators in the future who support \nthis approach to reform.\n  There are other worthy and important efforts going on here, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill being one of them, to try to reduce the amount of \nmoney that is flowing in and affecting the politics of our country. I \npersonally think, and I think the majority of people in this country \nagree, that this is a core issue, a core problem. Many things which \ncould happen here don't happen because they get trumped by money, big \nmoney in politics.\n  The ethical issue of our time is the way money has come to dominate \npolitics. If you believe each person should\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\ncount as one, and no more than one, which is the standard of \nrepresentative democracy, that is a harsh verdict.\n  I do think we have corruption, but I don't like bashing colleagues. I \nam not talking about individual colleagues. The vast majority of \nSenators and Representatives with whom I serve--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--believe in public service and do their very best to \nserve people. Still, there is a systemic corruption. We have such a \nhuge imbalance between those people at the top who have economic \nresources and access to power and the vast majority of people who just \nfeel locked out.\n  Mr. President, I have a friend--Jim Hightower, who used to be \nAgriculture Commissioner in Texas. He has a wonderful way of putting \nthings. Jim Hightower says you don't have to be who's who to know \nwhat's what. The what's what is that a lot of people in the country \nthink there has been a hostile takeover of our electoral and Government \nprocesses by big money interests. Many people don't feel a part of this \nsystem any longer. When that is the case, there is not anything more \nimportant that can be done than to pass a reform bill.\n  The goals of the clean money/clean elections bill are simple: \ndramatically reduce the amount of money that is spent, get the \ninterested dollars and private money out, have a level playing field, \ntry to eliminate, or come as possible to eliminating special interest \naccess, have real elections as opposed to auctions, don't have Senators \nspending so much of their time raising money, instead they should be \ntrying to be good legislators. I think people want to turn this system, \nwhich they think is a rotten system, not upside down, it is upside down \nnow, but right side up.\n  What our bill does, with agreed-upon spending limits, so candidates \ndon't have to go out and raise all the private money, is we break the \nlink between private money and our votes and work as legislators. Under \nour bill, the money is no longer interested money. We dramatically \nreduce spending by setting voluntary limits, then campaign spending by \nclean money candidates comes from this Senate election fund. We tighten \nthe definition when it comes to independent expenditures. And we do the \nsame for issue advocacy ads, some of which are barely disguised \ncampaign ads. Our bill includes free broadcast time. If you really want \nto have a system where the vast majority of the people feel like they \ncan be a part of it, we are going to have to take this journey.\n  Mr. President, two final points. If we can pass McCain-Feingold, that \nmoves our country forward, that would be an important step. But this \npiece of legislation, which won't pass immediately, has a lot of energy \nbehind it, too. We introduce it as part of the debate, as part of the \nenergy behind reform. I have met with the people who were involved in \nthe Maine effort, and they passed a clean effort option. I met with \nlegislators and a lot of people in Vermont, and they are going to pass \nit. I met with people in the Midwest. There is a lot of energy in the \nMidwest and New England. It may be States which pass this kind of \nreform at first. You are going to see a lot of pressure on people here \nfrom the grassroots.\n  We need to have a galvanized public. We are going to have to have an \nexternal jolt to this Congress to pass a reform bill, but there is no \nmore important thing that we can do than to pass such a reform bill. \nThis clean money/clean elections bill would represent an enormous step \nforward for our country, toward real elections as opposed to auctions, \ntoward authentic democracy as opposed to pseudo democracy, toward a \nGovernment of, by and for the people, not of, by and for those who have \nthe wealth and economic resources.\n  I think people in this country yearn for a political process they can \nbelieve in. They yearn for reform, and I don't agree with one person \nwho says, ``Look, people don't seem to care that much.'' People care \ndeeply, they care desperately, they care about issues that affect \nthemselves and their families. They have hopes for themselves and their \nfamilies and their communities, but right now I think most people \nbelieve that they there is not a heck of a lot they can do on the \nissues that are most important to them, because our political process \nhas essentially been dominated by big money, not people's needs.\n  Mr. President, we have given people entirely too much justification \nfor that point of view. We have to make some big changes. Some of us \nare going to be fighting hard on the floor for reform. I think there \nwill be plenty of pressure building around the country. It will be a \ntough fight, but I cannot think of a more important fight as a Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr BIDEN. Mr. President, the single most significant thing we can do \nin Congress today is to reform the way we fund political campaigns in \nthis country. I have been saying it for 24 years now, and while some \nthings are better than they used to be--large amounts of cash are no \nlonger being passed under the table in brown paper bags--many things \nare worse--large checks are being passed over the table, or in the \nChamber of the House of Representatives, in the clear light of day. \nBut, regardless of what's better and what's worse, the fundamental \nproblem, in my view, remains.\n  That problem will not be fixed by tinkering at the edges, or making a \nsmall reform here and a small reform there--because the fundamental \nproblem is not a flaw in the system's construction. The fundamental \nproblem is the system itself--a system where the amount of private \nmoney is out of control and is not susceptible to be controlled in the \npublic interest. Until we get private money completely out of the \nsystem, we will not completely reform the system.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I have been pushing for public funding of \ncongressional campaigns for my entire career, and that is why I am \npleased today to join several of my colleagues in introducing the Clean \nMoney, Clean Elections Act.\n  When I first came to the United States Senate, 24 years ago, in \nspeeches on this floor and in testimony before the Rules Committee, I \noutlined three principles of a better system. All three are contained \nin this important proposal.\n  First and foremost, we must have a system of public funding. Let me \nexplain why that is so crucial. When they asked Willy Sutton why he \nrobbed banks, he said that was where the money was. Politicians do not \nrob banks, but they, like Willy Sutton, must go where the money is. You \nwill not get very far in this business by asking for contributions from \npeople who do not have money. So, inevitably, people running for office \nfind themselves on the doorsteps of the wealthy and the special \ninterests. Or, they are wealthy enough to fund their own campaigns.\n  The result is that other old saying--he who pays the piper calls the \ntune. Those who pay the bills ultimately, when you get right down to \nit, are the ones who decide who runs for office. And, they are the \nones, at least in the mind of the public, to whom elected officials are \nbeholden.\n  No matter what other reforms you enact, unless you get private money \nout of the system, that is the way it will continue. I submit that it \nwould be better to let the American people decide--on the merits--who \nruns for office. And, I submit that it would be far better for America \nto make sure that elected officials are beholden to no one but the \npeople who elected them.\n  Second, we need to level the playing field between incumbents and \nchallengers. I have, Mr. President, been both an incumbent and a \nchallenger. And, I can tell you that being an incumbent has its \ndisadvantages. But, the biggest advantage of incumbency is in the money \nchase. It is such an advantage that if I were looking out only for my \nown self-interest, I would not support this proposal. I do pretty well \nin raising money, and the thought that my opponent would have the same \namount of money as I do is not exactly an appealing notion.\n  But, there is something much bigger at stake here than my own \nelectoral future. What is at stake is nothing less than a healthy, \nvibrant democracy. What is at stake is whether election to office will \nbe based on the merits of the individuals, not on who is the best \nfundraiser.\n  Third, we need to limit the overall amount of money that can be spent \nin political campaigns. Back in 1976, all candidates for all \ncongressional races--Senate and House--spent $99 million in\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\nthe general election. In 1996, all candidates for Congress in the \ngeneral election spent over $626 million--more than six times as much. \nIn just the last 4 years, the total amount of money given to political \nparties has increased 73 percent--in just the last 4 years.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has ruled--in what is, in my view, a \nwrong decision, but one that we are bound by--that spending money is \nthe same thing as speech. Thus, Congress cannot limit spending in \npolitical campaigns, unless a candidate is offered some benefit in \nreturn for voluntarily agreeing to a spending limit.\n  Enter the ``Clean Money, Clean Elections Act.'' This significant \nproposal that we are introducing today would, as I said a moment ago, \nmeet the three principles I just outlined. It would limit spending in \ncampaigns--in a constitutional way--by providing public funding and \nfree media time to candidates who agreed to abide by those limits. And, \nit would be full public funding for both challengers and incumbents--so \nthat private money is eliminated from the system and so that both \nchallengers and incumbents are on the same level playing field.\n  I am not so naive, Mr. President, to believe this bill is going to \npass today--or even without a fight. I have been down this road too \nmany times before. Too many special interests have too many vested \ninterests in the status quo. But, if we are to reverse the tide of \ncynicism and mistrust that surrounds political campaigns--and even our \ninstitutions of government--then we must change the system so that the \nonly interests we are all concerned about are the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity today to \nsupport my colleagues, Senators Kerry and Wellstone, in cosponsoring \nthis much needed reform of our campaign finance system. I believe that \nsimple principles should be applied in our democracy. We should \nencourage the active participation of the greatest possible number of \ncitizens and restrain the undue influence of narrow and divisive \nfactions and special interests.\n  I believe that our democracy must be built on common rather than \nspecial interests and that our elections should depend upon common \nsense rather than dollars and cents. Only through an open and fair \nelection system can we guarantee that our democracy will be open and \nfair. Only then can the notion of consent of the governed have any true \nmeaning.\n  I believe that many of the statements made here today underscore the \nneed to reform our current system. I have been working with Senators \nKerry and Wellstone to provide a workable alternative that will go a \nlong way toward bringing long overdue improvements to our electoral \nprocess.\n  Let's face facts. Our current system of paying the bills for American \nelections is awash in money, largely unregulated and often unreported. \nThe improvements made a generation ago to provide partial public \nfinancing for presidential campaigns and contribution and spending \nlimits for all federal elections have been eroded and are now \noverwhelmed by Supreme Court decisions, overly partisan competition for \nmoney, increased costs of advertising and special interest \ncontributions. Nothing undermines the legitimacy and integrity of our \nelections more than the belief that special interests have special \nprivileges.\n  Many American voters believe that campaigns are too expensive, that \nspecial interests wield too much influence, while the average voter has \ntoo little, and that elected officials spend too much time raising \nmoney and not enough time solving the Nation's problems.\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal to provide voluntary campaign spending \nlimits is supported by a number of Senators and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor. However, even with the much needed improvements in that \nlegislation, I believe that the only way to eliminate any doubt about \nwho influences elections is to provide financing underwritten by the \nAmerican people.\n  The Clean Money, Clean Elections Act built upon the plan proposed in \nMaine would limit campaign spending, prohibit special interest \ncontributions to candidates, eliminate fund raising efforts, provide \nequal funding and a level playing field for all candidates, and end \nmany of the loopholes that have wrecked our current system.\n  Let's end this current abuse and establish a system that leaves no \ndoubt that only the clean money of the American people pays for \nAmerican elections.\n  Building on that Maine ballot initiative, nearly 20 States are now \nreviewing how they can improve their elections. Federal legislation is \nneeded to bring these reforms to Federal elections and we propose to \nbring those improvements into the congressional debate on campaign \nfinance reform.\n  This proposal will provide:\n\n       The most comprehensive reform of all the proposals \n     currently under consideration; the lowest spending limits: \n     the most free time and discounted media; the strictest limits \n     on special interest money and influence; the most competitive \n     election financing; an end to the money chase and dialing for \n     dollars.\n\n  As the Nation's attention turns to the campaign finance investigation \nin the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I want everyone to \nunderstand that highlighting these issues will be of little use if \naction is not taken. Certainly, the investigation should be conducted \nin a full and fair manner. But at the end of day, I believe that we owe \nit to ourselves as a people to end our current campaign finance system \nand bring true reform.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues who are long time advocates of \nserious campaign finance reform and look forward to working together to \nenact this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 919. A bill to establish the Independent Bipartisan Commission on \nCampaign Finance Reform to recommend reforms in the law relating to \nelections for Federal office; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n  THE INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the serious problem within our campaign finance system. I have \nmade similar remarks earlier this year, so I will not belabor the \nproblems again.\n  The American public is demanding that Congress reform our campaign \nfinance system, and many doubt whether we are ready or even able to \nmeet that demand. I am support S. 25, introduced by Senators McCain and \nFeingold. This bipartisan legislation is the best bill moving through \nthe Congress to reform our campaign system. However, there are signs \nthat Congress may not pass this legislation.\n  Therefore, if, and only if S. 25 is not passed, I think the 105th \nCongress must put in place a process for reforming the campaign finance \nsystem. The legislation I introduce today for myself and Mr. Brownback \nof Kansas would establish an independent, bipartisan commission to \nreform our campaign finance laws. Earlier this year I introduced \nsimilar legislation, also as a fall-back measure if S. 25 is not \npassed.\n  This measure, like the bill I introduced earlier this year, \nestablishes a commission similar to the Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission. The Commission would have a limited time to make \nrecommendations, Congress would be forced to vote up or down on their \nproposals, and would not have the power to amend the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that Congress does not have to turn \nover this matter to an independent commission. But, if we do not pass \nmeaningful campaign finance reform this year, I believe it is the next \nbest alternative. And, if we do create a campaign finance reform \ncommission, it must be a real commission, with real powers, and not \nanother advisory committee.\n  Congress has created many panels in the past to make recommendations \nabout reforming campaign finance laws. But, for reform to genuinely \ntake place, we must empower the Commission with the ability to create a \npackage of reforms that Congress cannot change. Like the successful \nBase Closure and Realignment Commission, Congress should have only the \npower to vote up or down on the recommendations.\n  Mr. President, we should not allow another Congress to come and go \nwithout passing meaningful campaign finance reform. Let this be the \nyear that Congress responds to cry from the grassroots and restore \nAmerica's faith in our election system.\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am proud today to be offering a \nbipartisan proposal for campaign finance reform with my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Herb Kohl.\n  Mr. President, those of us who have spent the balance of our \ncongressional careers working to build public trust in the political \nsystem know of the difficulties in offering constructive alternatives. \nAny legislation which fundamentally alters the way public officials \nseek election is bound to attract their attention and intense \nscrutiny--as it should.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kohl and I believe this proposal offers a \nhopeful avenue for progress. Recognizing that any reform effort must be \nbipartisan to succeed, the legislation we are offering establishes a \nfair and independent process to bring this issue to the floor of the \nCongress for consideration. Without prejudging any outcomes, this bill \nwould help to break the logjam which threatens to prevent even \nmeaningful consideration of alternatives for reform.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kohl and I do not claim to have all the \nanswers, but we believe that through this vehicle, we can take the next \nstep in accomplishing substantial progress on this important matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 920. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto issue an annual report card on the performance of the States in \nprotecting children placed for adoption in foster care, or with a \nguardian, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  THE ADOPTION REPORT CARD ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Adoption \nReport Card Act of 1997 to redress the poor quality of national data on \nadoption and foster care.\n  According to the American Public Welfare Association, the population \nof children in foster care is growing 33 times faster than the United \nStates child population in general. During the past 10 years, more \nchildren have entered the foster care system than have exited. Every \nyear, 15,000 children graduate from foster care by turning 18 with no \npermanent family. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 40 \npercent of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare.\n  In addition to the 50,000 children who today are legally free to be \nadopted, there are hundreds of thousands more who drift for days, \nmonths, or years within the state-run system--a system that too often \nlets down some of society's most vulnerable--our children.\n  I have already introduced legislation to promote kinship care as one \nsolution to this problem. However, more still needs to be done. Part of \nthe problem is we simply don't have any data on where children are in \nthe system. No one knows how long our children are languishing in the \nfoster care system, or how long it takes a State to find adoptive \nplacements for children. Finding comprehensive data for each State is a \nchallenge and, until recently, the Department of Health and Human \nServices [HHS] did not collect comprehensive national data on adoption \nfrom every State.\n  The legislation I offer in the Senate today will require HHS to issue \nan annual report card on the performance of each State in protecting \nchildren placed for adoption, in foster care or with a guardian.\n  My bill will require HHS to develop outcome measures, a rating system \nfor each State and make recommendations on how States can improve their \nefforts to move children from foster care to loving families.\n  It is high time we started holding those responsible for children in \nfoster care accountable for the treatment of these children. I believe \nan annual report card will give us the information we need to improve \nthe care and quality of life for these children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Adoption Report Card Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to immunize donations made in the form of charitable \ngift annuities and charitable remainder trusts from the anti-trust laws \nand State laws similar to the antitrust laws; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n             the charitable donation antitrust immunity act\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat is critical to our Nation's charities, the Charitable Donation \nAntitrust Immunity Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to make \nminor modifications to a bill that was passed by Congress in 1995 with \nunprecedented bipartisan support. The House passed the bill on a \nrollcall vote of 427 to 0, and the Senate immediately passed the \nmeasure by unanimous consent. I am hopeful that we can move this bill \nas quickly.\n  The Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995 was enacted \nin response to a lawsuit that threatened, and still threatens, the \nfinancial well being of thousands of charities. The 1995 act exempts \ncharities from the antitrust laws which use the same annuity rate for \nthe purpose of issuing charitable gift annuities. For more than 100 \nyears, the issuance of gift annuities by thousands of charities across \nthe country has played a major role in raising billions of dollars for \nour nation's charities. The 1995 act ensures that the billions of \ndollars donated to charities is spent serving their constituencies, not \non defending lawsuits.\n  The legislation I am introducing today amends the Charitable Gift \nAnnuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995 to address technical issues raised \nby the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court recently ruled that \ncharities are not protected by the act if lawyers or other for-profit \nentities administer or assist with the charities' gift annuities. This \nlegislation clarifies the 1995 act by replacing the current antitrust \nexemption for charities issuing gift annuities with antitrust immunity \nfor charitable gift annuities. Charities have spent more than $20 \nmillion defending themselves from a single lawsuit. This clarification \nis critical in order to protect our Nation's charities from spending \nmillions of dollars more on litigation instead of charitable purposes.\n  Mr. President, the antitrust laws are intended to protect investors, \nnot to frustrate gifts to charities. Faced with a continuing expensive \nlawsuit against Americans charities, and the threat of many more \nlawsuits to follow, Congress must make this technical change in the \n1995 law to fulfill its original intent. Without this legislation, \ncharitable organizations will lose a much needed and useful tool for \nraising funds precisely at a time when we must encourage this type of \ngift giving.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator Coverdell in \nintroducing the Charitable Donation Antitrust Immunity Act. The bill \nwould strengthen the Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act, \nwhich enjoyed broad bipartisan support when it passed the Congress in \n1995.\n  Every day across this country, charitable organizations help build \nbetter lives for millions of Americans. They are on the front lines in \nthe effort to provide food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and \neducational support to less fortunate individuals. Their efforts help \nprevent our social fabric from fraying.\n  Over the years, charities have used gift annuities as a means of \nmaking it easier for people to donate money. Generally, these \ntransactions work as follows: a person donates money or some other \nasset to a charity and receives a tax deduction. The charity then \ninvests the money and makes fixed, periodic payments to the donor. When \nthe donor dies, the remainder of the gift goes to the charity. These \narrangements help both donors and charities, and it was never the \nintent of Congress to unduly restrict their use.\n  Regrettably, the benevolent endeavors of charities have been \njeopardized by a lawsuit, Ozee and Richie versus The American Council \non Gift Annuities. The lawsuit alleges that the use of annuity rates \npublished by the Council constitutes price fixing, and thus a violation \nof the antitrust laws. The suit also alleges violations of securities \nand insurance laws. The plaintiffs ask that money donated to charities \nthrough charitable gift annuities be returned, along with additional \ndamages. I have heard from a broad spectrum of charitable organizations \nin Connecticut and across the country who say that this lawsuit is \nundermining their ability to raise funds and continue their work.\n  In order to save our Nation's charities millions of dollars in legal \nfees, and to preserve a critically important fundraising tool for \ncharities, I joined with Senator Hutchison and introduced the \nCharitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995. With the help of \nmany of my colleagues in both the House and Senate, we passed that \nmeasure quickly. The intent of the legislation was to exempt the use of \ncharitable gift annuities from antitrust laws. Regrettably, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not interpret the \nlegislation in this manner and the lawsuit continues.\n  Consequently, we now need to make a few technical changes to clarify \nthe intent of the law. Although these changes would put an end to the \nlitigation and ensure that charities can continue to do their good \nwork, they will not make it easier for charities to commit fraud. The \nlegislation would not change the antifraud provisions in Federal \nsecurities law or affect Federal tax laws relating to fraud. People \ncould still bring appropriate lawsuits against cheats or swindlers \nattempting to disguise themselves as charities, or charities acting \nfraudulently.\n  Mr. President, charitable organizations work hard every day to help \nfill some of the gaps in the American safety net. We must support their \nefforts. The Charitable Donation Antitrust Immunity Act will help. I \napplaud Senator Coverdell's work on this legislation, and I urge all of \nmy Senate colleagues to help move it forward expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 922. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury, acting \nthrough the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, to \nissue minimum safety and security standards for dealers of firearms; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      GUN SHOP SAFETY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nthe Gun Shop Safety Act of 1997, to require the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms to issue minimum safety and security standards for \nfederally licensed firearms dealers.\n  Mr. President, incredible as it may seem, there are no Federal \nminimum standards for security of premises and merchandise at gun \nshops. In fact, a gun dealer must meet only minimal qualifications to \nobtain a gun dealers' license. An applicant need only be 21 years of \nage, not be prohibited by law from possessing or transporting firearms, \nand maintain a business premises in compliance with any State law. Once \na dealer gets a license, the only Federal requirements are that dealers \nkeep accurate records of purchases and sales, and have the books \navailable for yearly inspection by the ATF. Basically, that is it. No \nsafety or security requirements, no safety inspections.\n  This is simply not good enough. Guns are being stolen from licensed \ngun dealers at an alarming rate. These guns pose an increasingly \nsignificant public safety problem. Clearly, by definition stolen guns \nare available to criminals. In fact, studies have found that between 10 \nand 32 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime are obtained \nas a direct result of theft, while an approximately equal number of \nguns used during a criminal act were stolen before being used in a \ncrime.\n  Mr. President, stolen guns from gun shops are a significant source of \nguns used in violent street crimes. For example, everywhere we see the \ngrowing problem of the so-called ``smash and grab'' burglaries from \nretail gun outlets, where thieves either drive through or otherwise \nsmash the windows of gun shops and steal large quantities of firearms \nin a matter of minutes.\n  During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, 19 gun stores were looted and \nrobbed of about 4,000 guns. One pawnshop lost 970 guns, while another \noutlet was robbed of 1,150 guns. An ATF report reveals that these guns \ncontinue to be recovered on the street.\n  Mr. President, guns are not stolen from licensed gun dealers only \nduring a riot. Recently, it has been reported that thieves stole 75 \nfirearms from a store in Washington State after killing the owner, and \nthen sold about 40 of the stolen guns on the streets of Seattle that \nnight.\n  In my own State of New Jersey, we also recently witnessed a sickening\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\nmurder committed with a gun stolen from a gun shop. This past April, \n24-year-old Jeremy Giordano and 24-year-old Georgio Gallara of Sussex \nCounty, NJ were shot down in cold blood by two young thugs. No robbery \nwas involved, no motive discovered, just murder for the sake of murder. \nAnd these killings were only possible because the murderers were able \nto steal two high-powered handguns from a local shop. They simply \nsmashed the store's front window and smashed the locked glass display \ncase where the guns were stored overnight. The theft was over in a few \nbrief minutes, the criminals long gone by the time the police arrived \nat the gun shop.\n  Mr. President, there must be a better way. It is time that our laws \nrecognize that guns are not ordinary merchandise--they are deadly \nweapons. It is just common sense that criminals should be denied easy \naccess to an arsenal of weapons.\n  Mr. President, this country is already awash in a sea of gun \nviolence. Every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is shot. Every \n14 minutes, someone dies from a gunshot wound. In 1994 alone, over \n15,000 people in our country were killed by handguns. Compare that to \ncountries like Canada, where 90 people were killed by handguns that \nyear, or Great Britain, which had 68 handgun fatalities.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimate that by the year 2003, gunfire will have surpassed auto \naccidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United \nStates. In fact, this is already the case in seven States.\n  Mr. President, given the severity of our Nation's gun violence \nproblem, we need to find new ways to reduce the number of guns on our \nstreets. Although we cannot totally end gun theft, there is much we can \nand should do. We can prevent predators from getting guns so freely and \nfrequently through theft.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill will require the ATF to use its \nexpertise to craft reasonable and needed regulations to ensure that gun \nshops better secure the weapons and ammunition they sell from theft.\n  I hope this proposal will receive strong, bipartisan support, even \nfrom those hostile to any gun-related legislation. This bill will help \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals. This is a goal I believe all \nof us share. And this legislation is the least we can do.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) crimes committed with firearms threaten the peace and \n     domestic tranquility of the United States and reduce the \n     security and general welfare of the Nation and its people;\n       (2) crimes committed with firearms impose a substantial \n     burden on interstate commerce and lead to a reduction in \n     productivity and profitability for business around the Nation \n     whose workers, suppliers, and customers are adversely \n     affected by gun violence;\n       (3) all stolen firearms are available to criminals by \n     definition;\n       (4) licensed gun dealers have reported nearly 30,000 \n     firearms stolen from their shops since 1994, when a Federal \n     law was enacted requiring the reporting of such thefts;\n       (5) between 10 and 32 percent of firearms used in the \n     commission of a crime are obtained directly through theft, \n     while an approximately equal number of firearms used in the \n     commission of a crime have been stolen at some point before \n     ultimately being used in the commission a crime; and\n       (6) all Americans have a right to be protected from crime \n     and violence from stolen firearms, regardless of their State \n     of residence.\n\n     SEC. 3. MINIMUM SAFETY AND SECURITY STANDARDS FOR GUN SHOPS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 923 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Safety and Security Standards for Gun Shops.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of the Gun Shop Safety Act of 1997, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, acting through the Director of the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, shall issue final regulations \n     that establish minimum firearm safety and security standards \n     that shall apply to dealers who are issued a license under \n     this section.\n       ``(2) Minimum standards.--The regulations issued under this \n     subsection shall include minimum safety and security \n     standards for--\n       ``(A) a place of business in which a dealer covered by the \n     regulations conducts business or stores firearms;\n       ``(B) windows, the front door, storage rooms, containers, \n     alarms, and other items of a place of business referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) that the Secretary of the Treasury, acting \n     through the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms, determines to be appropriate; and\n       ``(C) the storage and handling of the firearms contained in \n     a place of business referred to in subparagraph (A).''.\n       (b) Inspections.--Section 923(g)(1) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A)--\n       (A) in clause (i), by striking ``, and'' and inserting a \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in clause (ii), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iii) with respect the place of business of a licensed \n     dealer, the safety and security measures taken by the dealer \n     to ensure compliance with the regulations issued under \n     subsection (m).''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)--\n       (A) in the matter preceding clause (i), by inserting ``and \n     the place of business of a licensed dealer'' after ``licensed \n     dealer'';\n       (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (C) in clause (iii), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iv) not more than once during any 12-month period, for \n     ensuring compliance by a licensed dealer with the regulations \n     issued under subsection (m).''.\n       (c) Penalties.--Section 924(a)(1) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (E); \n     and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:\n       ``(D) being a licensed dealer, knowingly fails to comply \n     with any applicable regulation issued under section 923(m); \n     and''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 923. A bill to deny veterans benefits to persons convicted of \nFederal capital offenses; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                 veterans' benefits denial legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which \nI chair, we have been considering the situation of Mr. Timothy McVeigh, \nwho has certain entitlements as a veteran. Curiously, the committee has \nconcluded that a conviction for murder in the first degree does not \nsignificantly affect Mr. McVeigh's entitlements or benefits as a \nveteran.\n  Veterans who are convicted of certain criminal offenses forfeit their \nbenefits. Those offenses, however, are limited to convictions for \nmutiny and aiding the enemy; spying; certain national security crimes, \nsuch as treason, sabotage, disclosing classified or defense \ninformation, interfering with the Armed Forces during a time of war, \ncommunications of classified information by a Government employee to an \nagent of a foreign government; and certain nuclear material crimes, \nsuch as the unauthorized possession or transfer of nuclear material or \nreceipt and communication of restricted data.\n  Surprisingly, my staff on the Veterans' Affairs Committee has \nconcluded that Mr. Timothy McVeigh would be entitled to veterans \nbenefits, notwithstanding his conviction on 11 counts including the \nmurder of some 168 people in the Oklahoma City bombing of the Federal \nbuilding. He remains eligible for such benefits, including burial \nbenefits, since he was not convicted of any of the crimes I just \nlisted.\n  Because of that, I now introduce legislation which would deny veteran \nbenefits to any person who is convicted of a State or Federal capital \noffense. The specific provision would be:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who is \n     convicted of a Federal or State capital offense is ineligible \n     for benefits provided to veterans of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States pursuant to title 38, United States Code.\n\n  This bill would prevent Mr. McVeigh from having any veterans benefits \nin light of his conviction on 11 counts, including murder in the first \ndegree. I send this bill to the desk and ask that it be filed with the \nappropriate authority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 924. An original bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n1998 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nfor the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; from the Committee on \nArmed Services; placed on the calendar.\n\n\n      the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to report out from the \nCommittee on Armed Services an original bill, the national defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  The members of the Committee on Armed Services have put a great deal \nof work into this bill, which continues the long bipartisan tradition \nof the Senate in dealing with the vital issues of the Nation's \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

or\n       (H) private sector sources cannot maintain continuity of \n     workforce expertise as a result of high rates of employee \n     turnover.\n       (2) The systems or equipment identified under subsection \n     (a) that must be maintained and repaired in Government-owned \n     facilities, whether Government operated or contractor-\n     operated, as a result of the Secretary's determination that--\n       (A) the work involves facilities, technologies, or \n     equipment that are unique and sufficiently valuable that the \n     facilities, technologies, or equipment must be maintained in \n     the public sector in the national interest;\n       (B) the private sector sources having the capability to \n     perform the workloads have insufficient facilities, \n     technology, or equipment to perform the depot-level \n     maintenance and repair workloads--\n       (i) in the quantity necessary, or as rapidly as the \n     Secretary considers necessary, to enable the armed forces to \n     fulfill the national military strategy; or\n       (ii) without a significant disruption or delay in the \n     maintenance and repair of equipment; or\n       (C) the need for performance of workloads is too \n     infrequent, cyclical, or variable to sustain a reliable base \n     of private sector sources having the facilities, technology, \n     or equipment to perform the workloads.\n       (3) The systems or equipment identified under subsection \n     (a) that may be maintained and repaired in private sector \n     facilities.\n       (4) The approximate percentage of the total maintenance and \n     repair workload of the Department of Defense necessary for \n     the systems and equipment identified under subsection (a) \n     that would be performed at Department of Defense facilities, \n     and at private sector facilities, as a result of the \n     determinations made for purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and \n     (3).\n\n     SEC. 319. REVIEW OF USE OF TEMPORARY DUTY ASSIGNMENTS FOR \n                   SHIP REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In order to reduce the time that the crew of a naval \n     vessel is away from the homeport of the vessel, the Navy \n     seeks to perform ship repair and maintenance of the vessel at \n     the homeport of the vessel whenever it takes six months or \n     less to accomplish the work involved.\n       (2) At the same time, the Navy seeks to distribute ship \n     repair and maintenance work among the Navy shipyards (known \n     as to ``level load'') in order to more fully utilize \n     personnel resources.\n       (3) During periods when a Navy shipyard is not utilized to \n     its capacity, the Navy sometimes sends workers at the \n     shipyard, on a temporary duty basis, to perform ship repairs \n     and maintenance at a homeport not having a Navy shipyard.\n       (4) This practice is a more efficient use of civilian \n     employees who might otherwise not be fully employed on work \n     assigned to Navy shipyards.\n       (b) GAO Review and Report.--(1) The Comptroller General of \n     the United States shall review the Navy's practice of using \n     temporary duty assignments of personnel to perform ship \n     maintenance and repair work at homeports not having Navy \n     shipyards. The review shall include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the rationale, conditions, and factors \n     supporting the Navy's practice.\n       (B) A determination of whether the practice is cost-\n     effective.\n       (C) The factors affecting future requirements for, and the \n     adherence to, the practice, together with an assessment of \n     the factors.\n       (2) Not later than May 1, 1998, the Comptroller General \n     shall submit a report on the review to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 320.

and\n       (B) provides for an alternating rotation of such forces \n     between a state of high readiness and a state of low \n     readiness.\n       (3) The evaluation of the readiness posture described in \n     paragraph (2) shall be based upon assumptions permitting \n     comparison with the existing force structure as follows:\n       (A) That there are assembled from among the units of the \n     Armed Forces two equivalent forces each structured so as to \n     be capable of fighting and winning a major theater war.\n       (B) That each force referred to in subparagraph (A) \n     includes--\n       (i) four active Army divisions, including one mechanized \n     division, one armored division, one light infantry division, \n     and one division combining airborne units and air assault \n     units, and appropriate support and service support units for \n     such divisions;\n       (ii) six divisions (or division equivalents) of the Army \n     National Guard or the Army Reserve that are essentially \n     equivalent in structure, and appropriate support and service \n     support units for such divisions;\n       (iii) six aircraft carrier battle groups;\n       (iv) six active Air Force fighter wings (or fighter wing \n     equivalents);\n       (v) four Air Force reserve fighter wings (or fighter wing \n     equivalents); and\n       (vi) one active Marine Corps expeditionary force.\n       (C) That each force may be supplemented by critical units \n     or units in short supply, including heavy bomber units, \n     strategic lift units, and aerial reconnaissance units, that \n     are not subject to the readiness rotation otherwise assumed \n     for purposes of the evaluation or are subject to the rotation \n     on a modified basis.\n       (D) That units of the Armed Forces not assigned to a force \n     are available for operations other than those essential to \n     fight and win a major theater war, including peace \n     operations.\n       (E) That the state of readiness of each force alternates \n     between a state of high readiness and a state of low \n     readiness on a frequency determined by the Secretary (but not \n     more often than once every 6 months) and with only one force \n     at a given state of readiness at any one time.\n       (F) That, during the period of state of high readiness of a \n     force, any operations or activities (including leave and \n     education and training of personnel) that detract from the \n     near-term wartime readiness of the force are temporary and \n     their effects on such state of readiness minimized.\n       (G) That units are assigned overseas during the period of \n     state of high readiness of the force to which the units are \n     assigned primarily on a temporary duty basis.\n       (H) That, during the period of high readiness of a force, \n     the operational war plans for the force incorporate the \n     divisions (or division equivalents) of the Army Reserve or \n     Army National Guard assigned to the force in a manner such \n     that one such division (or division equivalent) is, on a \n     rotating basis for such divisions (or division equivalents) \n     during the period, maintained in a high state of readiness \n     and dedicated as the first reserve combat division to be \n     transferred overseas in the event of a major theater war.\n       (c) Report Elements.--The report under this section shall \n     include the following elements for the readiness posture \n     described in subsection (b)(2):\n       (1) An estimate of the range of cost savings achievable \n     over the long term as a result of implementing the readiness \n     posture, including--\n       (A) the savings achievable from reduced training levels and \n     readiness levels during periods in which a force referred to \n     in subsection (b)(3)(A) is in a state of low readiness;

A bill to provide authority for women' business centers to \nenter into contracts with Federal departments and agencies to provide \nspecific assistance to women and other underserved small business \nconcerns; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n            THE WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support \nfor Women's Small Business Programs Act of 1997. As a member of the \nSenate's Small Business Committee, I have focused on helping small \nbusinesses succeed in an increasingly competitive environment. Women-\nowned small businesses have made impressive strides in recent years. To \nme, this is no surprise.\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\n  Women-owned businesses are an increasingly important part of our \nNation's economy. In 1996, they accounted for an estimated $2.3 \ntrillion in sales and employed one out of every four workers totaling \n18.5 million employees. According to the National Foundation of Women \nBusiness Owners, the growth of women-owned business continues to \noutpace overall business growth nearly 2 to 1. In my home State of \nGeorgia, there are 143,045 women-owned businesses both full time and \npart time.\n  I believe it is important the Federal Government continue to support \nthe development of these small businesses and assist them in overcoming \nthe unique challenges facing them. Currently, the Office of Women \nBusiness Ownership administers women's demonstration sites where women-\nowned small businesses can find critical support. These demonstration \nwomen business development centers at these sites are required to be \ncompletely self-sufficient a short period of time. I hope we succeed in \nthe coming Small Business Administration reauthorization legislation to \nmake these centers permanent.\n  My legislation is simple. It allows these women business development \ncenters to enter into contracts with other Federal departments and \nagencies to provide specific assistance to small business concerns. It \nexpands their pool of available resources they can use to nurture \nwomen-owned small business.\n  I have been working with the Senate Small Business Committee on this \nmatter, and it is my understanding this proposal will become part of \nthis year s SBA Reauthorization bill. I look forward to working with \nthe committee to ensure the Federal Government provides women's \nbusiness centers this critical support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 926. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe child and dependent care credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE WORKING FAMILY CHILD CARE TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Working \nFamily Child Care Tax Relief Act of 1977. This legislation is targeted \nto those families most in need of a tax break--working families with \nchild or dependent adult care expenses. The need for child care \ncontinues to grow, 60 percent of women in the workforce have children \nunder 6 years of age. Moreover, hard working families throughout Iowa \nand across America are struggling to meet the escalating costs of child \ncare. A family with a preschool-age child spent an average of $15 more \nper week on child care in 1993 than in 1986. Currently, average child \ncare costs for a working family in Iowa run about $3,000 to $6,000 per \nyear.\n\n  Today, there is a child care tax credit available for many working \nfamilies--but that credit hasn't been increased since 1982--and it \nwasn't even adequate then. Inflation has reduced the value of the \ncredit by about 60 percent since it was last adjusted in 1982. Under \ncurrent law, families with $10,000 in adjusted gross income are \neligible for a 30-percent credit on the first $2,400 in child care \nexpenses for one child or $4,800 for two children. The credit phases \ndown to 20 percent at $28,000 and all incomes above that level. Because \nthe child care tax credit is not refundable, few families actually \nqualify for the full 30 percent credit under current law. Families with \nan income of less than $10,000 do not have a tax liability against \nwhich they can apply the credit.\n  This legislation would expand the child care tax credit and make it \navailable for more working families. The amount of child care expenses \neligible for the credit would be increased to $4,000 for one child or \nother dependent and $8,000 for two or more dependents. For example, my \nproposal would provide a 30-percent refundable credit for working \ncouples with an adjusted gross income of up to $50,000 on the first \n$8,000 in child care expenses for two or more children or other \ndependents. For families earning between $50,000 and $80,000, the \ncredit gradually phases down to current level. Families earning more \nthan $80,000 would be eligible for the same level of benefits they \nreceive under current law.\n  Although we must continue our efforts to reach a balanced budget, we \nmust also realize that American families with child or dependent care \nexpenses deserve a tax break. But I am not talking about doling out \nhuge new tax breaks for those on top who don't need it. This \nlegislation is targeted directly to families in the middle--they are \nnot on welfare and they are not rich. They work hard, they care about \ntheir families and their jobs, and they deserve a break.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Sea Grant Program.\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\n       THE OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH REVITALIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senator Hollings, the ranking member on the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and by Senators \nGregg, Kerry, Reed, Glenn, and Breaux.\n  Since its establishment in 1966, the National Sea Grant College \nProgram has provided an invaluable service to the citizens of our \nNation, and particularly to those who depend on our Nation's coastal \nand marine resources. Sea Grant operates programs in concert with 29 \nacademic institutions covering the entire marine coastline of the \nUnited States, the Great Lakes region, and Puerto Rico. It serves as a \nkind of cooperative research and extension program for States and \nlocalities with a direct interest in ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \nresources. Sea Grant is unique in the breadth of its programs, bringing \ntogether the natural and social sciences as well as educational \ninstitutions, the private sector, and State and local governments. By \nfacilitating these interactions across institutional boundaries, Sea \nGrant makes important contributions to the development of management \nprograms that effectively address both resource conservation and the \nneeds of communities who use these resources.\n  In my home State of Maine, the decline in groundfish populations has \nhad a devastating impact on the fishing community. The joint Maine/New \nHampshire Sea Grant Program has supported research looking at the \neconomic and social impacts of this decline, as well as biological \ninvestigations into the ecology of the fisheries. With the results of \nthese studies, Maine has been able to mitigate some of the losses these \ncitizens have suffered. Management programs have been adapted to better \naccount for the needs of local residents and the vagaries of an ever-\nchanging ocean. In all of their programs, Maine Sea Grant has \nconsistently reinvested in local communities, providing knowledge and \ntools for working with the sea.\n  I know from my colleagues that the work I have witnessed in Maine is \nrepresentative of the quality work Sea Grant programs are doing across \nthe country. The wealth of benefits Sea Grant provides comes from a \nsmall Federal investment. By requiring matching grants, State Sea Grant \nPrograms use their partnerships with industry and academia to generate \na high return on every Federal dollar expended. This investment, in \nturn, helps to stimulate industry productivity and increase the \nefficiency of coastal management programs. In these cost-conscious \ntimes, Sea Grant is a model of being able to do more with less.\n  This legislation will allow Sea Grant to continue its work by \nreauthorizing the program for 3 years. It caps the national \nadministrative costs of the program at 5 percent of the total budget, \nand it repeals an international program and a postdoctoral fellowship \nprogram which have never been funded. The bill also responds to a \nNational Research Council Report by clarifying the responsibilities of \nthe Sea Grant director and streamlining the process for reviewing State \nprogram proposals.\n  This bill is supported by the Sea Grant Association, whose membership \nincludes many of the land grant universities and other institutions \nwith an interest in the program, and it was drafted in close \nconsultation with the Clinton administration. The legislation is \ndeserving of broad bipartisan support in the Senate, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues for its quick passage. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 927\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this important bill to reauthorize the National Sea Grant \nCollege Program. Last year marked the 30th anniversary of the Sea Grant \nProgram, so it is especially fitting that we propose\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nlegislation today that will revitalize the program and continue its \neffective operation into the next century.\n  At its core, Sea Grant is a program that brings competitive, high-\nquality science to bear on problems affecting our Nation's oceans and \ncoasts. Sea Grant's top priority is creating new economic opportunities \nby forging alliances among academia, government, and industry to \ntransfer information and technology into the hands of people who can \ntruly use it. For example, Sea Grant led the development of hybrid \nstriped bass aquaculture, which has grown from a university \ndemonstration project to a $6 million fish farming industry in just 6 \nyears. In addition, Sea Grant has an extraordinary record of success in \nbalancing development with sound marine conservation, working with \ncitizen-volunteers to clean beaches and monitor environmental quality, \nand promoting the effective management of fisheries and other marine \nresources for the benefit of future generations.\n  Sea Grant is a national leader in the field of marine biotechnology, \nwhich has shown enormous promise in truly revolutionizing our use of \nmarine resources. Marine biotechnology research funded by Sea Grant has \nalready succeeded in discovering new pharmaceuticals from the sea, \ndeveloping new, environmentally-friendly products with a wide range of \napplications, improving fisheries management and stock assessments \nthrough advances at the molecular level, and enhancing environmental \nremediation through the development of compounds that combat oil spills \nand other toxic substances in the marine environment. In South \nCarolina, a study on how the Eastern oyster builds its shell laid the \ngroundwork for the development of alternatives to non-biodegradable \nwater treatment compounds and detergent additives. Based on this \nresearch, the Donlor Corporation was formed to synthesize and market \nthese new materials. The company's 50,000 square foot plant will soon \nbegin operations.\n  A results-oriented point of exchange, Sea Grant brings Federal and \nState managers together providing an opportunity for local and regional \nneeds to receive national attention. Conversely, national initiatives \nare placed on local and regional agendas. This legislation will bolster \nsuch exchanges by giving members of the Sea Grant network throughout \nthe country a larger voice in planning national initiatives.\n  Moreover, Sea Grant is training the next century's leaders in marine \npolicy. Sea Grant graduate student fellowships give marine policy \ntraining to tomorrow's scientists and managers. Efforts like South \nCarolina's Sea Partners, a joint program sponsored by the South \nCarolina Sea Grant Consortium and the U.S. Coast Guard, reach out to \nkindergarten through high school students regarding the problem of \nmarine pollution. Through such programs, young people become interested \nin ocean and coastal issues and develop life-long respect for \nconserving the marine environment.\n  Mr. President, more than a quarter-century ago, the Stratton \nCommission outlined a seminal vision for the benefits this Nation could \nderive from the oceans and coasts. The Sea Grant Program has played a \nvital part in realizing this vision through the application of sound \nscientific research to problems affecting our publicly-owned marine \nresources. The legislation we are introducing today will strengthen the \nSea Grant Program, improve the procedures by which it operates, clarify \nthe respective roles of the Federal Government and the universities \nthat participate in the program, and reduce administrative costs. I \nurge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nprogram and this excellent bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 928. A bill to provide for a regional education and workforce \ntraining system in the metropolitan Washington area, to improve the \nschool facilities of the District of Columbia, and to fund such \nactivities in part by an income tax on nonresident workers in the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be offset by tax credits; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n  the metropolitan washington education and workforce training act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \naddress a problem that has enormous significance for the future of this \nNation and the prosperity of our citizens. This legislation will create \na regional Education and Workforce Training Partnership for the \nWashington Metropolitan Area. The partnership created in the Washington \nMetropolitan region would serve as a national model and would address \nthe infrastructure crisis that exists in the District of Columbia \nPublic Schools. Let me take a moment to explain the importance of this \nlegislation as a national model.\n  We face a national economic crisis if we fail to prepare our \nworkforce for the high-paying technology jobs of the future. As a \nnation, we are currently enjoying an extended period of economic \nstrength, and that is terrific. But we mustn't be lulled into a false \nsense of complacency. We have all read and digested the theory of how \nthe foundation of our economy is shifting from a manufacturing base to \nwhat is now called the global knowledge economy. In the global \nknowledge economy, the ability to use critical thinking skills with \nadvanced technology and information will be at a premium. Technology \nproficiency will be required to get and keep a good job. Now, I ask \nyou, are we really prepared as a nation to be a leader in the global \nknowledge economy? Will our workers be surpassed by the workforces of \nour competitors overseas?\n  At present there are 190,000 unfilled high-skilled information \ntechnology jobs at large and mid-sized U.S. companies. These vacancies \nare almost equally divided between information technology (IT) and non-\nIT companies that rely heavily on advanced technology skills to get the \njob done. This shows us, that as we approach the 21st century \ntechnology skills are a must.\n  In the Washington Metropolitan Area alone there are at least 50,000 \njobs--with an average annual salary of $40,000--that cannot be filled \nby the local labor market. Local area students are not being prepared \nto fill these jobs. Companies have complained to me in meeting after \nmeeting that they are forced to recruit from other States or from other \ncountries to try and find people for these positions--and that tactic \nis entirely too cost-prohibitive.\n  The Metropolitan Washington Education and Workforce Training \nImprovement Act of 1997 authorizes the establishment of a regional \neducation and work force training partnership. This partnership is to \nbe composed of 13 members representing business and education, together \nwith a government official from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and \nVirginia. The partnership will chart a course for reforms and \ninvestments in education and work force training for the D.C. \nmetropolitan area, making recommendations to the Secretaries of \nEducation and Labor for grants to fund specific activities so that the \nskills of the regional work force will meet the needs of the regions \nemployers.\n  By filling the 50,000 IT jobs in the Washington metropolitan area an \nadditional $3.5 billion annually would be injected into the region's \neconomy. And, the partnership created by this legislation with its \nunique focus on business-education collaboration, would serve as a \nmodel for other regions in the Nation that are facing the same pending \ncrisis in labor market shortage and economic development.\n  In addition, this legislation will fulfill another long awaited \npromise that we as national leaders living and working in Washington \nmust see through. I believe we have an obligation to make the Nation's \nCapital a model of what education must be as we enter the next century. \nThe D.C. schools have made administrative progress recently, but the \ninfrastructure problems are still appalling--requiring, according to a \n1996 GSA report, an additional $2 billion for reconstruction and repair \nof dilapidated buildings. We must not let the students of the District \nof Columbia be sentenced to learning in buildings that would be found \nin a war zone. We owe more to the students of our Nation's Capital.\n  I want to be clear that this legislation would provide initial \nFederal funding to help finance the bonding required to reconstruct the \nD.C. school infrastructure. No funds would be used towards the present \nschool administration as they have adequate receipts. The legislation \nwould also provide funding for the D.C. school reform legislation \npassed by the Congress last session.\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\n  I want to see this Metropolitan Washington Education and Workforce \nTraining Act enacted to help correct our regional labor market shortage \nand to serve as a model for the Nation. Through this legislation we can \nhelp fill the high-paying jobs we have available in this region, known \nas the Golden Crescent of Maryland, Virginia, and the District, and in \nso doing we will make our capital's education system one that is \neffective and one we can be proud of. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin this important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Abraham to \nintroduce a resolution that will allow the National Safe Kids Campaign \nto use a small portion of the Capitol Hill grounds to provide a very \nimportant community service, a Car Seat Check-Up event. This \ninitiative, called Safe Kids Buckle-Up, is a joint project of the \nNational Safe Kids Campaign and the General Motors Corporation. Its \npurpose is to educate families about the importance of buckling up on \nevery ride. Child passenger safety has received significant attention \nin the past year, and this program will provide parents and care givers \nwith the essential information they need to ensure that their children \nare safely restrained in an automobile.\n  Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury-\nrelated death to children ages 14 and under, yet 40 percent of kids are \nstill riding unrestrained! More disturbing is the fact that, of the \nchildren who are buckled up, eight out of ten are restrained \nincorrectly. Each year more than 1400 children die in automobile \naccidents, and an additional 280,000 are injured. Tragically, most of \nthese injuries could have been prevented. Child safety seats are proven \nlife savers, reducing the risk of death by 69 percent for infants and \n47 percent for toddlers.\n  It will take a nationwide effort to combat this problem. Safe Kids \nBuckle-Up will be part of such effort. It is a national grassroots \neffort that will disseminate key safety messages through the more than \n200 Safe Kids Coalitions, health and education outlets--such as \nhospitals and community health centers--and GM dealerships in all 50 \nstates. Additionally, educational workshops and Car Seat Check Up \nevents will be available at participating GM dealerships.\n  On August 28, 1997, this program will be launched here at the \nCapitol, highlighted by a Car Seat Check Up for Federal employees, \nCongressional members and staff, and others from the metropolitan area. \nThis event will kick off Labor Day weekend--one of the biggest travel \nweekends of the year. I am honored to be supporting this event and the \noverall program with my friend and colleague Senator Abraham. We urge \nour colleagues to support this Congressional Resolution allowing this \nevent to take place. Protecting our children is a critical national \npriority that deserves national attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5876-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5876-S5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 100--RELATIVE TO THE EDUCATION OF AMERICAN INDIANS \n                           AND ALASKA NATIVES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nDorgan, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas, there exists a unique legal and political \n     relationship between the United States and tribal governments \n     and a unique Federal responsibility to American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives; and\n       Whereas, under law and practice, the United States has \n     undertaken a trust responsibility to protect and preserve \n     Indian tribes, Indians, and tribal assets and resources; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's commitment to Indian \n     education has been recognized, reinforced and carried out \n     through most treaties with Indian tribes, Congressional \n     legislation, numerous court decisions and presidential \n     executive orders; and\n       Whereas, this Federal responsibility includes working with \n     tribal governments and their members to improve the education \n     of tribal members; and\n       Whereas, the 1990 Census shows the poverty rate for \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives was nearly twice the \n     national average--31 percent of Indians live below the \n     poverty level, compared to 13 percent of the total \n     population. Nearly 38 percent of Indian children above the \n     age of 5 were living below the poverty level in 1990, \n     compared with 11 percent of non-minority children; and\n       Whereas, the development of tribal economies is dependent \n     on physical infrastructure, capital investment, and highly \n     developed human capital and an educated labor force; and\n       Whereas, excellence in educational facilities and services \n     is a key to building the skills necessary for Indian people \n     to develop vibrant tribal economies; and\n       Whereas, ever-increasing regional, national, and \n     international economic competition demands that Indians have \n     every competitive advantage accruing from achieving \n     excellence in education; and\n       Whereas, there are approximately 600,000 American Indian \n     and Alaska Native children attending schools in this country. \n     An estimated 87% of these children attend public schools \n     located on or near reservations and in urban areas; another \n     10% attend schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     (BIA) and an estimated 3 percent attend private schools; and\n       Whereas, these schools have experienced an increase in \n     student population of 3-4 percent in the past five years, \n     however, annual funding for the education of Indian children \n     has not increased proportionately; and\n       Whereas, U.S. Census data shows that the Indian and Alaska \n     Native population has increased significantly in the past \n     three decades. Primary growth concentrations are at ages 5 \n     through 19; and\n       Whereas, the 1994 National Assessment of Education Progress \n     (NAEP) showed over 50 per cent of American Indian fourth \n     graders scored below the basic level in reading proficiency, \n     compared with 42 percent of all students; and\n       Whereas, American Indian students have the highest dropout \n     rate of any racial ethnic group (36 percent) and the lowest \n     high school completion and college attendance rates of any \n     minority group. As of 1990, only 66 percent of American \n     Indians aged 25 years or older were high school graduates, \n     compared to 78 percent of the general population; and\n       Whereas, the demonstrated need for improvements to Indian \n     schools and colleges is acute as reflected in the great \n     disparity between average annual college funding per student \n     of $2,900 for Indian students, and $6,200 for non-Indians in \n     America, and the Federal Government should assist in bringing \n     the Indian schools and colleges up to parity with the rest of \n     America; and\n       Whereas, tribal scholarship programs nationally are only \n     able to serve an estimated 40 percent of the eligible college \n     student population and funding for graduate scholarships has \n     been cut in half in the past two years; and\n       Whereas, there is a major backlog of $680 million in \n     funding need for facilities construction, maintenance and \n     repair for the 185 BIA-funded schools as well as for public \n     schools located on and near Indian reservations; and\n       Whereas, there exists an alarming decline in the use of \n     Native languages indigenous to the United States. A 1969 \n     Senate Committee report stated that in 1969 there were 300 \n     separate languages still being spoken. In 1996, the number \n     had dropped to 206 still being spoken. These languages are \n     spoken nowhere else in the world; and\n       Whereas, despite these alarming statistics, funding for the \n     education of Indian and Alaska Native students has been \n     reduced substantially in the past three years. The U.S. \n     Congress in FY 1996 eliminated discretionary education \n     programs in the Office of Indian Education budget which had \n     funded adult education, research and demonstration programs, \n     the Indian Fellowship Program and teacher training and \n     professional development projects. At the same time, funding \n     for reservation-based education programs in the BIA budget \n     was reduced by more than $100 million in the FY 1996 budget. \n     Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the United States Senate:\n       (1) that the Senate recognizes and supports the federal \n     government's legal and moral commitment to the education of \n     American Indian and Alaska Native children, which is a part \n     of treaties, Executive Orders, court decisions and public \n     laws which have been enacted by the House and Senate of the \n     United States government.\n       (2) that funding for all bills, including reauthorizing \n     legislation in the 105th Congress with specific programs for \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives be funded at levels \n     sufficient to meet the ever-increasing educational and \n     economic demands facing Indian people on reservations, urban \n     communities and Alaska Native villages.\n       (3) that the Senate recognizes the adult literacy needs of \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives through the inclusion of \n     tribal provisions in the Administration's proposal to \n     reauthorize the Adult Education Act.\n       (4) that the Administration's bill for reauthorization of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965, P.L. 102-325, preserve the \n     original purpose and intent of the Tribally-Controlled \n     Community Colleges Act and promote access to higher education \n     opportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n       (5) that during the 105th Congress' reauthorization of \n     agricultural research programs, the needs of Tribal Colleges \n     as designated land-grant institutions must be given close \n     attention, through amendments to the Educational Equity in \n     Land-grant Status Act of 1994.\n       (6) that early childhood programs such as Head Start (P.L. \n     103-252) and Healthy Start contain resources needed to meet a \n     growing number of American Indian and Alaska Native children \n     whose rate of growth exceeds the national average.\n       (7) that the Senate recognizes the need for development and \n     implementation of a government-wide policy on Indian \n     education which addresses the needs of American Indian and \n     Alaska Native people.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nrecognizes the large disparity between funding for Indian tribal \ncolleges and mainstream colleges. Unfortunately, tribal colleges and \ntechnical vocational schools are barely able to keep up with growing \nenrollments. While many Indian colleges, like Crownpoint Institute of \nTechnology, perform valiantly and have solid records of job placement, \nthey are struggling to educate Indian students with roughly half the \nresources available to other colleges around the country. Indian \ncolleges receive on average of $2,972 per year per pupil, compared with \n$6,200 per year for mainstream community colleges.\n  My statement analyzes this situation further and concludes that the \n105th Congress should pay more attention to Indian education as we \nreauthorize important education legislation like the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational Education and Applied Technology Act, the Higher Education \nAct, and the Tribally-Controlled Community Colleges Act. Hopefully, \nSenators will review this resolution and come to the conclusion that we \nare not doing right by Indian colleges and Indian junior colleges, and \nwe could do a much a better job of educating Indians in America.\n  Mr. President, Indian education remains far behind standard education \nin America. There are many reasons for this sad state of affairs. The \nproblem is particularly acute among Indian colleges, where the average \nannual expenditure per student is $2,972 per year compared to $6,200 \nper year for mainstream community colleges.\n  It may surprise my colleagues, who may assume that the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs is primarily in charge of Indian education. The fact is \nthat 87 percent of Indian students in America in grades K-12, are in \npublic schools. Only 10 percent of all school age American Indians are \nin schools funded by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  While younger Indians are among America's fastest growing population, \nfunding for their schooling gets further behind every year. While most \nelementary school Indian students are clearly in public schools, their \neducational attainments remain far behind most non-Indian students. In \nthe federally funded Indian colleges we are seeing much larger student \nbodies; they are fed by both the public and Federal school systems.\n  Federal funding for Indian schools simply has not kept pace with the \npopulation growth among Indians, and we are seeing this problem is \nparticularly acute among Indian tribal colleges.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Inouye, vice chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and Senator Campbell, the committee's \nchairman, for joining me today to alert the Senate to this large \ndisparity in education for American Indians.\n  Most Americans and many of my Senate colleagues know, that, despite \nrecent income and job increases due to Indian gaming activities, \nAmerican Indians remain at the bottom by most measures of social and \neconomic well-being. Thirty-one percent live below the poverty line; \nalmost four times as many Indian children over the age of 5 live in \npoverty compared to nonminority children; life expectancy is the lowest \namong all ethnic groups; and housing conditions remain substandard for \nthe most part.\n  In terms of educational attainment, half of all American Indians in \nthe fourth grade--in both BIA and public schools--read below the \nexpected proficiency level, compared to 42 percent of all students who \nare below this level. American Indian students have the highest dropout \nlevel of any racial ethnic group at 36 percent. They also have the \nlowest high school completion rate and the lowest rate of college \nattendance. Only 66 percent of all American Indians are high school \ngraduates compared to 78 percent in the general population.\n  Mr. President, our resolution is really quite simple. We are asking \nthe U.S. Senate to take note of this large disparity in educating \nAmerican Indians. We ask that the Senate reaffirm the Federal \nGovernment responsibility for the education of American Indian and \nAlaska Native children. This obligation is spelled out in treaties, \ncourt decisions, Presidential Executive orders, and public laws. Our \nresolution delineates several key pieces of legislation that will be \npending before the Senate in this Congress. Included in this list are \nthe Higher Education Act of 1965, the Tribally-Controlled Community \nColleges Act, the Educational Equity in Land-grant Status Act of 1994, \nand Head Start and Healthy Start.\n  In addition, when the Senate considers reauthorization of such \nnational education acts as the Adult Education Act, the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational Education and Applied Technology Act, and the Individuals \nWith Disabilities Act, we simply ask that special attention be paid to \nthe great needs of American Indian students.\n  We also need to consider the establishment of a governmentwide policy \non Indian education that will better coordinate and address their \neducational needs, so that more of our citizens will be better prepared \nfor life in the 21st century. It is our intention to work closely with \nthe appropriate Senate committees to raise the level of educational \nattainment of American Indians for greater participation in our \nexpanding economy. We hope to bring the funding disparity to a close \nwithin a few years. We can hardly expect Indian children to be well \neducated on less than half the resources we spend on the average \nAmerican student.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to become aware of the \neducational needs of American Indians and to help us find ways to close \nthe gap.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe Sense of the Senate Resolution on Indian Education submitted by \nSenator Domenici today. I am an original cosponsor of this resolution \nbecause of my strong commitment to prioritizing education for every \nAmerican, and to bring attention to the ongoing inadequacies of \neducation facilities and consistently feeble investment in student \npotential throughout Indian country.\n  I have witnessed first-hand the devastating effects of poverty and \nunemployment that too often result from stunted academic growth. There \nare nine federally recognized tribes in South Dakota, whose members \ncollectively make up one of the largest Native American populations in \nany state. At the same time, South Dakota has three of the ten poorest \ncounties in the nation, all of which are within reservation boundaries. \nUnemployment on these extremely rural reservations averages above 50%. \nYet economic depression on rural Indian reservations is not unique to \nmy state.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this Resolution \nbecause Native Americans across the nation have been, and continue to \nbe, disproportionately affected by both poverty and low educational \nachievement. In 1990, over 36% of Indian children ages 5-17 were living \nbelow the poverty\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\nlevel. The high school completion rate for Native Americans aged 20 to \n24 was 12.5% below the national average. Indian students, on average, \nhave scored far lower on the National Assessment for Education Progress \nindicators than all other students. In 1994, the combined average score \nfor Indian students on the Scholastic Achievement Test was 65 points \nlower than the average for all students. These problems are compounded \nby the grave school facilities and construction backlog facing Indian \nCountry. Currently, $680 million is needed for facilities construction, \nmaintenance, and repair for the 185 BIA-funded schools and for public \nschools located on and near Indian reservations. These statistics \nreflect the continued neglect of America's under-served Indian \npopulation and are unacceptable.\n  Congress must continue to promote the self-determination and self-\nsufficiency of Indian communities, in keeping with our special trust \nresponsibility to sovereign Indian nations. Education at every level is \nabsolutely vital to this effort. Education is the cornerstone of the \nsuccess of great nations and is a basic right of all persons. At a time \nwhen education is at the top of the agenda both at the White House and \nin Congress, we must work together to focus national attention on \neducation, on and off reservations. Our goal must be the creation of \nacademic environments where every student will have the opportunity to \nreach their full potential and acquire the knowledge and skills \nnecessary to create better opportunities for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  With this Resolution, Senator Domenici is calling on the Congress to \nbring equity to education for all students of every age nationwide. Mr. \nPresident, I am extremely pleased that my colleague has recognized the \nnational need to improve education in Indian Country. Senator Domenici \nhas developed this legislation in close consultation with Indian \nleaders, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5876-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 101--AUTHORIZING THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL TO \n      REPRESENT THE MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND EMPLOYEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to.\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIAN \n                   MINORITIES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Chinese law requires all religious congregations, \n     including Christian congregations, to ``register'' with the \n     Bureau of Religious Affairs, and Christian congregations, \n     depending on denominational affiliation, to be monitored by \n     either the ``Three Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the \n     Protestant Churches of China,'' the ``Chinese Christian \n     Council,'' the ``Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association,'' or \n     the ``Chinese Catholic Bishops College;''\n       (2) the manner in which these registration requirements are \n     implemented and enforced allows the government to exercise \n     direct\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\n     control over all congregations and their religious \n     activities, and also discourages congregants who fear \n     government persecution and harassment on account of their \n     religious beliefs;\n       (3) in the past several years, unofficial Protestant and \n     Catholic communities have been targeted by the Chinese \n     government in an effort to force all churches to register \n     with the government or face forced dissolution;\n       (4) this campaign has resulted in the beating and \n     harassment of congregants by Chinese public security forces, \n     the closure of churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and \n     criminal and administrative sentences. For example, as \n     reported by credible American and multinational \n     nongovernmental organizations,\n       --in February 1995, 500 to 600 evangelical Christians from \n     Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces met in Huaian, Jiangsu \n     Province. Public Security Bureau personnel broke up the \n     meeting, beat several participants, imprisoned several of the \n     organizers, and levied severe fines on others;\n       --in April 1996 government authorities in Shanghai closed \n     more than 300 home churches or meeting places;\n       --from January through May, 1996, security forces fanned \n     out through northern Hebei Province, a Catholic stronghold, \n     in order to prevent an annual attendance at a major Marian \n     shrine by arresting clergy and lay Catholics and confining \n     prospective attendees to their villages.\n       --a communist party document dated November 20, 1996 \n     entitled ``The Legal Procedures for Implementing the \n     Eradication of the Illegal Activities of the Underground \n     Catholic Church'' details steps for eliminating the Catholic \n     movement in Chongren, Xian, Fuzhou and Jiangxi Provinces and \n     accuses believers of ``seriously disturbing the social order \n     and affecting [the] political stability'' of the country; and\n       --in March 1997, public security officials raided the home \n     of the ``underground'' Bishop of Shanghai, confiscating \n     religious articles and $2,500 belonging to the church;\n       (b) It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to release from incarceration all those held for \n     participation in religious activities outside the aegis of \n     the official churches, and cease prosecuting or detaining \n     those who participate in such religious activities;\n       (2) the government of the People's Republic of China be \n     urged to abolish its present church registration process;\n       (3) the government of the People's Republic of China fully \n     adhere to the religious principles protected by the U.N. \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and\n       (4) the Administration should raise the United States' \n     concerns over the persecution of Protestant and Catholic \n     believers with the government of the People's Republic of \n     China, including at the proposed state visit by President \n     Jiang Zemin to the United States, and at other high-level \n     meetings which may take place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                      hutchison amendment no. 397\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 903, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI, add the following (and conform the \n     table of contents accordingly:)\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY \n                   ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The West's victory in the Cold War dramatically changed \n     the political and national security landscape in Europe;\n       (2) The unity, resolve, and strength of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization was the principal factor behind that \n     victory;\n       (3) The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in April 1949 and \n     created the most successful defense alliance in history;\n       (4) The President of the United States and leaders of other \n     NATO countries have indicated their intention to enlarge \n     alliance membership to include at least three new countries;\n       (5) The Senate expressed its approval of the enlargement \n     process by voting 81-16 in favor of the NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996.\n       (6) The United States is bound by Article Five of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty to respond to an attack on any NATO member as \n     it would to an attack on the United States itself;\n       (7) Although the prospect of NATO membership has provided \n     the impetus for several countries to resolve long standing \n     disputes, the North Atlantic Treaty does not provide for a \n     formal dispute resolution process by which members can \n     resolve differences among themselves without undermining \n     Article Five obligations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should consider a \n     formal dispute resolution process within the Alliance prior \n     to its December 1997 ministerial meeting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                      murkowski amendment no. 398\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 903, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

AVIATION SAFETY.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the need for cooperative \n     efforts in transportation and aviation safety be placed on \n     the agenda for the Summit of the Americas to be held in \n     Santiago, Chile, in March 1998. Since April 1996, when \n     ministers and transportation officials from 23 countries in \n     the Western Hemisphere met in Santiago, Chile, in order to \n     develop the Hemispheric Transportation Initiative, aviation \n     safety and transportation standardization has become an \n     increasingly important issue. The adoption of comprehensive \n     Hemisphere-wide measures to enhance transportation safety, \n     including standards for equipment, infrastructure, and \n     operations as well as harmonization of regulations relating \n     to equipment, operations, and transportation safety are \n     imperative. This initiative will increase the efficiency and \n     safety of the current system and consequently facilitate \n     trade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ABRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 403\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for Mr. Abraham) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n903, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI of division B, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD \n                   THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As the world's leading democracy, the United States \n     cannot ignore the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China's record on human rights and religious persecution.\n       (2) According to Amnesty International, ``A fifth of the \n     world's people are ruled by a government that treats \n     fundamental human rights with contempt. Human rights \n     violations continue on a massive scale.''.\n       (3) According to Human Rights Watch/Asia reported that: \n     ``Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted \n     by the government during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at \n     forcing all churches to register or face dissolution, \n     resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of \n     churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In \n     Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or \n     meeting points were closed down by the security authorities \n     in April alone.''.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China's compulsory family \n     planning policies include forced abortions.\n       (5) China's attempts to intimidate Taiwan and the \n     activities of its military, the People's Liberation Army, \n     both in the United States and abroad, are of major concern.\n       (6) The Chinese government has threatened international \n     stability through its weapons sales to regimes, including \n     Iran and Iraq, that sponsor terrorism and pose a direct \n     threat to American military personnel and interests.\n       (7) The efforts of two Chinese companies, the China North \n     Industries Group (NORINCO) and the China Poly Group (POLY), \n     deserve special rebuke for their involvement in the sale of \n     AK-47 machine guns to California street gangs.\n       (8) Allegations of the Chinese government's involvement in \n     our political system may involve both civil and criminal \n     violations of our laws.\n       (9) The Senate is concerned that China may violate the 1984 \n     Sino-British Joint Declaration transferring Hong Kong from \n     British to Chinese rule by limiting political and economic \n     freedom in Hong Kong.\n       (10) The Senate strongly believes time has come to take \n     steps that would signal to Chinese leaders that religious \n     persecution, human rights abuses, forced abortions, military \n     threats and weapons proliferation, and attempts to influence \n     American elections are unacceptable to the American people.\n       (11) The United States should signal its disapproval of \n     Chinese government actions through targeted sanctions, while \n     at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and cultural \n     exchanges that can lead to positive change in China.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) limit the granting of United States visas to Chinese \n     government offices who work in entities the implementation of \n     China's laws and directives on religious practices and \n     coercive family planning, and those officials materially \n     involved in the massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen \n     square;\n       (2) limit United States taxpayer subsidies for the Chinese \n     government through multilateral development institutions such \n     as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund;\n       (3) publish a list of all companies owned in part or wholly \n     by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Chinese \n     government who export to, or have an office in, the United \n     States;\n       (4) consider imposing targeted sanctions on NORINCO and \n     POLY by not allowing them to export to, nor to maintain a \n     physical presence in, the United States for a period of one \n     year; and\n       (5) promote democratic values in China by increasing United \n     States Government funding of Radio Free Asia, the National \n     Endowment for Democracy's programs in China and existing \n     student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs between \n     the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 404\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for Mrs. Feinstein) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n903, supra;

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nretirement of Mrs. Jimmie Johnson. Mrs. Johnson retires after 36 years \nof dedicated service to Milwaukee Public Schools. I want to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge her hard work and commitment to the students \nof Milwaukee.\n  Throughout her 36 years as an education professional, she has earned \nthe respect and admiration of her students and colleagues by upholding \neducational standards, while maintaining a loving and caring \nrelationship with all who encountered her. She is known to her \ncoworkers and students as a counselor, a problem solver, and consummate \nfriend.\n  As socioeconomic and family issues changed over the years for the \nstudents within the school system, she maintained the same love for \nmaking a difference. Her dedication shines through in her desire to \nfeed, clothe, and counsel her students.\n  Her commitment to education transcended the school system, as she \ntaught Sunday school faithfully for more than 25 years. She also taught \nvacation Bible school out of her home to the children in her \nneighborhood. This same commitment is also exemplified by her ability \nto obtain a masters degree in education, while working fulltime and \nraising a family.\n  A success not only in the classroom, but in her personal life as \nwell--Mrs. Johnson is a devout Christian who lends her time to the \ndevelopment of other Christians. She is also the faithful wife to Oscar \nSr., a world class mother to Oscar Jr. and Derrick, and a loving \ngrandmother to Janae and Dilona. Throughout the process of fulfilling \nthese responsibilities, she has managed to balance her professional \ncareer with her family life. Her kind spirit has made her the \nunofficial adopted mother of countless peers, acquaintances and \nextended family members.\n  Mrs. Jimmie Ruth Johnson has left a mark on the countless students \nthat she has taught and deserves this recognition. She has played an \nintegral part of the development of excellence through educating the \ncity of Milwaukee's youth with optimism, patience and love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5883-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5883-S5884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATING THE STUDENTS OF GORHAM HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. GREGG.

I also would like \nto recognize their teacher Mike Brosnan, their district coordinator Ray \nKneeland, and their state coordinator Holly Belson. These three people \ndedicated much time and effort to help the team make it to the national \nfinals.\n  This competition, which is organized by the Center for Civic \nEducation, attracts over 1,200 students and tests their comprehension \nof the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Also, the students must be able \nto relate these ideals to contemporary issues before simulated \ncongressional committees composed of constitutional lawyers, \njournalists, and scholars. The students of Gorham did an exceptional \njob demonstrating all of these important skills. Their dedication to \nour Nation's founding ideals is impressive and should serve as an \nexample to any young person who is interested in the U.S. Government \nand its laws.\n  The ``We the People . . .

SHIMBERG'S DEPARTURE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this Friday, June 20, marks the \nlast day Steven J. Shimberg will work here in the Senate as staff \ndirector and chief counsel of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. Next month, he will begin a new career with the National \nWildlife Federation.\n  Steve Shimberg is a New York native and a magna cum laude graduate of \nthe State University of New York at Buffalo. Upon graduating from Duke \nUniversity School of Law, Steve spent 3 years as a trial attorney with \nthe U.S. Department of Justice's Land and Natural Resources Division \nbefore joining the staff of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks in 1981.\n  I have been a member of the Committee since I entered the Senate in \n1977. I served as the chairman or ranking minority member of the Water \nResources Subcommittee from the 96th Congress through the 103d \nCongress, and I served as full committee chairman from September 1992 \nthrough January 1993. So, over the years, I have seen Steve shepherd \nthrough the committee enormously complicated and thoroughly bipartisan \nlegislation to protect our natural resources. I can attest to Steve's \npersonableness, his sense of humor and good cheer, his comity, and his \nutter competence. Consummately professional, always courteous, and \nalways calm.\n  Environmental policy, to be supportable, must be based on sound \nscience. And so I have argued that the committee needs more scientists \nand fewer lawyers on the staff. Steve certainly is an exception; he has \nbeen indispensable. While I applaud Federation officials for their \nastuteness in hiring Steve, I lament the loss his departure means to \nthe committee, and to the Senate. We will miss him.\n  Sir Christopher Wren's tombstone reads, ``Lector, si monumentum \nrequiris circumspice.'' With regard to Steve's work over the past 17 \nyears on the committee, the products are around us all: cleaner air, \ncleaner water, a greatly redeemed physical and human \nenvironment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5884-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on Wednesday, April 10, the Senate \nonce again turned to consideration of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. \nThis legislation, Senate bill 104, is the latest attempt to force \naction on the long overdue construction of a Federal, spent nuclear \nwaste depository. A centralized waste storage facility must be located \nsoon if the Department of Energy [DOE] is to have any hope of \nfulfilling its contractual obligation to collect the spent fuel stored \nat over 100 facilities around the country in the next decade.\n  Michigan needs the DOE to fulfill this obligation. My State has four \nnuclear plants: Big Rock in Charlevoix, Fermi in Monroe, Palisades in \nSouthhaven, with 2 reactors, and DC Cook in Southhaven. All four of \nthese plants were designed with some small storage capacity, but a \ncouple of years ago, Palisades ran out of spent fuel pool storage \nspace. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act will mandate the removal and \nstorage of this spent fuel at a safe, central facility.\n  The first amendment to S. 104 was a Reid amendment stipulating that \nno waste may be transported through a State without the prior written \nconsent of that State's Governor. In effect, this amendment would have \npermitted any Governor to block the implementation of the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act and impede the safe storage of nuclear waste. I supported, \ntherefore, the tabling motion which passed by a 72 to 24 margin.\n  The Thompson amendment which was considered next sought to exempt Oak \nRidge, TN, from being considered as an interim waste site should the \nPresident search for a location other than Yucca Mountain. In general, \nI do not like the idea of deleting from consideration particular sites \nwithout a debate on the matter. This site, however, lies in a \ngeological zone comprised primarily of limestone bedrock that is \nfrequently riven by shallow underground rivers. As such, the risk of \ncontaminated waste leaking into the area's water table is too great for \nthis site to be a reasonable replacement for the Yucca Mountain site. \nFor that reason, I supported the Thompson amendment and it passed on a \n60 to 33 vote.\n  The Bumpers amendment that followed was a sense of the Senate \nresolution stating that the Department of Energy had an unavoidable \ndelay in its contractual obligations to begin taking possession of \nspent fuel in 1998. If passed, this resolution could have undermined \nthe current lawsuit which has been filed by Michigan and 34 other \nStates against the DOE for not taking this waste in the agreed to time. \nFor that reason, I opposed this resolution. The great majority of my \ncolleagues agreed with me, and the resolution failed on a 24 to 69 \nvote.\n  The next amendment, a Bingaman effort to eliminate the language to \nexempt Oak Ridge, TN, from consideration as an interim site, failed by \na 36 to 56 margin. As I have noted, this site is not a suitable interim \nstorage site, and I voted against the Bingaman measure.\n  The second Bingaman amendment which was considered sought to \neliminate the default provision for designating an interim storage \nsite. The legislation as passed gives the President the authority to \ndeclare whether Yucca Mountain is a suitable interim storage site. If \nthe President says it is not, he has 18 months to identify a new \ninterim site. If, however, the President does not designate another \nfacility within that time, then Yucca Mountain becomes the interim site \nby default. The Bingaman amendment would have changed this. Had it \npassed, the President could have rejected Yucca Mountain and then \nsimply refused to identify another interim site. The end result would \nbe years of lost time, millions of wasted taxpayer dollars, and a \nreturn to the present, untenable situation. I opposed the Bingaman \namendment for this reason and supported the motion to table which \npassed 59 to 39.\n  The final amendments to be considered were a Domenici amendment and a \nMurkowski second degree amendment. The bill as written could have been \nconsidered to allow a waiver on a budget point of order. The Domenici \namendment clarified and reinstated existing law, which does not permit \nwaiving a point of order prospectively.\n  The Murkowski second degree to the Domenici amendment was a technical \nfix that capped the annual fee for each civilian nuclear powerplant at \n1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour. The original provisions limiting user fees \nto 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour were poorly worded. With the budgetary \nfix provided by the Domenici amendment, this provision was restored.\n  I supported the Murkowski amendment and it was adopted by a 66 to 32 \nvote. Shortly after, the Senate passed the Domenici amendment as \nmodified by a voice vote.\n  Upon the disposition of these amendments, the Senate turned to final \npassage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Once again, I voted in favor \nof this important act and was pleased to see it pass by a 65 to 34 \nmargin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5884-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5884-S5885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RACE FOR THE CURE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my admiration \nfor the thousands of Americans who spent last Saturday morning running \nto help bring attention to breast cancer and to raise money to aid in \nfinding a cure for this terrible disease--the leading cause of death \namong women ages 35 to 54.

This effort is even \nmore impressive when you consider that this race took place in 77 \ncities across the country. Since its inception in 1982, the Race for \nthe Cure has raised $45 million and funded 230 grants in basic science \nand clinical research, as well as education and screening projects. The \nincredible turnout for this event displays the widespread concern over \nthe devastation of breast cancer.\n  Every 3 minutes another woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. This \nyear alone, more than 180,000 women will struggle with this disease, \nand more than 44,000 women will die as a result of it. One in eight \nwomen will develop breast cancer within their lifetime, making it \nlikely that every American will be touched in some way by this disease.\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n  Until we find a cure for this disease, it is crucial that we educate \nwomen about the importance of early detection. If the cancer can be \nconfined to the breast, the survival rate is 93 percent. Women need to \nunderstand the importance of mammograms, monthly breast self-\nexaminations, regular exercise and a low-fat, high fiber diet.\n  Mammography screening exams are the best early detection system \navailable, and I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the \nreauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act. Since it was \noriginally passed in the 102d Congress, this legislation has provided \nwomen with safe and reliable mammography services. Through this \nreauthorization, mammography service providers will be required to \nretain women's mammography records so that an accurate medical history \nis maintained. In addition, it will ensure that patients are notified \nabout substandard mammography facilities. It is crucial that we address \nthis need, as early detection is often the key to effective treatment \nand recovery.\n  Women who undergo treatment for breast cancer deserve the best and \nmost appropriate care. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of \n1997, another bill that I have cosponsored, guarantees that health care \nproviders cover inpatient care for mastectomies, lumpectomies, and \nlymph node dissection. These procedures can be both physically and \npsychologically traumatizing, and we must provide these women with the \noption to have an overnight stay in the hospital after surgery.\n  This bill would also require HMO's to provide coverage for \nreconstructive surgery that is necessitated by breast cancer. \nCurrently, this reconstructive surgery may be considered cosmetic, but \nthis categorization is illogical as it ignores the trauma that results \nfrom a full mastectomy and other breast cancer related procedures. \nLast, this bill will guarantee that HMO's cover secondary consultations \nwhen any form of cancer has been diagnosed.\n  I know that my colleagues share my concern with the problem of breast \ncancer, and I hope that they will support these legislative efforts to \nhelp women prevail over this disease.\n  Again, I wish to commend all those who participated in the Race for \nthe Cure, and I only hope that their efforts move us closer to the \nRace's noble goal: a true cure for this debilitating illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5884-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5885-S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN J.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in saluting the 1997 Stanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings. \nAfter 42 years of frustration and near misses, on Saturday night a week \nago the Red Wings completed a 4-0 sweep of the powerful Philadelphia \nFlyers and brought the most coveted trophy in professional sports back \nto the city known by hockey fans across North America as \n``Hockeytown.''\n  My wife, Barbara, and I had one of the most thrilling experiences of \nour lives when we were able to attend the game. Our daughter, Erica, \ncame within a whisker of coming to Detroit from New York but ended up \nglued to her TV instead, with our daughter, Laura, 800 miles away. With \nour daughter, Kate, watching in Ann Arbor, the family was together, \nelectronically watching history in the making. The outpouring of \npositive emotion after the game was almost as memorable as the game \nitself! The long drought was finally over and Detroit's fans poured \nforth into the streets all across Michigan to whoop it up.\n  The Detroit Red Wings are one of the most successful teams in hockey \nhistory. An ``Original Six'' franchise, today's team is rooted in the \ntradition of hockey legends like Sid Abel, Ted Lindsay, Terry Sawchuck, \nand the greatest player ever to lace up skates, Gordie Howe. Their \nnumbers have been retired and hang on banners from the rafters of Joe \nLouis Arena, reminding today's players and fans of glory years past.\n  The 1996-97 Red Wings won the Stanley Cup because of an \norganizationwide commitment to excellence. That commitment begins at \nthe top with team owners Mike and Marian Ilitch, and is matched only by \ntheir dedication to the city of Detroit. When Mike and Marian purchased \nthe team 15 years ago, the Wings regularly missed the playoffs and gave \naway a car at each home game to put fans in the seats. Their \nperseverance, dedication to winning and commitment to the city of \nDetroit have paid off with their Stanley Cup triumph.\n  The Red Wings' tremendous victory was truly a team effort, but a few \nindividuals deserve a special mention. Coach Scotty Bowman won his \nseventh Stanley Cup, and became the first coach in NHL history to win \nthe cup with three teams. Mike Vernon, the Red Wings' veteran goalie, \nearned the Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player in the \nplayoffs with his stellar netminding. But this victory may mean the \nmost to Red Wings Captain Steve Yzerman, one of the classiest \nprofessional athletes one could ever meet. Steve was drafted 14 years \nago and was named team captain 11 years ago, making him the longest \nserving captain with the same team in the NHL. He has carried his team, \nand the often weighty hopes of Red Wings fans, on his shoulders with \ndignity and grace. My congratulations go to Mike and Marian Ilitch, \nScotty Bowman, Mike Vernon, Steve Yzerman, Jimmy Devellano; and players \nDoug Brown, Mathieu Dandenault, Kris Draper, Sergei Fedorov, Viacheslav \nFetisov, Kevin Hodson, Tomas Holmstrom, Mike Knuble, Joey Kocur, \nVladimir Konstantinov, Vyacheslav Kozlov, Martin LaPointe, Igor \nLarionov, Nicklas Lidstrom, Kirk Maltby, Darren McCarty, Larry Murphy, \nChris Osgood, Jamie Pushor, Bob Rouse, Tomas Sandstrom, Brendan \nShanahan, Tim Taylor and Aaron Ward.\n  I would like to extend my congratulations as well to the Philadelphia \nFlyers for a well-played series. Their strength and power gave the Red \nWings a tough battle.\n  Last Friday, after a week of celebration which saw 1 million people \nfill Hart Plaza and Woodward Avenue for the Red Wings' victory parade, \nHockeytown met with tragedy as three members of the team were involved \nin a limousine accident. Two of the Wings' famous ``Russian Five,'' \nVladimir Konstantinov and Slava Fetisov, as well as the team's masseur, \nSergei Mnatsakanov, were seriously injured. Today, Vladimir and Sergei \nare each in a coma with critical head injuries. Slava, thankfully, is \nlisted in good condition with chest injuries. Vladimir, a finalist for \nthe Norris Trophy as the National Hockey League's top defenseman, and \nSlava, a 39-year-old known to his teammates as ``Papa Bear,'' are fan \nfavorites around the league. Hockey fans in the Detroit area and across \nNorth America are praying for the full recovery of all three men.\n  Mr. President, the Detroit Red Wings showed people around the world \nwhat it takes to be a champion. I know my colleagues will join me in \nextending the congratulations of the entire U.S. Senate to the 1997 \nStanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings and also send our hopes and \nprayers for the full recovery of all those injured last Friday \nnight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5886-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCORRECTIONS TO STATEMENT OF MANAGERS ACCOMPANYING CONFERENCE REPORT ON \n                   FISCAL YEAR 1998 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator \nNickles for introducing the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997. \nI believe this important legislation will help victims of crime \nexercise their deserved rights.\n  The 104th Congress did much to ensure that victims are no longer \ncasualties of a skewed justice system where their voices are often \nignored. This year, we are picking up where we left off in standing up \nfor the innocent. I am proud to join several of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  The purpose of the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 is \nreally quite simple. This act will guarantee that victims of crime may \nbe present at public court proceedings, barring their presence will not \nbe a detriment to his or her testimony. Frankly, I am disheartened it \ntakes an act of Congress to reaffirm this right. But, I am pleased we \nare making progress in correcting these deficiencies in America's legal \nsystem.\n  The devastation of lives in the Oklahoma City bombing and the \nsenseless acts of violence occurring in our neighborhoods every day \ngives this Chamber\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\ncause to enact policies empowering victims. In my estimation, the \naccused should see their victim's face in a court of law and know they \nscarred a life forever. I believe this legislation drafted on a \nbipartisan basis will entitle victims of crime their overdue rights and \nmerits widespread support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5886-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today as a supporter and \ncosponsor of Senator Byrd's sense-of-the-Senate resolution, Senate \nResolution 98, regarding ratification of any international agreement on \ngreenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change. Back in 1992, the United States and the rest of the \nworld agreed to work, on a voluntary basis, to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions which scientists believed could affect climate and sea levels \nover the next century. Unfortunately, this agreement, aimed at \nreturning greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels, has failed.\n  Now, the administration is negotiating an agreement aimed at meeting \nthis 1990 level. Instead of requiring countries, all countries--\ndeveloped, developing, and underdeveloped--to agree on voluntary \nefforts, these negotiations are focused on making the 1990 level \nmandatory for only developed countries. In short, it will increase the \nburden of compliance on the United States and other developed \ncountries, while doing nothing to ensure that developing countries meet \nthese targets.\n  Yes, the United States and other developed countries are responsible \nfor the bulk of these emissions but that will not always be the case. \nMany developing countries, such as China, Mexico, India, and Brazil, \nare on course to surpass United States emissions. It makes no sense to \ngive these countries a pass. I am not saying the United States should \nnot do its fair share, we should. My concern is that the agreement is \nshortsighted. Failing to include these developing countries does \nnothing to head off the emission problems which they will soon face.\n  In addition, I have a long record of defending the American worker \nand American industry from unfair business and trade practices \noverseas--many of which occur in these developing countries. My fear is \nthat failing to include developing nations in this agreement will \nundermine America's ability to compete internationally and will only \nwork to force American industry overseas to these developing areas. \nAmerica has the strongest economy in the world. I want to ensure it \nremains that way. Placing the burden of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions only on developed countries and ignoring developing countries \nwill do nothing to secure economic stability.\n  In short, this resolution calls for the United States to refuse to \nsign any agreement unless the developing countries are included in a \nlegally binding regime of emission control measures. It is an effort to \nensure that all countries are placed on a level playing field.\n  With regard to my record on environmental issues, there have been \nsome who have asked if my support of Senate Resolution 98 undermines my \nlong record of supporting efforts to clean and protect our environment. \nLet me say now, it does not. In my opinion, this resolution will \nstrengthen efforts to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by \nensuring that all countries meet the same standards.\n  In closing, I submit for the Record the authoritative and expert \nopinion of Dr. James B. Edwards, the former Secretary of Energy, and \nencourage my colleagues to read his opinions on this matter.\n  The material follows:\n\n                   Pouring Gas Reductions Down Drain\n\n       If a new climate treaty to include binding restrictions on \n     the emission of greenhouse gases is a bad idea--and it is--\n     then the immediate consequence of such a move is even worse: \n     that a tax is imposed on U.S. industries that burn oil, gas \n     and coal. The cost would ultimately fall on American \n     consumers--without necessarily providing benefits to anyone \n     if other countries continue to pollute.\n       The logical conclusion should be: Don't make the first \n     blunder so you are not forced into making the even worse \n     second blunder. But in just seven months an agreement on a \n     new climate treaty could be a done deal. If government \n     commitments made at the latest round of negotiations in \n     Europe are any indication, there could be a treaty in place \n     by December. There is just one problem: U.S. ratification is \n     going to take a two-thirds vote of the Senate eventually.\n       In the view of climatologists as esteemed as Patrick \n     Michaels of the University of Virginia, an expert on computer \n     simulations of the climate, and the University of Alabama's \n     John Christy, it will take decades before scientists gain a \n     comprehensive understanding of how greenhouse gas emissions \n     affect the earth's climate. One thing scientists do know is \n     that the concentration of greenhouse gases is building up \n     slowly--less than 0.5 percent annually for carbon dioxide--\n     and that gives us time to implement effective mitigation \n     measures.\n       Unfortunately, the proposed treaty places binding \n     commitments on industrial nations but none on developing \n     countries. Even such economic powerhouses as China, Korea, \n     and Indonesia would be let off the hook, while the United \n     States would be required to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 15 \n     to 20 percent by 2010 or soon thereafter. Such self-imposed \n     restrictions could backfire.\n       Simply put, the danger is that developing countries will \n     have no incentive to reduce emissions. Their output would \n     overwhelm reductions made by industrial nations--just the \n     opposite of what a new treaty is supposed to achieve. In \n     fact, developing countries, as a group, are expected to \n     produce the majority of greenhouse emissions in future years.\n       According to a report by the U.S. Department of Energy, \n     efforts to restrict fossil fuel emissions with a carbon tax \n     would do serious damage to our economy. The hardest hit would \n     be energy-intensive industries, especially petroleum \n     refining, chemicals, automobile manufacturing, paper \n     products, iron and steel, aluminum and cement. These large \n     industries would be at a disadvantage in the world \n     marketplace, and the cost in dollars, as well as in lost \n     jobs, would be staggering.\n       The most responsible economic estimates of the cost to cap \n     carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2010 or \n     soon thereafter range from $250 billion to $300 billion per \n     year--an amount that would reduce the U.S. gross domestic \n     product by about 4 percent. For comparison, that's nearly \n     equal to what was spent last year on Social Security.\n       This is not to suggest that the United States should do \n     nothing about reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. When major \n     industrialized countries meet in Denver in late June at the \n     ``Group of Seven'' economic summit, climate change will be on \n     the agenda. Efforts should be directed toward establishing a \n     flexible route that could achieve the same long-term benefits \n     but at far lower cost. For example, spreading the \n     responsibility globally, possibly through an emissions \n     trading system involving developing countries, would lower \n     the cost substantially.\n       Under an emissions trading system, any country exceeding \n     its allotment of greenhouse emissions, pays a regulatory \n     fine. The significant differences between this plan and a \n     carbon tax are that technological innovation, market \n     mechanisms and total global emissions are the defining \n     characteristics of this alternative approach to reducing \n     greenhouse emissions.\n       Major efforts should be directed at exporting advanced \n     power systems to developing countries such as China and India \n     so that they can begin to stabilize their emissions, without \n     depriving them of an opportunity for economic growth. After \n     all, as its share of industrial output rises, China is \n     expected to become the world's largest source of carbon \n     dioxide, emitting nearly double the amount the United States \n     emits and more than triple what Western Europe produces.\n       It's very simple: Before we hobble our economy and our \n     society with costly new regulations and taxes we should ask \n     ourselves whether the hoped-for benefits justify the cost to \n     our economy and whether there is a better alternative. And \n     environmentalists ought to keep another perspective mind: For \n     any global emissions reduction program to succeed, all \n     nations must participate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5887-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5887-S5889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HANS A. BETHE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the great Nobel physicist, Hans \nA. Bethe, is the subject of the lead article in the ``Science Times'' \nsection of the New York Times. One cannot help but marvel at the life \nDr. Bethe, a national treasure, has led. In 1935, he fled Nazi Germany, \nsettling at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Within three years, \nhe developed an equation to explain solar fusion which won him a Nobel \nprize in 1967.\n  Hans Bethe led the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos; he was, one \ncould say, present at the creation. He stood next to J. Robert \nOppenheimer on July 16, 1945 in the New Mexico desert, a witness to the \ntesting of the first atomic bomb. The scientists at the site knew that \nif the test worked it would end World War II, as it did within a month, \nand forever change the nature of warfare.\n  At the moment of that explosion, a new era began. It changed us. \nChanged the world, and changed all those present. Maurice M. Shapiro, \nnow chief scientist emeritus of the Laboratory for Cosmic Physics at \nthe Naval Research Station, in Washington, recalled the scene in the \nNew Mexico desert in an interview two years ago:\n\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\n\n       At precisely 5:30 there was a blinding flash--brighter than \n     many suns--and then a flaming fireball. Within seconds a \n     churning multicolored column of gas and dust was rising. \n     Then, within it, a narrower column of debris swirled upward, \n     spreading out into an awesome mushroom-shaped apparition high \n     in the atmosphere--Maurice M. Shapiro, ``Echoes of the Big \n     Bang,'' New York Times, July 15, 1995.\n\n  Next came ``an oppressive sense of foreboding.''\n  Oppenheimer described the event as follows:\n\n       We waited until the blast had passed, walked out of the \n     shelter and then it was extremely solemn. We knew the world \n     would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people \n     cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from \n     the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: Vishnu is trying to \n     persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress \n     him he takes on his multi-armed form and says, ``Now I am \n     become Death, the destroyer of worlds,'' I suppose we all \n     thought that, one way or another.\n\n  Hans Bethe's role in shaping United States nuclear policy had only \njust begun. For the past fifty years, he has involved himself in \nthoughtful and constructive efforts to develop responsible policies to \ndeal with this technology he played such a crucial role in creating. \nThe article in today's New York Times, for instance, characterizes him \nas a ``prime mover behind the first East-West arms accord, the 1963 \nLimited Test Ban Treaty, which ended nuclear explosions in the \natmosphere.'' And just a few months ago--on April 25--he wrote the \nPresident an historic letter which states:\n\n       It seems that the time has come for our Nation to declare \n     that it is not working, in any way, to develop further \n     weapons of mass destruction of any kind.\n\n  Mr. President, Dr. Bethe is one of our living treasures. It is \nentirely fitting that his many contributions to society are publicized \nand studied, and that his policy pronouncements are accorded the \nattention they so deserve, for as the author of the Times article, \nWilliam J. Broad, states, Bethe's voice may be gentle, but his words \nare sharp. I hope that Dr. Bethe will soon complete work on his \nautobiography and share with us the breadth of his life experiences.\n  I ask that the article in the New York Times, the letter from Dr. \nBethe to the President, and the President's response be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n               He Lit Nuclear Fire; Now He Would Douse It\n\n                         (By William J. Broad)\n\n       ``For the things I do, it's accurate enough,'' Dr. Hans A. \n     Bethe said as he rummaged through his briefcase and pulled \n     out a slide rule, a relic from the days before computers took \n     over tedious number-crunching for most scientists. It's \n     battered case told of considerable use.\n       What Dr. Bethe does at the age of 90, and has done for more \n     than seven decades, is ponder such riddles of nature as how \n     stars live and die. It is his passion. Once it won him a \n     Nobel Prize in Physics and now it keeps him excited and in \n     his office at Cornell University, where he arrived more than \n     60 years ago after fleeing Nazi Germany.\n       A combination lock on a metal cabinet hints at what else he \n     does, his sideline, as he puts it, an avocation of more than \n     a half century that helped change history. The atomic bomb.\n       Dr. Bethe knows how it lives--having overseen its birth \n     during the World War II, having felt its blistering heat \n     across miles of desert sand, having watched its progeny fill \n     superpower arsenals--and now he is working hard to make it \n     die.\n       In April, he wrote a letter to President Clinton that some \n     advocates of arms control regard as historic. As the most \n     senior of the living scientists who begat the atomic age, Dr. \n     Bethe called on the United States to declare that it would \n     forgo all work to devise new kinds of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       But his dream, it turns out, is larger than that, much \n     larger. In an interview last week, Dr. Bethe said that a \n     concerted push by the world's nations and people might yet \n     cut nuclear arsenals down from their current levels of \n     thousands of arms to perhaps 100 in the East, 100 in the West \n     and few in between.\n       ``Then,'' added this survivor of Hitler and Mussolini, his \n     voice gentle but words sharp, ``even if statesmen go crazy \n     again, as they used to be, the use of these weapons will not \n     destroy civilization.''\n       Eventually, perhaps late next century, Dr. Bethe said, the \n     right social conditions may finally arise so that the bomb is \n     no more, so that no nation on earth will want to wield the \n     threat of nuclear annihilation. The nightmare will be over.\n       He paused.\n       ``That is my hope,'' he said. ``My fear is that we stay \n     where we are,'' with each side keeping thousands of nuclear \n     arms poised to fly at a moment's notice. ``And if we stay \n     where we are, then additional countries will get nuclear \n     weapons'' and the earth may yet blaze with thermonuclear \n     fire, the kind that powers stars and destroys most everything \n     in its path.\n       Hans Albrecht Bethe (pronounced BAY-ta) was born on July 2, \n     1906, in Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine. His father, a \n     physiologist at the university there, was Protestant and his \n     mother Jewish. Hans was their only child.\n       Displaying an early genius for mathematics, he excelled in \n     school and received a Ph.D. in physics in 1928 at the \n     University of Munich, graduating summa cum laude. He fled \n     Germany after Hitler came to power, going first to England \n     and then to America, arriving at Cornell in 1935.\n       While helping to found the field of atomic physics, he \n     became fascinated by nature's extremes. In 1938 he penned the \n     equations that explain how the Sun shines and how stars in \n     the prime of life feed their nuclear fires. In 1967 he won a \n     Nobel Prize for the discovery.\n       From 1943 to 1945 he headed the theoretical division of Los \n     Alamos, the top-secret laboratory in New Mexico where \n     thousands of scientists and technicians, fearful that Hitler \n     might do it first, labored day and night to unlock the atom's \n     power.\n       Dr. Bethe coaxed some of world's brightest and most \n     idiosyncratic experts to success as they toiled behind rows \n     of barbed wire. Their atomic bomb shook the New Mexican \n     desert on July 16, 1945. The next month the American military \n     dropped similar ones on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki.\n       After the war, Dr. Bethe devoted himself not only to \n     nuclear science but to the social dangers posed by that \n     knowledge, in particular to keeping the bomb from ever \n     killing people again.\n       He advised the Federal Government on matters of weapons and \n     arms limitation, becoming a prime mover behind the first \n     East-West arms accord, the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, \n     which ended nuclear explosions in the atmosphere and \n     permitted them only beneath the earth.\n       That stopped the rain of radioactive fallout that had \n     raised the risk of cancer and birth defects among many \n     people. But Dr. Bethe wanted more. He campaigned for a \n     complete cessation to all testing, contrary to Pentagon \n     planners and politicians intent on redoubling the size of the \n     nation's nuclear arsenal.\n       The development of new types of nuclear arms requires \n     numerous test firings and, as flaws inevitably come to light, \n     design improvements. The absence of explosive testing sharply \n     increases the odds of failure and virtually rules out the \n     possibility of perfecting new designs.\n       In the 1980's, Dr. Bethe was on the losing side of the \n     political war over nuclear-arms development as the Reagan \n     Administration pressed ahead with dozens of underground \n     explosions. One series aimed at perfecting a new generation \n     of bombs that fired deadly beams.\n       In the 1990's, he was on the winning side as President \n     Clinton signed, and the United Nations endorsed, the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Its goal is to halt the \n     development of new weapons of mass destruction by imposing a \n     global ban on nuclear detonations.\n       A remaining trouble, as Dr. Bethe sees it, is that the \n     United States over the decades has become so good at \n     designing nuclear arms that it still might make progress \n     despite the ban. Indeed, the Clinton Administration recently \n     began a $4-billion-a-year program of bomb maintenance that is \n     endowing the weapons laboratories with all kinds of new tools \n     and test equipment, including a $2.2 billion laser the size \n     of the Rose Bowl that is to ignite tiny thermonuclear \n     explosions.\n       Critics fear the custodians might get carried away, \n     begetting new designs and perhaps even new classes of nuclear \n     arms.\n       So it was that Dr. Bethe wrote President Clinton in April, \n     asking for a pledge of no new weapons.\n       ``The time has come for our nation to declare that it is \n     not working, in any way, to develop further weapons of mass \n     destruction,'' he wrote.\n       The United States ``needs no more,'' Dr. Bethe stressed. \n     ``Further, it is our own splendid weapons laboratories that \n     are, by far and without question, the most likely to succeed \n     in such nuclear inventions. Since any new types of weapons \n     would, in time, spread to others and present a threat to us, \n     it is logical for us not to pioneer further in this field.''\n       In the interview, Dr. Bethe waxed philosophic about the \n     odds that his personal appeal might engender new Federal \n     policy. ``It's a big step for the President to say so, but \n     it's a small step for me,'' he mused. ``Maybe the \n     laboratories will feel that my letter was useful and maybe \n     they'll even follow my advice. I think that's all one can \n     expect.''\n       The issue is important, he added. If the community of \n     nations comes to view the United States as a nuclear \n     hypocrite, whether true or not, that perception could \n     threaten to undermine the new treaty and its ratification \n     around the world. Instead, Dr. Bethe said, the United States \n     must be seen as striving to obey the letter of the law.\n       Dr. Bethe's face comes alive as the topic turns to his \n     current scientific research: how a single aging star can \n     suddenly explode with the power and brilliance of an entire \n     galaxy of 100 billion stars.\n       It seems like pure poetry given the light he himself is now \n     shedding in his final years.\n       ``I want to understand just how the mechanism works,'' Dr. \n     Bethe said, ``how you get a\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\n     shock wave that propels most of the star outward, propels it \n     at very high speed.''\n       Most days, he said, he spends about four hours studying the \n     nature of the exploding stars, which are known as supernovas. \n     Occasionally, he works up to six hours.\n       Theoretic physics is a quintessential young man's field, \n     where geniuses often peak at the age of 30, like athletes. \n     Very few make significant contributions at 50. But at 90, Dr. \n     Bethe, a living legend among his peers, is still going \n     strong. ``Here's my latest paper,'' he said with a grin, \n     displaying it proudly on his cluttered desk. ``It has been \n     accepted by The Astrophysical Journal.'' The main point, he \n     said, ``is that it's easy to get the supernova to expel the \n     outside material,'' eliminating the problems theorists once \n     encountered.\n       Dr. Bethe is not interrupting his research to write \n     memoirs. Instead, a biographer is at work. ``It's much easier \n     to have a biographer,'' he remarked, ``and he writes much \n     better than I do.''\n       The back of his office door, in an easy-to-view position, \n     held a poster of the Matterhorn. For nearly a half century, a \n     small town at the foot of the great Swiss mountain has been a \n     vacation spot for Dr. Bethe and his wife, Rose Ewald, whom he \n     met in Germany and married in 1939 while the two were \n     newcomers to the United States.\n       ``I couldn't live without her,'' he said.\n       His hair askew, his eyes agleam, Dr. Bethe looked a bit \n     like an aged wizard on the verge of disappearing in a puff of \n     smoke. He seemed at ease with his many lives over many \n     decades and appeared to have reconciled his early work on the \n     bomb with his current push to eliminate it. For him, doing \n     the right thing in different periods of history seemed to \n     call for different kinds of actions.\n       ``I am a very happy person,'' he said with a relaxed smile. \n     ``I wouldn't want to change what I did during my life.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Federation of American Scientists,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1997.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       My Dear Mr. President: As the Director of the Theoretical \n     Division at Los Alamos, I participated at the most senior \n     level in the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the \n     first atomic weapons. Now, at age 90, I am one of the few \n     remaining senior project participants. And I have followed \n     closely, and participated in, the major issues of the nuclear \n     arms race and disarmament during the last half century. I ask \n     to be permitted to express a related opinion.\n       It seems that the time has come for our Nation to declare \n     that it is not working, in any way, to develop further \n     weapons of mass destruction of any kind. In particular, this \n     means not financing work looking toward the possibility of \n     new designs for nuclear weapons. And it certainly means not \n     working on new types of nuclear weapons, such as pure-fusion \n     weapons.\n       The United States already possesses a very wide range of \n     different designs of nuclear weapons and needs no more. \n     Further, it is our own splendid weapons laboratories that \n     are, by far and without any question, the most likely to \n     succeed in such nuclear inventions. Since any new types of \n     weapons would, in time, spread to others and present a threat \n     to us, it is logical for us not to pioneer further in this \n     field.\n       In some cases, such as pure-fusion weapons, success is \n     unlikely. But even reports of our seeking to invent them \n     could be, from a political point of view, very damaging to \n     our national image and to our effort to maintain a world-wide \n     campaign for nuclear disarmament. Do you, for example, want \n     scientists in laboratories under your Administration trying \n     to invent nuclear weapons so efficient, compared to \n     conventional weapons, that someday, if an unlikely success \n     were achieved, they would be a new option for terrorists?\n       This matter is sure to be raised in conjunction with the \n     Senate's review of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, because \n     that Treaty raises the question of what experiments are, and \n     what experiments are not, permitted. In my judgment, the time \n     has come to cease all physical experiments, no matter how \n     small their yield, whose primary purpose is to design new \n     types of nuclear weapons, as opposed to developing peaceful \n     uses of nuclear energy. Indeed, if I were President, I would \n     not fund computational experiments, or even creative thought \n     designed to produce new categories of nuclear weapons. After \n     all, the big secret about the atomic bomb was that it could \n     be done. Why should taxpayers pay to learn new such secrets--\n     secrets that will eventually leak--even and especially if we \n     do not plan, ourselves, to implement the secrets?\n       In effect, the President of the United States, the \n     laboratory directors, and the atomic scientists in the \n     laboratories should all adopt the stance of the ``Atomic \n     Scientists' Appeal to Colleagues,'' which was promulgated two \n     years ago, to ``cease and desist from work creating, \n     developing, improving and manufacturing further nuclear \n     weapons--and, for that matter, other weapons of potential \n     mass destruction such as chemical and biological weapons.''\n       I fully support the Science-based Stockpile Stewardship \n     program, which ensures that the existing nuclear weapons \n     remain fully operative. This is a challenging program to \n     fulfill in the absence of nuclear tests. But neither it nor \n     any of the other Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Safeguards \n     require the laboratories to engage in creative work or \n     physical or computational experiments on the design of new \n     types of nuclear weapons, and they should not do so.\n       In particular, the basic capability to resume nuclear test \n     activities can and will be maintained, under the Stockpile \n     Stewardship program, without attempting to design new types \n     of nuclear weapons. And even if the Department of Energy is \n     charged to ``maintain capability to design, fabricate and \n     certify new warheads''--which I do not believe is necessary--\n     this also would not require or justify research into new \n     types of nuclear weapons.\n       The underlying purpose of a complete cessation of nuclear \n     testing mandated by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is to \n     prevent new nuclear weapons from emerging and this certainly \n     suggests doing everything we can to prevent new categories of \n     nuclear weapons from being discovered. It is in our national \n     and global interest to stand true to this underlying purpose.\n       Accordingly, I hope you will review this matter personally \n     to satisfy yourself that no nuclear weapons design work is \n     being done, under the cover of your Safeguards or other \n     policies, that you would not certify as absolutely required. \n     Perhaps, in conjunction with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test \n     Ban Treaty hearings in the Senate, you might consider making \n     a suitable pronouncement along these lines, to discipline the \n     bureaucracy, and to reassure the world that America is \n     vigilant in its desire to ensure that new kinds of nuclear \n     weapons are not created.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hans A. Bethe.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 1997.\n     Prof. Hans Bethe,\n     Federation of American Scientists, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Professor Bethe: Thank you for sharing your thoughts \n     on nuclear weapons with me, and for the tremendous service \n     you have rendered this nation and the world for well over \n     half a century. Your efforts to develop the atomic bomb \n     during a grave period of national emergency, and your \n     subsequent courageous and principled efforts in support of \n     international agreements to control the awesome destructive \n     power of these weapons, have made our country more secure and \n     the entire world a safer place.\n       I am fully committed to securing the ratification, entry \n     into force and effective implementation of the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). By banning all nuclear explosions, \n     the CTBT will constrain the development and qualitative \n     improvement of nuclear weapons and end the development of \n     advanced new types of nuclear weapons. In this way, the \n     Treaty will contribute to the process of nuclear disarmament \n     and the prevention of nuclear proliferation, and it will \n     strengthen international peace and security.\n       I appreciate your support for the Science-Based Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program. The objective of this program is to \n     ensure that our existing nuclear weapons remain safe and \n     reliable in the absence of nuclear testing. As you are aware, \n     my support for the CTBT is conditioned upon such a program, \n     including the conduct of a broad range of effective and \n     continuing experimental programs. I have also directed that \n     the United States maintain the basic capability to resume \n     nuclear test activities prohibited by the CTBT in the \n     unlikely event that the United States should need to withdraw \n     from this treaty. These precautions notwithstanding, I remain \n     confident that the CTBT points us toward a new century in \n     which the roles and risks of nuclear weapons can be further \n     reduced, and ultimately eliminated.\n       Thank you again for sharing your views with me as we work \n     to lift the nuclear backdrop that has darkened the world's \n     stage for far too long.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/17/senate-section/article/S5887-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE RETURNED TO THE CALENDAR--S. 903\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 101, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be stated by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 101) to authorize representation of \n     Members, officers, and an employee of the Senate in the case \n     of Douglas R. Page v. Richard Shelby, et al.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a resident of California has, for the second \ntime in the past several years, filed a lawsuit in the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia challenging the \nconstitutionality of\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate. Under rule XXII, debate \non a pending matter may be limited by a vote of three-fifths of the \nSenators duly chosen and sworn or, in the case of an amendment to a \nSenate rule, a vote of two-thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum \nbeing present.\n  The plaintiffs has named as defendants in this action all Members of \nthe Senate, together with the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at \nArms, the Parliamentarian, and two executive branch officials. He seeks \na declaration that rule XXII is unconstitutional and a court order \nrewriting rule XXII to permit a simple majority of a quorum to limit \ndebate in the Senate.\n  With respect to a prior action filed by the same plaintiff also \nchallenging rule XXII, Senate Resolution 150 of the 103d Congress \nauthorized the Senate Legal Counsel to defend Senators named as \ndefendants in that action. With respect to the plaintiff's prior \nchallenge, the district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing. \nOn appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate court \nvacated the district court's decision and ordered the plaintiff's \ncomplaint dismissed as moot. In his complaint, the plaintiff had sought \nto present his alleged injury as frustration of the majority party's \nlegislative program by the minority. The appellate court noted that the \nintervening change in the control of the Senate after the 1994 election \nhad mooted his allegations of injury.\n  The plaintiff's new action alleges an injury independent of party \ncontrol, as well as adding non-Member defendants. The new action is \nsubject to the same grounds for dismissal as was the previous action.\n  Over the years, the Senate has vigorously debated the merits of rule \nXXII. That debate has included the question that the plaintiff seeks to \npresent to the court in the instant action of whether a majority of the \nSenate should be permitted to end debate. The resolution of this issue \nunder our constitutional system, Mr. President, is best decided in the \nSenate and not in the courts.\n  The resolution at the desk would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel \nto represent the Members, officers, and an employee of the Senate who \nhave been named as defendants in this case and to move to dismiss the \ncomplaint.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear \nat this point in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 101) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 101\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Douglas R. Page v. Richard Shelby, \n     et al., C.A. No. 97-0068, pending in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, the plaintiff \n     has named all Members of the Senate, and the Secretary, the \n     Sergeant at Arms, and the Parliamentarian, of the Senate, as \n     defendants;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nArmed Services Committee has filed the DOD authorization bill. It is \nthe leader's intention to ask consent to turn to that bill at 12 noon \non Wednesday. It is the leader's hope that Senators will grant the \nconsent so the Senate can begin debate on this very important piece of \nlegislation. Also, the Senate may be asked to consider the intelligence \nauthorization bill. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur \nthroughout the session of the Senate on Wednesday.\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n  The leader would remind Senators that we have a lot of work to do \nbetween now and the Fourth of July recess. Therefore, all Senators' \ncooperation is essential in order to complete our business in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the only point I would like to make is that \nunder the situation as it now stands as it relates to the DOD bill, \nthere is at least one conflict. Unless it is worked out overnight, or \nby noon tomorrow, it would be very difficult to move to that piece of \nlegislation. I think everything is all right as it relates to going to \nthe intelligence bill. I think everybody understands it. But for the \nRecord, we would be hard pressed, or I would be hard pressed not to \nrecognize Senators on my side and your side.\n  Mr. HELMS.
