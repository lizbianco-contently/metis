Mr. President, my children attend a high school in \nFairfax County. It is a high school that has great diversity, great \nhope, great potential. It is a school that you might say is in some \ntransition. The school has seen a great deal of improvement, has a \ngreat deal of camaraderie, a great spirit at this public high school. \nIt is Mount Vernon High School. The teachers care, the parents care, \nthe administrators care. My kids have made terrific friends at this \nschool, friends that indeed will last a lifetime.\n  One student, Ann Harris, became one of my daughter's absolute best \nfriends. They had morning period together. They had one book that they \nwould share, they would make notes and they would pass it each day with \nthe thoughts that they had in their heart and they would share it back \nand forth.\n  Ann Harris's father, Coleman, has been PTA president for 3 years. His \nwife, Jean, you could not ask for a better booster for that high \nschool. They want to make sure that that high school is a safe place \nfor kids, and they have done a terrific job.\n  March 29 of this year my wife and I were driving when the cell phone \nrang. I answered, and it was my daughter. I could tell that something \nwas very wrong because of the anguish in her voice. She said, ``Dad, \nwhen will you and Mom be home?'' And I said we will be home very soon. \nThen my daughter started crying and she said, ``Ann Harris is dead.'' \nAnd I said, ``What?'' And she said, ``Ann is dead,'' and she continued \nto cry. I tried to ask her what in the world had happened, and she said \nshe has been shot.\n\n  We later learned that she had been shot in a drive-by. So here is \nColeman and Jean Harris, doing all they can as\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\nparents, all that teachers and administrators can do to make sure that \nyou have a safe school, a safe environment, and a safe neighborhood.\n  But here is the irony. That shooting did not take place in our \nneighborhood. It took place 3,000 miles away over spring break because \nof something going on in that community where some guy, for whatever \nreason, got offended and fired into the back of that automobile, ending \nthe lovely life of a 17-year-old girl.\n  Ann Harris was a model student and a model citizen. She was an A \nstudent. She was an outstanding athlete, a great tennis player. She had \nbeen accepted to Purdue University. She is gone because somebody--\nsomebody--just undertook a senseless and pointless act that \nextinguished the life of so much potential.\n  I can tell you that not just my daughter cried but a whole community \nhas cried in mourning the loss of Ann Harris. I don't think there is a \nsweeter smile that I have seen on anybody than on the face of Ann \nHarris.\n  We talk about this today on the floor of the U.S. Senate because how \nmany times throughout the United States in any of our communities do we \npick up newspapers and find out that a young life has been extinguished \nbecause of some senseless, violent act? We read about it all the time.\n  In 1994, more than 2,600 juveniles between the ages of 10 and 17 were \nmurdered. That is a rate of seven per day. One in five of these victims \nwas killed by another juvenile. The number of juveniles arrested for \nviolent crimes has increased 60 percent in the last 10 years. During \nthat same time, murder arrests rose 125 percent. Our young people are \nthe most frequent victims of violent crime. They are raped, robbed or \nassaulted at a rate five times higher than adults. The homicide rate \nfor youths in the United States is 10 times higher than in Canada, 15 \ntimes higher than in Australia, 28 times higher than in France and \nGermany. This increase in juvenile crime has been linked to the \nincrease in youth gang activity. Gangs are now present in all 50 \nStates, in large cities, small cities, and in rural communities.\n  I think it is appropriate for the U.S. Senate to salute the life of \nAnn Harris and all of these young Americans that we have lost who have \nbeen senselessly killed for no reason.\n  At graduation this past June, they still called Ann's name, and her \nbrother and sisters came across the stage to accept her diploma. \nWaiting on stage to meet each graduate were Coleman and Jean Harris. \nThey hugged every student, just as they hoped that they would be \nhugging Ann on receiving her diploma.\n  May this tragic event somehow cause all of us to look around our own \ncommunities. With us today are Coleman and Jean Harris; Ann's high \nschool principal, Calanthia Tucker; Fairfax County school board member, \nKris Amundson; members of the church, the pastor.\n  All of us today salute and celebrate the life of Ann Harris and the \nlife of the young people that aren't with us. Let us, as parents and as \nadults, redouble our efforts. What have we done lately for our children \nand for our community? Have we gotten involved in our children's \nschools to make sure they are safe, that they are drug free? Have we \ndemonstrated with organizations like Parents and Youth Against Drug \nAbuse that that is the right thing to be doing? Have you worked with \nlocal law enforcement agencies to develop safer neighborhoods and a \nsupport system?\n  Ann's parents have continued their efforts to promote safer schools \nin safer neighborhoods. They have started with what is called Ann's \nCampaign, ``Ann's Campaign For A Safer America.'' The focus of the \ncampaign is to help youth and adults live the kind of life exemplified \nby Ann, a life that radiated kindness, warmth and compassion for \nothers. That describes Ann Harris.\n  In just a few months, Ann's Campaign has grown from a simple concept \nborn of love to a national organization with a web site that offers \nencouragement, support, and information to interested persons. Ann's \nCampaign provides links to other support groups such as Mothers Against \nViolence in America and Students Against Violence Everywhere. Through \nthis type of networking, the Harris's hope to promote a positive \nmessage to young people that together we really can build a better \nAmerica and a safer America.\n  I send my sincere thoughts and prayers to the Harris family on their \nloss, my admiration and support for their effort to make our world a \nlittle bit better place to live. As the model of Ann's Campaign \nadvocates, we need to encourage each other to smile more, to care more, \nto love more, and to be more understanding. If we save just one life, \nwe have paid the finest tribute in the world to Ann Harris, and we can \ndo so. This senseless loss of life of our young people must come to an \nend.\n  So while my heart is sad, it also celebrates. My family knew Ann \nHarris. All the kids at Mount Vernon High School knew Ann Harris, and \nfor the rest of their lives they will know the joy that she brought to \nthem, and through Ann's Campaign it can bring to others throughout the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I referenced Ann's Campaign and the fact that they \nhave a Web site. Anybody who wishes to access that, if they simply \naccess ``annscampaign.org,'' they would have access to that Web site. I \nacknowledge that Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia, whose alma mater is \nMount Vernon High School, intends to be speaking on this issue today, \ntoo, as well as Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, who will be coming \ndown and speaking on this issue.\n  I mentioned about the parents and all of us getting involved. I am \nvery proud of my wife, who is now the President of the PTA of Mount \nVernon High School. Now, it is with pleasure that I turn to my \ncolleague from Idaho, the senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, who \nhas comments with regard to Ann Harris.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, \nfor taking out this time to reference what tragically has become all \ntoo common in America today--the loss of a beautiful person and the \nrepercussion of that loss on the family of Coleman and Jean Harris. I \nmust tell you, I did not know Ann, but I do know Coleman and Jean, the \nparents of Ann. I watched as the community around where Senator \nKempthorne and I live mourned the loss of this beautiful young girl and \nfelt the tragedy of it all.\n  I don't know what we do about crime in America today. The statistics \nthis morning were, as I drove in from the Mount Vernon area to our \nNation's Capital, that the number of violent crimes is down in America. \nThat is always positive and it is always good. When Ann left home here \nin northern Virginia to go to Tacoma, WA, with her friends to see \nfriends, she did not expect to be treated violently or to become \ninvolved in a violent episode, because the perpetrator of the incident \nthat killed Ann Harris broke the law.\n  So is the answer today adding more laws to the books? It really \ndoesn't seem to be. What Coleman and Jean Harris are doing today may \nwell be a piece of an answer that allows citizens of this country not \nonly to express themselves, but to recognize that this is a people \nproblem that we are dealing with today, that it is a societal problem \nin our country, that stacking laws upon laws that people refuse to live \nby, if they decide to constantly be a breaker of the law, doesn't solve \nthe problem.\n  Now, when I came to work yesterday morning, I was involved in the \nstandard traffic gridlock that oftentimes we become involved in in this \nimmediate metropolitan area. There were times when my temper flared and \nI thought, why should this happen? Yet, I calmed myself and relaxed as \nmuch as I could to cope, so that I would not misjudge or cause a bad \naction. Certainly that kind of reaction, or whatever may have caused a \nreaction that caused the death of Ann Harris, is something that I think \nwe all need to deal with. Thank goodness, the parents of this beautiful \ngirl have said, ``We are going to do something about it. In the name of \nAnn Harris, Ann's Campaign, we are going to do something about it.''\n  They have not approached Senator Kempthorne and me and said we want \nmore laws. What they have said is, ``We want a campaign nationwide that \nrecognizes that if you smile more and care more and you love more and \nyou have more understanding and you bring back to the culture of this \nsociety\n\n[[Page S11003]]\n\nsome of those underpinnings that kept us whole and kept a human \nrelationship going for so long that seems to have broken down, that may \nhave caused the death of Ann Harris, and certainly does cause deaths \naround the country in drive-by shootings and those kinds of things that \njust seem to be baseless types of crimes, that our society can, by \nthese actions and by this action of the Harrises, become a better and a \nsafer place to live. That is what we must all dedicate a part of our \ntime to.\n  Dirk Kempthorne and I are lawmakers, and we could probably pass \nanother law. Certainly, in the passion and emotion of these kinds of \nincidents happening, all of us want to reach out and do something about \nit and do it quickly. Well, this Senate and this Congress, for the last \ndecade, has passed a lot of laws that deals with violent actions of our \ncitizens. Yet, somehow we are told by sociologists today that we must \nprepare ourselves for a very violent generation of juveniles. While \nadult crime goes down, as I referenced, juvenile crime seems to go up. \nI suspect that when society as a whole does what Coleman and Jean \nHarris are now doing on behalf of the beautiful daughter they lost, and \nmore and more citizens speak up and become involved, and our \ncommunities and our churches and all of the institutions of our society \nbind together in intolerance of this kind of activity, that we will \nonce again become a safer place to live.\n  So let me thank my colleague again for this time and this \nrecognition. We must continue to use any pulpit we can to speak out, \nand certainly the Harrises have. They have every reason to. I applaud \nthem for their action and want to be a part of it where I can be as I \nask other citizens to in the name of Ann and Ann's Campaign so that we \ncan all smile a little more in a less violent society.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nvery thoughtful comments that he made this morning and for the \nsincerity by which I know he has delivered them.\n  I now, with a great deal of honor, yield to the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Murray, for her comments as well.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I stand with my colleagues from Idaho today out of \nanger, sadness, and commitment. A beautiful young woman, Ann Harris, \nwas murdered in my State of Washington. She was murdered by a young man \nin a random act of violence as she rode in a car with her friends \nthrough a Tacoma neighborhood.\n  Her death is an outrage. We all should be furious. But the saddest \ncomment is that to so many young people, Ann is simply another \nstatistic. To too many she's just ``another homicide.'' A 17-year-old \ngirl is murdered by a young college football player. Our eyes just \nglaze at the headline and move on.\n  This time, her parents, her friends, my colleagues and I, and many \nindividuals and organizations across America are not going to let her \nmurder be only a small blip on the television screen. We will not \nforget her--or any of the other hundreds of children and young people \nmurdered each year.\n  Her parents, Coleman and Jean, have organized ``Ann's Campaign for a \nSafer America.'' Even in their tragic loss and profound grief, they \npledged to themselves and their lost daughter that they would work to \nstop violence and stop our national indifference to it. Ann's \nCampaign's focus will be to encourage, motivate, educate, and help \nyouth and adults alike to live the life Ann radiated--a life that said \nevery day and in every way: smile more, care more, love more, and be \nmore understanding. They will help us all focus on the good and learn \nto stop violence.\n  Mr. President, this is not about guns. This is about an attitude \namong too many young people ``on the street'' that violence is an \nacceptable alternative. We adults, we Members of Congress, must send \nthe message to our kids and young adults that when someone is killed it \nwill not pass by unnoticed. As adults we must let them know killing and \nmaiming is appalling--and totally unacceptable.\n  To too many of them it is a quick news piece and it's gone. To too \nmany of them it is ``just another funeral.'' But to parents and family \nand friends it is a light gone out, a hope not realized, a life not \nfulfilled.\n   Mr. President, there is hope that we can make a change in the apathy \nof our young people. In addition to Ann's parents, a friend of mine \nfrom Mercer Island, Pam Eakes, formed an organization called Mothers \nAgainst Violence in America.\n  After hearing about one too many children who lost their lives to \nviolence, she resolved to make a difference, to make kids think about \ntheir actions, to teach them empathy, to teach them nonviolence.\n  Mothers Against Violence also supports families of victims. There is \nnothing worse than a parent's loss of a child. They feel helpless, and \noften guilty, like they somehow are to blame for not giving their child \nfull protection from all danger. They are innocent victims, too, and \ndesperately need the support that only others who have suffered their \nloss can give.\n  I want to again offer my sincere condolences to Ann's parents. They \nare so brave to wage this war against apathy and indifference and for \nlove and caring and understanding. Every time they discuss these \nissues, their own wounds are opened. I thank them and I thank Pam Eakes \nand a member of my staff, Mary Glenn, and all of the mothers and \nfathers who have taken their grief and have woven it into a mission to \nchange the world.\n  Mr. President, they cannot fight alone. We all must get involved and \nteach our children--and each other--that violence is unacceptable. We \ncan make a difference by joining organizations like Mothers Against \nViolence or Ann's Campaign and working with them to teach and support. \nAnd we can start organizations across America to save our children from \nviolence.\n  Young people can no longer believe that an angry action of one moment \nis only that. It is not just an action. It is murder. It is wrong and \nit will be punished. It is time to stop the violence.\n  I know that I will continue my personal fight against violence in \nAmerica. And I urge all of our colleagues to join us in this campaign.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in listening to the Senator from \nWashington, we hear not only an effective Senator speak but we also \nhear a mother speak. I know of the beautiful children she has.\n  I commend all of the Senators who have spoken on this issue this \nmorning.\n  Carved in granite behind me are words ``In God We Trust.''\n  Today, I just say thank God for Ann Harris. I can think of no finer \ntribute than for us here on the floor of the U.S. Senate to officially \nacknowledge Ann's Campaign as it goes nationwide because this lovely \nlady's life is going to continue to do wonderful things for this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ann \nHarris and her memory.\n  The Harris family, who I have known for over 20 years, recently \nsuffered the loss of their 17-year-old daughter, Ann. She was the \ninnocent victim of a drive-by shooting.\n  It is a gross understatement to say that that moment changed their \nlives forever, but it certainly did exactly that. Confronted with such \nan atrocity, many people would have used the occasion to question the \nexistence of evil in our society and to ask why such a horrible event \ncould have happened to such an innocent person, and to simply ask the \nquestion of ``Why? Why? Why? Why has our society become so crime-\nridden? Why was such an innocent girl's life taken? Why Ann's life?''\n  Members have a picture of Ann at their desk. This is Ann's Campaign \nwhich they have launched.\n  When their daughter was shot, the Harris family had an occasion to \nask just those same questions that I asked, but they did not ask just \nthose questions. They went further and asked the deeper questions.\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\n  They realized that by turning this extraordinary incident, \nextraordinarily terrible incident--and also by us changing our ordinary \nincidents--events in our lives into true occasions of loving and of \nserving God, our communities, and one another, that we begin to change \nsociety, not to mention ourselves, for the better. And more \nimportantly, we change them in a way that mitigates against the evil \ninfluences that have come to dominate many aspects of this culture.\n  The Harris family could have used the horrors of this world as an \nexcuse to turn away from God, but, you know, they didn't. Instead, they \nturned to God and asked quietly, asked humbly, not why--but what? \n``What do you want us to do? What can we do to make the world a better \nplace? What can we do to keep the memory of our daughter alive?''\n  Out of that question came a wonderful foundation dedicated to \npreserving the memory of the daughter the Harris family lost and to \nfighting the spread of violent crime in our society.\n  Ann's Campaign for a Safer America--that is what this card is--was \nestablished by Jean and Coleman Harris following the brutal death of \ntheir daughter. Ann's Campaign for a Safer America seeks to encourage, \nmotivate, educate, and help youth and adults alike to live the life \nradiated like their daughter did--a life that said every day and in \nevery way: smile more, care more, love more and be more understanding.\n  The Harris family is combating violence by combating the problems \nthat often lead to violence. And I believe Ann's Campaign is a unique \nopportunity to help contribute to the restoration of our culture by \ndirectly combating the influences that denigrate and ultimately \ncompromise our moral worth as a nation.\n  The Harris family has turned a horrible event into an occasion of \nenriching the community and the country. We too can turn the events of \nour lives, the extraordinary, the terrible, and the good, along with \nthe ordinary, into occasions of remembering to help others, to serve \nand to love, and to ask the question: Not why, but what? What? What \nshould I be doing? How should I serve?\n  So I am joined by my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, and several \nothers, in this privilege of highlighting Ann's Campaign that we note \nhere today.\n  I have a tie on as well that has smiling faces of children from \naround the world. That was the Ann Harris who I knew. I even knew her \nwhile her mother was pregnant with her. She had just a delightful smile \nand was a joy of life that was taken brutally.\n  I applaud what the Harris family has done, taking that incident and \nturning it into something of: What can we say to our culture? How can \nwe change? Not ``Why?'' But ``What?'' I applaud what they are doing. I \nask and hope and encourage my colleagues to look at this as a campaign \nthat they can help in as well as other people from around this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last spring, a bright young Fairfax County \nhigh school senior was murdered while visiting friends in Washington \nState.\n  Ann Harris was an honor student, a student leader, a gifted athlete, \nand a member of the Virginia All-State Chorus. Although she didn't live \nto graduate from Mount Vernon High School--where I graduated over 40 \nyears ago--she carried a 3.4-grade point average and had been accepted, \nearly admissions, to Purdue University. Last spring, Ann had a future \nfilled with unlimited possibilities.\n  This fall, as I know her family continued to struggle with their \nloss, many of her friends in Mount Vernon's Class of 1997 left home to \nattend the college of their own choice. But they left home with a \nchilling loss of innocence--the innocence of those who don't know what \nit's like to lose someone you care about to a senseless act of \nviolence.\n  We want our young people to be safe. Safe in our schools. Safe in our \nhomes. Safe on our streets. We want them to live and learn and \ncontribute to our country.\n  Ann's family joins us in the gallery today. Let us take this time to \nrecommit ourselves to working for a safer America for all our children. \nAnn Harris deserved a future limited only by the borders of her dreams. \nAnd her friends deserved the innocence of not knowing someone--when \nyou're l7 years old--who loses their future to a senseless act of \nviolence.\n  I will conclude by commending Ann's family for creating Ann's \nCampaign for a Safer America. This campaign encourages all of us to \nlive life as their daughter would have lived--to ``smile more, care \nmore, love more and understand more.'' As the father of three daughters \nwhose smiles have brightened many rooms, I thank you for your efforts.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized as \nin morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11001-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11004-S11007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today we will be having some conversation \non the floor concerning the global warming treaty. I will make a few \ncomments concerning that in that I am the chairman of the Clean Air \nCommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. We have had \nextensive hearings on this. I will review just very briefly what we \nhave learned from the hearing that we held in our subcommittee in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee insofar as global warming is \nconcerned.\n  In July, the Environmental Committee had a hearing on the global \nclimate change treaty and we heard from five top scientists.\n  The conclusions I found were very interesting, particularly since \nlast night when I watched Administrator Carol Browner talk about the \nscientific evidence that is conclusive concerning global climate \nchange. That is not at all what we found in our hearing. We had five of \nthe top scientists around. While there is a large body of scientific \nresearch, there is much controversy and disagreement in scientific \nfacts being misrepresented by the administration and the press.\n  Four things that we came to a conclusion on were, No. 1, we don't \nknow how much human activity has influenced the climate. One scientist \nbefore our committee said it could be as much as 6 percent.\n  Second, if you look at satellite data, we are not sure if there has \nbeen any global warming. We had a very interesting session that lasted \nmore than an hour with viewing the satellites and what conclusions \ncould come, and there was no conclusive evidence that there has \nactually been any global warming.\n  Three, even if we eliminate all manmade emissions, it may not have a \nnoticeable impact on the environment, and the treaty may only eliminate \nemissions here in the United States and not in the entire world.\n  Four, when asked, all five scientists stated that we would not have \nthe uncertainties understood by this December, when the administration \nplans on making a decision regarding the treaty.\n  Now, we found out yesterday that the President came and made his \nannouncement. It is kind of interesting, Mr. President, because we \npassed a resolution on the floor of the Senate, by 95 to 0, that said \nwe would reject any type of a treaty that came from Kyoto that didn't \ntreat the developing nations the same as the developed nations. So the \nPresident came out with something where he is calling for a binding 30 \npercent reduction in emission levels by the year 2012. He calls this an \nimportant first step, with more reductions to follow.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I can tell \nyou that this is going to have a profound negative affect on our \nability to defend America, as the President stated yesterday that the \nmilitary accounts for 43 percent of the Federal energy use. The Federal \nGovernment cannot reduce by 30 percent or more without significant cuts \nin the military. I think this equates to something like a 3 to 7 times \ngreater cut than the Btu tax of 1993.\n  One of the things that bothered me more than anything else is the \nmoving target that we are dealing with. In March of 1995 in a House \nCommerce Committee hearing, Congressmen Dingell and Schaefer raised \nconcerns that the new targets may not apply to all countries equally, \nand on behalf of\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\nthe administration, Mr. Rafe Pomerance, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nthe State Department said, ``Our goal, Mr. Chairman, is that all \nparties participate in this next round of negotiations. We want to see \nthat all governments participate and help define the post-2000 \nregime.''\n  One month later, the administration signed on to the Berlin Mandate \nto review the commitments made to reduce the greenhouse gases and adopt \ntargets for further reductions. The conference differentiated between \ndeveloped and developing nations. They signed on to this, totally at \nodds and contradicting the commitment made to the Congressmen.\n  In June 1996, Mr. Pomerance stated, ``Are we going to agree to \nlegally binding instrument in Geneva? No way.'' One month later, Under \nSecretary Wirth announced that the United States supported a legally \nbinding emissions target.\n  I want to also say that this has not changed since September 1996. It \nis before the same Commerce Committee. Assistant Secretary of State \nEileen Claussen told Congressman Dingell and the committee that the \nUnited States would not be bound before we have completed the economic \nanalysis and assessments. We have just learned that the \nadministration's efforts to analyze the economic effects has failed. \nThe models they used did not work, and we will not understand the \neffect on our nations's economy certainly before December.\n  The reason I am concerned about this is, there is a very interesting \nparallel between what they are trying to do in the absence of any \nscientific evidence in global climate change, which has a dramatic \ndeteriorating effect on our ability to be competitive on a global basis \nand on the ambient air changes promulgated by this administration. We \nall know that, just about a year ago, Carol Browner came out and \nunilaterally suggested--and now has promulgated--the rule change to \nlower the ambient air standards in both particulate matter and in \nozone. We find that during the various hearings that we have had that \nMary Nichols, who is immediately under Carol Browner, said that the \ncost would be $9 billion to put these standards in--the cost to the \nAmerican people. At the same time, the President's Economic Advisory \nCommittee said it was $60 billion a year. The Reason Foundation \nestimated the costs between $90 billion and $150 billion. This would \ncost the average family of four some $1,700 a year.\n  They talk about the deaths, and Carol Browner reused this yesterday. \nThere would be 60,000 premature deaths. Those deaths were lowered by \nthe EPA last November to 40,000; then in December to 20,000, and in \nApril to 15,000. Then the scientist who discovered the mathematic \nmistake now says it's less than 1,000. In our committee, Mary Nichols \nadmitted these regulations would not save any lives over the next 5 \nyears.\n  I have watched how Carol Browner goes around and makes promises. She \nsays to the mayors of America, ``This isn't going to affect you.'' She \nsays to the farmers, ``This isn't going to affect you.'' She says to \nsmall businesses, ``This won't affect you.'' To some of the parishes in \nLouisiana that were found to be out of attainment, she said, ``This \nisn't going to make you do anything because the problem is for the \nneighboring State of Texas to the west; they are going to have to do \nthis.''\n  So, Mr. President, I only ask the question, why is this obsession \ntaking place in the administration if there is no scientific \njustification on either global warming or ambient air standards? Why \nare they trying to do this in eroding our personal freedoms? I think \nprobably the best way to answer that is to read an article in Forbes \nmagazine, called ``Watch Out For This Woman; The EPA's Carol Browner is \nexploiting health and the environment to build a power base.''\n  If you read this article, Mr. President, it says:\n\n       If science isn't Browner's strong point, political tactics \n     are. Her enemies can only envy the way the EPA uses the \n     courts.\n       . . . For her part, Browner often dismisses as simple male \n     chauvinism any criticism of her hardball tactics.\n       . . . She learned politics working on Gore's Senate staff, \n     where she rose to be his legislative director before heading \n     back to Florida to head the State environmental commission.\n       . . . She is an environmentalist zealot.\n\n  Mr. President, I know my time has expired. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Forbes magazine, Oct. 20, 1997]\n\n                 Carol Browner, Master of Mission Creep\n\n                 (By Pranay Gupte and Bonner R. Cohen)\n\n       As the center of that enormous rent-seeking organization \n     known as the federal government, Washington, D.C. has evolved \n     its own vocabulary. There is, in bureaucratese, an innocent-\n     sounding but insidious phrase: mission creep. Mark it well: \n     Mission creep explains a lot about how big government grows \n     and grows and grows.\n       Mission creep is to a taxpayer-supported organization what \n     new markets are to a business organization. It involves a \n     gradual, sometimes authorized, sometimes not, broadening of a \n     bureaucracy's original mission. It is a way to accrete money \n     and power beyond what Congress originally approved when it \n     funded an agency.\n       Playing mission creep is an old game in Washington. But no \n     one has ever played the game with more skill than Carol M. \n     Browner, Bill Clinton's choice to head the Environmental \n     Protection Agency.\n       From a modest beginning a quarter-century ago, the agency \n     has grown to employ nearly 20,000 people and control an \n     annual budget of $7 billion. But these numbers are a poor \n     measure of the agency's power: Because its regulations have \n     the force of law, the agency can jail people, close factories \n     and override the judgments of local authorities.\n       In its quest for power and money, the agency has imposed \n     many unnecessary costs on American industry, and ultimately \n     on the American people--costs that do more to satisfy \n     bureaucratic zeal than to clean the air or the water.\n       The EPA was established in 1970 by an executive order \n     issued by President Richard M. Nixon. Rachel Carson, a patron \n     saint of the environmental movement, had made a huge impact \n     with her emotional tract, Silent Spring, a few years earlier.\n       The public was right to be alarmed. Industrialization has \n     imposed hidden costs in the form of polluted air, despoiled \n     streams, unsightly dumps and a general degradation of the \n     landscape. Concerns about pollution could, of course, have \n     been dealt with by existing agencies, but that is not the \n     nature of American politics. Politicians must be seen to be \n     doing something dramatic. Creating new agencies makes \n     favorable waves in the media.\n       Nixon created a new agency. Pulled together from a \n     hodgepodge of existing federal programs, the EPA never had a \n     congressional charter that would have defined its regulatory \n     activities. It was simply given the task of carrying out the \n     provisions of what, over time, became 13 environmental \n     statutes, each with its own peculiarities and \n     constituencies.\n       Without perhaps fully comprehending the issues, Nixon made \n     the new EPA the instrument for a tremendous power grab by the \n     federal government. Most environmental problems--chemical \n     spills, groundwater contamination, abandoned dump sites--are \n     purely local in nature. But suddenly they were federal \n     matters. In the name of a greener, cleaner Earth, Washington \n     mightily increased its power to intervene in the daily lives \n     of its citizens. It was a goal so worthy that few people saw \n     the dangers inherent in to. Mission creep had begun.\n       In 1978 then-EPA administrator Douglas Costle cleverly \n     shifted the focus of the agency. Henceforth the EPA would \n     protect not just the environment but your health. ``Costle \n     became determined to convince the public that [the] EPA was \n     first and foremost a public health agency, not a guardian of \n     bugs and bunnies,'' wrote Mark K. Landry, Marc J. Roberts and \n     Stephen R. Thomas in their book, The Environmental Protection \n     Agency: Asking the Wrong Questions from Nixon to Clinton.\n       People do care about forests and wildlife, but they care \n     much more about themselves and their families. There is a \n     strong strain of hypochondria in the American people, and \n     nothing grabs our attention faster than an alleged threat to \n     our health. If the alleged threat involves cancer, it is \n     almost guaranteed to make the six o'clock news. Costle \n     shrewdly exploited cancerphobia to expand his agency's reach \n     and to wring money from Congress. He launched the EPA on a \n     cancer hunt, looking for carcinogens in foods and air and \n     water, even in the showers we take.\n       Carcinogens, of course, abound in nature, ordinary sunlight \n     being one of the most prevalent. So it is with many man-made \n     substances. The exposure to background levels of these \n     carcinogens is so minimal in most cases as to pose no serious \n     threat in the over whelming majority of cases. Never mind: \n     EPA scientists, following the agency's cancer-risk \n     guidelines, were soon ignoring the age-old admonition that \n     the ``dose makes the poison.'' If it was man-made and carried \n     carcinogens, the EPA would root it out. As one EPA scientist \n     explained it to Forbes: ``At EPA, we're not paid not to find \n     risks.''\n       Under the mantra of ``one fiber can kill,'' the EPA in the \n     1980s mounted a costly and probably self-defeating nationwide \n     effort to rip asbestos out of schools. Simply sealing the \n     substance would have kept the fibers away from kids at a \n     fraction of the cost. But it would not have yielded the same \n     harvest in headlines.\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\n       Even more than her predecessors--and possessing much \n     greater resources--Carol Browner presents herself as the \n     great family physician. ``There isn't a decision I make on \n     any given day that's not related to the health of the \n     American people.'' she tells Forbes. Browner, it's worth \n     noting, is a lawyer with no medical training.\n       After all, she reminds us, she's the mom of a young boy. \n     Attendees of Capitol Hill hearings snicker at her constant \n     references to her son, Zachary, when she testifies on \n     environmental issues. But she never misses a chance to repeat \n     the message. ``If we can focus on protecting the children . . \n     . we will be protecting the population at large, which is \n     obviously our job,'' she tells Forbes.\n       Who said that was her job? Nobody, but that's what mission \n     creep is all about.\n       Last September Browner announced the release of a new EPA \n     report setting forth a broad national agenda to protect \n     children from environmental risks. She followed up the report \n     with the creation earlier this year of the Office of \n     Children's Health Protection at EPA.\n       There was no congressional mandate, but Congress meekly \n     went along by failing to challenge the agency's justification \n     of the program. Who would want to face reelection accused of \n     being callous toward children? Especially when the EPA's kept \n     researchers stand by ready to produce scare studies on EPA \n     money (see box, p. 172).\n       Where most agency chiefs tremble at criticism from \n     Congress, Browner has a platform from which she can \n     counterattack. An EPA-funded newsletter was recently \n     distributed by the National Parents Teachers Association. At \n     the time an internal EPA memo noted: ``The PTA could become a \n     major ally for the Agency in preventing Congress from \n     slashing our budget.'' Thus does Browner's EPA use taxpayer \n     money to fight efforts to trim the federal budget.\n       On Mar. 15, 1995 David Lewis, an EPA scientist attached to \n     the agency's laboratory in Athens, Ga., was told by his \n     supervisor that EPA employees with connections to members of \n     Congress should use their influence to sway lawmakers against \n     a bill proposed by Representative Clifford Stearns (R-Fla.)--\n     if it could be done ``without getting into trouble.'' \n     Stearns' bill would have reduced funding for EPA. The \n     scientist later said in a deposition: ``We were being asked \n     to do this during government business hours, and the purpose \n     was to protect EPA funding levels.'' This request on the part \n     of high-level EPA officials to lobby Congress on government \n     time is under investigation by the House Government Reform \n     and Oversight Committee.\n       Had this been a Republican administration and had the \n     department involved been other than the EPA, one can imagine \n     the outcry in the media.\n       Asked about the growing criticism of her tactics, Browner \n     blatantly ducks the question with: ``This isn't about me. It \n     never has been about me. It's about the air being cleaner. Is \n     the water going to be safer? It's about business going to be \n     able to find a better solution to our environmental \n     problems.''\n       It's really about politics. When supportive lawmakers ask \n     to borrow EPA experts for their staffs, the EPA hastens to \n     comply. Requests from liberal Democrats almost always are \n     filled, those from Republicans rarely. A request by \n     Representative Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) for an EPA detailee \n     was rejected on Jan. 2, 1997 on the grounds that ``new \n     procedures'' were being written. Less than four weeks later \n     (Jan. 28), a similar request from liberal Democrat \n     Representative Charles Rangel of New York was approved, \n     without reference to any ``new procedures.''\n       Since 1995 her office has approved all requests for \n     employee details to four Democratic lawmakers--Senator Frank \n     Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), Senator \n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Rangel. Of the four GOP \n     requests, three were rejected.\n       Browner was at her politically impressive best in this \n     summer's debate over the EPA's tougher clean air standards. \n     Because air quality levels have improved markedly since \n     passage of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, it was \n     widely hoped--especially in areas that badly need new jobs--\n     that the standards would not be further tightened. The EPA's \n     own data showed that levels of the particulates have dropped \n     dramatically over the past decade. Many local governments, \n     anxious for jobs and economic development, were looking \n     forward to being removed from the list of so-called \n     nonattainment areas for ozone and particulate matter, or PM.\n       In July the EPA finalized new tighter standards for ozone \n     and PM. For communities that had made expensive efforts to \n     comply with the current law, the higher standards were like a \n     baseball player, having rounded third base and heading toward \n     home, being told he had to circle the bases again to score.\n       A good many congresspeople were outraged. Browner's \n     insistence on imposing the new standards in the face of \n     nothing more than scanty scientific evidence unleashed howls \n     of protest from elected officials in the affected \n     communities.\n       Legally, Browner was probably in the right. In its haste to \n     seem to be attending to the environment, Congress failed to \n     exert control over EPA standards and regulations.\n       There was nonetheless quite a donnybrook, with veteran \n     Democrat John Dingell of Michigan leading the charge against \n     Browner. A lot of jobs were at stake in Michigan, still \n     headquarters of the U.S. auto industry. Congress, he \n     insisted, should be consulted. Dingell was not alone.\n       With lots of support from Vice President Al Gore's office, \n     Browner went to work putting down the congressional revolt. \n     Her testimony before Congress was, by general agreement, \n     brilliant, though her facts were often shaky.\n       Until then, Bill Clinton had remained on the sidelines. But \n     Browner maneuvered the President into a corner, where he \n     faced the politically embarrassing choice of supporting her \n     controversial initiatives or disavowing his outspoken EPA \n     administrator. Clinton then got to the head of the parade by \n     declaring his support for Browner. The game was over. Browner \n     1, Congress 0.\n       If EPA's new standards survive congressional and legal \n     challenges, state and local governments will have to devise \n     elaborate State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, detailing \n     their strategies for complying with the agency's latest \n     regulatory diktat. And in accordance with the Clean Air Act, \n     it will be up to the EPA to approve or disapprove the SIPs. \n     The estimated cost of compliance with the new standards for \n     the Chicago area alone is projected to be between $3 billion \n     and $7 billion.\n       ``I wish we never had that fight with Congress,'' she tells \n     Forbes. ``I wish it could have been avoided. I think it came \n     at great expense to the country. I think it was very \n     unfortunate.'' Note the implication: The way it could have \n     been avoided was for Congress to avoid challenging her.\n       You can admire Browner's skill and still be appalled by \n     what she is doing. ``This is by far the most politicized EPA \n     I've seen in my three decades of working in state \n     governments,'' says Russell J. Harding, director of \n     Michigan's Depatment of Environmental Quality. ``It is an \n     agency driven more by sound bites than by sound science.''\n       Says Barry McBee, chairman of the Texas Natural Resource \n     Conservation Commission: ``EPA continues to embody an \n     outdated attitude that Washington knows best, that only \n     Washington has the capability to protect our environment. \n     States are closer to the people they protect and closer to \n     the resources and can do a better job today.''\n       As a weapon to humble the state regulatory bodies, Carol \n     Browner's EPA has embraced the politically correct concept of \n     ``environmental justice.'' This broadens EPA's mandates even \n     beyond protection of everyone's health.\n       In early 1993 Browner set up the Office of Environmental \n     Justice within EPA which, among other things, passes out \n     taxpayer-funded grants for studying the effects of industrial \n     pollutants on poorer, mostly black, communities. In 1994 the \n     White House supported this initiative by ordering federal \n     agencies to consider the health and environmental effects of \n     their decisions on minority and low-income communities.\n       That's the rhetoric. The reality is that the federal \n     agencies have a new weapon for overruling state agencies. \n     Browner's EPA recently delayed the approval of a $700 million \n     polyvinyl chloride plant to be built by Japanese-owned \n     Shintech in the predominantly black southern Louisiana town \n     of Convent. Louisiana's Department of Environmental Quality \n     had already given the go-ahead; the plant would have created \n     good-paying jobs and opportunities in an area suffering from \n     60% unemployment and low incomes. But the EPA argued that \n     blacks would suffer disproportionately from potentially \n     cancer-causing emissions of the plant in an area already \n     lined with chemical factories of all descriptions.\n       Louisiana Economic Development Director Kevin Reilly was \n     enraged. ``It is demeaning and despicable for these people to \n     play the race card,'' he says, pointing out that poor people \n     and blacks would have gained economically and were at little \n     health risk. The scientific evidence bears Reilly out: A \n     recent article in the Journal of the Louisiana Medical \n     Society found that cancer incidence in the area is in most \n     cases no higher than nationally.\n       But never mind the facts: This kind of decision has less to \n     do with science than with power politics. It delivers the \n     message: Don't mess with the EPA. ``Carol Browner is the best \n     hardball player in the Clinton Administration,'' says Steven \n     J. Milloy, executive director of The Advancement of Sound \n     Science Coalition in Washington, a longtime critic of EPA who \n     acknowledges receiving funding from industry. ``She has the \n     105th Congress completely intimated by her debating skills \n     and her sheer grasp of facts, however questionable. She eats \n     their lunch.''\n       Like many Clintonites, Browner takes her own good time \n     about responding to congressional requests for EPA documents. \n     When word got out that EPA was developing a series of \n     proposals for reducing U.S. emissions of man-made greenhouse \n     gases, the House Commerce Committee asked for a copy. The EPA \n     ignored the request for two years.\n       When the proposals were leaked to the committee late last \n     week, it was immediately clear why EPA had stiffed Congress. \n     The document was loaded with proposals for raising taxes to \n     pay for new EPA initiatives. Produced in the agency's Office \n     of Policy, Planning & Evaluation and dated May 31, 1994, \n     EPA's ``Climate Change Action'' recommends a new 50-cent-per-\n     gallon gasoline tax, with an estimated cost to motorists of \n     $47 billion in the year 2000 alone. Seven other tax increases \n     were recommended: a ``greenhouse gas tax,'' a ``carbon \n     tax,'' a ``btu tax,'' an ``at-the-source ad-volorem tax'' \n     on the value of the fuel at the source of extraction,\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\n     an ``end-use ad valorem tax'' on the value of the fuel at \n     the point of sale, a ``motor fuels tax'' on the retail \n     price of gasoline and diesel, an ``oil import fee.'' Also \n     recommended: A new federal fee on vehicle emissions tests \n     of $40 per person to ``shift the cost of vehicle \n     inspection from the state to the vehicle owner.''\n       How could they hope to get so many new taxes through a tax-\n     shy Congress? The ``Climate Change Action Plan'' contains \n     repeated references to how each of the above taxes and fees \n     can be imposed under existing laws. Talk about taxation \n     without representation.\n       It's not entirely surprising that Browner and her crew \n     think in terms of government-by-edict. Browner's \n     extraordinary power is in many ways a consequences of \n     Congress' delegation of its lawmaking power to the EPA. It \n     has let the agency micromanage environmental activities \n     throughout the nation with little regard for either local \n     wishes or the cost. This negligence has permitted the agency \n     to ignore scientific data that conflict with agency \n     orthodoxy. The EPA is in many ways becoming a state within \n     the state.\n       ``This is Washington at its worst--out-of-touch bureaucrats \n     churning out red tape with reckless abandon. The EPA hasn't \n     taken into account an ounce of reality,'' says Representative \n     Fred Upton (R-Mich.), a frequent critic, referring to the new \n     clean air rules.\n       If science isn't Browner's strong point, political tactics \n     are. Her enemies can only envy the way the EPA uses the \n     courts. An organization such as the Natural Resources Defense \n     Council will go into federal court and sue to force the EPA \n     to do something. The EPA will wink and, after the courts \n     expand its mandate, see to it that big legal fees go to the \n     NRDC.\n       Mission creep, in short, takes many forms and its \n     practitioners have many ways to plunder the public purse.\n       For her part, Browner often dismisses as simple male \n     chauvinism any criticism of her hardball tactics. ``I think \n     sometimes that it's an issue of men and women,'' she says, \n     coyly.\n       Such cute demagoguery aside, there is no doubting Browner's \n     sincerity. She is an environmentalist zealot. She was clearly \n     behind the decision to tighten the clean air standards to \n     what many people regard as unreasonable levels. If not a \n     tree-hugger she is philosophically close to Al Gore and his \n     quasi-religious environmentalism.\n       After graduating from University of Florida law school, \n     Browner (both of whose parents were college teachers) went to \n     work for a Ralph Nader-affiliated consumer advocate group. \n     There she met her husband, Michael Podhorzer, who still works \n     there.\n       She learned politics working on Gore's Senate staff, where \n     she rose to be his legislative director before heading back \n     to Florida to head the state environmental commission.\n       After the EPA, what's next for this tough and aggressive \n     politician? If Al Gore's presidential hopes aren't dashed by \n     the fund-raising scandals, there's vice presidential slot on \n     the Democratic ticket up for grabs in 2000. A female \n     environmentalist and mother of a young boy would do a lot to \n     bolster Gore's otherwise soggy appeal.\n       In a statement to Forbes, Gore went so far as to try to \n     claim for Browner some of the credit for the current economic \n     prosperity. ``She has helped prove,'' he declares, ``that a \n     healthy environmental and a strong economy are inextricably \n     linked.''\n       If not a vice presidential run, what? Could Browner be \n     nominated by the Clinton Administration to be the next head \n     of the United Nations' environment program? Or would the \n     Administration nominate her as the new U.N. Deputy Secretary \n     General? Either position would give Browner instant \n     international visibility, which couldn't hurt her political \n     prospects in Washington.\n       One way or another, you are going to be hearing a lot more \n     about Carol M. Browner; whenever you do, it's unlikely to be \n     good news for business--and it may not even be good news for \n     the environmental.\n\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United \nStates announced the United States negotiating position on the U.N. \nglobal climate treaty. Some have called the President's position a \ncompromise. I would say that is the case only if you define compromise \nas an action that would have devastating consequences for the United \nStates without any meaningful progress toward the overall goal.\n  This is how an editorial in Investors Business Daily defined the \nPresident's proposal yesterday morning. This doesn't make any sense. \n``Signing a treaty that hobbles U.S. growth getting no environmental \npayoff in return.'' Now, here is what does make sense. ``Listening to \nscience rather than overheated rhetoric and acting on the basis of real \nevents, not computer models.''\n  The President's announcement follows along the same lines of what \nthis administration has been pushing in international circles for \nyears. No matter how he wraps his package, the President is still \ntalking about making the United States, our businesses, our people, \nsubject to legally binding international mandates while letting more \nthan 130 nations off the hook. Most important for this body, the U.S. \nSenate, is how does the administration's position stack up against the \nByrd-Hagel resolution which passed this body in July by a vote of 95 to \nzero? The Clinton administration's position announced yesterday falls \nwoefully short on all counts.\n  The President obviously realizes this since he stated yesterday that \nAmerica cannot wait for the U.S. Senate on this issue. The President \nsaid:\n\n       I want to emphasize that we cannot wait until the treaty is \n     negotiated and ratified to act.\n\n  This flies in the face of the Constitution and the powers it gives to \nthe U.S. Senate to give approval for the ratification of treaties. Why \ndoes the President's proposal fall short? Regarding participation by \nthe developing nations, the Byrd-Hagel resolution states very clearly \nthat no treaty will get the support of the U.S. Senate unless, and I \nread from the Byrd-Hagel resolution, ``* * * unless the protocol or \nagreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties within \nthe same compliance period.''\n  That is very clear. I noted some of my colleagues yesterday, and \nothers, have said what the President proposed yesterday is in full \ncompliance with Byrd-Hagel. I strongly recommend to those colleagues \nwho actually believe that, that they go back and read the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. It is only five pages long. It is not legal. It is very \nclearly understood by everyone.\n  What this means also is that support of the U.S. Senate is contingent \nupon China, Mexico, India, Brazil and the other 130 developing nations \ncommitting to specific limitations on greenhouse gas emissions within \nthe same time period as the United States and the other industrialized \nnations. Anything less, anything less than this, what is clearly \ndefined in the Byrd-Hagel resolution put forward by the U.S. Senate, is \nnot in compliance and it is the U.S. Senate that will have the final \nsay on any treaty signed by the administration in Kyoto, Japan, in \nDecember.\n  At the same time President Clinton was calling for ``meaningful \nparticipation''--those were his words--meaningful participation by the \ndeveloping countries, at the same time he was saying that, this is what \nhis negotiator in Bonn, Germany, Ambassador Mark Hambley, was saying in \na prepared release. ``In our view,'' said Ambassador Hambley, the \nPresident's negotiator in Bonn Germany this week--``In our view, this \nproposal is fully consistent with the Berlin mandate--it imposes no new \nsubstantive commitments on developing countries now. Instead, it calls \nfor such obligations to be developed following the third conference of \nthe parties'' in Kyoto in December.\n\n  I think that is rather clear, what Ambassador Hambley said: That the \nThird World, the developing nations, would not be called upon for any \ncommitments, any obligations in this treaty. It is obvious that this \nadministration has no intention of ensuring that the developing \ncountries have to meet the same obligations as the United States.\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\n  What about the second condition of the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which \nstated the Senate would not ratify a treaty that would cause serious \neconomic harm to the United States? Most of the economic impact studies \nare based exactly on what the President proposed yesterday, in terms of \ntimetables, targets, reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year \n2010, and excluding the developing nations from any binding limitations \nof greenhouse gases. The President's own analysis shows that this will \nrequire a 30-percent cut in projected energy use by the year 2010.\n  So, we are going to cut our energy use, between now and the year \n2010, by 30 percent; at the same time the administration says we don't \nhave an economic analysis to really understand what economic impact \nthis might have on our economy, on jobs. After a year and a half of the \nadministration promising to me and others in both the House and the \nSenate that they would come forward with an economic model and economic \nanalysis showing that there would be no harm to our economy, they have \nnow said: Well, economic models don't mean anything. But we are going \nto surge forward and sign that treaty having no understanding \nwhatsoever of what it might do to our economy, to jobs.\n  I have seen studies, I have seen economic models and analyses done by \nthe AFL-CIO, done by independent economists, done by business, done by \nindustry, done by the agriculture industry, farmers, ranchers. The \nresults are not good. Here is what these studies have shown: Job losses \nin the millions for this country, lower economic growth in this country \nmeaning a lower standard of living and less opportunities for all \nAmericans, energy rationing. What the Clinton administration is talking \nabout is the rationing of energy use in the United States.\n  Remember the gas lines the last time this country rationed energy use \nin the 1970's? I remember them very well. Energy taxes--I know the \nadministration has said we don't think this is going to require any \ntaxes. We are not sure, but we will kind of get going, sign that treaty \nand bind the United States to these commitments, and allow an \ninternational body to enforce and police and administer it. Maybe we \nwill need more taxes, who knows, they say.\n  In an October 4 article in the Washington Times an unnamed Clinton \nadministration official said that the President's proposal would raise \nenergy taxes up to five times greater than the Btu tax the Clinton \nadministration proposed back in 1993. That is devastating. That is \ndevastating. Much of the State that I represent, Nebraska, is \nagricultural. Agriculture is an energy-intensive industry. When you \nstart talking about raising taxes on energy five times greater than \nwhat President Clinton proposed in 1993, that will put literally \nthousands of farmers and ranchers and agricultural interests out of \nbusiness. What I find incredible about this is at the same time the \nPresident is asking for fast-track legislation because we are trying to \ndo something about our deficit of payments, deficit in the balance of \npayments to China, to Japan, all the other areas of trade we are trying \nto pursue, what this would do is go the other way, make our products \nless competitive because they would cost more. Higher prices for all \ngoods because of higher energy costs mean American goods cost more \nworldwide, making American products and services less competitive in \nthe world market. And when you are allowing China and Mexico and Brazil \nand India, South Korea, and 130 other nations not to legally bind \nthemselves to this, what do you think happens in the world marketplace? \nOur products cost more, our services cost more, and these other \nnations' economies will thrive as their products cost less. Does that \nput us in a stronger competitive position worldwide? I don't think so.\n\n  The real question is, for what? Why are we doing this? Why are we \ndoing this? The nations that would be excluded, the over 130 nations \nthat would be excluded from this treaty are the nations that will be \nresponsible for 60 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions \nwithin the next 20 years. Not the United States, the nations that we \nare not asking to bind themselves to this treaty.\n  China, which has said very forcefully that it will never agree to \nlegally binding emission limits, will be the largest emitter of \ngreenhouse gases by the year 2015. By 2025, China will surpass the \nUnited States, Japan and Canada combined, as the greatest emitter of \ngreenhouse gases in the world. Yet we are not asking them to sign up to \nany legally binding mandate to do something about their greenhouse gas \nemissions. So how can any treaty that exempts these 134 nations be at \nall effective in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions? It will not. \nThis is folly. This is feel-good folly. It makes great press, but it is \ninsane that we would bind our Nation to this kind of folly and allow \nthese other nations to go untouched.\n  What President Clinton proposed yesterday is for the American people \nto bear the cost and suffer the pain of a treaty that will not work. \nThat is the legacy, or more appropriately the lunacy he would leave to \nthe children of America. I have always said that this debate is not \nabout who is for or against the environment. That is not the debate. We \nare all concerned about the environment. We are concerned about the \nenvironment we leave to our children and our grandchildren, our future \ngenerations. But let's use some common sense here. Let's use some \nAmerican common sense.\n  Mr. President, in its present form, this treaty will not win Senate \napproval. We can do better. We must do better. Our future generations \nare counting on us to do better. Let's bring some balance, some \nperspective and some common sense to this issue and do it right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the Senator from \nNebraska, this morning to speak out against the proposal that our \nPresident yesterday announced to the Nation and to the world as it \nrelates to this country's concept of how the world ought to be when it \ncomes to the issue of global warming.\n  But first let me thank the Senator from Nebraska for the leadership \nrole he is taking on behalf of a very large bipartisan coalition of \nSenators in bringing clarity to this issue and demonstrating what is a \nclear opposing point of view, an opposing point of view based on \nscience, an opposing point of view based on economics and an opposing \npoint of view based on one of the largest coalition-building efforts I \nhave witnessed, at least in my public life, between labor and business \nand public officials in this country.\n  The Senator spoke out very clearly this morning on the discrepancy as \nit relates to what our President announced yesterday compared to what \nthe Hagel-Byrd resolution that was adopted by the Senate some months \nago spoke to. That was, if we are to enter an agreement, that agreement \nmust be, by its definition, a world agreement, that all parties \ninvolved, that is, all nations of the world, must come together in \nrecognition of what may or may not be an environmental problem.\n  I am disappointed that the President of the United States, clearly \nrecognizing the constitutional obligation of this body, chose largely, \nyesterday, in his proposal, to ignore us. While he gave us lip service \nand while his spokespeople have given us lip service over the last \nseveral months since the almost unanimous adoption of the Hagel-Byrd \nresolution, I must tell you that what our President laid down for his \nnegotiators in Bonn yesterday is not reflective of what he has been \nsaying or what his people have been saying.\n  To the parliamentarians of the world, it is important that you \nunderstand that we are not a parliament and the President is not a \nprime minister. He does not speak for the majority of the U.S. \nCongress. He speaks for himself and for what I believe to be a narrow \ninterest of people whose agendas take them well beyond just the concept \nof a better environment, but to a desire to do some industrial or \neconomic planning nationwide, if not universally, all without any \nreliance whatsoever on the good judgment of the American consumer and/\nor the free market that this country has relied on since its very \nbeginning.\n  ``Serious harm,'' those are important words. Those are words that the \nHagel-\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\nByrd resolution spoke to, ``serious harm to the U.S. economy.'' \nImportant words, simple words, easy to understand, a relatively small \nmeasurement and threshold to be understood by anyone negotiating a \ntreaty that, in the long term, might bind this country in an \ninternational obligation.\n  We will not, nor should we, seriously harm our citizens, the economy \nin which they live, and the opportunities for which they strive. And \nyet, the President, we believe, ignored that and talked about the need \nfor catastrophic emissions reductions by the year 2012. Mr. President, \n2012. A long time off? No, not really; clearly within my lifetime, \nclearly within everybody's reasonable imagination, and something that \nif you are to accomplish a 30-percent reduction of fossil fuel \nemissions off from the current path, then you must start now in \nsignificant ways to change that and alter it. It is something that you \ndo not wait until you get out to 2008 and then you say, ``Oh, my \ngoodness.'' Because if we are to be responsible in relation to a \nnegotiated treaty, a ``binding'' relationship by that point would draw \nus into a situation that we could not meet, or, if we chose to meet it, \nwe would truly handicap the economy of this country.\n\n  This Senator will not vote to make our country and its citizens \nsecond class to the rest of the world. I cannot nor will I do that nor \ndo I believe any Senator in this body will knowingly vote in that way. \nYet, the President is proposing that we allow 130 economies, 130 \nnations of the world, be exempt, to be able to do anything they choose \nwhile we would choose to restrict and control ourselves.\n  Mr. President, we are a nation today that is proud of its \nenvironmental legacy. We have moved faster and more directly in the \nlast two decades to improve the environment in which our citizens live \nthan any other nation of the world, and we have paid a big price for \nit. But we have been willing to pay it. We have been willing to pay it \nand able to pay it because we are a rich nation. Rich nations move to \ndo things to clean up their environment. Poor nations simply cannot \nafford to. They are too busy trying to feed themselves, clothe \nthemselves and put shelters over the heads of their citizens. All of \nthose items in this country are secondary considerations because we \ntake them for granted, because we are rich, and we are rich because of \na free-market system unfettered by Government rule and regulation and, \nin my opinion, by the silly politics that this administration \nperpetrates today on faulty science or certainly a lack of science or a \nknowledge of what all of this means.\n  I have to say, in all fairness, the President gave some reasonable \nsuggestions for conservation, and there is no question we ought to \ncreate the kind of incentives within our economy that move our \ncitizens, and the economy that drives us, toward conservation. That is \nfair and that is reasonable, and we could assume a better world with \nall of that in mind.\n  But the thing that frustrates me most is that there is emerging out \nof all of the current negotiations a reminder that the developing world \nis saying something to us that is most significant, and I am not sure \nthat our President is listening at this moment. They are, in essence, \nsaying, and when they laid down their position on the table in Bonn on \nOctober 22, that developing countries are demanding reductions of 35 \npercent below 1990 levels of emissions and that fines be assessed \nagainst the United States and the other developed nations if those \ntargets are missed. They want global warming gas reductions, but guess \nwho is supposed to pay for it? Not the consumers of the developing \nworld, but us rich Americans. Rich Americans are supposed to pay for \nany economic inconvenience the developing world would encounter because \nwe are foolish enough to agree to impose these kinds of reduction \ntargets on ourselves.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President, I don't buy that, the American consumer is \nnot about to buy it, nor do I believe the U.S. Senate will.\n  So in 10 to 14 years, at about the time that the baby boomers are \nretiring and our Social Security system is challenged, at about the \ntime when we are once again going to have to make tough decisions in \nthis country about our social character and the economics that drive \nour social well-being, the President yesterday said we are going to lay \nyet a bigger burden on the economy; we are going to say that you are \ngoing to have to be at a certain level of emissions reductions and, if \nnot, we are going to take drastic measures to drive up the cost of \nenergy, to drive down the amount of consumption, and that's what we are \nprepared to do based on faulty science and interesting politics.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that what you have proposed to the world \nand to the Nation and to this Congress is unacceptable. It certainly \nappears to be unacceptable at this moment to the U.S. Senate and to all \nwho have spent any time studying the critical issue of global warming.\n  While this Nation will continue to strive for a cleaner world--and it \nshould--and a cleaner nation and will be reasonable and responsible \nplayers, we expect the rest of the world to do the same. But we can \nalso understand that where a nation tries to feed itself and clothe \nitself and cause its citizens, by the economy in which they live, to \nrise to a higher standard of living, we understand that we have had \nthat privilege and opportunity over the years and we should not \nrestrict nor should we cause them to achieve anything less.\n\n  Our technology can assist, and we need to be there to help. But I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that binding obligations, no matter how far out \nyou push them to allegedly conform with what our country believes ought \nto be done, simply do not work. This proposal won't work. I agree with \nmy colleague from Nebraska, this Senate, in my opinion, will not concur \nin this, will not agree to the kind of treaty that our President and \nhis associates are attempting to cause the rest of the world to agree \nto.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that you understand and I hope the world \nunderstands that this Senate, the Senate responsible for the \nratification of these kinds of agreements, will, at this time, not \nratify what you are proposing.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues for just a few \nmoments with respect to the question that we are addressing this \nmorning, that question of global warming, but more particularly the \nspecifics with respect to it.\n  I am sure you already heard, but let me say again, there was a \nmeasure adopted by this Senate 95-0 that expressed two main points: \nOne, the United States should not be signatory to any treaty that would \n``result in serious harm to the U.S. economy.'' And, No. 2, that \nmandates developing countries to have specific scheduled commitments to \nlimit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the same compliance \nperiod.\n  So we have been working at this for some time. We have had several \nhearings in our Committee on the Environment and Public Works and also \nin Energy. We have had representatives of the administration there. \nThis goes clear back to Rio, I think, in 1992. It goes back more \nspecifically now to Geneva about a year ago, in which promises were \napparently made at that meeting with respect to what the United States \nwould do. We called the Assistant Secretary to our committee to talk \nabout that. He indicated, no, that wasn't true, there were no \ncommitments made. In fact, I think there were.\n  Now we move on to the meeting in Bonn, which will go on almost \nimmediately, and then the Kyoto meeting to take place something over a \nmonth from now.\n  So this is the result of a good long time in planning and a good long \ntime in difficulty in trying to bring together the issues as they \nrelate to developed countries, as they relate to developing countries.\n  The President has finally made somewhat of an understandable \nstatement. We have not had that before.\n\n  Just 2 weeks ago we had another hearing in our committee, brought the \nAssistant Secretary on Global Affairs to talk to us, asked specific \nquestions about what they had in mind without any specific answers. \nThere was no response from the administration's witness.\n  So now the President has come forth with statements. That is good. We \nshould have had them some time before, statements which he indicates--\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\nand I quote--``Would be painless and even economically beneficial.'' Of \ncourse that is what he would say. Many people disagree with that, \nincluding myself. I cannot imagine that whatever we do that is \nmeaningful is going to ``be painless and economically beneficial.'' But \nspecifically, of course we have not had time to analyze the full thing.\n  It talks about reaching 1990 levels by the year 2010, emission levels \nthat occurred in 1990, reaching back to those by 2010, with some cap by \n2008. And then to move below the 1990 levels by 2020. He calls that a \nfairly modest proposal.\n  Interesting how often these things are set out. I think if you go \nback, you find that the air quality statutes were given a great deal of \ntime before implementation, so the argument was, ``Don't worry, don't \nworry about some regulation. Don't worry about the cost because it's \nway out in the future.'' I do not think that is a good recommendation.\n  We should worry about what the impacts are on the economy, what the \nimpacts are on costs, what the impacts are on our ability to compete in \nthe world and worry about them regardless of the fact that they are out \nthere.\n  China, on the other hand, and some of the other countries that are \ndeveloping countries, ask for a 15 percent reduction from the 1990 \nlevels by 2010, a 7.5 percent reduction by 2025, 7.5 below 1990. \nRemember, the President said we will not reach 1990 until 2010. The \nChinese and their group also want a 35 percent reduction from 1990 \nlevels by the year 2020.\n  The problem, of course, is, as we go into this negotiation--and those \nwho are involved say, ``Well, they've set the parameters, somehow the \nresults will be between these two.'' That is kind of scary. The \nPresident is saying, this is where we are. They are saying, we want to \nbe way up here. And probably they will end up somewhere in between.\n  I go back to the action of the Senate which 95 to nothing said we \nwill not accept a treaty that does the kinds of things that we have \nalready talked about.\n  So, Mr. President, I know this is a difficult problem. But I agree \nwith my friend, the Senator from Idaho. We have done a good job of \nemissions.\n  I have been to China several times, and I can tell you, if you want \nto look forward to where the emissions problems are going to be, it is \ngoing to be there in those developing countries.\n  I think we need to make the changes that we want to have happen in \nour country, encourage others. But I am very concerned about us going \nto this meeting in Kyoto and coming out seeking to agree to the kinds \nof things that have been set forth by the developing countries who wish \nnot to have any containment put on theirs.\n  So we are looking for a fair agreement. We are looking for some kind \nof an arrangement that will allow us to continue to do what we have \ndone and we are proud of doing.\n  I think, Mr. President, that you need to be more specific than you \nhave been with this idea that we want you to do some things, and then \nwe will decide later what the reimbursement is going to be, we will \ndecide later what the incentives are going to be, which I understand is \nwhat the President said yesterday.\n  So I think we need to continue. And I want to say to my friend from \nNebraska that he has done an excellent job of holding hearings, taking \npositions, following this issue, which is one of the most important \nissues to the future of the country. And I commend him for that and \njoin with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the old adage says everybody likes to \ntalk about the weather, but nobody can do anything about it. A \nparticularly strong El Nino has meteorologists predicting strange \nweather this year, so expect lots of people to be talking about the \nweather in the months ahead. But in a new twist, many will claim that \nthere is something we can do about the weather as well.\n  I'm talking about efforts to curb global warming. And if you'll \npardon the pun, this is one of the hottest debates we are likely to see \nover the next year.\n  Is human activity the cause of this particularly strong El Nino, or \nthe warming that some say is underway? Or is this just natural climate \nvariation? Scientists are divided. The prestigious journal Science, in \nits issue of May 16, says that climate experts are a long way from \nproclaiming that human activities are heating up the earth. Indeed, the \nsearch for the human fingerprint in observed warming is far from over \nwith many scientists saying that a clear resolution is at least a \ndecade away. We continue to spend over $2 billion each year on the U.S. \nGlobal Climate Change Research Program for the simple reason that the \nscience is not settled.\n  One thing that scientists can agree on is that the Earth's climate \nhas always changed--the ice core and fossil records bear that out. \nHippos once grazed in European rivers. Sea levels were low enough \nduring periodic ice ages to allow humans to walk from Asia to North \nAmerica. The climate changes. It always has. And it will continue to \nchange regardless of what we do or don't do.\n  Yesterday, the President revealed his negotiating position on a new \nclimate treaty. He has proposed reducing our carbon emissions to 1990 \nlevels between 2008 and 2012. The Department of Energy estimates that \nwe will have to engage in a crash course of research and development, \nplus impose a $50 per ton carbon permit price--or tax--to achieve this \ntarget.\n  Talks are underway at this moment in Bonn, and everyone is preparing \nfor December negotiations in Kyoto, Japan. It is almost certain that \nlegally binding targets and timetables will be a central feature of the \nnew climate treaty expected to emerge in Kyoto--and that these targets \nand timetables will not apply to developing nations. Even if you are a \nproponent of strong action to address increasing concentrations of \natmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases thought to warm \nthe Earth's climate, there are plenty of good reasons to oppose \nselectively applied, legally binding targets and timetables for \ngreenhouse gas reductions as the President has proposed.\n  First, these are really just emissions controls targeted at just a \nfew of the 168 nations that are parties to this treaty. Aside from \nbeing just plain unfair, these new emissions controls will be \ndevastating to large sectors of our economy. They will raise energy \nprices in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe--while \nChina, South Korea, and Mexico are specifically exempted from them.\n  As a consequence, energy-intensive industrial production, capital, \njobs, and emissions will shift from the U.S. to developing nations not \nsubjected to the new controls. What will result from that? According to \na study by the Department of Energy: 20 to 30 percent of the U.S. \nchemical industry could move to developing countries over 15 to 30 \nyears, with 200,000 jobs lost; U.S. steel production could fall 30 \npercent with accompanying job losses of 100,000; All primary aluminum \nplants in the United States could close by 2010; many petroleum \nrefiners in the Northeast and gulf coast could close, and imports would \ndisplace more domestic production.\n  Needless to say, China, South Korea, Mexico, and some of our other \nmost competitive trading partners salivate at the prospect of this \nmonumental shift in capital, production, and jobs.\n  Putting economic and competitive aspects aside for a moment, it's \nimportant to ask the questions: Will these emissions controls applied \nonly to a few nations work? Can they decrease emissions and stabilize \natmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations?\n  The answer is no. Actual global emissions won't decrease--only their \npoint of origin will change. In fact, because our industrial processes \nare more energy efficient than those found in most developing nations, \nglobal carbon emissions per unit of production would actually increase \nunder the administration's approach.\n  In other words, the United States and a few leading industrial \nnations would suffer domestic economic pain, without realizing any \nglobal environmental gain.\n  The U.S. Senate has passed a resolution by a vote of 95 to 0 urging \nthat the new climate treaty avoid legally binding targets and \ntimetables on developed nations unless there are ``new, specific \nscheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \nDeveloping Country Parties within the same compliance period.''\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n  Thus, we have the makings of a train wreck: The developing nations \nwill not participate in a climate treaty that contains legally binding \ntargets and timetables that apply to them. Yet, the U.S. Senate is \nunwilling to ratify a treaty that does not contain new commitments for \ndeveloping countries.\n  There are other practical problems as well. Legally binding targets \nand timetables would be impossible to verify and enforce. For example, \nhow does one measure the methane being produced by a rice paddy or \nlandfill? How do you calculate the carbon dioxide being sequestered by \na forest? While good scientific estimates can be offered, the legally \nbinding nature of the controls might require greater precision. What \nkind of new strict and intrusive international regulatory regime would \nbe needed for enforcement?\n  These are all questions that have not been answered in the rush \ntoward Kyoto. Practically speaking, legally binding targets and \ntimetables won't reduce global emissions. In addition, they present \npotentially insurmountable implementation problems, and would even kill \nthe treaty. Thus, they endanger well meaning efforts to address the \nglobal climate issue.\n  If we want to keep the new treaty from becoming an international \nembarrassment as an environmental initiative, we should reconsider the \nrush to Kyoto and hammer out solutions that can really work.\n  So, you may ask--what can really work? How does one generate large \namounts of carbon-free electricity for a growing economy here at home \nand a developing world abroad? There are two ways in the short term--\nhydropower and nuclear.\n  So what is our official U.S. policy toward hydropower? Domestically, \nwe are studying tearing down a few dams out west. Environmental \ninterests want to tear down, for example, the Glen Canyon Dam on the \nColorado River in Northern Arizona in hopes of ``restoring the natural \nwonder of the once wild Glen Canyon.'' In so doing, we would: Drain \nLake Powell--a 252 square mile lake which guarantees water supplies for \nLos Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas; Eliminate the source of carbon-\nfree electricity for four million consumers in the Southwest; Scuttle a \n$500 million tourist industry and the water recreation area frequented \nby 2.5 million visitors each year.\n  On the international front, we have refused to participate in efforts \nsuch as China's ``Three Gorges Dam,'' a project that will produce \nelectricity equivalent to thirty-six 500 megawatt coal plants.\n  Of course, all this makes no sense if you claim that carbon emissions \nare your preeminent environmental concern.\n  Let's turn to nuclear, which produces 22% of our electricity and \nabout 17% of global electricity. The President says he will veto our \nnuclear waste bill, and that could cause some of our nuclear plants to \nclose prematurely as they run out of space for spent fuel. And we can't \nsell nuclear technology to China, something we hope to change in the \nvery near future.\n  Well, you can't be anti-nuclear, anti-hydropower, and anti-carbon. \nLet's do the math: Coal produces 55% of our electricity, and our coal \nuse is likely to decrease in the face of: A new climate treaty; the \nEPA's new air quality standards on ozone and particulate matter; the \nEPA's tightened air quality standards on oxides of sulphur and \nnitrogen; the EPA's proposed regional haze rule; and the possibility of \na new EPA mercury emissions rule.\n  So if you knock coal out of the picture, what's next? Nuclear is in \nsecond place with 22% of our electrical generation. But as I mentioned, \nthe President has threatened to veto our nuclear waste bill, and we \nhaven't ordered a new nuclear plant since 1975. Moreover, if we can't \nrecover ``stranded costs'' of nuclear power plants in the electricity \nrestructuring effort, you can say goodbye to nuclear.\n  What's next? Hydropower produces 10%. But all of our large hydropower \npotential outside Alaska has been tapped, and as I mentioned earlier, \nthe administration is entertaining notions of tearing down some dams.\n  What's next? Natural Gas produces 10% of electricity generation. Gas \nalso emits carbon, although not as much as coal. So expect gas \ngeneration to increase, demand to rise, prices to increase and \nshortages to result from time to time. Does that sound like a solid \nstrategy on which to gamble our economy?\n  No coal, no nukes, no hydro; that leaves us with 13% of our \ngeneration capacity. What's left? Wind power? I like wind and solar, \nbut you can't count on them all the time. And recently, the Sierra Club \ncame out against wind farms in California, calling them ``cuisinarts \nfor birds.''\n  So the choices are tough, and a dose of realism is badly needed down \nat EPA and the White House. To sum things up, we are negotiating a \ntreaty in Kyoto that is unrealistic, can't be verified, and can't \nachieve the advertised results. If this were an arms control treaty, \nwe'd be guilty of unilateral disarmament if we were to agree to it.\n  We should reconsider this rush to Kyoto and a new treaty. There is no \nreason to join the lemmings in their rush over the cliff. The carbon \nproblem didn't appear overnight. It won't be addressed overnight. We \nhave time to devise and consider balanced approaches that can work. \nTime will allow new energy and efficiency technologies to mature. Time \nwill provide for global solutions that include the developing nations. \nTime will allow us to sharpen our science and better understand the \ntrue threat of climate change, if it is indeed a dangerous threat.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, since the founding of our Republic, we \nhave faced a dilemma as old perhaps as the concept of democracy itself. \nThat is how the Nation is governed: With an informed electorate, but at \nthe same time we can protect the national security by containing \ninformation which might be used against ourselves.\n  This debate has largely, though not exclusively, been settled by the \njudgment that we are best served by informing the people so they can \nmake the proper judgments about choosing the leadership of our country.\n  Indeed, this is the philosophy that gave rise to the first amendment \nto the Constitution, but perhaps more exactly also to article I, \nsection 9, which reads, ``a regular Statement and Account of the \nReceipts and Expenditures of all public money shall be published from \ntime to time.''\n  There has, however, in spite of this general judgment of the need to \ngovern the Nation based on the best possible information to the \nelectorate, and in spite of this rather specific constitutional \nprovision, been a notable and exceptional exception in the Nation's \naccounting.\n  I speak obviously of the Central Intelligence Agency in its half-\ncentury determination to keep its accounting, its expenditures, private \nfrom the people of the United States. And, indeed, during both times of \nnational conflict and in the broad period of the cold war it was a \npolicy with a considerable rationale.\n  The United States faced, in the Soviet Union, an adversary which if \nin possession of our expenditures of the intelligence community would \nlearn a great deal about our national intentions and our capabilities. \nBut now some 7 years after the end of the cold war, there is no longer \na rationale for not sharing with the American people at least the \naggregate amount of spending of the American intelligence community.\n  I do not speak, obviously, of specific requirements for expenditures \nin individual programs or even broad categories of expenditures but \nwhether or not the American people should be informed of the total \naggregate spending since the United States no longer faces an adversary \nwhich, if in possession of that amount of expenditures, could make real \nuse of it.\n  Last Wednesday, George Tenet, the new Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, perhaps because of this changed situation, took a \nvery important step. In response to a Freedom of Information Act \nrequest filed by the Federation of American Scientists, Director Tenet \nended 50 years of what\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\nmay have been unconstitutional secrecy and finally disclosed the \naggregate budget numbers of the U.S. intelligence community.\n  I take the floor today, Mr. President, to applaud President Clinton \nand Director Tenet for taking this first step, but note with some \nconsiderable regret that this judgment was made in response to a \nlawsuit filed against the administration not with the support of this \nCongress and, indeed, in spite of a vote taken in response to an \namendment that I offered on the floor of this Senate.\n  While I applaud Director Tenet, I also speak with regret that while \nthe budget numbers were offered this year, they specifically were not \nmade as a change in permanent policy, therefore, raising the specter \nthat the American people are being provided this information in 1997, \nwith the possibility they may never be given this information again.\n  That perhaps leads to the most cynical interpretation of all, that \nwhat is really feared by the intelligence community is not the sharing \nof this aggregate amount of spending with foreign adversaries, but if \nthe American people have this number they would be able to gauge this \nyear to next, to next, and into the future whether or not the \nintelligence budget of this country is rising or falling, whether it is \ntoo large or too small.\n  What is feared is that the American people will be as engaged in this \ndebate as they are about Social Security spending or health care or \neducation spending or even defense spending, which routinely is a part \nof the American political debate.\n  A 1-year number provides precious little information for public \ndebate about the adequacy or the excessive nature of our spending. \nWhat, of course, is peculiar about this inability to inform the public \nis that defense spending, equally or arguably far more important to \nnational security, is so routinely debated. Perhaps that is the reason \nwhy defense spending in the Nation today, excluding intelligence, is \nnow 4 percent lower than defense spending in 1980, why in real dollar \nterms there has been in the last 7 years such a dramatic reduction in \ndefense expenditures, while according to the Brown report, intelligence \nspending since 1980 in the United States has risen by 80 percent, an \nincrease in spending almost without parallel.\n  It is worth noting as well, Mr. President, that in the bipartisan \nBrown Commission report, the commission could find no systematic basis \nupon which the intelligence budget is even created. In the Commission's \nwords, ``Most intelligence agencies seemed to lack a resource strategy \napart from what is reflected in the President's 6-year budget \nprojection. Indeed, until the intelligence community reforms its budget \nprocess, it is poorly positioned to implement these strategies.''\n  Mr. President, other countries in the democratic family of nations \nhave long recognized the need to include defense and intelligence \npriorities in their national debate over budgetary matters. Indeed, \nAustralia, Britain, and Canada long ago lifted this veil of secrecy. I \nthink, indeed, even the State of Israel, which today faces potentially \nmore serious adversaries at the very heart of their democracy with a \ndaily terrorist threat, long ago decided that its democracy was better \nserved by sharing this information then continuing with the veil of \nsecrecy.\n  So, Mr. President, in this notable year when for the first time the \nAmerican people are given access to this information about intelligence \nspending, the burden now passes to this Congress whether or not we will \nallow this to be a single exception, or indeed we will now take the \nchallenge and make this a permanent change in how we govern the \nnational intelligence community.\n  I close, therefore, Mr. President, with the words of Justice Douglas, \nwho in 1974 wrote in making a judgment about whether or not the budget \nshould be revealed, ``If taxpayers may not ask that rudimentary \nquestion, their sovereignty becomes an empty symbol and a secret \nbureaucracy is allowed to run our affairs.''\n  More than 20 years later, Mr. President, this Senate still faces the \nsame judgment. Director Tenet has met his responsibilities. I am proud \nthat President Clinton allowed him to proceed. Now the question rests \nwith us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11011-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11012-S11013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are preparing to cast a vote on a \ncloture motion in another 10 minutes or so, and I thought it would be \nuseful to take the floor of the Senate and describe not only for our \ncolleagues but for those who watch the proceedings of this body what \nexactly is happening.\n  We are nearing the end of a legislative session. We expect from what \nthe leaders have indicated that the Senate will continue for perhaps \nanother 2\\1/2\\ weeks at the most. We have on the floor of the Senate a \npiece of legislation that we should consider and we should pass. It is \ncalled the ISTEA or the highway reauthorization bill. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Just prior to having this legislation on the floor of the Senate, we \nhad a piece of legislation called campaign finance reform. That is a \npiece of legislation we should pass as well. It is interesting that \nboth pieces of legislation were brought to the floor and tied up with \nropes procedurally so that no one could do anything with either piece \nof legislation.\n  Why? One underlying reason: Because there are some in this Chamber \nwho do not want to allow an up-or-down vote on campaign finance reform. \nThey want to crow about campaign finance reform and how much they \nsupport it. They want to go out and talk about their desire to have \ncampaign finance reform, but they don't want to allow this Chamber an \nopportunity to vote on campaign finance reform.\n  The fact is the American people know better. The American people know \nthis system is broken and ought to be fixed. They know we need campaign \nfinance reform, and they know that the votes exist in the Senate to \npass a campaign finance reform bill. In fact, we have demonstrated on \nprocedural votes there are at least 52, 54, perhaps 55 Senators who \nwill vote for campaign finance reform. But can we get to the vote? No. \nWhy? Because procedurally those who control this Senate have tied ropes \naround both campaign finance reform and now the highway bill in a \nmanner designed to prevent having an uncomfortable vote on campaign \nfinance reform.\n\n  When I talk about using ropes, I am talking about procedures called \n``filling the tree.'' It is probably a foreign language to people who \ndon't know what happens in the Senate, but it is a rarely used \napproach, filling the tree, which means establishing through \nparliamentary devices a series of amendments, first degree and second \ndegree, that offset each other sufficient so when you are finished \nfilling the tree, no one can move and no one can do anything.\n  The highway reauthorization, which is on the floor now, was brought \nto the floor and the tree was filled immediately. As I said, it is a \nrarely used device and almost always used to prevent something from \npassing.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I think the Senator from North Dakota makes an \nimportant point to the Senate, and that is that many of the American \npeople are asking why, with all that we now know about campaign finance \nabuse and with the continued erosion of confidence in our electoral \nsystem, why a majority of this Senate is not prepared to vote for \ncampaign finance reform.\n  The simple truth is, a majority of the U.S. Senate would vote today \nfor campaign finance reform, for the most meaningful change in how \nmoney is raised and spent and we govern our elections in a generation. \nBut a majority of this Senate is being prohibited from casting votes \nfor this fundamental change, first by the Republican leadership, which \nis so intent on preventing a vote of the McCain-Feingold bill that it \nwill filibuster, and second,\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nas the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, by prohibiting \nprocedurally the offering of any amendments to other legislation that \nwill allow us to make campaign finance reform part of other legislation \nenacted on this Senate floor.\n  It is cynical. It is a deliberate, partisan tactic to keep an \nadvantage in the financing of campaigns in this country. The cost is \nenormous. The cost is enormous, not simply in delaying other \nlegislation, in stopping the work of this Congress, but in continuing \nand even fueling the erosion of confidence in the American people in \nthe ability of this Senate to solve a real and legitimate problem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New Jersey is absolutely correct.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, who is on the floor, \nhas, along with the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, brought to us \na bipartisan proposal to say, ``Let's fix this issue. Let's do \nsomething meaningful about campaign finance reform.''\n  Every day you look in the paper and there is something new, some new \nrevelation about what has happened in campaign finances, and it is not \ngood. It has been Democrats a good number of times, and I understand \nthat, and I am uncomfortable with that. Today it happens to be \nRepublicans in the Washington Post--$1 million-plus passed from big \ndonors to other groups, then out to campaigns. So what you have is big \nmoney being moved into campaigns with an inability to trace any portion \nof the funds. Yesterday, the same thing, in a little race going on up \nin New York. Right now, $800,000 put into that race in issue \nadvertising which is unfortunately, under today's system, a legal form \nof cheating.\n  I think it would be in the best interest of the American people that \nwe brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate an opportunity to vote yes \nor no, up or down, on campaign finance reform and stop the silly dance \ngoing on.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator would yield--and I am interested in \nhearing Senator Feingold on this issue--I think it is important that \nthe American people now understand this is not a choice between a \ncurrent campaign finance system in the country being governed under \nexisting statutes or an alternative offered by Mr. McCain and Mr. \nFeingold. The simple fact is there is no governing law of American \npolitical campaigns today.\n  The legal system, which for more than 20 years has governed the \nfinancing of our campaign system, has collapsed. Corporate money is \nflowing into this system. Independent organizations are beginning to \ndominate the system. Even the political parties risk becoming side \nvoices in a larger chorus. The system in this country of governing our \ncampaigns has ended. The only issue is whether this Senate is now going \nto allow the majority to govern by passing a new system which will \ninstall some new integrity into our system of government. That is, \nindeed, the issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One of the reasons we are told they don't want to have a \nvote on this is because money is speech, they say. If that is the case, \nthere are a lot of folks in this country who are voiceless in American \npolitics.\n  There is too much money ricocheting off the walls in politics. We \nneed to do something about it. Campaign finance reform of the type \noffered by Senator Feingold and Senator McCain is a step in the right \ndirection. All we need to do is be allowed to have a vote on campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on that point, let me agree strongly \nwith the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from North Dakota and \nhighlight what will happen in a couple of minutes.\n  We will have a cloture vote that is purportedly on the issue of \nhighway spending, but it is not about highway spending. It is not about \ntransportation. It is not about investing in infrastructure. Those \nvotes will come later. The vote we are going to have in a few minutes \nis about whether the first session of the 105th Congress is going to \nadjourn for the year without one single substantive vote on the issue \nof campaign finance reform and all the scandals that we have seen here \nin Washington. That is what is going on here. That is exactly what the \nAmerican people have to be told in a straightforward manner.\n  The discussion that we just had here indicated what really happened a \ncouple of weeks ago on the campaign finance reform bill. We thought we \nwere going to have a serious debate on that issue. We thought there was \ngoing to be an opportunity not only to debate the overall bill but to \noffer Senators what Senators come here to do--the opportunity to offer \namendments and modifications.\n  I was ready for that debate. These Senators were ready for that \ndebate. The Senator from Arizona was ready for that debate. Even the \njunior Senator from Kentucky, the leading opponent of campaign finance \nreform, said he was ready for that debate.\n  Well, we were wrong, Mr. President. We never had such a debate. We \nnever had such amendments voted on. We had a sham, a con game played on \nthe American people. We had a process that was purposely rigged so that \none way or the other the Republicans and Democrats would have to \nfilibuster, or better yet, if possible, make both of them filibuster.\n  So my point is this: Let's have that debate. Let's have serious, \nsubstantive votes on this issue. Let's let Senators amend and modify \nand give their good ideas to the bill and then let the chips fall where \nthey may.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11012-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11013-S11014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FIVE IMPRESSIVE WINNERS OF IMMIGRATION ESSAY CONTEST\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a few months ago, the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association held an essay contest entitled \n``Celebrate America'' for children in grades four through seven. The \nchildren were asked to write on the subject, ``Why I Am Glad America Is \na Nation of Immigrants.'' Hundreds of children entered the contest, and \nI congratulate all the participants.\n  The winner of the contest was Veronica Curran, a fifth grader in St. \nMark's School in Shoreline, WA, who wrote about her family's \nextraordinary immigrant history--she and each of her brothers and \nsister were adopted from different countries. Eric Eves of Goulds, FL, \nCrystal Kohistani of Plymouth, MN, and Joseph Opromollo of Morris \nPlains, NJ, wrote other top essays. All of the essays reflect pride in \nAmerica's immigrant heritage, and emphasize the benefits of immigration \nfor the United States.\n  I congratulate each of these young writers, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the five winning essays from the ``Celebrate America'' \nessay contest be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essays were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Coming From Afar\n\n                          (By Veronica Curran)\n\n       Most immigrants are not famous people. They are just \n     regular, ordinary people, like my family and me.\n       In America, people have opportunities. They have a chance \n     to use their talents to improve America. My family is a good \n     example of why immigrants are good for this country.\n       My father's family immigrated from Ireland. They lived on a \n     very poor farm which was too small to support everyone. They \n     came to Montana and worked long hours in a dangerous copper \n     mine. They saved their money for their children to get a good \n     education. My father is now a teacher. America helped their \n     family and they helped America.\n       My mother's family were printers who moved from \n     Switzerland, then to America. They were in trouble for \n     printing books against the government. They were looking for \n     freedom to express themselves. They helped America by being \n     good thinkers.\n       Many students have immigrant stories like these. But my \n     family's story is different because my brothers, sister and I \n     were adopted from different countries. We all have our own \n     stories. My oldest brother immigrated from Colombia. My \n     sister's ancestors immigrated from Portugal. My other brother \n     and I immigrated from India.\n       If America was not a nation of immigrants, my family would \n     not have been created. Because America welcomes people from \n     all over the world, our family members have come together to \n     become American citizens. I hope we will grow up to help \n     America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                              Like a Tree\n\n                             (by Eric Eves)\n\n       Like a tree, America is supported by many roots. Long ago \n     Vikings used to tell tales of an enormous tree that supported \n     the entire universe. The roots of this mighty tree grew down \n     into the underworld. Its trunk held the earth and its \n     evergreen boughs reached beyond the sky. When I think of the \n     United States, I can't help but think of the United States as \n     that tree. We are one of the most powerful nations on earth \n     today, much thanks to our many roots that have come\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\n     from all corners of the world. Our evergreen boughs reach \n     beyond the earth to space itself. It has taken many different \n     people and many different kinds of people to make the United \n     States what it is today.\n       Like a tree, America had to start from a seed--this seed \n     being the natives, the Indians. It is believed that the \n     Indians migrated from northeastern Asia, thousands of years \n     ago, when there was a land bridge that linked North American \n     to Asia. As we know, after the voyage of Christopher \n     Columbus, Europeans started to immigrate to North America. \n     This was the birth of our nation.\n       Like a tree, America started with a seed, was born, then it \n     started to grow its roots--immigration. These immigrants have \n     come and made the nation strong with their many strengths. \n     Immigrants to the United States are people who have left \n     their homeland for many reasons: war, social upheaval, \n     economic calamities, political and religious persecution, but \n     the greatest reason for people to come to America has been \n     the desire to find greater opportunities. The United States \n     has been known for a nation of immigrants. Since its birth it \n     has taken in more than 55 million people, from every corner \n     of the world. These people are welcomed and many have made \n     enormous contributions to the culture and to the economy of \n     the United States.\n       Like a tree, America has become a mighty nation with its \n     roots grown from immigrants. Roots, anchor a tree in the \n     ground, holding it firmly in place, so, that it doesn't blow \n     over when storm winds blow. The roots of America, like a \n     tree, has thousands of different people branching from it, \n     spreading out in every direction. It is the roots of a tree \n     that have more growth than its trunk or leaves, and, this we \n     see here in America. Immigration has fed our country and made \n     it what it is today--A Mighty Nation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      The Long Journey To America\n\n                         (By Crystal Kohistani)\n\n       My story begins in 1983 when I was born. I was my parents \n     first child. Both my parents were born and raised in \n     Afghanistan, where I also was born. The religion in \n     Afghanistan is Islam. The language is Farsi.\n       I was one year old and my brother, who was also born in \n     Afghanistan, was eleven months old, when a war broke out \n     between the Russian and Afghan communists against Muslim \n     Afghans. The Russian communists wanted to overpower the \n     Afghan country. Many people died. Innocent people. They \n     bombed homes and shot people who would not side with them. \n     One of those people was my grandfather. He was a highly \n     respected, wealthy man. The communists wanted him to side \n     with them, but when he refused they shot him to death. They \n     thought since he was a leader to people, that the people \n     would do whatever he did. When my parents heard of this they \n     became scared and decided to leave the country. We started \n     our Journey in 1984. My father had to leave a day earlier \n     than us. He got on a bus that would transfer workers from and \n     to the University of Afghanistan. My father was good friends \n     with the driver so he agreed to drive him one hour out of \n     town to a village. The next day a jeep came for us at 12:00 \n     A.M. We had to leave at dark so no one would see us leaving. \n     The communists would not let anyone leave the country. If you \n     were caught, they either arrested you or shot you. We had \n     sold our belongs and took our clothing and some food with us. \n     The jeep took us to the village and we met with my father. \n     From there, four armed men with horses and donkeys met us. We \n     had to pay these men for the donkeys and horses. We also had \n     to pay ten thousand dollars for each one of us to be \n     transferred. These men were to take us to Pakistan. They took \n     us from village to village. My mother held me on her horse \n     and my father held my brother on foot. We had some family \n     with us so there wasn't enough horses or donkeys for my \n     father. Then early in the morning we reached another home. \n     This home contained many people; a tiny room for two people \n     were given to us. We had about ten people with us. We spent \n     the night there. The next day we all got sick. Luckily my \n     mother had medication with her. Then we set out again. We \n     came to a bombed out house and spent another night there. We \n     were all wet from the rain storm that had hit. We were so \n     tired and hungry. Most of the places we stayed in were very \n     dirty and smelly. They had rats, lizards and bugs. We had to \n     sleep on the bare floor. We changed our clothes and got our \n     rest. Later we headed towards a desert with little food and \n     water. We saw many snakes. When we came out of the desert we \n     were greeted by a wet and muddy path. Because of this we had \n     to pass through the mountains. On the way a man tried to \n     kidnap by brother from my mother, but when they saw the armed \n     men they ran away. After the mountains we reached a dangerous \n     valley, where many had died. After seven days we had reached \n     the border of Pakistan. The officers at the border asked us \n     some questions and then let us through. We thanked the men \n     that helped us. The men returned to Afghanistan, perhaps to \n     help another family. We got in touch with our relatives in \n     Pakistan. They came, picked us up from the border and helped \n     us look for a house. We lived in Pakistan for two years. \n     After two years, my uncle, who lived in Minnesota sponsored \n     us. We went from Pakistan, to Japan, to California, to \n     Colorado, and finally to Minneapolis, Minnesota. I was three \n     and half years old when I came here. I did not know any \n     English. I am thirteen years old today. I am glad that I am \n     here today, safe with my family. It was very hard for me to \n     have two cultures. It confused me. But now I have learned to \n     maintain two cultures. Some day I do hope I can go back to my \n     country to visit. Although America will always be my country, \n     for I was raised here. Right now there is war in Afghanistan \n     still, but this time it's with the Tallibans. They are taking \n     the religion Islam too far. They make it seem like a horrible \n     religion, but it's not. What the Talliban are requiring of \n     the religion is not what the Holy Quran is requiring. I am \n     glad I am here today to tell the story of my dangerous \n     migration. So that my grand children and so on can tell the \n     story of their ancestor's migration. And some day I hope that \n     the world can live in peace.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            Why I Am Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n                         (By Joseph Opromollo)\n\n     Red, yellow, olive,\n     Black, brown, white.\n     Splashes of color from God's own brush.\n     Splashes of color upon\n     Blue, green, brown,\n     Grey, red, beige.\n     Splashes of color which form an\n     Endless rainbow,\n     Which bleed together and blend into one.\n\n       The above symbolizes the diversity that is found in the \n     United States of America. I am glad that the United States is \n     a nation of immigrants. God has created all different \n     nationalities of people to live on this world. For what \n     reasons? For war? To fight each other because of our \n     differences? No. I believe it was to live together in harmony \n     and peace. This is why America is considered a melting pot.\n       In school I have learned many interesting facts about \n     America's past. Although life was often hard for the \n     immigrants, their fight for freedom allowed all to live \n     peacefully together. I know if my great-grandparents did not \n     dream of the freedom they would find in the U.S. and had not \n     immigrated, I would not be here today.\n       Where else in the world can you find friends of every race, \n     color and nationality? Like the colors of nature, the colors \n     found in America add variety to our lives. Like the colors of \n     an artist's palette, they can exist side by side and can also \n     blend to form new colors. I am proud to live in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11013-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11014-S11015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, under \nthe provisions of rule XXII, the second cloture vote will occur \nimmediately, unless changed by unanimous consent. We had the first \ncloture vote, which was not agreed to. Then we had the vote on the \ncontinuing resolution. I am glad we got that done now.\n  My intent had been to have the second cloture vote later on in the \nday to give Members time to assess where we were on the ISTEA, and see \nif they would like to have an ISTEA bill and see if there is a way to \nsort of get things that are wrapped around the axle moved in such a way \nthat we could go forward with this very important transportation \ninfrastructure bill. But I understand our Democratic colleagues will \nnot grant consent for the cloture vote to occur at 3 o'clock today. \nThey want the cloture vote right now. I don't think that is wise. I \nthink we need 3 hours here to sort of assess where we are, have some \ndiscussions, and then have a vote.\n  So, with that in mind, I will shortly move to recess the Senate, \nthen, until 3 o'clock today. Therefore, Senators can expect the next \nvote to occur at 3 p.m., on the second cloture motion with regard to \nthe ISTEA highway infrastructure extension bill, and hopefully we will \nhave some greater success there.\n  If we don't get cloture--- and I had hoped we would on the second \ncloture vote--we have a cloture motion filed and we will have another \ncloture vote on Friday. I know some Senators have things they need to \ndo. I know there will be some Senators absent and therefore it would be \neven more difficult to get the cloture vote to pass on Friday.\n  If we don't get cloture then, as majority leader I have to make a \ncall, after consultation with Members on both sides of this very \nimportant ISTEA transportation bill, as to whether we just pull it down \nand then next week try to move to other issues. We may have to have \ndebate and votes on the Federal Reserve nominees. We have two Federal \nReserve nominees that there is a hold on. It would be my intent to call \nthose up because I don't think we ought to delay Federal Reserve \nnominees for any of our maneuverings around here. That could possibly \nbe done on Monday.\n  We also have a judge on the calendar that we have cleared, except a \nvote is going to be required. So we probably would have that vote on \nMonday at 5 o'clock. And again, I am not locking all these in. I am \njust trying to advise Members where we are.\n  Then we could very well move to a variety of bills that are pending--\nthey are very serious--that we would like to get done before we adjourn \nfor the end of the year. That would include, of course, Amtrak reform, \nwhich we need very badly. A lot of good work has been done on it. We \nhave, of course, a threatened Amtrak strike that we may have to act on. \nWe have the juvenile justice bill. We have the adoption and foster care \nbill. I thought we had bipartisan agreement on that, but there seem to \nbe some problems with it. But we will begin to look at bringing up \nother bills. Also, then, next week we hope to begin the fast-track \nlegislation, with the intent of completing action one way or the other \non fast track early the first week in November.\n  So that is kind of where it is. I think my inclination now is, if we \ndon't get cloture this afternoon and we don't get cloture tomorrow, \nthen we would have to just say, well, campaign finance reform took down \nthe very important ISTEA infrastructure bill. That is kind of where we \nare, and I am prepared now to move that the Senate stand in recess \nuntil 3 p.m. today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator mentioned fast track. I would not expect us \nto have fast consideration of fast track. I would expect that piece of \nlegislation would take some significant time. But that wasn't the \nreason I asked the Senator to yield.\n  There clearly is a wrench in the crankcase here and we are not \nmoving. I suspect the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, \nfeels the wrench is he's not able to get cloture on the highway bill \nand others feel that the wrench is that we are not able to get a vote \non the McCain-Feingold legislation. I wonder whether we wouldn't, in \nthe coming days, be able to accomplish both purposes. Are there \ncircumstances under which we might be able to expect that we can \nproceed on the highway bill and proceed to find a way to have a vote in \nsome fashion on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. We have already had votes on the McCain-Feingold issue. It \nmay not have been the way that some Senators would have liked to have \nhad it, but we have had votes on it. There is not a consensus on what \nto do on campaign finance reform at this time that could get the \napproval of the Senate, which requires 60 votes. I mean, that is what \nthe Senator from North Dakota has indicated he is going to force on the \nfast track. He's probably going to have a filibuster and we'll have to \nget 60 votes on cloture to move on fast track. He may be successful in \nblocking fast track, which the President is very anxious to get and, in \na meeting earlier this week, requested that I schedule it before we go \nout, and I want to do that. But he understands full well what the rules \nof the Senate are, and he's going to take full advantage of them, and \nthat's his right.\n\n  So, the same is applicable here. There is no consensus yet on how we \ncan come together on campaign finance reform. This issue will come up \nagain. I don't think it makes good sense for it to come up again this \nyear. It will come up again in the future. I assume it will come up in \na very different form in the future. Maybe not.\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n Maybe in many different forms. I realize Senators are going to try to \nhave it considered again at a later time and, as the majority leader, \nthe floor leader of the Senate, it would be my intent to try to \nschedule it in some orderly way, where Senators will know when it is \ncoming. I have already indicated, and Senator Daschle has indicated, \nthat we would like to see some action take place on it by the first \nweek in March, either during that week or earlier perhaps. But we would \nneed to look at the calendar for the year and look at the President's \nDay recess and work around that.\n  I don't see right now an agreement on how that would come up, because \nI just think the atmosphere, again, is not such that we can get an \nagreement worked out. Some people said, ``Oh, well, let's just have it \nfreewheeling and let everybody offer whatever amendment they want to \nand see what happens.'' I'm not sure that's going to do us any good or \nthe country any good, where we have a bunch of amendments where we try \nto pin each other's ears back and at the end of the day we have a \nfilibuster and get nothing and we start off the year in a cranky mood \nand had a great roar and accomplish nothing.\n  I am prepared to continue to work with Senators on both sides of the \naisle on both sides of the issue and look to how that is going to be \nhandled next year. I am prepared to say now that I realize it is going \nto come up and I will schedule it. But I have not been able to get an \nagreement as to how that would be done, and I don't think we are going \nto get that done at this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Mississippi yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield further.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One additional comment. I understand the points the \nSenator from Mississippi makes. He indicates he would bring it to the \nfloor, that is campaign finance reform. He did that. But when the \nSenator from Mississippi announces, ``I don't understand how it would \ncome up,'' it would come up in the regular order, offered as an \namendment. The dilemma we have at the moment is the regular order is \nnot allowed because we have a procedure on the highway reauthorization \nbill to fill the tree, which prevents a second-degree amendment at some \npoint to get back into consideration of it.\n  I understand and accept all the points the Senator from Mississippi \nmade about cloture and all those issues. I would just say this, that I \nthink you only have to pick up the paper every single day to see the \nproblems that exist all around in campaign finance reform. I think the \nSenator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona have crafted an \napproach that we at least ought to be able to express ourselves on in \nsome detail.\n  Bringing the campaign finance reform bill to the floor did not \ninclude the opportunity to actually get to those votes. We hope very \nmuch to have that kind of opportunity one way or the other in the \nfuture. That was the reason I inquired of the Senator from Mississippi \nto see whether we might not get to that point at some early point in \nthe consideration of the Senate in the final days.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again I want to emphasize that on this \ncampaign finance issue, the idea of adding more laws on the books on \ntop of the laws that are already there that are already impossible to \ncomply with in many respects, and certainly not without lawyers and \naccountants and advisers to make sure that you are complying with the \nalready convoluted, difficult campaign law requirements, we had three \ncloture votes recently on the campaign finance bill and we had two \nother cloture votes on the paycheck equity. We have had five votes. \nCloture was not achieved, and cloture is very important. Just like what \nare we trying to do on ISTEA? Get cloture. What am I going to have to \ndo on fast track? I am going to have to try to get cloture to cut off \nan extended debate so we can get to the substance of the issue and \nbring it to a head. We have had five votes. It's not as if we have not \nvoted on this. Consensus is not there.\n  As far as picking up the paper and seeing the problems, yes, you can \npick up the paper and see how the existing laws are being violated or \nmaneuvered. Without saying who did it, which side, the fact of the \nmatter is, what we need to do is to see if we can find ways to \nencourage people and get people to comply with existing laws before we \nstart trying to add a whole bunch more on top of it that would limit \nfree speech, that would limit people's abilities to have a fair shot at \ngetting elected. That is what is at stake here. That is what I would \nlike to be able to do, is maintain the ability to get my message \nacross.\n  In my State, if I cannot raise the money to get my message across, \nthere are those who are going to try to get it across for me, some of \nthose same newspapers you are talking about. Yes, if I had to depend on \nthem, I wouldn't be here. So what you are talking about is trying to \nfind a way where a guy like Trent Lott can't get an opportunity to get \nhis message across to the constituents. I don't want to give that up. I \nthink I have a right to be able to raise the funds to try to make my \ncase to the constituents of my State. I don't think--we cannot limit \nadvocacy. We can't do that. This is still America.\n  But, again, to put it back in the calmer voice, we know it's going to \ncome back up. Maybe someday we will quit trying to trump each other and \ntry to see if there is some way maybe there might be some things that \nneed to be done that we can agree on. I don't think we are there yet.\n  I would be glad to yield to Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have just one comment. I understand the position the \nmajority leader is in and the majority on this side of the aisle. I \nthink we would all agree that the way we are going to move forward on \nthis issue is if we all sit down together and try to work out something \nthat is agreeable and fair, not only in our minds but in the minds of \nobjective observers. I would, again, urge--the Senator from Kentucky is \nhere on the floor--if we could just agree that we will take up this \nlegislation sometime next year, with a certain amount of amendments and \na cloture vote, leaving on both sides the right to filibuster if it is \nnot agreeable to either side. But to not allow a single amendment that \naddresses this issue is what is frustrating, I think, clearly to the \nSenator from Wisconsin and me.\n  So, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of this issue, if we \ncould just sit down and say, ``OK, we will take up this issue at a date \ncertain and we will give it a certain amount of consideration.'' It \ndoesn't have to be unlimited amendments. It doesn't have to be even a \nlarge number of amendments. But, then, if at the end of that debate and \nvoting and having Senators on record on the issue, we could then either \nfilibuster or, which I think is the most likely result, is we could \nagree on a campaign finance reform that would be agreeable to all \nsides, we could move forward to the benefit of the American people. I \nwant to thank the Senator, the distinguished majority leader. I thank \nthe Democrat leader. I think that good effort has been made.\n  But all of us need to sit down and agree on this so we can address \nthis issue, and the reality is, as the distinguished majority leader \nknows, we are going to address it sooner or later. I hate to see it \nhold up ISTEA. I don't like to see it hold up fast track. Clearly, it \nis in all of our interests not to have to impede the progress of the \nSenate.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding to me, and I thank him for \nhis continued courtesy to me on this issue which, obviously, he just \ndisplayed he feels very, very strongly about.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say, I agree with Senator McCain. I think the \nissue at this point is really whether we are going to finish the \nhighway bill and some other important legislation pending in the \nSenate. We had 7 to 9 days of debate on campaign finance reform. The \nmajority leader is absolutely correct, there is no way he can or any of \nus can prevent further debate on this issue. As a matter of fact, we \nhave been debating it for 10 years. It comes back almost every year.\n  I don't object to that. As someone who has not been in sympathy with \nMcCain-Feingold, I certainly don't object to the debate. I enjoy it. We \nhad 27 speakers on my side of the issue when we debated it a few weeks \nago, and I don't mind debating it again.\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will he allow votes on amendments? That is the key to \nthis. It is fun to debate. I enjoyed it, but at sometime or another, \nthe Senate has to be on record on this issue.\n  So I respectfully request that he agree to some kind of format that \nwe could agree on where there are votes, and if the Senator still does \nnot agree, then he can filibuster or the majority on either side can \nfilibuster depending on the result. That is the question I ask.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, I am open to \ndiscussion about having lots of amendments on both sides and lots of \ndebates, lots of votes. But it seems to me the issue here, 3 weeks \nbefore we get out, is whether we are going to finish other important \nlegislation the majority leader would like to advance and I am sure the \nminority leader would, too.\n  We will have that debate next year. I am more than happy to discuss \nthe context of the debate, the timing of the debate. I am confident \nthat an issue this controversial will always be determined in a 60-vote \ncontext, as much as the Senator from North Dakota will assure that is \nwhat will happen on fast track. I am open to that discussion.\n  What I would like to see us to do is go on and pass some of the much-\nneeded legislation the majority leader would like to push forward in \nthe remaining weeks of the session.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, and after that, it will be my intention to yield the \nfloor so Senator Daschle can make some comments and then after that, I \nwill move the Senate stand in recess until 3 o'clock. I would like for \nSenator Daschle to have some time first.\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to the majority leader, obviously the leader takes \nprecedence.\n  Mr. LOTT. Did you want to ask a question? I can yield the floor so he \ncan have some time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it was my intention, before the leader came \nto the floor, and also in response to the Senator from Kentucky, to \npoint out that the issue is not really simply whether or not we can \nfinish the so-called important business of the Senate if that business \nis limited to the definition of the Senator from Kentucky, which is \nISTEA and a few other matters.\n  Mr. LOTT. If you will yield, it is ISTEA, it is fast track, it is \nAmtrak, it is juvenile justice, it is foster care and adoption, even \nmaybe the Endangered Species Act--I have not had a chance to meet with \nthe interested parties there--product liability. We have a lot of stuff \nwe can do here in the next 2 weeks if we can get a process to achieve \nthat.\n  Mr. KERRY. And I think every Senator on this side agrees with that, \nbut the question is larger than just that. The question is whether the \nentire caucus on the Democratic side and a portion of the Republican \ncaucus is going to be permitted to know with certainty that an issue of \nequal and, in many people's judgment, greater importance, campaign \nfinance reform, is going to receive its proper hearing on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I think what the Senator from Arizona was asking the Senator from \nKentucky didn't really get an answer. It is one thing to say we are \nwilling to sit down and discuss this. That discussion has to come to \ncloture before we are able to proceed, because we are determined to \nknow that we are going to have adequate capacity to be able to bring up \namendments and have that kind of a thorough vetting of this issue.\n  Now, I agree with the Senator from Kentucky. This will take 60 votes. \nI think everybody over here understands that. And clearly we are going \nto have to come together in this process to arrive at those 60 votes. \nThat is going to require us to do precisely what the leader said, which \nis not to be jockeying for advantage one over the other, and to find an \nevenhanded way to approach this. Right now we are not even having that \ndiscussion. So we are operating in a vacuum where we are being asked to \naccede to going forward on certain legislation without the \nunderstanding that we will be able to vote and to have these amendments \ncome to the floor.\n  This can be resolved in 1 hour. It can be resolved in half an hour if \nthe majority leader were permitted to simply say to us, we will have a \ndate certain when we return in the winter, and with that date certain, \nwe will have x number of amendments with a period of time to vote, and \nwe will be able to take up campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have said I know this issue will come up \nagain, rightly or wrongly, and I would like to schedule it in a way for \neverybody to know when it is coming up. I think Senator Daschle and I \ncan agree on that. What I can't guarantee the Senator from \nMassachusetts is a process that would match or fit his word ``proper'' \nor ``adequate.'' It is in the eye of the beholder. What you think might \nbe proper may not be what some other Senator thinks is proper as to how \nit should be considered. And also, if you are talking about setting up \na process where at the end you win on the McCain-Feingold version, \nwhether it is the first or second one, we don't think that is proper.\n  So if the idea is you have to have a process where we can have a \ngreat big fight, after which nothing happens, or whereby you can be \nrelatively assured you are going to be able to win the issue, we can't \nagree to that.\n  Mr. KERRY. But, if the majority leader will yield for a minute, I \nthink we just agreed it is going to take 60 votes. The question is, we \nare never going to get to the point of understanding whether we can \nmuster the 60 votes if we can't even have one vote on one of the major \namendments that begins to sort out where people are and where you can \nfind the common ground.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. We tried to get the vote on the paycheck equity amendment, \nand cloture was defeated twice on that. The situation may be different \n3 or 4 months from now. I think the atmosphere is charged now in a way \nthat makes it difficult for us to define now what the process will be. \nBy the end of February, the first of March, something that might appear \nimpossible now we might be able to work out. We can continue to talk \nabout how we would do that.\n  Now, in the meantime, time marches on. The calendar is moving on. We \nare struggling to have committees meet that, by the way, need to meet \nso they can confirm Foreign Service or Ambassador nominations and \njudges. We are having trouble with that. We are trying to see if we can \ncontinue to move some of these people on the Executive Calendar. We \nhave Members who are working on the highway transportation bill. \nSenator Chafee has been here now for a week and nothing has happened. \nSenator Byrd is very interested in this bill and has an amendment on \nwhich he has been working with Senator Gramm and others. Senator Baucus \nis very anxious to see if we can't get going forward.\n  It is the usual process around here. Sometimes you get just \ncompletely bollixed. The only way you change that is you start moving--\nyou move a little here, you move a little there. Senator Daschle and I \nhave been trying to do that a little bit this week. We made a little \nprogress here, a little progress there. If we can get these wheels \ncreaking and moving forward, then who knows what will happen.\n  As long as we are hunkered down, saying, ``We've got to get this \nagreed to before we do that; if we don't get that, you don't get \nthis,'' and we wind up getting nothing. I hope that is not what we will \ndo. We can see. I hope we can get cloture on ISTEA. If we got cloture \nthis afternoon, we would still be performing a miracle if we finish \nthis bill by next Thursday, and if we don't get it done next week, how \ndo we get fast track where we have been assured we are going to have \nextended debate on that, and maybe other games being played with that \none?\n  I think we need to move the ball forward, get cloture, get on this \nbill, get some of these amendments offered that are very important and \nvery critical to various States, the entire country. There are some \nother issues that will be hotly debated on this bill. We will still be \nhere, and we will still have time to have meetings and talk about what \nwe are going to do.\n  I think I just saw probably the greatest exchange between my two \ngreat friends of Scottish descent, McCain and McConnell, a moment ago. \nWho knows\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\nwhat great things might happen once we start moving things forward?\n  Mr. FORD. Don't bet on that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Don't bet on that? The Senator from Kentucky will make sure \nthat doesn't happen. I yield the floor so Senator Daschle can comment \non his own time, and then I will move to stand in recess after that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his comments and applaud him for making the effort that he has over \nthe last several days in working with us to see if we can't find a way \nwith which to resolve this impasse.\n  I want to clarify a couple of matters that I think ought to be \nunderstood as we work our way through the impasse. The first is that a \ncloture vote, a victory on cloture on the Chafee amendment may move the \nball ahead slightly, but there are scores of Chafee amendments, all of \nwhich will be subject to the same cloture vote process, each taking 30 \nhours. So if you multiply 30 hours times 30 amendments, that is a lot \nof time, and we don't have a lot of time.\n  It is not only the amendments, but it is the titles themselves, the \nbanking, the finance, the commerce titles that have to be added to the \ntrunk of the bill. They, too, will be subject to cloture and will \nrequire a substantial amount of time.\n  So unless we get an agreement, even if the caucus, even if our \nDemocratic caucus would vote for cloture, there are Senators who would \noppose moving the ISTEA bill forward without an agreement, which brings \nus to the need to vote for cloture in any case.\n  So it is with unanimity the Democrats are hoping that we can work \nwith our friends in the majority to see if we can't reach that \nagreement.\n  As to the agreement, the clarification I wish to make goes along the \nlines of what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has just \nnoted, and others. What do we want? Well, we want a date certain. We \nwould like the assurance that the so-called parliamentary tree is not \nfilled; that we have an opportunity, as Senator McCain noted, to offer \namendments. We would like to take the bills in sequence--the McCain-\nFeingold and then perhaps the Lott bill having to do with the labor \nunions. That would be the desirable approach, a sequence of \nconsideration, first of McCain-Feingold and then of the Lott bill.\n  We recognize that every amendment and the bill itself would be \nsubject to the rules of the Senate which means you have to have 60 \nvotes. It would seem to me that if you don't get 60 votes, you pull the \namendment and would move on to another one. If we filed cloture on an \namendment or required a 60-vote threshold, you could get through these \namendments pretty quickly. If you don't get it, it falls, and we just \nkeep going. Ultimately, if we don't get 60 votes on McCain-Feingold, it \nfalls; it is over.\n  I do not think it would take that long. I think we could work through \na procedure that would bring us to some closure on this bill. That is \nall we can ask. We cannot do anything more than make our best effort to \npersuade and come up with a parliamentary process that will allow us \nthe right to protect Senators as Members of the minority, whatever the \nminority may be, on a given issue. And I believe a process like that \nwould work.\n  Senator Lott has been, I think, fair in his willingness to consider \nalmost anything. We have Senators who are unable to agree at this \npoint. But like others before me, I am hopeful that we can get an \nagreement, that cloture votes will not be necessary, that we can then \nfinish ISTEA, that we can then move on to nominations and another array \nof issues next week. That is within our grasp, but it will take an \nagreement.\n  I think it is fair to say that it will not matter how many cloture \nvotes we take, I do not think the votes will be different. A majority \nof the Senate voted against cloture this morning--a majority. Forty-\nfive Democrats and seven Republicans voted against cloture. A majority, \nit seems to me, now want to resolve this matter.\n  So I am hopeful, Mr. President, we can do that. I think we can do it. \nI will stand ready to meet with anybody to come to some conclusion on \nhow we might proceed. But I hope we do not give up.\n  Under the rules, as I understand them, we will go into a recess until \n3 o'clock?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11015-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, last night, the Hong Kong stock market \nlost 10 percent of its value. In the past week it has dropped 25 \npercent of its value. Panic stock selling has taken over the Hong Kong \nmarket. All stock markets around the world are declining very heavily. \nAnd as of 2:30 this afternoon the Dow Jones industrial average was down \n215 points.\n  This is no coincidence. This is not just the normal fluctuation of \nthe stock market. This is a warning sign of what could be yet to come \nin Hong Kong now that the Communist Chinese have taken over.\n  I have spoken out before on this floor about the dangers of the \nCommunist takeover in Hong Kong and, regrettably, my fears appear to be \ncoming true. There is a simple but profound lesson here for Americans \nand for all freedom-loving people around the world. Until recently, \nHong Kong was an oasis of economic vibrance and freedom surrounded by \nthe Communist dictatorship on the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong was \neconomically strong because Hong Kong was free.\n  Freedom knows no boundaries. Whether it is in America or Europe or \nAfrica or Latin America or Asia, freedom is what creates the \nopportunity for people and ideas to prosper, but wherever the \nCommunists have ruled freedom dies.\n  Mr. President, the collapse of communism in Russia and Eastern Europe \nis one of the epic stories of our time, a true triumph of the human \nspirit against the forces of oppression. Unfortunately, the brave \npeople of Hong Kong are suffering a reversal. It is tragic to see a \nfree people come under the yoke of Communist rule.\n  There is still freedom of Hong Kong today, but the warning signs are \nominous.

Mr. President, the United States is currently engaged in \nnegotiating a climate change treaty. This is a negotiation that we have \nliterally only just really engaged in, in the sense that we have only \nnow made clear to the world what our negotiating position will be, the \ncritical elements from which we will proceed. I was somewhat troubled \nthis morning to hear a number of our colleagues come to the floor of \nthe Senate and, frankly, either considerably misstate or considerably \nmisrepresent the very straightforward words of the President yesterday \nwith respect to this subject. The following is the position that the \nPresident articulated yesterday.\n  No. 1, it is the goal of the United States to find a binding treaty \nwhich includes not just developed nations but developing nations as \nwell.\n  No. 2, the U.S. goal is a binding treaty that seeks to bring \ngreenhouse gases to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, so as to \nminimize economic costs to the United States.\n  And, finally, No. 3, the United States now will undertake policies to \nfully leverage market mechanisms, innovation, technology, and American \ningenuity to make achieving emissions reductions less costly.\n  I remind my colleagues that all of these positions are completely \nwithin the framework of the resolution that the Senate passed, the \nByrd-Hagel resolution. That resolution specifically said it must \n``mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfor the annex I parties, unless the protocol or other agreement''--and \nI want to emphasize here, ``other agreement.'' The President in his \nproposal has made allowance for the very ``other agreement'' potential \nthat was contemplated in the resolution we passed. It specifically \nrequires that other agreement, or the principal agreement, mandate new, \nand specific scheduled reductions for the developing countries within \nthe same compliance period.\n  The second requirement that the Senate passed was that whatever \nagreement we reached would not result in serious harm to the economy of \nthe United States. Let me emphasize, the term is ``serious harm to the \neconomy of the United States.'' Any fair reading of the President's \nremarks outlining our position would find that the President is \ncompletely within the framework of the Senate resolution. And yet, \ntoday, we really heard Senators completely misrepresenting that \nposition and asserting that it is somehow outside of the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of the President's comments be \nprinted in the Record so people can judge for themselves the degree \nwith which we are in compliance.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by the President on Global Climate Change Before the National \n                           Geographic Society\n\n       The President. Thank you very much. Mr. Murphy, Mr. Vice \n     President, to all of you who are here. I thank especially the \n     members of Congress who are here, the leaders of labor and \n     business who are here, all the members of the administration, \n     and especially the White House staff members that the Vice \n     President mentioned and the Secretary of Energy, the \n     Administrator of the EPA, and the others who have helped us \n     to come to this moment.\n       On the way in here we were met by the leaders of the \n     National Geographic, and I complimented them on their recent \n     two-part series on the Roman Empire. It's a fascinating story \n     of how the Empire rose, how it sustained itself for hundreds \n     of years, why it fell, and speculations on what, if any, \n     relevance it might have to the United States and, indeed, the \n     West.\n       And one of the gentlemen said, well, you know, we got a lot \n     of interesting comments on that, including a letter \n     referencing a statue we had of the bust of Emperor Vespasian. \n     And one of our readers said, why in the world did you put a \n     statue of Gene Hackman in a piece on the Roman Empire? \n     (Laughter.) And I say that basically to say, in some senses, \n     the more things change, the more they remain the same. \n     (Laughter.)\n       For what sustains any civilization, and now what will \n     sustain all of our civilizations, is the constant effort at \n     renewal, the ability to avoid denial and to proceed into the \n     future in a way that is realistic and humane, but resolute. \n     Six years ago tomorrow, not long after I started running for \n     President, I went back to my alma mater at Georgetown and \n     began a series of three speeches outlining my vision for \n     America in the 21st century--how we could keep the American \n     Dream alive for all of our people, how we could maintain \n     America's leadership for peace and freedom and prosperity, \n     and how we could come together across the lines that divide \n     us as one America.\n       And together, we've made a lot of progress in the last \n     nearly five years now that the\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\n     Vice President and I have been privileged to work at this \n     task. At the threshold of a new century, our economy is \n     thriving, our social fabric is mending, we've helped to lead \n     the world toward greater peace and cooperation.\n       I think this has happened, in no small measure, in part \n     because we had a different philosophy about the role of \n     government. Today, it is smaller and more focused and more \n     oriented toward giving people the tools and the conditions \n     they need to solve their own problems and toward working in \n     partnership with our citizens. More important, I believe it's \n     happened because we made tough choices but not false choices.\n       On the economy, we made the choice to balance the budget \n     and to invest in our people and our future. On crime, we made \n     the choice to be tough and smart about prevention and \n     changing the conditions in which crime occurs. On welfare, we \n     made the choice to require work, but also to support the \n     children of people who have been on welfare. On families, we \n     made the choice to help parents find more and better jobs and \n     to have the necessary time and resources for their children. \n     And on the environment, we made the choice to clean our air, \n     water, and land, to improve our food supply, and to grow the \n     economy.\n       This kind of commonsense approach, rooted in our most basic \n     values and our enduring optimism about the capacity of free \n     people to meet the challenges of every age must be brought to \n     bear on the work that remains to pave the way for our people \n     and for the world toward a new century and a new millenium.\n       Today we have a clear responsibility and a golden \n     opportunity to conquer one of the most important challenges \n     of the 21st century--the challenge of climate change--with an \n     environmentally sound and economically strong strategy, to \n     achieve meaningful reductions in greenhouse gases in the \n     United States and throughout the industralized and the \n     developing world. It is a strategy that, if properly \n     implemented, will create a wealth of new opportunities for \n     entrepreneurs at home, uphold our leadership abroad, and \n     harness the power of free markets to free our planet from an \n     unacceptable risk; a strategy as consistent with our \n     commitment to reject false choices.\n       America can stand up for our national interest and stand up \n     for the common interest of the international community. \n     America can build on prosperity today and ensure a healthy \n     planet for our children tomorrow.\n       In so many ways the problem of climate change reflects the \n     new realities of the new century. Many previous threats could \n     be met within our own borders, but global warming requires an \n     international solution. Many previous threats came from \n     single enemies, but global warming derives from millions of \n     sources. Many previous threats posed clear and present \n     danger; global warming is far more subtle, warning us not \n     with roaring tanks or burning rivers but with invisible \n     gases, slow changes in our surroundings, increasingly severe \n     climatic disruptions that, thank God, have not yet hit home \n     for most Americans. But make no mistake, the problem is real. \n     And if we do not change our course now, the consequences \n     sooner or later will be destructive for America and for the \n     world.\n       The vast majority of the world's climate scientists have \n     concluded that if the countries of the world do not work \n     together to cut the emission of greenhouse gases, then \n     temperatures will rise and will disrupt the climate. In fact, \n     most scientists say the process has already begun. Disruptive \n     weather events are increasing. Disease-bearing insects are \n     moving to areas that used to be too cold for them. Average \n     temperatures are rising. Glacial formations are receding.\n       Scientists don't yet know what the precise consequences \n     will be. But we do know enough now to know that the \n     Industrial Age has dramatically increased greenhouse gases in \n     the atmosphere, where they take a century or more to \n     dissipate; and that the process must be slowed, then stopped, \n     then reduced if we want to continue our economic progress and \n     preserve the quality of life in the United States and \n     throughout our planet. We know what we have to do.\n       Greenhouse gas emissions are caused mostly by the \n     inefficient burning of coal or oil for energy. Roughly a \n     third of these emissions come from industry, a third from \n     transportation, a third from residential and commercial \n     buildings. In each case, the conversion of fuel to energy use \n     is extremely inefficient and could be made much cleaner with \n     existing technologies or those already on the horizon, in \n     ways that will not weaken the economy but in fact will add to \n     our strength in new businesses and new jobs. If we do this \n     properly, we will not jeopardize our prosperity--we will \n     increase it.\n       With that principle in mind, I'm announcing the instruction \n     I'm giving to our negotiators as they pursue a realistic and \n     effective international climate change treaty. And I'm \n     announcing a far-reaching proposal that provides flexible \n     market-based and cost-effective ways to achieve meaningful \n     reductions here in America. I want to emphasize that we \n     cannot wait until the treaty is negotiated and ratified to \n     act. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's \n     people, enjoys 22 percent of the world's wealth, but emits \n     more than 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. We must \n     begin now to take out our insurance policy on the future.\n       In the international climate negotiations, the United \n     States will pursue a comprehensive framework that includes \n     three elements, which, taken together, will enable us to \n     build a strong and robust global agreement. First, the United \n     States proposes at Kyoto that we commit to the binding and \n     realistic target of returning to emissions of 1990 levels \n     between 2008 and 2012. And we should not stop there. We \n     should commit to reduce emissions below 1990 levels in the \n     five-year period thereafter, and we must work toward further \n     reductions in the years ahead.\n       The industrialized nations tried to reduce emissions to \n     1990 levels once before with a voluntary approach, but \n     regrettably, most of us--including especially the United \n     States--fell short. We must find new resolve to achieve these \n     reductions, and to do that we simply must commit to binding \n     limits.\n       Second, we will embrace flexible mechanisms for meeting \n     these limits. We propose an innovative, joint implementation \n     system that allows a firm in one country to invest in a \n     project that reduces emissions in another country and receive \n     credit for those reductions at home. And we propose an \n     international system of emissions trading. These innovations \n     will cut worldwide pollution, keep costs low, and help \n     developing countries protect their environment, too, without \n     sacrificing their economic growth.\n       Third, both industrialized and developing countries must \n     participate in meeting the challenge of climate change. The \n     industrialized world must lead, but developing countries also \n     must be engaged. The United States will not assume binding \n     obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully \n     participate in this effort.\n       As President Carlos Menem stated forcefully last week when \n     I visited him in Argentina, a global problem such as climate \n     change requires a global answer. If the entire industrialized \n     world reduces emissions over the next several decades, but \n     emissions from the developing world continue to grow at their \n     current pace, concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the \n     atmosphere will continue to climb. Developing countries have \n     an opportunity to chart a different energy future consistent \n     with their growth potential and their legitimate economic \n     aspirations.\n       What Argentina, with dramatic projected economic growth, \n     recognizes is true for other countries as well: We can and we \n     must work together on this problem in a way that benefits us \n     all. Here at home, we must move forward by unleashing the \n     full power of free markets an technological innovations to \n     meet the challenge of climate change. I propose a sweeping \n     plan to provide incentives and lift road blocks to help our \n     companies and our citizens find new and creative ways of \n     reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n       First, we must enact tax cuts and make research and \n     development investments worth up to $5 billion over the next \n     five years--targeted incentives to encourage energy \n     efficiency and the use of cleaner energy sources.\n       Second, we must urge companies to take early actions to \n     reduce emissions by ensuring that they receive appropriate \n     credit for showing the way.\n       Third, we must create a market system for reducing \n     emissions wherever they can be achieved most inexpensively, \n     here or abroad; a system that will draw on our successful \n     experience with acid rain permit trading.\n       Fourth, we must reinvent how the federal government, the \n     nation's largest energy consumer, buys and uses energy. \n     Through new technology, renewable energy resources, \n     innovative partnerships with private firms and assessments of \n     greenhouse gas emissions from major federal projects, the \n     federal government will play an important role in helping our \n     nation to meet its goal. Today, as a down payment on our \n     mission solar roof initiative, I commit the federal \n     government to have 20,000 systems on federal buildings by \n     2010.\n       Fifth, we must unleash competition in the electricity \n     industry, to remove outdated regulations and save Americans \n     billions of dollars. We must do it in a way that leads to \n     even greater progress in cleaning our air and delivers a \n     significant down payment in reducing greenhouse gas \n     emissions. Today, two-thirds of the energy used to provide \n     electricity is squandered in waste heat. We can do much, much \n     better.\n       Sixth, we must continue to encourage key industry sectors \n     to prepare their own greenhouse gas reduction plans, and we \n     must, along with state and local government, remove the \n     barriers to the most energy efficient usage possible. There \n     are ways the federal government can help industry to achieve \n     meaningful reductions voluntarily, and we will redouble our \n     efforts to do so.\n       This plan is sensible and sound. Since it's a long-term \n     problem requiring a long-term solution, it will be phased in \n     over time. But we want to get moving now. We will start with \n     our package of strong market incentives, tax cuts, and \n     cooperative efforts with industry. We want to stimulate early \n     action and encourage leadership. And as we reduce our \n     emissions over the next decade with these efforts, we will \n     perform regular reviews to see what works best for the \n     environment, the economy, and our national security.\n       After we have accumulated a decade of experience, a decade \n     of data, a decade of technological innovation, we will launch \n     a broad emissions trading initiative to ensure that we hit \n     our binding targets. At that time, if there are dislocations \n     caused by the changing patterns of energy use in America, we \n     have a moral obligation to respond to those to help the \n     workers and the enterprises affected--no less than we do \n     today by any change in our economy which affects people \n     through no fault of their own.\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\n       This plan plays to our strengths--innovation, creativity, \n     entrepreneurship. Our companies already are showing the way \n     by developing tremendous environmental technologies and \n     implementing commonsense conservation solutions.\n       Just yesterday, Secretary Pena announced a dramatic \n     breakthrough in fuel cell technology, funded by the \n     Department of Energy research--a breakthrough that will clear \n     the way toward developing cars that are twice as efficient as \n     today's models and reduce pollution by 90 percent. The \n     breakthrough was made possible by our path-breaking \n     partnership with the auto industry to create a new generation \n     of vehicles. A different design, producing similar results, \n     has been developed by a project funded by the Defense \n     Advanced Research Products Agency and the Commerce \n     Department's National Institute of Science and Technology.\n       The Energy Department discovery is amazing in what it does. \n     Today, gasoline is used very inefficiently in internal \n     combustion engines--about 80 percent of its energy capacity \n     is lost. The DOE project announced yesterday by A.D. Little \n     and Company uses 84 percent of the gasoline directly going \n     into the fuel cell. That's increased efficiency of more than \n     four times traditional engine usage.\n       And I might add, from the point of view of all the people \n     that are involved in the present system, continuing to use \n     gasoline means that you don't have to change any of the \n     distribution systems that are out there. It's a very \n     important, but by no means the only, discovery that's been \n     made that points the way toward the future we have to \n     embrace.\n       I also want to emphasize, however, that most of the \n     technologies available for meeting this goal through market \n     mechanisms are already out there--we simply have to take \n     advantage of them. For example, in the town of West Branch, \n     Iowa, a science teacher named Hector Ibarra challenged his \n     6th graders to apply their classroom experiments to making \n     their school more energy efficient. The class got a $14,000 \n     loan from a local bank and put in place easily available \n     solutions. The students cut the energy use in their school by \n     70 percent. Their savings were so impressive that the bank \n     decided to upgrade its own energy efficiency. (Laughter.)\n       Following the lead of these 6th graders--(laughter)--other \n     major companies in America have shown similar results. You \n     have only to look at the proven results achieved by companies \n     like Southwire, Dow Chemical, Dupont, Kraft, Interface \n     Carpetmakers, and any number of others in every sector of our \n     economy to see what can be done.\n       Our industries have produced a large group of efficient new \n     refrigerators, computers, washer/dryers, and other appliances \n     that use far less energy, save money, and cut pollution. The \n     revolution in lighting alone is truly amazing. One compact \n     fluorescent lamp, used by one person over its lifetime, can \n     save nearly a ton of carbon dioxide emissions from the \n     atmosphere, and save the consumer money.\n       If over the next 15 years everyone were to buy only those \n     energy-efficient products marked in stores with EPA's \n     distinctive ``Energy Star'' label, we could shrink our \n     energy bills by a total of about $100 billion, over the \n     next 15 years and dramatically cut greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n       Despite these win-win innovations and commitments that are \n     emerging literally every day, I know full well that some will \n     criticize our targets and timetables as too ambitious. And, \n     of course, others will say we haven't gone far enough. But \n     before the debate begins in earnest, let's remember that over \n     the past generation, we've produced tremendous environmental \n     progress, including in the area of energy efficiency, at far \n     less expenses than anyone could have imagined. And in the \n     process, whole new industries have been built.\n       In the past three decades, while our economy has grown, we \n     have raised, not lowered, the standards for the water our \n     children drink. While our factories have been expanding, we \n     have required them to clean up their toxic waste. While we've \n     had record numbers of new homes, our refrigerators save more \n     energy and more money for our consumers.\n       In 1970, when smog was choking our cities, the federal \n     government proposed new standards for tallpipe emissions. \n     Many environmental leaders claim the standards would do \n     little to head off catastrophe. Industry experts predicted \n     the cost of compliance would devastate the industry. It \n     turned out both sides were wrong. Both underestimated the \n     ingenuity of the American people. Auto makers comply with \n     today's much stricter emissions standards for far less than \n     half the cost predicted, and new cars emit on average only 5 \n     percent of the pollutants of the cars built in 1970.\n       We've seen this pattern over and over and over again. We \n     saw it when we joined together in the '70s to restrict the \n     use of the carcinogen, vinyl chloride. Some in the plastics \n     industry predicted massive bankruptcies, but chemists \n     discovered more cost-effective substitutes and the industries \n     thrived. We saw this when we phased out lead and gasoline. \n     And we see it in our acid rain trading program--now 40 \n     percent ahead of schedule--at costs less than 50 percent of \n     even the most optimistic cost projections. We see it as the \n     chlorofluorocarbons are being taken out of the atmosphere at \n     virtually no cost in ways that apparently are beginning \n     finally to show some thickening of the ozone layer again.\n       The lesson here is simple: Environmental initiatives, if \n     sensibly designed, flexibly implemented, cost less than \n     expected and provide unforeseen economic opportunities. So \n     while we recognize that the challenge we take on today is \n     larger than any environmental mission we have accepted in the \n     past, climate change can bring us together around what \n     America does best--we innovate, we compete, we find solutions \n     to problems, and we do it in a way that promotes \n     entrepreneurship and strengthens the American economy.\n       If we do it right, protecting the climate will yield not \n     costs, but profits, not burdens, but benefits; not sacrifice, \n     but a higher standard of living. There is a huge body of \n     business evidence now showing that energy savings give better \n     service at lower cost with higher profit. We have to tear \n     down barriers to successful markets and we have to create \n     incentives to enter them. I call on American business to lead \n     the way, but I call upon government at every level--federal, \n     state, and local--to give business the tools they need to get \n     the job done, and also to set an example in all our \n     operations.\n       And let us remember that the challenge we face today is not \n     simply about targets and timetables. It's about our most \n     fundamental values and our deepest obligations.\n       Later today, I'm going to have the honor of meeting with \n     Ecumenical Patriarch Batholomew I, the spiritual leader of \n     300,000,000 Orthodox Christians--a man who has always \n     stressed the deep obligations inherent in God's gift to the \n     natural world. He reminds us that the first part of the word \n     ``ecology'' derives from the Greek word for house. In his \n     words, in order to change the behavior toward the house we \n     all share, we must rediscover spiritual linkages that may \n     have been lost and reassert human values. Of course, he is \n     right. It is our solemn obligation to move forward with \n     courage and foresight to pass our home on to our children and \n     future generations.\n       I hope you believe with me that his is just another \n     challenge in America's long history, one that we can meet in \n     the way we have met all past challenges. I hope that you \n     believe with me that the evidence is clear that we can do it \n     in a way that grows the economy, not with denial, but with a \n     firm and glad embrace of yet another challenge of renewal. We \n     should be glad that we are alive today to embrace this \n     challenge, and we should do it secure in the knowledge that \n     our children and grandchildren will thank us for the \n     endeavor.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I also point out it is true that yesterday \nthe group of 77 and China proposed a 15 percent reduction in greenhouse \ngases by the year 2010 under a framework that would exempt developing \nnations. That is a proposal that would do serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy. It does completely ignore the growing contributions of \ndeveloping nations to the problem. It anticipates a command-and-control \nmodel that would undermine all of the opportunities for cost savings \ninherent in the market-based solutions that the President has proposed. \nI believe that is a proposal that U.S. Senators ought to oppose, and I \nam confident we would. But that is not what the President will agree \nto. That is not what the President has proposed. That is not, clearly, \nthe negotiating framework within which the United States will attempt \nto approach this treaty.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the remarks of the President so they \nwill understand how fully it is within the framework of the resolution \nthat the Senate passed. I hope my colleagues will stand back and really \nmake judgments based on a fair appraisal of our negotiating position \nand ultimately what we hope to achieve in Kyoto.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I would just say it is my hope, \nobviously, we are about to be able to talk about the framework in which \nwe are going to proceed on campaign finance reform. I would like to \nthank all of those parties who have worked together to try to come to \nwhat I think is a reasonable agreement on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas in morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--of course, I \nwill not object--I wonder if I could get consent to be recognized after \nthe majority leader and the minority leader, who are going be \nrecognized a little later?

Mr. President, this weekend, Chinese President Jiang \nZemin arrives in the United States for the first state visit by a \nChinese official since 1985. As you know, China has been described by \nmany experts as the No. 1 foreign policy challenge that the United \nStates will face in the 21st century. Next week's summit will help set \nour course as we respond to that challenge.\n  I have traveled to China six times since I first visited in 1983. \nMost recently, I traveled to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong during the \nAugust recess where I met with numerous senior Chinese leaders, \nincluding the Chinese Foreign Minister.\n  In my many visits and contacts, I have witnessed the enormous, and \noverall positive, changes that have taken place in China since the \ndeath of Mao. Yet, while China today is clearly not the China of the \ncultural revolution, neither is it a ``former Communist country,'' as \nPresident Clinton has suggested.\n  As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am \nespecially interested in Chinese foreign and military policies and \nChinese intelligence activities, particularly those that pose potential \nthreats to vital American interests. Last month, I convened in the \nIntelligence Committee exhaustive hearings into Chinese threats to \nUnited States national security, including the reported Chinese plan to \ninfluence United States elections.\n  I am well aware that there is no country that poses such risks, such \nopportunities, and such dilemmas for United States foreign and security \npolicy. It is clear that China today, as an emerging economic and \nmilitary power in the post-cold war, has the option, and increasingly \nthe will, to challenge vital United States interests around the globe.\n  It is equally clear that despite the demise of communism virtually \neverywhere around the globe, and despite China's extensive and \nimpressive economic liberalization, the Chinese regime remains \ndetermined to maintain its repressive domestic political system.\n  I will shortly address these issues in greater detail, but, first, I \nwould like to make just a few general points.\n  When President Clinton meets with President Jiang, he will have the \nopportunity to define the United States-China relationship in a way \nthat defends vital United States interests and promotes the values upon \nwhich our country was founded, while recognizing at the same time \nlegitimate Chinese interests and aspirations.\n  But President Clinton, I believe, must make it clear that if China \nwishes to be accepted as a responsible world power, it must act as a \nresponsible world power. If China wishes to work together to promote \npeace and stability in the region and the world at large, as President \nJiang suggested in a press interview last weekend, it must not \nundermine peace and stability in Asia and around the world by reckless \nand aggressive actions. And President Jiang, I believe, is wrong when \nhe invokes, for example, Einstein and the theory of relativity to \njustify China's refusal to comply with norms and ideals which, while \nnot yet universal, are on the march worldwide.\n  Relativity, as most of you know, is an immutable law of physics. \nRelativism is something altogether different, and it is not a concept \nto which we as Americans subscribe.\n  President Clinton, I believe, must respectfully make it clear that \nthe President of China is wrong when he says that ``democracy and human \nrights are relative concepts and not absolute and general.''\n  Our Founding Fathers did not speak in relative terms when they wrote:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these \n     rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n  The courageous demonstrators in Tiananmen Square echoed these ideals \nwhen they tried to peacefully exercise their right of consent. They \nadopted our Statue of Liberty as their symbol, and we saw it brutally \ndestroyed by Chinese tanks on TV.\n  In one final general point, we sometimes hear the refrain from the \nChinese that they do not wish to be bound by sets of rules and norms \nthat they had no say in creating.\n  There are certain truths that are not limited by time and geography, \nand the ``inalienable Rights'' spoken of by the\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\nFounding Fathers, I believe, are among them.\n  Proliferation and security issues are very important. With the end of \nthe cold war, and the end of the Soviet massive military threat that \nhad provided the glue for the United States-China relationship since \nits beginning, China has increasingly been willing to challenge core \nUnited States interests, by the destabilizing proliferation of weapons \ntechnology, and by direct and indirect threats against United States \nfriends and allies.\n  In June of this year, the CIA's nonproliferation center reported that \nChina was ``the most significant supplier of [weapons of mass \ndestruction]-related goods and technology to foreign countries'' in the \nsecond half of 1996.\n  China's sales of antiship cruise missiles, ballistic missile \ntechnology, chemical weapons, materials and nuclear technology to Iran, \na hostile country whose military forces threaten United States \ninterests in an area of vital national concern, directly endanger the \nlives of American soldiers, sailors and airmen, and, as we know, \nthreaten our ability to defend our interests in the region.\n  Further, these same weapons serve to intimidate our friends and our \nallies in the Persian Gulf region. The last time the United States was \ncompelled to defend its interest in the region in Operation Desert \nStorm, we were able to create a coalition of friendly states, many of \nwhich were willing to accept the deployment of United States forces on \ntheir soil. Who can say, though, in the future that our allies would \nrespond in the same way in a future conflict if they were faced by a \ncredible threat of Iranian missiles bearing nuclear, chemical or \nbiological warheads?\n  The threat from Chinese technology sales is not limited, Mr. \nPresident, to weapons of mass destruction. Accurate, conventionally \narmed missiles, especially antiship cruise missiles like the C-802's \nthat China has sold to Iran, pose a serious danger to United States \nforces. Remember the U.S.S. Stark. Bear in mind that the single \ngreatest American loss of life in the Persian Gulf war occurred when an \nIraqi Scud missile with a conventional payload struck a barracks in \nDhahran, Saudi Arabia.\n  It is difficult to speak of ``working together to promote peace and \nstability'' when, for example, China has reportedly supplied Iran with \nhundreds of missile guidance systems, and in the second half of 1996 \ncontributed ``a tremendous variety of assistance'' to Iran's missile \nprogram, according to the CIA.\n  The transfer of nuclear and missile technology to Pakistan, despite \nrepeated United States objections, jeopardizes the stability of South \nAsia and flies in the face of United States nonproliferation goals, \neven though it is less of a direct threat to United States forces. But \nby increasing the likelihood of a nuclear war that could kill millions \nof innocent people, China jeopardizes its claim to be seen as a \nresponsible world power.\n  It is in this context that we consider the administration's reported \nplans to announce the implementation of the 1985 United States-China \nAgreement for Nuclear Cooperation. This agreement cannot, by law, be \nimplemented until the President certifies to Congress that China has \nmet a number of conditions, notably, one, that effective measures are \nin place to ensure that any United States assistance is used for the \nintended peaceful activities; and, two, China has provided additional \ninformation on its nuclear nonproliferation policies, and that based on \nthis and all other information, including intelligence information, \nChina is not in violation of paragraph 2 of section 129 of the Atomic \nEnergy Act which, among other things, bars United States nuclear \nassistance to any country that has assisted any other country to \nacquire nuclear capabilities and has failed to take sufficient steps to \nterminate such assistance.\n  According to press reports, Mr. President, China has made or is \nwilling to make a number of commitments in order to obtain this \ncertification. United States diplomats are now in Beijing trying to \nnail down an agreement on these issues. And at this stage, after years \nof hair splitting and denying with respect to similar commitments in \nthe past--hair splitting and denial, I might add, on the part of both \nGovernments--these commitments must be, I believe, unambiguous and in \nwriting if they are to convince the United States Congress.\n  Just last week, China joined the Zangger Committee, which imposes \nsome modest controls on nuclear exports. The administration also \nreportedly believes that China has complied with its May 1996 \ncommitment not to provide assistance to any unsafe- guarded nuclear \nfacility.\n  In addition, China has reportedly agreed to cease selling antiship \ncruise missiles to Iran. While agreement on nuclear cooperation is not \nconditioned on such transfers of advanced conventional weapons, it \nwould certainly be difficult for the administration to argue for \nnuclear cooperation while China was continuing to sell advanced \nmunitions that could be targeted on U.S. naval vessels protecting \nfreedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf.\n  As a result of these actions, and other actions, administration \nofficials believe they can make the statutorily required certification, \nif not at the summit, then in the foreseeable future. If and when such \na certification is made, the Congress will have the opportunity to \nreview and, if necessary, overturn this certification.\n  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I am asking the Director \nof Central Intelligence to provide the Intelligence Committee with the \ninformation upon which the administration would base its determination. \nThe committee will also closely scrutinize this intelligence to ensure \nthat it does support the administration's determination, whatever it \nis.\n  But, Mr. President, without prejudging my decision, should the matter \ncome before the Senate, I have the following concerns about early \nimplementation of a nuclear agreement. It seems likely today, Mr. \nPresident, and for the immediate future that China lacks the military \nforces to seriously challenge the U.S. military power in the region.\n  However, Mr. President, as the only great power whose defense \nspending has increased in recent years, China is acquiring advanced \nmissile, naval, air, amphibious, and other forces capable of projecting \npower in East Asia and the Pacific region.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the Chinese military apparently has \nlearned the lessons of the American victory in the Persian Gulf war, \nwhich demonstrated the superiority of modern technology.\n  Second, in its commitments to date, China has, in effect, agreed only \nto control sales to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. This commitment \nsounds useful on its face, but it is potentially meaningless in \ncountries like Iran and Pakistan that are reportedly pursuing a \nclandestine military program, because equipment, materiel, and know-how \nfrom safeguarded facilities can be transferred to other unsafeguarded \nfacilities, as we all know.\n  Third, Mr. President, the Congress will want to closely scrutinize \nthe text of any commitments by the Chinese Government.\n  In particular, I believe we must ascertain whether these recent \npromises are limited to halting any future cooperation or trade in \nstrategic technology or, Mr. President, whether they also apply to \nending existing contracts and transactions that have been ongoing.\n  If they are only to apply to future activities, then I would be \nconcerned that a whole host of ongoing and dangerous cooperative \nventures between China and Iran and other countries would in effect be \n``grandfathered'' and thus not prohibited.\n  Fourth, China must recognize that mere grudging compliance with the \nletter of its international agreements does not make China a \nresponsible member of the world community. I believe, Mr. President, \nthat China must go beyond a narrow reading of its obligations to \ndemonstrate by actions as well as words that it accepts, as it has not \ndone in the past, that the spread of dangerous and destabilizing \nmilitary technologies is not in anyone's interest, including China's.\n  China, I believe, should, therefore, cease its cooperation with all \nIranian nuclear, missile, and other military programs, even if a \nparticular transaction may be permissible under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the Missile Technology Control Regime, or other \ninternational legal agreements.\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\n  I would like to know, Mr. President, how the Chinese foreign and \nmilitary policy in Asia will work in the future.\n  In the wake of the cold war, China, which for years viewed the U.S. \npresence in East Asia and the Western Pacific as a stabilizing force, \nnow resents a security structure that is increasingly viewed as \nintended--to quote some of them--to ``contain'' China. Most \ntroublesome, China has shown a willingness to pursue its goals in the \nregion by the threat or use of force.\n  Mr. President, as we were reminded in last year's Taiwan Straits \ncrisis, Beijing has never renounced the use of force to reunify Taiwan \nwith the mainland.\n  President Clinton, I believe, will have an opportunity to have a \nserious discussion with the Chinese President about how bracketing \nTaiwan with missiles, followed by a thinly veiled threat against the \nUnited States, comports with his stated goals of ``maintaining peace \nand stability in the region and the world at large.''\n  Our President also must make clear, I believe, our determination that \nthe Taiwan issue be resolved peacefully so that China will never be \ntempted to resolve it by force.\n  In addition, Mr. President, to tension over Taiwan, China has used \nand threatened force to enforce its other claims in the South China \nSea. This undermines a lot of allies and friends.\n  It seems likely that today and for the immediate future, Mr. \nPresident, China lacks the military forces to seriously challenge U.S. \nmilitary power in the region. However, as the only great power whose \ndefense spending has increased in recent years, China is certainly \nacquiring advanced missile, naval, air, amphibious and other forces \ncapable of projecting power, as I reminded my colleagues just a few \nminutes ago.\n  Mr. President, to speak of human rights in the area there, in 1996, \nin a damning and exhaustive report on Chinese human rights practices, \nthe State Department concluded that ``almost all public dissent against \nthe central authorities was silenced by intimidation, exile, or \nimposition of prison terms or administrative detention.''\n  In addition to its suppression of political dissent, China continues \nto maintain a cruel and massive network of forced labor camps. They \ncontinue also an inhumane one-child policy, including forced abortion, \nrepression of religious groups, use of forced labor, and ongoing \nrepression in Tibet.\n  President Clinton, I believe, must place President Jiang on notice \nthat Americans are offended by the notion that human rights are \n``relative'' and that their practices fit within an acceptable \ndefinition of human dignity.\n  I believe, Mr. President, we must ask ourselves, how much real \nprogress can we make in our relationship with China as long as the \nregime feels compelled to stamp out every ounce of political dissent \nand believes that it cannot survive without the ``laogai'' labor camp \nsystem?\n  Mr. President, on a somewhat more positive note, economic \ndevelopments, both within China and between China and the United \nStates, continue to generally move in the right direction. However, we \nencourage China to continue to take the painful but necessary steps to \nqualify China for membership in the World Trade Organization, notably \nin the area of opening China's markets. The sooner they do, I believe, \nthe better off they will be.\n  We are also encouraged to see some meaningful progress on the \nprotection of intellectual property rights.\n  Americans support China in its search for prosperity for its people. \nBut we do not, Mr. President, support, and will not tolerate, attempts \nto build prosperity by ignoring the rules of international trade. Nor \nwill Americans support prosperity built, even in part, on the backs of \nforced laborers or prosperity that is the result of a Faustian pact in \nwhich the Chinese people are forced to effectively surrender their \npolitical and human rights in return for economic growth.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up and be clear on where I stand. I \nsupport, as most of us do, a strong United States-China relationship, \nand I have always done so. President Clinton can work with President \nJiang to raise Sino-United States relations to a new high level, as the \nChinese President has requested.\n  But to truly protect American interests and reflect American values, \nthis relationship cannot be based on ceremony alone. We cannot gloss \nover problems or sweep them under the rug or keep them unfulfilled--and \nunenforced--as promises.\n  I believe, Mr. President, it must be based on responsible \ninternational behavior with respect to nonproliferation and on \nrefraining from the threat or use of force. Our relationship must be \nbased on steady and consistent progress toward political as well as \neconomic freedom in China.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate majority \nleader is to be recognized.\n  In his absence, the Chair recognizes the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I had wanted to take the floor to speak on \nthe highway bill, but Mr. Chafee was here and he indicated he wanted to \nget the floor first. As he is the manager of the bill, I have no \nquarrel with that, so I will not speak on that subject at the moment. I \nalso indicated I would expect to follow both leaders. Inasmuch as none \nof these aforementioned Senators is seeking recognition at this time, I \nhave sought recognition and will speak briefly but not talk at the \nmoment on the highway bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11022-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11024-S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will speak with reference to the so-called \nline-item veto of the fiscal year 1998 Military Construction \nAppropriations Act.\n  I received a letter today from Mr. Franklin D. Raines, Director of \nthe Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, \nwhich I shall read into the Record. The letter is dated October 23, \n1997. It is addressed to me. It reads as follows:\n\n       I am writing to provide the Administration's views on S. \n     1292, the bill Disapproving the Cancellations Transmitted by \n     the President on October 6, 1997.\n       We understand that S. 1292 would disapprove 36 of the 38 \n     projects that the President canceled for the FY 1998 Military \n     Construction Appropriations Act. The Administration strongly \n     opposes this disapproval bill. If the resolution were \n     presented to the President in its current form, the \n     President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the \n     bill.\n       The President carefully reviewed the 145 projects that \n     Congress funded that were not included in the FY 1998 Budget. \n     The President used his authority responsibly to cancel \n     projects that were not requested in the budget, that would \n     not substantially improve the quality of life of military \n     service members and their families, and that would not begin \n     construction in 1998 because the Defense Department reported \n     that no design work had been done on it. The President's \n     action saves $287 million in budget authority in 1998.\n       While we strongly oppose S. 1292, we are committed to \n     working with Congress to restore funding for those projects \n     that were canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data \n     provided by the Department of Defense.\n       Sincerely, Franklin D. Raines, Director.\n\n  The letter indicates that an identical letter was sent to the \nHonorable Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. President, we have all heard that the devil is in the details and \nthat it is advisable always to read the fine print. I take the floor at \nthis time, as I have indicated already, just mainly because nobody else \nis seeking recognition and I am waiting an opportunity to talk further \nwith respect to the highway bill.\n  Now, as I look at this letter more closely, it says--I have already \nread it in its entirety--it says in part, ``The Administration strongly \nopposes this disapproval bill. If the resolution were presented to the \nPresident in its current form, the President's senior advisers would \nrecommend that he veto the bill.''\n\n  Now, early today, Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, met with the Appropriations Committee and discussed a \nmeasure of disapproval of the President's cancellation of 36 of the 38 \nprojects from the fiscal year 1998 Military Construction Appropriations \nAct. The committee met and reported out the disapproval measure by a \nvery wide margin. I think that only two votes were cast against \nreporting the measure. So that has been done.\n  With reference to the letter from Mr. Raines, let me say at the \nbeginning, I have great respect for Mr. Raines, the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget. He is a very able director and a very \nhonorable man, as far as I\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nknow. He has always treated me as I hope to be treated. And as I expect \nto treat others. I respect the President and the Presidency, so what I \nsay has nothing to do with the individuals personally.\n  That being said, let me more particularly call attention to this \nsentence: ``The administration strongly opposes this disapproval \nbill,'' Mr. Raines says. ``If the resolution were presented to the \nPresident in its current form, the President's senior advisers would \nrecommend that he veto the bill.''\n  My response would be, so what? Go ahead, veto the bill.\n  Now, more particularly I call attention to the second sentence in the \nthird paragraph, which reads as follows: ``The President used his \nauthority responsibly to cancel projects that were not requested in the \nbudget.''\n  Now, Mr. President, the word that intrigues me in this sentence is \nthe word ``authority.'' ``The President used his authority responsibly \nto cancel projects that were not requested in the budget.'' Now, where \ndoes one go, may I ask, to find the President's ``authority'' to cancel \nprojects that were not requested in the budget? From what act does he \nderive his authority to cancel projects solely on the basis that they \nwere not requested in the budget? Does one go to the Constitution?\n  Well, let's see if we can find it in the Constitution. Therein, in \narticle II, section 3, I note these words:\n\n       He [meaning the President of the United States] shall from \n     time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of \n     the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures \n     as he shall judge necessary and expedient. . .''\n\n  That is what the Constitution says with respect to the President's \nmaking recommendations to Congress. So, he submits his State of the \nUnion message, he submits his budget, and so on, but ``He shall. . \n.recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge \nnecessary and expedient.''\n  But does that language give him authority to ``cancel projects that \nwere not requested in the budget?'' That language doesn't do it.\n  Well, let's turn to the language that speaks specifically of the \nPresident's veto authority. That is in section 7 of article I.\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.\n\n  It doesn't say there in that section that he shall not sign a bill if \nit contains any items not requested in the budget. It says, ``if he \napproves [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not [meaning if he doesn't \napprove it] he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in \nwhich it shall have originated.''\n  So I find no authority in the Constitution for the President to \ncancel projects solely for the reason that they were not requested in \nthe budget.\n  Now, let's take a look at the Line-Item Veto Act, Public Law 104-130. \nLet's see what it says. This is the act under which the President has \nacted. This is the deformed, malformed, illegitimate end-run that \nCongress made around the Constitution when it passed that bill. This is \nthe act that we, in one of our weakest moments in the history of the \ncountry, passed and gave the President this so-called ``authority.'' \nBut let's see if even in that monstrosity there is authority to cancel \nprojects solely on the basis that they were not requested in the \nbudget. Let's see. Let's read:\n\n       Section. In general--notwithstanding the provisions of \n     parts A and B, and subject to the provisions of this part, \n     the President may, with respect to any bill or joint \n     resolution that has been signed into law pursuant to Article \n     I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States, cancel \n     in whole (1) any dollar amount of discretionary budget \n     authority; (2) any item of new direct spending; or (3) any \n     limited tax benefit, if the President, A, determines that \n     such cancellation will (1) reduce the Federal budget deficit; \n     (2) not impair any essential government functions; and (3) \n     not harm the national interest.\n\n  It doesn't say that the President has authority to cancel projects \nbecause they were not requested in the budget. It doesn't say that at \nall. It doesn't say that the President may cancel items that were not \nincluded in the budget. It doesn't say that at all. It says that if he \ndetermines that such cancellation will reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit, or not impair any essential Government functions, not harm the \nnational interest''--all three.\n  So I simply wanted to bring to the Members' attention this letter, in \nwhich the very distinguished and highly respected Franklin D. Raines, \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget states:\n\n       The President used his authority responsibly to cancel \n     projects that were not requested in the budget.\n\n  I don't find anywhere in the Constitution, or in the ill-advised act \nitself, any authority for the President to cancel a project simply \nbecause it was not requested in the budget.\n  Well, so much for that. I think we can expect this administration, or \nany other administration, as long as this act is on the statute books, \nto expand upon it, to read into it whatever they want to see, read into \nit whatever they want to read into it. Here is a good example of it. We \nhave now found that they are interpreting the act to give the President \nthe authority to cancel projects on the basis that they were not \nrequested in the budget.\n  Additionally, in the last paragraph, Mr. Raines says.\n\n       . . . we are committed to working with Congress to restore \n     funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of \n     inaccuracies in the data provided by the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  So the President, in this letter, through his Director of OMB--I \nwould have appreciated it if the President had written the letter \nhimself and signed it himself. But we are told here by the President \nthrough his Director of OMB that, indeed, projects were canceled as a \nresult of inaccuracies in the data provided to the Department of \nDefense.\n\n  Now he says they are committed to working with Congress to restore \nfunding. How are they going to do that? The President can't go back now \nthat he has unilaterally amended that law--the fiscal year 1998 \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Act. Now that he has unilaterally \namended that law, he cannot go back and put those items into law. He \nhas unilaterally amended it after he signed it into law, so he can't go \nback and put those items in. The heads have been severed from those \nitems. They are dead, dead, dead. So he cannot go back and breathe new \nlife into those items. How is he going to restore funding? He says he \nis going to veto this disapproval resolution. That is not going to help \nif he vetoes that act.\n  But we are told that if the resolution reported out of committee \ndisapproving 36 of the projects is presented to the President in its \ncurrent form, the President's senior advisers would recommend he veto \nthat bill. That is not going to help restore the projects that were \nvetoed by mistake. So we have to start all over again, unless we can \noverride that veto. It takes two-thirds of both Houses to do it. The \nold chickens are coming home to roost.\n  So my advice to Members is that they go back--and my office will be \nvery happy to assist any Member who wishes to have assistance in the \nmatter--go back and read all of my speeches against the line-item veto. \nIf they will assure me they will do that, I will quit talking. I will \nquit making speeches on this subject. But all Members who voted for \nthis pernicious piece of legislation will have to assure me and have to \nshow me that they are going back and reading every speech that I have \nmade over the years in opposition to a so-called ``line-item veto.'' If \nthey will do that, then I will quit talking on it. But I think that \nthose Members who voted for that abominable piece of legislation and \nwho are now bellyaching about it should be required to go back and read \nevery one of those speeches all over again. Read them again.\n  Then I would suggest that they read the Constitution, because it is \nhe who has read it lately that counts. I guess that should be the way \nof thinking of it, how lately have we read it?\n  Let me just read one section, the very first sentence of the \nConstitution. I am reading it so it will not only sound authentic but \nit will look to be authentic because I am reading it. I am not \nrepeating it from memory. I am reading it. Here it is from the \nConstitution:\n\n       All legislative powers herein granted--\n\n  If legislative powers are not ``herein granted,'' they don't exist, \ndo they?\n\n       All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\n     which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  That is it. That is the whole kit and caboodle. That is where the \nauthority rests to legislate. The authority to legislate rests right \nthere. And it doesn't include the President of the United States. Only \nthe Congress can legislate.\n  Point No. 2: To amend a bill or resolution is to legislate.\n  Am I correct? Yes.\n  To amend a bill is to legislate. To amend a bill is to act within--is \nto act pursuant to that first section of the first article, which I \nhave just read.\n  Point No. 3: To move to strike an item is a motion and is a \nlegislative act.\n  To move to strike. That is a legislative act. And it is vested only \nin the Congress of the United States by virtue of that one sentence \nthat I have just read.\n  Right? Correct.\n  Now, the act that Senators are griping about says that the \nPresident--any President--after having signed a bill into law may \nwithin the next 10 seconds, may within the next 10 minutes, may within \nthe next day, may within the next 5 days go back and take a new look at \nthat law, and he may move to strike. He may not only move to strike; he \nmay strike items from that law.\n\n  If the distinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], let us say, \nwho is presiding over this Chamber at this moment, moves in this \nChamber to strike an item from a bill, that is a legislative act.\n  So, if he moves to strike an item, or if he is moving to amend a \nbill, he has to have a majority of this body to support his motion to \nstrike or cancel. And, if he gets a majority, if all Members are here \nand voting, he will have to have 51 Members--51 votes, including his \nown--to succeed in striking or cancelling that item from the bill. But \nhe has not finished yet. If he accomplishes that, a majority of the \nother body also has to agree to his motion to strike, and a majority of \nthe other body, if everyone is present and voting over there, would be \n218.\n  So he has to have 218 votes in that other body to support his motion \nto strike or cancel this item from an appropriations bill--218 in the \nother body, 51 in this body. If all Members are present, he has to have \n269 Members of both bodies supporting his motion to cancel.\n  That is a legislative act. Does anyone disagree with that? No. Nobody \ndisagrees with that. That is all accurately and correctly stated.\n  But the Congress passed an act. We in the Senate voted for it on \nMarch 23, 1995, and it went to conference. And it lay dormant in \nconference for about a year. Finally, I think it was Mr. Dole who got \nbehind it and urged the leadership in both Houses to pass that act \nbecause he anticipated being the first to wield the line-item veto pen.\n  So it was brought back as a conference report. And, on March 27, \n1996, the Senate stabbed itself in the back and adopted that conference \nreport giving the President of the United States--any President; not \njust this one; any President of the United States--the authority to \nunilaterally cancel or amend a law. He may do it all by himself. He \ndoesn't have to have 218 Members of the other body. He doesn't have to \nhave 51 in this body. He can simply call Mr. Raines and others in the \nexecutive branch together and say, ``What do you find in this bill, \nthis appropriations act, that Congress has just sent me here? I have \nsigned it into law. I didn't have to wait. I just went ahead and signed \nit. Now it is a law and no longer a bill. It is a law. But I have the \nauthority now to singlehandedly amend that law.''\n  Senator Coats didn't have that kind of authority. Only a majority of \nboth Houses could amend a bill.\n  I cannot for the life of me understand how grown men and women who \nhave sworn to support and defend the Constitution of the United States \nright there at that desk with their hands on the Bible--most of them \nhad their hands on the Bible or swore an oath by it--I cannot for the \nlife of me understand how grown men and women who are supposed to have \nread that Constitution, who are willing to stand up there and before \nGod and men swear to support and defend that Constitution, how they \nwould then turn right around and pass legislation that flies directly \nin the face of the first sentence of the Constitution, which says that \n``All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \nof the United States which shall consist of a Senate and House of \nRepresentatives.'' Were they using the Constitution as their guide? No. \nWere they using the polls as their guide? In all likelihood, I suppose \nthey were, because the overwhelming majority of the American people \nfavor a line-item veto.\n\n  I am going to quit very quickly.\n  Well, I wrestle with my imagination. I ponder over this question. And \nI try to come to some logical conclusion as to why Congress did what it \ndid. Oh, I know there are some folks who will say, ``Well, you can \nexpect Senator Byrd to be against the line-item veto because he likes \npork.'' He likes pork. Let me tell Senators one thing. This Senator \nwill not, will not, will not negotiate with this President or any other \nPresident over an item from West Virginia that he wishes to line-item \nveto. I will not negotiate with him. They may call and say, look, if \nyou will do this or that, we will not line-item veto that item. My \nanswer will be, ``Go to it. Veto it.''\n  You mean that Senator Byrd would not negotiate with the White House \nover a piece of pork for his State? You try me and see. No. I am not \nfor negotiating. When it has reached that point, the subcommittees and \ncommittees have acted and have conducted hearings and earmarked the \nlegislation and it has come before the Senate and the House--there may \nhave been efforts to strike it out along the way, there may not have \nbeen, but once it reaches that point and comes back in the conference \nreport, no, I am not negotiating with any President. If he wants to \nveto, go to it. I think there is a principle that is far more important \nhere than pork for West Virginia or any other State.\n  So there it is. ``Lay on, Macduff; and damn'd be him that first cries \nout `hold, enough.' ''\n  I guess there is a song which says, ``I'll still be wondering why.'' \nAnd so I am still going to be wondering why. Whatever got into the \nheads and minds and hearts and livers of the Members of these two \nbodies that they would be so gullible as to hand to this President or \nany other President part of the people's power over the purse, which, \naccording to the Constitution of the United States, is vested right \nhere in the hands of the directly elected representatives of the \npeople.\n  Well, think about it because you are going to hear more about it. You \nare going to see more line-item vetoes. And if they want to line-item \nveto pork for West Virginia, ``Lay on, Macduff.'' I am not negotiating.\n  But I hope Members will think about it and will conclude that it was \na mistake and that come the appropriate time they will vote to repeal \nthat nefarious act. And I hope that Members will not bow down and \nscrape and negotiate with the White House about it. Let the President \nveto it. He has the right to veto under the Constitution any bill he \nwants to veto. He has that right according to the Constitution. He has \nthat right.\n  I am not willing to negotiate to keep him from doing it. If he vetoes \nit, I know what our rights are. The Congress may uphold his veto or it \nmay reject it. So let's go by this Constitution, and if Members are \nworth their salt, having made this mistake, they will not make the \nadditional mistake of negotiating with any administration to keep their \nlittle items from being vetoed. Because if we do that, we merely \nlegitimize the wrongful act that Congress has already committed. I do \nnot believe in legitimizing it. Let the President veto it. Go to it.\n  Mr. President, I thank all Senators for listening. Those who didn't \nlisten, they will have further opportunity to listen. And I hope that \nat least those who read the Record 50 years from now will find that \nsomebody up here had read the Constitution lately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia still here. Previously, I had said that I wanted to \ngo ahead of the Senator on some discussion in connection with the bill \nthat is before us, the\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\nISTEA bill. Does the Senator want to go ahead now on that to discuss \nsomething? I understand he is not going to present any motions or \nanything but discuss it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Not at the moment. I may come back shortly. But I do thank \nthe Senator from Rhode Island for his kind offer.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11024-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11027-S11028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHILD CARE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today the White House is sponsoring an all-\nday conference on child care. I believe the President and First Lady \nhave correctly identified this as an important issue to families, and \nparticularly to working families in America. A number of experts have \nbeen invited to testify and to participate in panel discussions \nthroughout the day.\n  This is an important but yet also a very complex issue. The \ncomplexity of the issue is that there is one segment of our population \nthat seriously needs high-quality day care in order to work--work that \nfor many has been required through welfare reform. Others work out of \neconomic necessity; both mother and father need to be employed. And \nagain for others, who are single parents raising their children, they \nneed to provide the financial wherewithal to do that. The focus on the \nchild care conference at the White House correctly focuses on this \nsegment of our population.\n  The conference will focus on three questions: how to increase access \nfor child care; how to make it more affordable; and how to guarantee \nthe quality of child care so that children will be safe.\n  But, what the conference did not focus on was another segment of the \npopulation, in fact a majority segment of the population, the nearly 50 \npercent who do not have both parents working and another 25 percent who \ndo not work out of the home full time. One of the questions, \nunfortunately, that will not be discussed at the White House today is \nhow we can ensure that we are not discouraging or sending the wrong \nsignals to the second segment, those parents, those mothers who stay \nhome and do not work and those parents who keep one parent at home \nraising the child while the other works or they take separate shifts or \nthey have worked out arrangements to raise their own children.\n  There is a legitimate need, I believe, to address the first question, \nhow we provide child care for working families, for single mothers, for \nwelfare mothers and others. But there is also a legitimate and \nessential question that needs to be discussed along with that, and that \nis what can we do to help those who have made the decision to stay at \nhome?\n  We have recently had some exciting developments concerning infant \nbrain development, about the much earlier than originally thought \ndevelopment, the connection of synapses that occur, the billions of \nthese connections that occur at very, very early ages and how important \nit is to recognize that and to make sure that children receive the \ncorrect upbringing, stimulation and so forth to foster that \ndevelopment.\n  Again, unfortunately, there has been little discussion along with \nthat about the critical nature of the emotional development of the \ninfant, because, after all, as many experts have told us, it is the \nemotional development of the infant that is the fuel that drives the \nautomobile, to use a metaphor. Unfortunately, there has been little \ndiscussion about this in the recent child care debate that focuses on \nthose early years and the need for correct and effective childhood \ndevelopment. Recently, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Children and \nFamilies, I held a hearing in which we heard testimony from Dr. Diane \nFisher, who is a practicing clinical psychologist. I want to quote from \nher:\n\n       Imagine a brilliant, stimulated, optimally educated child \n     who is lacking in self-esteem, self-control, identity or \n     discipline. This in fact is what we are hearing about in our \n     schools today--privileged, indulged children who are wired to \n     the Internet but without a moral compass or a sense of \n     connection to the adults who are supposed to be present in \n     their lives.\n\n  Our committee heard about how mothers are biologically hard wired to \nform a close emotional tie with their children; that this bonding \nexperience is not a quick experience, something to be accomplished in a \nmatter of weeks or even months, but something that is a gradual process \nthat proceeds slowly and over time. Anybody who is a parent knows that. \nWe don't need studies or experts to come and testify as to the kind of \nbonding that takes place between parents and children, particularly \nmother and child, in those first critical early months and years and \nthen throughout their growing experience for the next 15 or 20 years or \nso.\n  For the last 15 years I have been involved, first, as the ranking \nRepublican on the Early Childhood, Youth and Families Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives during my service there and in the last 9 \nyears as chairman or ranking member of the Children and Families \nSubcommittee here in the Senate. Over that time I have listened to and \nread and personally visited experts in the field--sociologists, \npsychologists, child development experts, and so forth--who have \nimpressed upon me the absolutely critical element of the emotional \nattachment, the emotional connection, the bonding process between \nmother and child with infants, and mothers and fathers with their \nchildren, and how absolutely essential this correct attachment is for \nsuccessful childhood development.\n  Most of this is not accomplished through a complex formula. It is not \naccomplished through a lot of educational training, academic training, \nor how-to books. It is accomplished intuitively by a mother motivated \nby love and enjoyment of that child. It takes an enormous amount of \nlove and motivation to want to pay attention to the subtle cues that an \ninfant or a young child sends on a moment-by-moment, hour-by-hour, \ndaily basis. Frankly, it is very rare to find a caregiver who is either \nable or motivated by that same degree of love and attention and \nmotivation to pay that kind of attention to a child. Often they have a \nnumber of children to look out for, and it is just keeping some \nsemblance of order in the child-care facility that becomes the \nparamount challenge for the child-care provider.\n  We talk a lot about and they are talking today at the White House a \nlot about the term quality. Often that is used by the experts, or those \nwho are discussing this, as a code word, ``quality'' meaning we need \nmore control, we need more regulation, we need more oversight of child \ncare facilities.\n  The quality of child care, for those children, especially children 0 \nto 3, is more than just having developmentally appropriate materials or \nan effective well-located site staffed by trained individuals that is \nimportant in child care, although it is only one form of child care, \nbut quality is, I believe, more clearly related, and according to the \nexperts we had testify before our committee, more clearly related to \nlove and nurture and, as such, I believe, we have to recognize that it \nis a child's mother, a child's father that are in the best position to \noffer that love and nurture to their children.\n  As one mother told me, and this is someone who holds an advanced \ndegree in family therapy, an expert in the field of raising children, \nshe said a baby, a young child, needs to be adored. There isn't a child \ncare provider in the world that can adore my child like I can adore my \nchild. Only a mother can truly adore a child, provide the kind of \nnurturing that children need when they are growing up. We know that and \nmost American people know this.\n  A recent Gallup poll for the Los Angeles Times said 73 percent of the \nAmerican public believes too many children are being raised in day care \nand not nearly enough are being raised by their mother at home, and \nchildren fare best when raised by their mother at home. That figure was \nup from 68\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\npercent who responded that way in 1987.\n  If we truly believe in quality child care, then I believe we should \nfocus much of our attention, not just on ways in which we can provide \nimproved quality care for children in day care settings, for those \nmothers who have no choice, for those families that have no choice, for \nthose welfare mothers who have no choice but to move into the \nworkplace, but we should also provide equal attention to those \ninitiatives that can make it easier for families to have at least one \nparent remain at home, those families that can juggle their work \nschedules so that the primary care for their child is from parent to \nchild rather than from paid provider to child.\n  The White House is going to be issuing a number of initiatives, \naccording to reports, about how we as a society, both the private \nsector and the public sector, can provide assistance for child care \nfacilities to improve the quality and access to child care. But \nshouldn't we also be discussing the positive family friendly policies \nthat can provide assistance to those who have the ability or make the \nchoice to stay at home with their children, like extended job protected \nleave?\n  As a Republican conservative, I broke with many of my fellow \ncolleagues on the issue of family leave. I believe it is an important \nprovision to guarantee that mothers have the choice of taking at least \n12 weeks after the child is born to be with that child, but beyond \nthat, the initiatives of part-time work, flextime, comptime, job \nsharing, telecommuting, and other corporate policies which a majority \nof families would prefer if they had the option, because many parents \nare willing to work less and provide more care for their own children \nif it is possible for them to do so and still maintain economic \nviability.\n  According to a 1991 survey sponsored by the Hilton Hotel Corp., two-\nthirds of Americans said they would take salary reductions in order to \nget more time off from work. There is another way we can focus Federal \nattention appropriately on making it easier for families to provide \ncare for children at home: Tax fairness.\n  In my time in the Congress, I haven't agreed on too many issues with \nformer Representative Pat Schroeder, but one thing she said that I did \nidentify with and I have always remembered is she said you can get a \nbigger tax break for breeding racehorses than you can for raising \nchildren, and she was right. The Tax Code over the years has penalized \nparents for spending time with their children by narrowly linking tax \nbenefits to day care expenses and provisions on the other side of the \nequation. The dependent care tax credit, for example, is constructed in \nsuch a way that the more time a child spends in day care and the \nhigher, therefore, the family's day care expenses, the greater the tax \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, I don't want to ignore the reality that growing \neconomic and cultural pressures make it difficult for parents to spend \nas much time with their children as they would like. We all face that \nproblem. Tying tax benefits to day care expenses makes matters worse, \nnot better. It penalizes parents for caring for their own children by \nredistributing income by those who make extensive use of out-of-home \nprofessional day care services. Tax benefits which favor day care over \nparental care should be replaced, I suggest, by increasing benefits for \nall families with young children.\n  While I fully expect that the White House Conference on Child Care \nwill emerge with new policy recommendations, such as model standards \nfor quality care or the expansion of the military model of child care \nin the private sector, I would caution that we need to pay equal \nattention to the facts that we have learned about the critical \nimportance, especially in early years, about the need of strong \nattachment between mother, father and child.\n  We also must ask the question: Are there policies which we can \nsupport and provide leadership on that will, in fact, make that \nattachment a true priority? Because if we have learned anything over \nthe past couple of decades, it is how critical that attachment between \nchild and family, mother and child, father and child is and the \nuncomfortable fact that for many, quality child care, though important, \ncan never be an effective substitute for parental attachment.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that in this day of focus on provision of \nchild care, we can also focus our attention on what true quality care \nis and look for ways in which we can initiate and implement policies in \nthe Congress and in the workplace that can provide mothers and families \nwith this very, very important and essential element to successful \nchild raising.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I also thank the Presiding \nOfficer for giving this Senator the opportunity to speak at this point \nas opposed to presiding. I appreciate his consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11027-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11028-S11029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to address the direction of \nour country's relationship with the People's Republic of China. As we \nspeak, the Clinton administration is busily preparing for next week's \nstate visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. A state visit is the most \nformal and ceremonial diplomatic event hosted by the United States. It \ninvolves champagne receptions and flattering toasts.\n  While United States-Chinese relations are crucial and important for \nboth countries, I believe it would be inappropriate for President \nClinton to welcome the Chinese leader in a state visit at this time.\n  The United States, the world's leading free nation, should not give a \nred carpet welcome to China's Communist leadership until we see greater \nstrides on human rights, religious freedom and other issues in that \ncountry. Rather than a ceremonial visit, we should be holding a working \nvisit with the Chinese leadership, concentrating on the very real \nissues which exist between our two nations.\n  In my view, the President should put specific demands on the Chinese \nleadership, calling for improved human rights policies and an end to \nweapons proliferation.\n  Mr. President, China's record of human rights abuses and repression \nof religious faith is long and disturbing.\n  Peaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been \nsentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, \ntortured, and denied needed medical care.\n  Women pregnant with their second or third child have been coerced \ninto abortions.\n  Religious meeting places have been forcibly closed.\n  Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious leader, the Dalai \nLama, have been forced from their monasteries; some of their leaders \nhave disappeared.\n  The President's own State Department Report on Human Rights confirms \nthese allegations.\n  And recent claims by the Chinese Government that Catholics in \nparticular are few in number and not mistreated have been directly \ncontradicted by the Vatican.\n  According to the Vatican news agency, Chinese reports simply ignore \nthe existence of 8 million Catholics loyal to the Pope, as well as \nChina's violent actions in closing down secret churches and arresting \nreligious leaders.\n  China also has engaged in weapons proliferation that endangers our \nnational security.\n  Although China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and agreed \nto abide by the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime in 1992, \nviolations of both agreements continue. Especially worrisome are \nChinese sales of weapons technologies to countries which are trying to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction, countries which America regards as \nrogue nations.\n  Chinese weapons exports also have more directly threatened Americans \nhere on United States soil. Companies associated with China's Communist \nPeople's Liberation Army the PLA, have been caught attempting to sell \nsmuggled assault weapons to street gangs in Los Angeles.\n  The Clinton administration's response to these dangerous actions, in \nmy judgment, has been inadequate to say the least.\n  Last December, the administration welcomed China's Defense Minister,\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nGen. Chi Haotian, to Washington. Mr. Chi was one of the People's \nLiberation Army officers who led the military assault against the \ncitizens of the Chinese capital on June 4, 1989--the massacre in \nTiananmen Square.\n  Now the administration wants to welcome President Jiang with pomp and \ncircumstance. These actions indicate that, where China is concerned, \nwhat we have is not a policy of constructive engagement, but one of \nunconditional engagement.\n  By agreeing to this state visit without receiving any significant \nconcession on human rights, religious freedom and weapons \nproliferation, the administration may be squandering its strongest \nsource of leverage with Beijing.\n  None of this is to recommend cutting off all dialog between the \nUnited States and China. Again, I would not object to having a visit \nfor working-level purposes. But I feel the symbolism of a state visit \nis inappropriate given the current situation in China and our \nfundamental disagreements.\n  For this reason, I have cosponsored a resolution, with Senators \nFeingold  and Helms, to downgrade the upcoming event from a state visit \nto a working visit. And I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nresolution as well.\n  We must work, Mr. President, to put United States-China relations on \na more substantive basis. And that requires hard work and tough \nnegotiations.\n  The President must call for specific actions on the part of the \nChinese leadership that will improve that country's treatment of its \nown people and stop its destabilizing activities in the world at large.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, ``[China] doesn't plan to \ndiscuss issues such as human rights'' at this upcoming conference. A \nChinese Embassy spokesman even said ``we do not welcome'' advice on \nsuch matters.\n  But, welcome or not, President Clinton must insist that China's \nleaders address crucial issues like human rights. Indeed, in my view, \nthe administration has a moral duty to press a whole host of issues on \nthe Chinese Government that it may not welcome, but that are of great \nimportance to the people of China, to the United States, and to the \nworld.\n  Specifically, I believe President Clinton should demand:\n  First, that the Chinese Government dismantle nonreciprocal tariff and \nnontariff barriers to American exports to China, and stop the continued \nexport to the United States of products made with prison labor;\n  Second, that the Chinese Government cease persecuting Chinese \nChristians, as well as members of other religious faiths, and release \nall persons incarcerated for their religious or other human rights \nrelated activities;\n  Third, that China end its coercive family planning practices, \nincluding its practice of forced abortion, forced sterilization and \ninfanticide;\n  Fourth, that the Chinese Government stop its activities leading to \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced ballistic \nmissile technology; and\n  Fifth, that the Chinese Government stop its evasion of United States \nexport control and other laws.\n  Mr. President, by making these demands on the Chinese Government, the \nPresident would put in place the structure needed for a coherent China \npolicy; a policy aimed at protecting our national interests and \nimproving human rights conditions in China.\n  In addition, I believe it is crucial that the President express his \ndetermination to uphold and fully implement the Taiwan Relations Act. \nThis act provides the framework for strong economic and security \nrelations between the United States and the democratic government of \nTaiwan. Full implementation will show our commitment to freedom in the \nAsian-Pacific region.\n  If no progress is made through these means, Mr. President, Congress \nmust act. If the Chinese leadership is not willing to make significant \nreforms on its own, we must pass legislation targeting its improper \nactivities.\n  In preparation for that contingency, I have joined with a bipartisan \ngroup of colleagues to introduce the China Policy Act of 1997.\n  This legislation will set in motion a policy that will encourage the \nChinese Government to reform its human rights policies, and end its \nsales of arms and weapons technology to renegade regimes like Iran.\n  To begin with, Mr. President, the bill contains targeted sanctions \naimed directly at Chinese companies that engage in weapons and weapons \ntechnology proliferation.\n  The bill would institute targeted sanctions against PLA companies \nfound to have engaged in weapons proliferation, illegal importation of \nweapons to the United States or military or political espionage in the \nUnited States. The U.S. Government also would publish a list of other \nPLA-controlled companies.\n  This would allow American companies and consumers to decide whether \nthey wish to purchase products manufactured in whole or in part by the \nCommunist Chinese Army.\n  As important, the bill includes provisions to encourage internal \nliberalization and cultural exchanges between our two countries. It \nwould increase funding for international broadcasting to China, \nincluding Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America.\n  It also would increase funding for National Endowment for Democracy \nand the United States Information Agency student, cultural, and \nlegislative exchange programs in China.\n  The bill would contain a variety of other provisions likewise aimed \nat trying to address the concerns on a targeted basis, Mr. President, \nas opposed to the approach which has been taken, in my judgment, for \ntoo long, an approach which has focused exclusively on the issue of \nmost-favored-nation treaty status with respect to the relationship \nbetween the United States and China.\n  I think the proper way to address the concerns that many of us have \nis to focus on the specific concerns themselves and to impose, if \nappropriate, sanctions with regard to those concerns on a targeted \nbasis.\n  I firmly believe that it is America's duty as well as our interest to \nmake the extra effort required to promote freedom and democracy in \nChina and to integrate her into the community of nations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and I call on the \nPresident to demand that the Government of the People's Republic of \nChina bring itself into compliance with international standards on \nhuman rights and religious freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11028-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11029-S11032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISTEA\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been waiting all week to talk about \nsome very, very important things in the highway and transportation \nreauthorization bill, also known as ISTEA or NEXTEA. I am disappointed \nwe have been unable to move to that bill because I think everyone here \ncan agree we have journeyed far in the transportation area not only \nover the last 6 years under the just-expired ISTEA bill but over the \nlast century. We are ready to embark upon the next leg of that journey. \nI am very distressed and saddened that our colleagues are not willing \nto move forward on it.\n  I think everyone in this body and certainly most of our constituents \naround the country know the importance and the role that transportation \nplays in our everyday lives and especially in our economy. Our economic \nstability and progress is tied directly to transportation.\n  In my opinion, what really worked, what really got us moving on \ntransportation infrastructure in this Nation was President Dwight \nEisenhower's vision of an interstate system. That succeeded in building \nthe first network of modern high-speed roads linking our States with \neach other and with markets around the world.\n  As my dear friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, often \nsays, this is one world market. Our country's transportation \ninfrastructure makes it so.\n  Mr. President, my home State of Missouri has always been a leader in \nthe\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\narea of transportation. As one example, the first construction contract \nawarded under the interstate system was awarded for part of Interstate \n70 near St. Charles, MO. In fact, the first three contracts awarded \nunder this system were Missouri contracts. I think this demonstrates \none more time Missouri's fundamental commitment to and belief in \nessential infrastructure.\n  Even though my friend and colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, \nand I had some differences of opinion during the 1991 debate, I do \nagree with many of my colleagues when they give Senator Moynihan and \nthe 1997 ISTEA bill credit for moving our transportation policy \nforward. The 1991 bill was landmark legislation that enabled us to \ncraft a new generation of highway and transit programs.\n  Now, let us all recognize that transportation in this country \nincludes everything from transit systems, rail, waterways, air, \npipelines, et cetera. However, as we move forward, we must build our \nnew policy solidly on our commitment to the concrete and asphalt \nreality that roads and bridges are, and will continue to be the \nfoundation of our transportation system. The new policy will be only as \ngood as the foundation on which it is built.\n  This country has an inadequate highway infrastructure that \ncontributes to 114 deaths on our Nation's highways each day. This is \nthe equivalent of a major airline disaster each and every day of the \nyear. And, tragically, many of these fatalities are our Nation's \nchildren. As a matter of fact, motor vehicle accidents are the No. 1 \ncause of death of American children of all ages. That is truly a \nremarkable and distressing and tragic fact.\n  I have to share with you, Mr. President, the fact that Missouri's \nhighway fatality rate is above the national average. I was reminded of \nthese highway tragedies just this past week during the Columbus Day \nwork period in the State, as I have been on every opportunity I have \nhad to travel around the State of Missouri. As I went back and forth \nacross the State, I saw along the roads the little white crosses that \nhad been marked for deaths of motorists and their passengers on \nMissouri's highways. Some of the highways have very, very frequent \nintervals of white crosses. And at every stop where I talked with \npeople and listened to them talk about transportation, they told me of \nfriends, neighbors, and loved ones who had been lost in highway \naccidents. Almost everyone of us in Missouri have experienced or know \nsomebody who has experienced the loss of a loved one or a dear friend. \nEarlier this year, my good friend Gary Dickenson of Chillicothe, MO, \nwas driving from Chillicothe toward Kansas City where he had business \ninterests, where he traveled frequently on Highway 36, a highway that, \nbecause of the traffic, should have been a four-lane, divided highway. \nIt was, in fact, a two-way, two-lane highway. He met a car driven by a \nstranger to that part of the road who had crossed over the center line \nand he was killed.\n  We have had hearings in Missouri where families who have come to \ntestify for the needs of highways have told us about the tragedy that \ntheir families have felt, like the Winkler family in Moberly, and many \nothers, who lost a loved one because someone not familiar with that \nhighway, not realizing that that heavily traveled road was a two-way \nroad rather than a divided highway, crossed the center line and was in \nthe wrong lane and crashed head-on into a fatal traffic accident.\n  Now, some fatalities on our roads are as a result of drunken driving \nand improper child safety restraints. But it is clear to me that the \nmajor role in these fatalities is the unsafe condition and inadequate \ncapacity of our highways, and we really can't allow this to continue. \nIt is totally unacceptable and we have to do something about it. We \nmust improve upon our existing infrastructure and we have to determine \nbetter ways to manage our transportation needs, not only to address the \ntremendous safety needs, but for our economic competitiveness.\n  We must not forget that Americans depend upon our transportation \ninfrastructure, mainly our roads and bridges, each day, to get to and \nfrom work, school, the shopping center, doctor appointments, ball \ngames, to see friends, and to go to church. But we also know that those \nhighways and byways, those roads and those bridges are vitally \nimportant to maintaining economic prosperity. They take workers to and \nfrom jobs, and bring goods and supplies into the workplace, and they \nbring the finished products out. And only if they do so in an efficient \nand effective manner can we make sure that our products are competitive \nagainst the products of other nations in the world.\n  Well, the condition of our roads and bridges, once the envy of the \nworld, should embarrass all of us. I have listened over the years, and \njust recently on the Senate floor, to my colleagues from Northeastern \nStates talking about their transportation needs and how they think they \nare somehow more deserving of additional highway funds than are the \nSouthern and Midwestern and the Western States. On this floor, before \nthe Columbus Day State work period, a Senator from the Northeast \nalluded to that part of the country as ``the crux of our economic \nmix.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I have to disagree and, like my colleagues who \nmake those statements, be a little parochial because I argue that the \ncrux is the middle part of the country. It is Michigan, it is Missouri, \nit is Iowa, it is Arkansas, it is Illinois, it is Kansas, it is \nOklahoma, it is Louisiana, it is Minnesota, it is Wisconsin, it is \nLouisiana, it is Mississippi, and Texas. Why, Mr. President? Because \nnot only is this the heartland of the country, but in my opinion this \nis where the country's current and future growth will be.\n  Now, my State of Missouri is ``geographically privileged'' to be \nlocated not only near the geographic center of the United States, and \nit not only has the demographic or population center of the United \nStates, but it is at the center or at the confluence of our Nation's \ntwo greatest waterways, the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Not only \nhas Missouri proven itself to be the gateway to the West, but today it \nis the gateway to the North, South, East and West. Like spokes from a \nbicycle wheel, Missouri's roads and bridges are fast becoming the \narteries that feed not only our country's heartland, but the whole of \nNorth America.\n  Already, according to the Federal Highway Administration, Missouri \nhas the country's sixth largest highway system. According to the Road \nInformation Program, vehicle travel in Missouri grew by 51 percent \nbetween 1985 and 1995, compared to a national average of 37 percent. It \nis the home of the second and third largest rail hubs, the second \nfastest-growing airport in the world, and the second largest inland \nport in the United States.\n  A further example of the dynamic growth in Missouri is Branson, MO, \npopulation 4,725. I hope my colleagues--and not just those of us who \nenjoy country music--know about Branson, because in 1996 alone, Branson \nwas visited by 5.8 million guests. That requires a lot of \ntransportation to bring that many people into a community of less than \n5,000 residents.\n  In addition, we look at our two largest trading partners, Canada and \nMexico. One of the main north-south highway routes in this country is \nInterstate 35 from Loredo, TX, through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, \nIowa, and Duluth, MN.\n  Unfortunately, many coastal States forget about inland States when it \ncomes to the global economy. But for our State of Missouri, and many \nother ``inland'' States, our highway infrastructure, coupled with rail, \nair and waterways, makes us strong players in ``our one-world market.''\n  Missouri alone serves over 100 different countries around the world \nwith our exports. In 1995, our exports exceeded $5.5 billion.\n  Not only does Missouri export electronics, machinery, and chemicals, \nbut Missouri is one of the largest exporters in the country of \nagricultural products. In overall agricultural exports, Missouri is \nranked 15th among all 50 States in the value of its agricultural \nexports. Missouri is the sixth largest soybean producer and eighth \nlargest feed corn producer in the country. Missouri ranks 6th in rice \nproduction and 13th in wheat production.\n  If we in Missouri are going to continue to compete globally for \nforeign trade opportunities of the next century, not only do \nMissourians need ``fair'' trade to compete, but we need a ``fair'' \nreturn of our transportation dollars so Missourians have ``fair'' \naccess\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\nto global markets which coastal States now dominate because they \nalready enjoy such access. A fair return to Missouri is imperative \nbecause Missouri's highways and bridges are in tremendous need of more \ndollars--more of our dollars that we have been sending to Washington, \nmore of our dollars that we have shared in large measure with other \nStates. It used to be, prior to the 1991 act, that we were getting \nabout 75 cents back on every dollar we sent to Washington. We got it up \nto 80 cents after 1991. And we are hoping--hoping against hope--that \nmaybe we can pass a measure which will get us up to 92 cents, still \nsharing 8 cents of every dollar that we send to Washington with other \nStates for their transportation needs.\n\n  Permit me to quote from testimony provided by Tom Boland, a good \nfriend and chair of the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission, \nat a field hearing we held in which the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, and the \nSenator from Virginia, Senator Warner, were kind enough to participate. \nMr. Boland said:\n\n       In Missouri, we can demonstrate the need for increased \n     Federal funding to improve the safety of our highways and \n     bridges all too well. Let me take you on a short tour down \n     the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The Missouri River \n     enters the State at our far northwest corner, flows southward \n     to Kansas City, then crosses the entire State and joins the \n     Mississippi River at St. Louis. The Mississippi River forms \n     the entire eastern boundary of Missouri.\n\n  More than 40 bridges on the State and Federal highway system cross \nthese two rivers in Missouri. More than half of these bridges are \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete when evaluated by \nFederal criteria. They are too narrow or have severe weight \nrestrictions, or both, that prevent commercial vehicle use and obstruct \nthe economic vitality of many of our communities.\n  Using the Federal Highway Administration rating system, Missouri has \napproximately 11,000 centerline miles of highways rating fair or worse, \nor a lower rate. This is nearly one-third of the total State highway \nsystem. According to the Surface Transportation Policy Project Report, \n81 percent of Missouri's urban highways alone are not in good \ncondition. Over 42 percent of Missouri's 23,000 bridges are \nsubstandard.\n  Missouri has transportation needs that need to be met.\n  Ever since my arrival in the U.S. Senate, I have worked on \ntransportation issues, mainly on getting my State of Missouri a fair \nreturn on its highway dollars. I will be honest; it has been an uphill \nbattle. Even under the bill as reported from the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Missouri, and several others, are still donor States. \nAs a member of the committee, I worked with my colleagues, Senators \nChafee, Warner, and Baucus, to come up with a formula that was fair. \nAgain, let me be honest; it is not everything I would like. If I got \nwhat I wanted, Missouri would be getting a return of $1.72 or $2.15 on \nevery dollar they sent in. That is the return that some of the \nNortheastern States are receiving. But Missouri is not receiving that \nmuch.\n  Yet, I am the sponsor of this bill because it has moved the formula \nby leaps and bounds in the right direction, and I believe it is a \nreasonable compromise. It is a compromise that recognizes both the \npolitical realities of this place and, I think, the legitimate concerns \nof all the States involved.\n  The bill which I am proud to have sponsored with a number of my \ncolleagues addresses three of the top priorities I have.\n  The bill, No. 1, increases the overall amount of transportation \ndollars that we invest in our infrastructure.\n  Two, it gives a fairer return of transportation dollars to the State \nof Missouri.\n  And, three, it provides additional flexibility to State and local \nplanners, decisionmakers, and officials to address their specific \ntransportation needs.\n  I hope that we can move forward on this vitally important legislation \nso we can address the numerous issues pending, such as transit, safety, \nand the Finance Committee title, which includes another critically \nimportant issue to Missouri and the rest of the country--that is \nethanol.\n  The Finance Committee amendment includes an extension to 2007 of \nethanol's tax incentives. This exemption promotes energy security by \nlowering our dependence on foreign oil. It is cleaner burning. It is a \ncleaner burning fuel, so it is good for the environment. And it is a \nrenewable resource that really benefits our rural economy. The Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly this summer to support this extension in the \nTaxpayers' Relief Act, and we defeated those who attempted to end the \nexemption in 1998. Senator Grassley and others have done an outstanding \njob of leading our bipartisan coalition. I am proud to be part of that \ncoalition, and I expect us to prevail if and when we are challenged \nagain on this issue.\n  Another amendment that is important will reauthorize the act \nproviding assistance to States for fish restoration, wetlands \nrestoration and boat safety, commonly known as ``Wallop-Breaux.'' I am \nparticularly interested in a new provision to authorize a new \n``National Outreach and Communications Program'' designed to introduce \nadditional segments of the public--especially America's youth--to the \nhealthy fun of fishing and boating, to increase awareness of boating \nand fishing opportunities, and to promote safe and environmentally \nsound boating and fishing practices. Fishing is very important, in my \nState, to the recreational industry, and it is a favorite pastime of \nthousands and thousands of enthusiasts. I was out there, I confess. \nMost people with good judgment wouldn't be out on a wind-blown lake in \n35 degree temperature getting their feet wet, getting cold to the bone \nbut going after the mighty sport fish, a tremendously important part of \nour heritage, and I am going to keep doing it until one of these days I \nquit being outsmarted by the fish.\n  Mr. President, moving our transportation policy into the 2lst century \nwill be a challenge. There is no denying that. I hope we can move \nforward and move forward soon on this vitally important legislation so \nthat these amendments that I have mentioned and other important \namendments can be debated and voted on.\n  It is important to realize that maintaining our Nation's roads and \nbridges is not a glamorous undertaking, but as with the debate raging \nin education circles about improving our Nation's crumbling schools, so \ngoes the equally important debate about improving public \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. President, as we prepare and plan our transportation policy for \nthe 21st century, I hope all of us remember four basic principles that \nour new policy must ensure. First and foremost is safety, but also \nfairness, efficiency, and economic competitiveness.\n  Mr. President, when we do move to the consideration of this bill--as \nI said, I hope that will be soon--I intend to offer an amendment with \nSenator Breaux, an amendment that has been cleared on both sides of the \naisle, because it makes good sense. This is an amendment that affects \nboth the EPA and the Corps of Engineers. They reviewed the amendment. \nThey have no objection to it. It is consistent with administration \npolicy and its Federal guidance issued November 1995. It is supported \nby the Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. And, \nbeyond that, it is good for wetlands protection. It promotes private-\nsector efforts to protect wetlands. And it saves money that can be used \non highways or other authorized uses under this act. Truly a win-win-\nwin amendment.\n\n  Now that I have your rapt attention, let me tell you what this \namendment would do.\n  This amendment provides that when highway projects result in impacts \nto wetlands that require compensation mitigation under current law, \npreference should be given, to the extent practicable, to private-\nsector mitigation banks. The amendment mandates that the banks be \napproved in accordance with the administration's Federal guidance on \nmitigation banking issued in 1995, and it requires that the bank be \nwithin the service area of the impacted wetlands.\n  The administration's definition of mitigation banking is\n\n       . . . the restoration, creation, enhancement and, in \n     exceptional circumstances, preservation of wetlands and/or \n     aquatic resources expressly for the purpose of providing \n     compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to \n     similar resources.\n\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\n\n  Mitigation is usually accomplished by restoring or creating other \nwetlands. Isolated, on-site mitigation projects, however, are expensive \nand costly to maintain. Wetlands mitigation banks are typically large \ntracts of land that have been restored as wetlands.\n  A State department of transportation building a highway project which \nimpacts wetlands merely buys credits generated in the bank based on the \nacreage and quality of the restored wetlands in order to satisfy its \nobligation to mitigate the harm to the impacted wetlands by the \nconstruction of the highway. The bank sponsor assumes full \nresponsibility for maintaining the restored wetlands site, and the \nState department of transportation has thus fulfilled its mitigation \nrequirement.\n  The amendment does not change in any way the mitigation required. It \nprovides simply that mitigation banking will be the preferred \nalternative once mitigation requirements are determined.\n  Last year, the Committee on Environment and Public Works held a \nhearing where witnesses from the administration, the private sector, \nthe environmental community, and the scientific community spoke to the \npromise of mitigation banking as being an important instrument to \nprotect wetlands and to do so with less red tape and, most importantly, \nat less expense to our highway and transportation programs.\n  Now, this proposal is strongly supported by the Missouri and the Ohio \nDepartments of Transportation and by the nationwide association AASHTO. \nA September letter from the Ohio Director of Transportation notes that \n``the Ohio department's costs for on-site mitigation have ranged as \nhigh as $150,000 an acre when the cost of design, real estate, \nconstruction and mitigation monitoring were combined. These costs are \nnot out of line with the high end costs experienced by many other \ndepartments of transportation around the country. Our lowest costs for \non-site mitigation have generally exceeded $35,000 per acre. The cost \nof banking, in our experience, has ranged from around $10,000 to \n$12,000 per acre and includes all of the above-cited cost factors. This \nequates to about one-quarter the cost of our average on-site \nmitigation.''\n  In Florida, the department of transportation pays its department of \nenvironmental protection $75,000 for every acre it impacts for \nmitigation. By contrast, the Florida wetlands bank acres in Broward \nCounty are sold for a reported $50,000 to $55,000. The State of \nIllinois in the Chicago area has had a similar experience.\n  The savings can be significant and they can be achieved because of \nspecialization and economies of scale. As a result, less Federal \nhighway money is spent on mitigating impacts to wetlands. More Federal \nhighway money is made available for highway construction. And the \nwetlands, wildlife and conservation benefits are achieved in the most \nefficient manner possible. The Vice President and others have said we \nshould pursue ways in which we can make environmental protection a \nprofitable enterprise while actually reducing the permit process times \nfor citizens weaving their way through the burdensome wetlands \npermitting process.\n  This does just that. Many agree that mitigation banks, which must be \napproved, will have a greater long-term rate of success in protecting \nwetlands because, one, the people who sell the credits are in the \nbusiness of wetlands protection; two, the banks are easy to regulate \nand be held accountable; three, there is more time and flexibility for \na bank to procure and identify high-quality wetlands.\n  Again, this is a good amendment. It is good for the environment. It \nis good for the efficiencies. It will save highway dollars and make \nsure we deliver the wetlands protection with the wildlife, \nenvironmental and conservation benefits that go along with it in the \nmost efficient use possible of our precious highway dollars.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will support the bipartisan \namendment when we are enabled to present it in the Chamber in the \nconsideration of the highway transportation reauthorization bill, \nISTEA.\n  Mr. President, I see others in the Chamber so I will yield the floor \nat this time. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           MITIGATION BANKING\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I'm pleased to cosponsor with Senator Bond \nthe mitigation banking amendment to the highway bill. I thank Senator \nBond for his leadership and am pleased to continue working with him on \nwetlands-related issues.\n  The Bond-Breaux amendment is direct and straightforward. It simply \nsays that mitigation banking shall be the preferred means, to the \nmaximum extent practicable, to mitigate for wetlands or natural habitat \nwhich are affected as part of a Federal-aid highway project and whose \nmitigation is paid for with Federal-aid funds.\n  In addition, the amendment identifies three factors that are to be \nmet in order to use a mitigation bank: first, the affected wetlands or \nnatural habitat are to be in a bank's service area; second, the bank \nhas to have enough credits available to offset the impact; and third, \nthe bank has to meet federally approved standards.\n  So, Senator Bond and I, through this amendment, are simply trying to \nestablish a reasonable, responsible wetlands and natural habitat \nmitigation policy as part of the Federal-aid highway program.\n  Our proposal has two key components: First, we say give mitigation \nbanking a preference, to the maximum extent practicable, which is \nreasonable. Second, we say a bank should meet certain conditions to \nensure its effectiveness and viability, which is being responsible.\n  Let me emphasize that our amendment does not mandate the use of \nmitigation banks. Nor does the amendment require their use nor does it \nsay they shall be the sole means or the only method used to mitigate \naffected wetlands or natural habitat.\n  The Bond-Breaux amendment simply says mitigation banks shall be the \npreferred means, to the maximum extent practicable, and they must meet \ncertain responsible conditions before they can be used.\n  Louisiana's transportation department officials have said that the \nState already uses mitigation banks and areas as an option for some of \nits highway projects.\n  Mitigation banks can offer several advantages when constructed and \noperated responsibly. They can achieve economies of scale. They can \nprovide larger, higher quality and diverse habitat and they can make \nmitigation costs less expensive when compared to costs for some \nisolated mitigation sites which are not part of a bank.\n  The Bond-Breaux amendment certainly is in line with the environmental \nprovisions and direction of the proposed highway bill we have before \nthe Senate, S. 1173.\n  For these reasons, I urge the Senate's adoption of the amendment when \nit comes up for consideration.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to make several comments \non the extension of the provision of section 245(I) which is in the \ncontinuing resolution we passed today.\n  This provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act allowed foreign \nnationals to adjust their status while remaining in this country after \neither entering the United States illegally or remaining in this \ncountry after their visa expired and they became illegal.\n  Either way, these individuals have entered this country without \nhaving respect for our laws or have remained here because of little or \nno respect for our laws.\n  On August 22, 1996, this body passed legislation to attempt to \nenforce stricter penalties against those foreign nationals that arrive \nin the United States illegally or remain hidden in the workforce \nillegally after their visas expire. The law we passed required illegal \naliens to leave this country and go through the proper channels of \nimmigration from their homeland or remain here and be subject to a 3- \nor 10-year bar from reentry into our country.\n  The Illegal Immigration Act of 1996 calls for a mandatory 3-year bar \nagainst that illegal alien from entering this country if he or she has \nremained illegally in this country for 180 days after April 1, 1997.\n  If he or she remains here for 1 year after April 1, 1997, that bar is \n10 years.\n  It appears in just over 1 year from passing this legislation and just \nat the time the 180 day timeframe kicks in--now this body is attempting \nto provide a loophole for illegal aliens to remain in this country with \nlittle or no consequence.\n  I am opposed to this extension. And I will not vote for any \nlegislation that permanently extends the cut off period. What we are \ndoing is rewarding illegal behavior.\n  I sometimes wonder why we have immigration laws that we do not \nenforce?\n  Our immigration policy in this country is a mess. We don't have a \npolicy, because if we make one we make exceptions to it almost \nimmediately. Here we are 1 year later and we are providing extensions \nalready. When is this kind of legislating going to stop?\n  For as little as $1,000, someone can remain in this country \nillegally. This is a small price to pay to enable someone with little \nregard for our laws to remain in this great country.\n  Mr. President, what kind of signal does it send to hardworking, law-\nabiding Americans--that you can come to this country illegally and stay \nhere illegally, for as little as $1,000.\n  I think we send the signal that anybody can come to the United States \nat anytime and stay here for as long as they want.\n  Maybe I have the answer to the respect for our laws that some \nnoncitizens have. I have also received information from the Bureau of \nPrisons that in the Federal prison system approximately 26.6 percent of \nthe Federal inmates are not U.S. citizens as of June 1997. To take care \nof these prisoners is costing U.S. taxpayers $687 million a year.\n  By the U.S. Congress extending the ability to adjust status to \npersons that have little regard for our laws with such little \nconsequence, we are only condoning illegal actions and opening the door \nto further crime.\n  Illegal immigrants have put a burden on our Federal system which we \ncannot sustain and remain solvent. This is wrong. We as a country \ncannot continue to fix the errors of illegal immigrants. They should be \nheld accountable for their actions.\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege to be in this great country. We must \nrequest all residents, whether citizens or noncitizens, of the United \nStates adhere to our laws. And our message should be consistent.\n  For these reasons, I am strongly opposed to the extension of 245(I) \nthat is in the continuing resolution. I am further opposed to any \neffort to make permanent changes to this law that would weaken our \nimmigration policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11033-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11033-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution:\n\n       S.

A bill to provide market transition assistance for tobacco \nproducers, tobacco industry workers, and their communities; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           THE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS ACT\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on June 20, the attorneys general of several \nStates emerged from a Washington hotel conference room to announce a \nproposed national tobacco settlement. The announcement sent Washington \nspin doctors to work, pronouncing the defeat of public enemy number \none--the tobacco industry. Press release after press release painted a \npicture of fat cat tobacco executives, rich at the expense of public \nhealth, finally being called to account.\n  But this picture of tobacco is not what I see when I go home to \nKentucky. There I see hard-working farmers trying to make an honest \nliving off a crop that has helped hundreds of communities in my State \nthrive for centuries.\n  Maybe you've forgotten about the farmer. That wouldn't surprise me. \nThey weren't in the room during the tobacco negotiations. They were not \nincluded in the final settlement, and to date, the only plan that \nmentions them would put them out of business.\n  Mr. President, it is as if the thousands of men and women who have \nbeen the bedrock of hundreds of communities simply no longer have any \nvalue.\n  Sixty thousand farm families produce tobacco in 119 of 120 counties \nin my State. While tobacco uses only 1 to 2 percent of their acreage, \nit produces 20 to 25 percent of their farm income. Along with these \nfarm families are tens of thousands of workers who warehouse, process \nand manufacture tobacco. They all live in communities where every \ntobacco dollar has a multiplier effect on the local economy, rolling \nover three to four times.\n  And they're the reason I am here today.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join several of my colleagues in \nintroducing legislation which addresses the needs of tobacco farmers, \ntobacco workers, and their communities and should provide the framework \nfor taking care of them in any comprehensive legislation.\n  First and foremost, ``taking care of them'' means protecting the \ntobacco program.\n  Opponents of the program claim they're not attacking farmers, but \nwith the program goes stability, with the program goes the small family \nfarmer, and with the program goes hundreds of small rural communities.\n  Mr. President, the program is the key to preventing fence row to \nfence row production.\n  It is the key to keeping tobacco prices high.\n  And it is the key to keeping tobacco production in the hands of small \nfamily farms and keeping rural communities alive.\n  Without the program, look for cheap cigarettes, look for the size of \nfarms--at the very least--to triple in size. Look for family farms to \ngo out of business, and look for the rural communities they sustain, to \nshut down.\n  What are the benefits of killing the program? For hard-working family \nfarmers there simply are none.\n  That is why killing the program is a nonstarter. And even though \ncriticisms are based either on misconceptions or misrepresentations of \nthe program, we're willing to address them by covering all these costs \nwith our legislation. But make no mistake, we're not willing to \neliminate the program.\n  The legislation we're introducing today follows the principles every \none of my colleagues went on record supporting in a September 9 Sense \nof the Senate amendment. We all agreed that tobacco growers should be \nfairly compensated as part of any Federal legislation to implement the \ntobacco settlement. We all agreed tobacco growing communities should be \nprovided sufficient resources to adjust to the economic impact of any \nsettlement legislation. We all agreed compensation to farmers and their \ncommunities should come from funds provided within the parameters of \nthe national settlement, as paid by tobacco manufacturers. And we all \nagreed the tobacco program should be maintained and operated at no net \ncost to the taxpayer.\n  These four simple principles will mean the difference between a \nproductive future for tobacco farmers and a ``for sale'' sign up at the \nend of the driveway--the difference between communities where a \nfarmer's children stay to raise their children and a ghost town.\n  At the core of the legislation is the establishment of a Tobacco \nCommunity Revitalization Trust Fund. The trust fund will provide \ncompensation for farmers, investment funds for communities, and \neducation and retraining funds, all within the parameters of the \ntobacco program and the national tobacco settlement dollar figure.\n  First, the fund will provide tobacco quota holders with ``Payments \nfor Lost Tobacco Quota'' based on the drop in the amount of tobacco \nthey can grow. The national tobacco settlement could cause consumption \nto drop substantially, which would translate into deep cuts in each \nfarm's tobacco quota and each farmer's income. Under our bill, quota \nholders will receive $4 per pound per year for every pound by which the\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nquota drops below their base quota. A maximum lifetime limit on \npayments will be set for quota holders at $8 times the number of pounds \nin their base quota. Those who lease quota or grow tobacco as a tenant \nfarmer will receive $2 per pound, with a life time cap of $4 per pound.\n  Second, the trust fund will make payments to cover all administrative \ncosts associated with the production of tobacco. This will include \nsalaries at USDA to administer the tobacco program, and any shortfall \nin the provision of crop insurance for tobacco farmers. This should \nfinally put a stop to false claims that tobacco growers receive \nsubsidies from the Federal Government.\n  Third, the trust fund will provide Farmer Opportunity grants for \nhigher education. Tobacco farmers and their dependents will be eligible \nfor higher education grants of up to $1,700 per year--which is the \ncurrent average size of a Pell grant--to attend a university, community \ncollege, vocational school, or other recognized institution. Academic \neligibility standards will be modeled after Pell grants, including \nrequirements that students maintain satisfactory progress toward the \ncompletion of their degree, and maintain at least a C average. Funding \nwill be provided to cover up to 25,000 individuals from tobacco farm \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco program has long meant the difference \nbetween whether a family can afford to send their children to college \nor whether their education stops after grade 12. We need to do \neverything we can to preserve a farm family's ability to provide their \nchildren with access to higher education opportunities.\n  Fourth, the fund will provide benefits to displaced workers from \ntobacco warehousing, processing, and manufacturing operations. This \nprogram is modeled after the NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nfor Displaced Workers. Under these provisions, workers who lose their \njobs can receive tobacco readjustment allowances, employment services, \njob training, job search allowances, and relocation allowances, all of \nwhich are modeled after the NAFTA benefits and services.\n  And fifth, the fund will provide economic development assistance to \ntobacco growing communities hit hard by the national tobacco \nsettlement.\n  The economic development fund will begin at $400 million per year \nminus the amount used for administrative costs of the tobacco program, \ndistributed through block grants to tobacco growing States.\n  States can use the funding to provide several types of assistance \nincluding rural business enterprise grants, farm ownership loans, \nactivities which create farm and off-farm employment, activities which \nexpand infrastructure facilities, and services which help diversify \nlocal economies, long-term business technical assistance, grants to \nagricultural organizations to help tobacco growers find supplemental \nagricultural activities, and activities which create or expand locally \nowned value-added agricultural processing and marketing operations.\n  Providing stability, preserving traditions, keeping farms in the \nhands of families, protecting hundreds of communities, Mr. President, I \nbelieve this legislation will give tobacco farmers, tobacco industry \nworkers and tobacco growing communities the resources to deal with the \nnational tobacco settlement likely to impact them.\n  With the tobacco program completely funded by tobacco growers or the \nindustry itself, antitobacco advocates can no longer take aim at the \nfarmer under the pretense of fiscal responsibility. And with a sense of \nstability and predictability, farmers can begin to prepare for the \nfuture in a responsible and thoughtful way.\n  I plan on sharing this proposal with my colleagues involved in \nwriting comprehensive legislative proposals to implement the national \ntobacco settlement, but I hope all my colleagues interested in this \nissue and interested in preserving a farming tradition will take a \nclose look at this program so that we can move forward in helping \ntobacco farm families and their communities.\n  Mr. President, we have not just singled out the farmer. We have \nincluded the total community, from education to job opportunity, \nwhatever it might be, so we have taken in the whole community. I am \nvery pleased with the hard work and support that has been given to me \nby Senator McConnell, Senator Faircloth, Senator Helms, and others to \nmake this introduction so important today.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this \nbill, the LEAF Act. I want to thank Senator Ford for the hard work and \nthe leadership role he has taken over his years in the Senate on this \nbill and in support of the tobacco industry as a whole and, especially, \nthe farmers involved in it.\n  There has been a lot of talk on this floor about farmers. Everyone is \nagainst tobacco, but they are for farmers. Everyone pledges to help the \nfarmers. This bill is a blueprint for that help. This plan offers \nassistance to the tobacco community across North Carolina, Kentucky, \nand the entire producing area, including Virginia, South Carolina, \nGeorgia, and Tennessee. These people are the men and women in tobacco \nfields and cigarette factories and their communities.\n  There are 18,000 tobacco farmers in North Carolina and thousands more \nthroughout the Southeast. The farmers of my State collect more than $1 \nbillion in receipts each year from tobacco alone. That is a big number, \nbut it is spread over many small farms. Everyone in Washington talks \nabout the small farmer, the family farm, but North Carolina is the \nState of small farms. The average farm size in North Carolina is just \n159 acres, one-third of the national average, which is 469 acres. It is \ndifficult at best to make a living on a small farm. Tobacco kept these \npeople alive on small farming operations over the last 60 years. \nTobacco produces roughly $1,200 an acre in net profit. There isn't \nanything else they can plant that comes close to this, even remotely \nclose. Tobacco keeps the family farm together, and, Mr. President, it \nkeeps the family on the farm. That is why we are here with this bill \nand the reason I am here this morning.\n  The impact of this proposed tobacco settlement would throw thousands \nof small farmers off their land and immediately into bankruptcy. It is \nup to us to step up and to help them through this transition.\n  I have talked about farmers so far and only farmers, but the economic \nimpact of tobacco and this proposed settlement is not limited to \nfarmers. There are 20,000 working people in factories across North \nCarolina manufacturing tobacco products. They pay mortgages, buy \ngroceries and struggle to meet tuition bills. They are simply middle-\nclass American people. However, tobacco is their livelihood, and \nCongress has set its sights on destroying their livelihood. That is \nsimply what has happened here.\n  The entire tobacco sector employs 100,000 people in North Carolina. \nThat is $7 billion in business in the State. It is 8 percent of the \nwork force and represents a lot of families. I am here to attempt to \nstand up for these people.\n  Next year the Congress will take up an agreement that deals a real \nblow to the livelihood of these thousands of people. Tobacco production \nis expected to drop significantly under the proposed agreement. The \nfarmers and factory workers are in the cross hairs of the tobacco \nsettlement, and whether the antitobacco crowd is aiming at them or not, \nthey are the ones who are going to be hit. This bill tells them that \nCongress will try to lessen the effects on the innocent parties, the \nhard-working men and women in the tobacco fields and on the factory \nfloor.\n  Senator Ford explained these transition payments to farmers. The \nFreedom to Farm Act moved farmers to an unregulated market and included \nsubstantial transition payments to assist them through this change. \nHowever, there was nothing in that bill designed to cut production of \ncorn, wheat or any other crop. This proposed tobacco settlement takes \naim at this crop, however, so the transition payments are a necessity.\n  The amount of money in this bill for the farmers and factory workers \nis modest compared to the amount of money that others seeking from the \nsettlement. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $28 billion would be \ninvolved in Senator Ford's bill. Now, it might interest you to know \nthat the hundreds of trial lawyers involved in this potential \nsettlement expect to receive up to\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\n$45 billion, almost two times as much as we are asking for the more \nthan 150,000 people effected by this settlement.\n  The farmers face a situation where the Government will target their \ncrop and cut its production. We need the transition money. How many \npeople, farmers or not, could stand a quick reduction of 30 percent of \ntheir income due to the intended actions of the Federal Government? \nThat is simply what we are talking about here--reducing the tobacco \nfarmer's income by 30 percent. This bill is about the future of \ncommunities and literally big sections of our State. The bill includes \nfarm opportunity scholarships to allow the farmers and their children \nadditional educational opportunities. It also provides for rural \ndevelopment to enable these communities to survive the transition. This \nbill tells farmers that Congress is not leaving them without any \noptions for the future. It tells them the rhetoric against tobacco is \nnot really against them. At this moment they believe that it is and \nhave every reason to think so.\n  This bill is a chance to back up all the rhetoric about being against \ntobacco but for farmers. If we are for farmers, we will pass this bill. \nI hope my colleagues will join me, Senator Ford, Senator McConnell, and \nSenator Helms in support of this bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Ford for his important \nwork and his leadership on this issue. It is so vital to the State we \njointly represent.\n  I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate today to talk about an \nindustry that has played an integral role in our country's history and \ncontinues to shape the cultural and economic landscape of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. The industry, of course, is tobacco. And for \nthe next few minutes I want to discuss tobacco and the shifting \npolitical terrain that will affect the 136,000 farmers who produce this \nagricultural commodity.\n  This summer a group of States attorneys general, representatives of \nthe major tobacco companies, and public health officials negotiated an \nagreement that would limit the companies' legal liability in exchange \nfor their promise to help reduce smoking and compensate States for past \ndamages caused by use of their product. This agreement obviously must \nbe passed by the Congress and signed by the President to have the force \nof law, and that process is now what best could be described as in its \ninitial stages.\n  To my deep disappointment, tobacco farmers were not included in these \nnegotiations. They had no seat at the table. Not surprisingly, there is \nnot a single penny in this $368 billion pool of money for tobacco \nfarmers, even though they will be the ones most directly impacted by \nthe agreement. On the other hand, the agreement allows for the \ncompensation of well-heeled sporting enterprises such as auto racing \nand rodeos in the event they lose sponsorship dollars but not a penny \ngoes to the hard-working tobacco farmers who may well be driven off \ntheir family farms because of an agreement to which they were not a \nparty.\n  Today, along with Senator Ford, the principal craftsman of this bill, \nSenator Helms and Senator Faircloth, I propose to right that wrong by \nsupporting a package that will provide for these farmers' well-being. \nToday, my colleagues and I are introducing the Long-term Economic \nAssistance for Farmers Act, what we call the LEAF Act, which creates an \numbrella ``Tobacco Community Revitalization Fund.'' The fund, to be \npaid for from moneys within the existing $368-billion settlement, will \nstabilize the incomes of tobacco farmers by providing payments for lost \ntobacco quota to tobacco quota holders, tenants and those who lease \nquota. Quota holders who produce their own tobacco will be paid $4 a \npound in any given year for every pound their quota falls behind their \naverage 1994-1966 quota level. In the case of leased tobacco and tenant \nfarmers, payments will be $2 a pound.\n  A portion of the fund will also be used for Tobacco Community \nEconomic Development Grants which will help transition tobacco \ndependent communities to a more diversified economic base. The economic \ndevelopment grants will be used for costs incidental to the tobacco \nprogram, economic development grants to States, farmer opportunity \ngrants for education and training, and assistance for displaced tobacco \nindustry workers.\n  Mr. President, most agree that tobacco farmers and their communities \nshould not bear the brunt of the agreement's dislocating effects. For \ninstance, Minority Leader Daschle has said that ``We need to address \nsome of the concerns that were not addressed in the agreement * * * \nespecially those dealing with small farmers.'' The President himself \nhas said, ``Any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and \ntheir communities.'' Even tobacco's most committed foes such as former \nFDA Commissioner David Kessler recognize that, as he put it, ``farmers \nshould not be left out'' of the agreement. The LEAF Act does provide \nfor farmers. It provides compensation for reduced quota to owners and \nthose who produce the tobacco. It provides opportunities for tobacco \nfarmers to diversify their crops. It provides economic stability for \nsmall tobacco farmers and their tobacco communities. It provides \neducation and training opportunities for tobacco farmers and their \ndependents. It keeps farmers like mine in Kentucky in the business of \nproducing this legal agricultural commodity.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise in support of the LEAF Act. I thank Senator \nFord for his leadership and tireless efforts to protect our tobacco \ngrowers and their communities. I believe Senator Ford's bill provides \nthe best alternative for our growers.\n  Having said that, I realize we face an uphill battle. Today's \npolitical environment for tobacco interests is darkened mightily. In \ntoday's Senate, outrageously unfair amendments that deny basic crop \ninsurance to tobacco farmers are only narrowly defeated. The ceaseless \nassault on tobacco has left the tobacco grower imperiled. In this \ncontext it may be difficult to sustain the political support necessary \nto enact all of the bill's provisions. I personally will fight for the \nFord package, but I also will be cognizant of political reality. It is \nmy fervent hope that we can incorporate the LEAF Act into any \nsettlement legislation.\n  If that is not achievable, I will not be discouraged from pursuing \nalternative ways to best provide tobacco farmers' needs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as Congress discusses the proposed tobacco \nsettlement, I urge my colleagues to remember that our decisions will \nnot affect some nameless, faceless machine. Rather, our actions here \nwill bear directly on thousands of hard-working tobacco farmers, men \nand women who pay their taxes, go to church, raise their families, and \ndo their best to provide for future generations. We owe it to them to \nensure that today's changes in the tobacco culture leave them with a \nstable future as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Let me thank my colleagues for their remarks. One of the \nthings that we have to take into consideration is that this bill is a \nbill that looks not only to the farmer but to his family, his children \nfor education, and economic development in the community. I hope people \nunderstand, I hope my colleagues understand, that this bill \nincorporates payment for everything, even the shortfall in the crop \ninsurance. So there should not be these so-called cheap shots, as my \ncolleague from Kentucky explained, as it relates to the tobacco farmer, \nunder this proposal. If you take a look, I would hope Senators will \nunderstand that. We have worked very hard putting this package together \nand hopefully it will be accepted within the parameters of any \nagreement.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I too am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Ford's bill, titled the Long-term Economic \nAssistance for Farmers Act (S. 1310). The able senior Senator from \nKentucky is to be commended for offering this legislation.\n  Mr. President, as farmers and rural communities in tobacco-growing \nStates come to terms with the national tobacco settlement, this bill \nwill address some of the needs sure to arise during this critical \neconomic adjustment period. I believe this legislation is a good \nstarting point for helping these farmers, their families, and their \ncommunities.\n  Obviously, it is too much to hope that everybody affected by the \nsettlement will be satisfied with every provision in this bill, but it \nis important\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\nthat we begin to take steps to ensure farmers the same stability and \npredictability that the tobacco companies sought when they negotiated \nthe national tobacco settlement.\n  Mr. President, let me make it clear that--and I believe Senator Ford \nand all other supporters of this legislation agree--that this is only a \nstarting point. It may be--after consultation with growers, companies \nand other affected parties--that only minor changes in this legislation \nneed to be made. Or, it may be--that a significant overhaul in our \napproach to this issue is needed.\n  Whatever the future holds, of this tobacco growers may be assured: I \nwill do everything proper in my power to protect their interests. I \nhave often been criticized for standing up for the livelihoods of \ntobacco farmers--and I suppose I will be criticized many times more in \nthe future. Let the critics proceed, but I shall never retreat from my \nconvictions that the hard-working families deserve to be recognized for \nthe good citizens and splendid families that they are.\n  So, Mr. President, again I commend my friend from Kentucky, Mr. Ford, \nfor his tireless effort to protect tobacco farmers, and I am honored to \nstand with him once again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Mack, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Abraham, and \n        Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1311. A bill to impose certain sanctions on foreign persons who \ntransfer items contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or \nproduce ballistic missiles; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n          the iran missile proliferation sanctions act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Iran Missile \nProliferation Sanctions Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this \nbipartisan effort by Senator Lieberman, as well as Senators McConnell, \nReid, D'Amato, Boxer, Coverdell, Helms, Durbin, McCain, Brownback, \nBennett, Campbell, Feingold, Mack, Shelby, Wyden, Hutchinson, \nFeinstein, Hollings, Mikulski, Nickles, Cleland, Inouye, Dorgan, and \nBryan.\n  This is very important legislation which addresses a serious threat, \nin my opinion, to American security: Iran's relentless efforts to \nacquire ballistic missile technology. There is no doubt that Iran is \nthe major proliferation danger in the world today. Iran is committed to \ndeveloping nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the means to \ndeliver them.\n  The consequences of Iran's ballistic missile development would be \ndisastrous. Iran actively supports terrorist groups around the world. \nEarlier this year, a German court found Iran's intelligence services \nresponsible for assassinations on German soil. There is a very real \npossibility that Iran was behind the murder of 19 Americans in the \nKhobar Towers bombing on June 25, 1996.\n  News reports now indicate that Iran is developing two missiles with \nranges of 800 or more than 1,200 miles. Such missiles would be able to \nreach American forces stationed in the Persian Gulf. They would be able \nto reach Israel. They would be able to reach our NATO ally, Turkey. \nThey would be able to reach all the way into Central Europe, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  The terrorist regime in Iran has already demonstrated its willingness \nand ability to use bombings and hit squads to support its radical \nagenda in the Middle East and in Europe. We cannot sit back and allow \nTehran to acquire ballistic missile capability that could hit even more \ntargets with the push of a button, possibly even with nuclear warheads.\n  This administration's track record on dealing with Iran is not \nencouraging. We are always anxious to work with the administration in \nthese important foreign policy issues. In 1995, with great fanfare, the \nadministration announced it was strongly opposed to the sale of Russian \nnuclear reactors to Iran and the issue would be handled in the \ncommission headed by Vice President Gore and Russian Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin. In the intervening 2 years there has been no progress in \nhalting that sale, or sales of this type.\n  In 1995 the administration gave a green light to Iranian extremists \nwho gained a foothold in Europe by arming the Bosnian Government. The \nresidue of that green light still affects the situation in Bosnia \ntoday. So, there are problems, obviously, in this area.\n  When the news reports in the Washington Times over the last month \nindicated that there were very serious concerns about Russian support \nfor Iran's missile technology programs, many of us on Capitol Hill \nlooked for action. Vice President Gore, we were told, would raise the \nissue with the Prime Minister when he was in Russia, but the response \nthat he received apparently was to call the news report ``stupid'' and \n``not worthy of comment.''\n  I think, after consultation with the administration, that this \nlegislation is necessary because not enough has been done to address \nthis Iranian missile development. I believe it is clear that existing \nUnited States law has been broken by Russian entities. Emissaries have \ngone to Moscow, information has been shared. Yet, no sanctions action \nhas been taken by the administration.\n  This legislation is necessary because it is time to act. Many have \nrecently expressed concern about Congress imposing ``unilateral'' \nsanctions. My response is that Congress will step into a vacuum and \ntake unilateral action when inadequate action is being taken in other \nareas.\n  The legislation is quite simple. It requires the President to report \nin 30 days, and every 180 days thereafter, on entities that have \ntransferred or attempted to transfer goods, technology, technical \nassistance or facilities that contribute to Iran's efforts to acquire, \ndevelop or produce ballistic missiles.\n  The legislation requires three sanctions on any such entities: No \nexport of American arms, no export of restricted dual-use items, and no \nAmerican Government assistance. So it is a targeted sanction, aimed at \nthe entities involved in these actions.\n  Congress has established with successive administrations, special \ncriteria in existing law for each of these three things. Our \nlegislation simply says if you help Iran acquire ballistic missile \ncapability, you will not get arms, controlled exports, or taxpayer-\nfinanced aid.\n  Similar bipartisan legislation is being introduced in the House \ntoday. I refer back to my opening remarks. There are already, I believe \nsome 26 Senators who are cosponsoring on both sides of the aisle, from \nall regions of the country and all philosophical spectrums.\n  I hope the Senate will take action on this legislation before the end \nof the session. Certainly, it will provide, hopefully, some additional \nimpetus for the administration to aggressively address this issue. A \nnumber of changes have been made in the legislation to meet policy and \nlegal concerns of the administration, and I hope the administration \nwill see the merits of imposing these serious and rapid sanctions on \nentities which aid Iran's efforts to threaten American forces and \nAmerican allies.\n  We cannot stand mute. We cannot ignore this very serious matter. We \nwill continue to work with the administration and support any \naggressive efforts that they care to use. But after serious \nconsideration, and after consultation particularly with Senator \nLieberman, I thought it was important that we go ahead and introduce \nthis legislation today, and explain why we are doing it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Missile Proliferation \n     Sanctions Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Requirement To Impose Sanctions.--\n       (1) Requirement to impose sanctions.--The sanctions \n     described in subsection (b) shall be imposed on--\n       (A) any foreign person identified under subsection (a)(1) \n     of section 2 in a report submitted pursuant to that section; \n     and\n       (B) any foreign person identified under subsection (a)(2) \n     of section 2 in a report submitted pursuant to that section, \n     if that person has been identified in that report or a \n     previous report as having made at least 1 other attempt \n     described in subsection (a)(2) of that section.\n       (2) Effective date of sanctions.--The sanctions shall be \n     effective--\n       (A) 30 days after the date on which the report triggering \n     the sanction is submitted, if the report is submitted on or \n     before the date required by section 2(b);\n       (B) 30 days after the date required by section 2(b) for \n     submitting the report, if the report triggering the sanction \n     is submitted within 30 days after that date; and\n       (C) immediately after the report triggering the sanction is \n     submitted, if that report is submitted more than 30 days \n     after the date required by section 2(b).\n       (b) Description of Sanctions.--The sanctions referred to in \n     subsection (a) that are to be imposed on a foreign person \n     described in that subsection are the following:\n       (1) Arms export sanction.--For a period of not less than 2 \n     years, the United States Government shall not sell to that \n     person any item on the United States Munitions List as of \n     August 8, 1995, and shall terminate sales to that person of \n     any defense articles, defense services, or design and \n     construction services under the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (2) Dual use sanction.--For a period of not less than 2 \n     years, the authorities of section 6 of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 shall be used to prohibit the \n     export of any goods or technology on the control list \n     established pursuant to section 5(c)(1) of that Act to that \n     person.\n       (3) United states assistance.--For a period of not less \n     than 2 years, the United States Government shall not provide \n     any assistance in the form of grants, loans, credits, \n     guarantees, or otherwise, to that person.\n\n     SEC. 4. WAIVER.\n\n       The President may waive the imposition of any sanction that \n     otherwise would be required to be imposed pursuant to section \n     3 on any foreign person 15 days after the President \n     determines and reports to the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate that, on the basis of \n     information provided by the person, or otherwise obtained by \n     the President, the President is persuaded that the person did \n     not, on or after August 8, 1995--\n       (1) transfer goods or technology, or provide technical \n     assistance or facilities, that contributed to Iran's efforts \n     to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles; or\n       (2) attempt on more than one occasion to transfer goods or \n     technology, or to provide technical assistance or facilities, \n     that would have contributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, \n     develop, or produce ballistic missiles.\n\n     SEC. 5.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Government of primary jurisdiction.--The term \n     ``government of primary jurisdiction'' means the government \n     under whose laws a foreign person is organized, or the \n     government of the place where a foreign person is \n     headquartered or habitually resides.\n       (2) Foreign person.--The term ``foreign person'' means a \n     natural person as well as a corporation, business \n     association, partnership, society, trust, any other \n     nongovernmental entity, organization, or group, and any \n     governmental entity operating as a business enterprise, and \n     any successor or subsidiary of any such entity that is \n     organized, headquartered, or habitually resides outside the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Lott, and the other cosponsors, in offering this bill \nwhich addresses what I believe is one of the most serious and urgent \nnational security threats facing this country. Ballistic missiles in \nthe hands of a nation that has been our most implacable foe in the \nrecent past and that has been the single most intransigent supporter of \nterrorism against this Nation and our allies should fill any right \nthinking person anywhere with the most profound fear and concern. \nIndeed, we here in this body have often expressed our concern. We have \ngiven the administration the tools to address this problem, \nspecifically in the Arms Export Control Act and in the Iran-Iraq \nSanctions Act. Regrettably, our concern and these tools have not yet \nresolved this threat. In fact, it is widely and reliably reported that \npersons in Russia continue to provide both technology and assistance to \nIran such that Iran may be now only 8 months from acquiring ballistic \nmissiles that could be combined with weapons of mass destruction to \nthreaten United States forces and our allies and friends in the Middle \nEast. And soon after that, our forces and allies throughout Europe.\n  This would be a profound change in the balance of power in the \nregion, and strike a serious, perhaps fatal blow to our ability to \ncontain Iran until it becomes a responsible member of the community of \nnations. It would allow Iran to threaten friendly Arab states, making \nit harder for them to cooperate with the United States. It would raise \nthe risks to U.S. military forces in the region. And it would threaten \nthe free flow of oil in this critical region, which could create crises \nin places far from the Persian Gulf.\n  We must act to try to prevent this from happening. We must tell \nRussia in no uncertain terms that we are serious, and that the time for \nslow progress in shutting off Russian assistance is past.\n  Many of us are aware that the degree of government control over \ndangerous technology in the former Soviet Union has eroded \nconsiderably. While trying to remedy this potentially frightful \nsituation, the Russian Government must contend with other pressing \ninternal issues. The results are that persons or groups within Russia \nhave had the latitude to transfer technology to rouge states such as \nIran.\n  We have the opportunity as well as the obligation to stand up, be \ncounted, and take reasonable steps to deter this type of potentially \ncataclysmic activity. While we cannot expect to prevent all such \ntechnology transfers to rogue states, we do have the ability to check \nthe flow of it through sanctions aimed at persons engaged in such \nactivity. We also are able and must take appropriate action against \nthose governments that condone such activity, whether they are \norganizing and abetting such transfer or merely looking the other way \nwhen their citizens engage in these activities.\n  For many years, the United States and the few other members of the \nmissile club of nations could be reasonably\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\nassured that these missiles armed with nuclear weapons would not be \nused. That was because the leaders of these nations were generally \nreasoned individuals who shared many of the same goals. As this \ntechnology has spread to other countries--and continues to expand at an \nalarming rate--some of the leaders share very different views on \nmethods to solve confrontation. We have to actively guard against these \nweapons becoming available to what most of the world considers to be \nunstable states governed by leaders whose thinking is outside the \nmainstream.\n  We have been engaged in dialogue across a wide spectrum with our \nfriends and allies in trying to prevent this from happening. As I \nmentioned earlier, the prospect of a nuclear capable, militarily \npowerful Iran armed with ballistic missiles, is clearly not in our \nnational interests. Our efforts at putting controls on the flow of \ntechnology to rogue states have been laudable, but the sieve has been \nleaking.\n  The sanctions we are proposing will further stop the diffusion of \ntechnology and lead toward a more stable Middle East. I fully support \nthis effort because it will help prevent further technology transfer \ninto an area that has seen several major wars in the last thirty years \nand that remains a region of vital national interest not only to us but \nto most of the industrial world.\n  In closing, I want to take this opportunity to express my thanks to \nSenator Lott for his leadership in this matter. This is an important \nstep toward a safer world.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the subject of the transfer of sensitive \nmissile, weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons \ntechnology to Iran is far more complicated than most of us would like \nto admit. As neighbors in a volatile region, Russia and Iran have a \nlong history of mutual antipathy alternating with periods of intense \ncooperation. The official atheism of the former Soviet Union was \nanathema to the Islamic tenets of revolutionary Iran. The former \nenjoyed the benefits of a sizable buffer between Russia proper and the \nPersian kingdom-turned-fundamentalist regime.\n  With the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. and the emergence of \nindependent Islamic governments along its southern frontier, Russia no \nlonger enjoys the security it once maintained. Certainly, the absence \nof the kind of domestic and foreign security apparatus characteristic \nof its totalitarian past has exacerbated the problem of stemming \nIslamic influence, and Russia has sought to maintain an active military \nrole in the region to prevent the spread of such influence, as well as \nof the kind of fighting that ravaged Tajikistan for years. The state of \nits economy, combined with its desire to maintain the best possible \nrelations with Iran, have led Russia to pursue policies thoroughly \ninimical to vital United States interests in the Middle East.\n  Herein lies the problem. It is in the interests of the United States \nfor Russia to develop economically, obviously through free market \nmechanisms. It is in Russia's interest to have access to Iranian oil, \nto the revenue generated by sales to Teheran of whatever the latter \nwill buy, and to be able to maintain cordial relations with a regime \nthat possesses, albeit less so since its presidential election, the \nwherewithal to destabilize the region. Consequently, any decision to \nimpose sanctions on Russia for its sale of missile and other advanced \nweapons technologies to Iran understandably should come only after an \nextraordinarily cautious appraisal of the potential ramifications of \ndoing so.\n  I stand before the Senate today to state as emphatically as I can \nthat such sanctions must be imposed. While news reports of missile \ntechnology sales, in violation of both the 1987 Missile Technology \nControl Regime and the 1992 Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, have \nappeared in great numbers over the past several months, the problem \nclearly has history going back years that the administration continues \nto ignore at our and our allies peril. Were the problem not one of such \nduration, the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, of which I was a \nprincipal sponsor along with then-Senator Al Gore, would not have been \nnecessary 5 years ago. Were the problem a recent manifestation of \nIranian ambitions and Russian inability or unwillingness to control the \nflow of militarily sensitive technologies, I would be willing to \nrespect the administration's prerogative in the conduct of United \nStates foreign policy.\n\n  Such, however, is not the case. Developments involving Russia and \nIran--and I am not intending to ignore China, simply focusing on a more \nimmediate and larger scale problem of the moment--are indicative of a \nmore systemic problem not conducive to quiet diplomacy and seemingly \nendless patience. The Teheran Times boasted in November 1995 of \nRussia's intransigence in the face of United States efforts at \ndissuading it from providing Iran with nuclear technology. Earlier that \nyear, Russia's Minister for Atomic Energy, Viktor Mikhailov, spoke of \nhis Government's intention to sell Iran a centrifuge for the enrichment \nof used nuclear fuel. More recently, reports of contracts being signed \nbetween Russian companies and research institutes--organizations with \nwhich the Government maintains an integral relationship--for the \nprovision of missile components, including guidance systems, laser \nequipment, wind tunnels for the testing of warheads and missiles, and \nmilitarily sensitive materials like tungsten-coated graphite, all \nilluminate a problem of enormous magnitude that, Moscow's protestations \nnotwithstanding, nevertheless reflect minimal effort on that \ngovernment's part to impede the flow of such technology to Iran.\n  Russia sees its economic interests as lying very much in closer \nrelations with Iran. Pipelines transporting Caspian Sea oil and natural \ngas present Russia with potential revenue in the hundreds of millions \nof dollars, should it prevail in dictating future pipeline routes. \nIran's announcement last year of a joint shipping venture with Russia \nsimilarly illuminated the depth of the growing economic relationship \nbetween the two countries. The economic importance of Iran to Russia \nand Russia's lack of viable exports other than the very weapon systems \nthat threaten United States interests in the Middle East have created a \ndilemma, but one with which we must come to grips.\n  Moscow, similarly, must confront the implications of its actions or \ninactions with respect to the transfer of militarily sensitive \ntechnology. It clearly places enormous economic importance on its \nrelationship with Iran, but it needs to be reminded that it fails \nwithin the range of the very missiles it is helping Iran to develop. \nRussia may, in the end, find itself selling Teheran the rope with which \nto hang itself.\n  The administration must comply with existing United States laws. It \nmust take Russia to task, in the form of economic sanctions, for the \ncontinuing problem of missile technology transfer to Iran. Russia must \nbe made to see that its economic well-being does not lie with \ntransactions that threaten United States interests. Russia desperately \nwants recognition as a major global player despite its inability to \ninfluence events militarily or economically far beyond its borders. \nWhen the United States, Germany, or Japan coughs, much of the \nindustrialized world catches cold. When Russia coughs, Moscow catches \ncold. If Russia wants to see the Group of Seven be permanently enlarged \nby one, it must accept that its economic future lies with the \ndemocracies of North America, Europe, and Asia--not with rogue regimes \nthat seek to threaten the interests of those nations.\n  The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act mandates sanctions against \nboth foreign companies and governments for the transfer of missile, \nchemical, biological and nuclear weapon technologies as well as \nadvanced conventional systems. It further provides for discretionary \nsanctions. Russia has thoroughly violated the act, as well as the MTCR. \nNot only has it transferred to Iran missile and nuclear technology, it \nhas sold to Teheran advanced surface-to-air missile systems, three \nKilo-class attack submarines with which Iran fully intends to asserts \nits control over the vital Strait of Hormuz, modern T-72 main battle \ntanks, and MiG-29 fighter and Su-24 strike aircraft. If the cumulative \neffect of these weapon sales does not violate both the MTCR and the \nIran-Iraq Act, then nothing does. And, Mr. President, as a principal \nsponsor of the latter legislation, I can personally attest that, \nirrespective of administration determinations constructed to suit its \npolicy preferences,\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nthese transfers from Russia do violate both the letter and the intent \nof the law.\n  The administration must act on this issue of utmost importance to \nUnited States national security interests. The Middle East lies at the \ncenter of our National Security Strategy and the force structure \nexercises that repeatedly postulate the likelihood of future conflict \nin that strife-torn region. The administration has not presented to \nCongress any reason, compelling or otherwise, for its refusal to abide \nby Public Law 102-484 and the MTCR. Congress must demand that it do so, \nor impose sanctions accordingly. Its failure to do so is inexcusable. \nThe ramifications of that failure will be serious indeed, and the costs \nwill inevitably be paid in American blood.\n  That is why we are introducing legislation to toughen existing \nstatutes by making the imposition of sanctions more certain and \nrequiring that the administration report to Congress information on \nweapons sales that will better enable the legislative branch of \nGovernment to determine for itself whether past failures to impose \nsanctions have been warranted. Governments must be held accountable \nwhen entities within their borders act dangerously irresponsible.\n  The administration must comply with the law, or sacrifice its role in \nthe formulation of U.S. foreign policy in one of the most important \nregions of the world.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Iran Missile \nProliferation Act of 1997, introduced by Senators Lieberman and Lott. \nThis legislation is critically needed because of dangerous recent \ndevelopments in the Middle East, namely disturbing reports that \nindicate Iran is acquiring terrifying weapons of mass destruction at an \nalarming pace.\n  Iran has become the most serious threat to stability in the Middle \nEast and is rapidly developing the means to strike Israel. Very \nrecently, Israeli and American intelligence have discovered that, due \nlargely to technology obtained from Russia, Iran may soon have the \ncapability to begin assembling and testing ballistic missiles capable \nof reaching Israel and other vital targets in the Middle East.\n  Russian companies are providing Iran with crucial technologies, \nincluding wind tunnels for the design of missiles, lasers, and special \nmaterials for missile construction. There are even reports of over \n9,000 Russian advisers working in Iran on a variety of military \nprojects, and Iran earlier this year tested a Soviet-designed rocket \nengine.\n  Iran, one of America's foremost self-proclaimed enemies, has been \nlinked to numerous anti-Israel terrorist attacks ranging from taking \nhostages and hijacking airlines to carrying out assassinations and \nbombings. These incidents include the taking of more than 30 Western \nhostages in Lebanon from 1984 through 1992, the bombings of the United \nStates Embassy and the French-United States Marine barracks in Beirut \nin 1983 and the Buenos Aires terrorist attacks on the Israeli Embassy \nin 1992 and on the Argentine Jewish communal building in 1994. An \nIranian ballistic missile capability would have enormous strategic \nrepercussions for the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. Iran possesses \nchemical weapons, and quite possibly could be only a few years away \nfrom acquiring nuclear weapons.\n  Clearly, the United States must adopt a stronger approach toward \nRussia. To its credit, the administration has tried every diplomatic \neffort with Russia. Vice President Gore and other senior officials have \naddressed this issue at the most senior levels of the Russian \nGovernment, including with President Yeltsin and Prime Minister \nChernomydrin, but these efforts have met with little success. Further \ndiscussions are set for November, however, and I believe Congress must \nact now to enact a more forceful policy which will ensure Russian \ncooperation.\n  The Lott-Lieberman legislation requires the President to submit a \nreport to Congress 30 days after enactment, providing a list of the \nentities that have been implicated in the transfer or attempted \ntransfer of goods, technology, or technical assistance that has \ncontributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic \nmissiles. Highly targeted sanctions will be imposed on these entities \n30 days after the submission of the report, unless the President waives \nthem under limited circumstances.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital measure which takes \nconcrete steps to halt the spread of ballistic missile technology to \nIran and to preserve peace and stability in the Middle East.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am pleased to join with the Distinguished Majority \nLeader in sponsoring S. 1311 regarding arms sales to Iran. This is very \ncritical legislation. If the relevant governments cannot regain control \nover their weapons sellers, Iran will have a ballistic missile \ncapability within months instead of years.\n  Mr. President, on Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told \nme, ``Dealing with proliferation is the highest priority item of this \nadministration.'' In the national security field, she has the right \nsense of priority. And certainly, Iran is the leading problem country.\n  The legislation we are introducing today calls on the administration \nto report on which foreign entities are contributing to Iran's missile \nambitions. For example, the Washington Times has recently reported on a \nnumber of important Russian organizations involved in this trade. \nSpecial metals and associated technology are said to be involved. If \nnecessary, sanctions against the named entities will be imposed.\n  I hope sanctions will not be necessary. I have some confidence that \nforeign government leaders will fulfill their commitments. But it may \nbecome necessary. We already know Iran has a chemical warfare \ncapability and we suspect it has nuclear and germ warfare ambitions. We \ncannot allow a sponsor of state terrorism like Iran to obtain a \nballistic missile delivery system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nOctober 20, 1997, issue of the Washington Times be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Russia Sells Iran Missile Metals\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       A secret Russian production center completed a deal with \n     Iran late last month to supply high-strength steel and \n     special foil for Iran's long-range missile program, The \n     Washington-Times has learned.\n       According to a classified United States intelligence \n     report, the Russian Scientific and Production Center Inor \n     concluded an agreement in late September to provide an \n     Iranian factory with four special metal alloys used in long-\n     range missiles.\n       The report contradicts assurances made by Russian officials \n     only days before the report that Russia had no involvement \n     with the Iranian missile program.\n       The report, labeled ``secret,'' says a two-month effort by \n     Inor to market four alloys to Iran's Instrumentation \n     Factories Plan, part of the Iranian Defense Industries \n     Organization, has ``borne fruit'' with the Iranian agreement \n     to buy the material.\n       ``With an eye to establishing a long-term business \n     relationship, the Russian firm offered to give the Iranian \n     firm a discount on the total value of the invoice,'' the \n     report states.\n       The deal, worked out between Inor Director L.P. Chromova \n     and the Iranian factory director identified as A. \n     Asgharzadeh, amounted to $48,000 for 620 kilograms of alloy, \n     plus several hundred dollars in shipping and packaging costs.\n       Efforts to locate and contact Inor were unsuccessful, and a \n     U.S. official said details about the facility are known only \n     to the CIA.\n       A CIA spokesman declined to comment.\n       The deal includes Inor's offer to provide ``thermal \n     treatment'' for the alloys ``so that the Iranians could \n     process the material themselves,'' the report said.\n       The Iranians have bought 240 kilograms of the high-strength \n     steel alloy known as ``21HKMT'' for $24,000, the report said. \n     The steel will be sent in bars that U.S. officials say the \n     Iranians will shape for missile-casing material.\n       The remaining materials are alloy foil designated by Inor \n     as ``49K2F,'' ``CUBE2'' and ``5ON'' that are being sold in \n     sheets 0.2 millimeter and 0.4 millimeter thick.\n       The special foil is used to shield guidance equipment in \n     missiles--material that is needed only for longer-range \n     missiles.\n       ``This gets into the whole business of the longer-range \n     ballistic missiles that they are seeking to develop,'' said \n     one Clinton administration official familiar with the issue. \n     ``There are a number of countries that are very, very \n     concerned about these Shahab-3 and Shahab-4 missiles.''\n       During meetings with Vice President Al Gore in Moscow Sept. \n     19 and 20, senior Russian officials, including Russian \n     President Borris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Victor \n     Chernomyrdin, provided the administration with \n     ``commitments'' that Russia is not assisting Iran's missile \n     program, according to a senior White House official.\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\n       Asked if the administration believes those commitments have \n     halted the missile trade, the senior officials said: ``The \n     answer is, we are not satisfied. We're still concerned about \n     ongoing activities.''\n       The official declined to comment on the Inor case, but \n     said, ``to the extent that we see activities going on that we \n     think are contrary to the assurances we've gotten from the \n     Russians, we are making an effort to bring that to their \n     attention and asking them to follow up.''\n       One official said ``21HKMT'' is a specialty steel that Iran \n     does not produce. The steel is a key material used by North \n     Korea and Iran for missiles, but it is not controlled under \n     the 31-nation Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).\n       The Clinton administration has sought to add the alloy to \n     the MTCR control list, but those efforts have been blocked by \n     Russia and France, the official said.\n       Inor is one of several Russian scientific and production \n     centers identified by U.S. intelligence agencies as being \n     involved in Iran's development of a liquid-fuel missile \n     similar in design to North Korea's Nodong missile.\n       In 1996, Inor prepared several contracts with Iran's Shahid \n     Hemmat Industrial Group, which is in charge of Iran's liquid-\n     fuel missile program. Inor brokered deals to supply the \n     Iranians with laser equipment, special mirrors used in \n     missile testing, maraging steel used in missile casings and \n     composite graphite-tungsten material.\n       Russia's Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute has been \n     helping Iran build a wind tunnel.\n       The Times disclosed last month that several Russian \n     entities were involved in Iran's program to build two \n     derivatives of the Nodong missile, the Shahab-3 and Shahab-4, \n     that will be fielded within three years.\n       According to an Israeli military intelligence report \n     provided to the CIA and the Pentagon in January, the Iranians \n     have worked closely with the Russian Space Agency; \n     Rosvoorouzhenie, the Russian government arms-export agency; \n     the Bauman Institute; the missile manufacturer NPO Trud; a \n     firm called Polyus and other institutes.\n       The Israeli intelligence report identified Yuri Koptev, \n     head of the Russian Space Agency, as being connected to the \n     project. Mr. Koptev is Mr. Yeltsin's representative in talks \n     with the United States on the issue.\n       Asked about Mr. Koptev's role in the Iranian program, the \n     senior White House official said Mr. Koptev was ``irate'' \n     during the meetings in Moscow and felt disclosure of his role \n     was ``an unfair slam.''\n       The official said Mr. Koptev has been helpful in seeking to \n     resolve U.S. concerns.\n       Mr. Koptev told U.S. officials attending the Moscow meeting \n     that he did not want U.S. aid to the Russian space program to \n     ``collapse'' because of U.S. opposition to the Russia-Iran \n     cooperation, which Mr. Koptev described as ``important in my \n     world, but a secondary issue,'' the official said.\n       The official said he believes the Shahab-3 is ``within \n     Iran's basic technical capabilities.'' For the Shahab-4, ``I \n     think the Iranians are more heavily dependent on external, \n     and in particular, Russian, assistance'' to field the system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM.\n  S. 1312. A bill to save lives and prevent injuries to children in \nmotor vehicles through an improved national, State, and local child \nprotection program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   the child passenger protection act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \ndesigned to increase the awareness and education of parents and public \nsafety professionals with respect to the proper use and installation of \nchild safety seats.\n  This legislation, the Child Passenger Protection Act of 1997, is \nnearly identical to legislation introduced in the other Chamber earlier \nthis year by the gentlewoman from Maryland, Representative Morella. It \nwould make $7.5 million [i.e., seven point five million] dollars \navailable to the Secretary of Transportation in each of the next two \nfiscal years--FY'98 and '99--for the purpose of assisting State highway \nagencies, police departments, and child passenger safety organizations \nin setting up and promoting such programs.\n  To receive funding under this bill, a program must focus on \npreventing death and injury to children under the age of 5 years old. \nThe program must educate the public about all aspects of the proper \ninstallation of child restraints using seat belt hardware and other \nsupplemental hardware or modification devices. The program must also \neducate the public with respect to the appropriate child restraint \ndesign selection and placement as well as harness threading and harness \nadjustment. Finally, the program must train and retrain child passenger \nsafety professionals, police officers, fire and emergency medical \npersonnel, and other educators concerning all aspects of child \nrestraint use.\n  As the parents of three children under the age of 5, all of whom \nstill ride in child car safety seats, my wife and I can attest to the \nfact that these considerations require a great deal of attention. My \nwife Jane serves as Honorary Chairperson of the Detroit SAFE KIDS \nCoalition and has been deeply involved in the issue of car seat safety \nfor some time, along with a number of other child protection advocacy \nissues. This past Labor Day, I was the sponsor of a Senate resolution \nthat provided permission to the National SAFE KIDS Coalition to use the \nCapitol Building grounds for the kickoff event of the National SAFE \nKIDS Buckle Up Campaign. The entire Abraham family participated in this \nevent. Our family has filmed Public Service Announcements on this issue \nfor the National SAFE KIDS Campaign and we are planning to sponsor and \nto participate in car seat safety check events in the coming months \nback in Michigan.\n  Based on our shared experience, I can assure my colleagues that there \nis often tremendous confusion among both parents and public safety \npersonnel when it comes to the proper selection, installation and use \nof child restraint devices in motor vehicles. Results from regional \nchild restraint clinics demonstrated between 70 and 90 percent of child \nrestraints are incorrectly installed or otherwise misused, which is \noften caused by the complication and wide variety in seat belt and \nchild restraint designs. And while there are several public-private \npartnership programs which exist that focus on the dangers of air bags \nand the proper placement of children in cars equipped with air bags, \nmany of these programs fall short of specifically educating parents and \npublic safety officials on the proper methods for installing and using \nchild safety seats.\n  It is my hope that we can focus the country's attention on this \nserious problem and, in the process, prevent needless death and injury \namong young children. While this legislation alone will by no means \nsolve the problem, I believe it is a positive step towards better \neducating parents and public safety officials on this important public \nsafety issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Passenger Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The annual losses in the United States from motor \n     vehicle collisions are estimated to exceed 800 deaths and \n     80,000 injuries to children under the age of 5.\n       (2) It is estimated that properly used child restraints in \n     motor vehicles can reduce the chance of serious or fatal \n     injury in a motor vehicle collision--\n       (A) by a factor of 69 percent with respect to infants; and\n       (B) by a factor of 47 percent with respect to children \n     under the age of 5.\n       (3) Some of the most common seating position designs that \n     have emerged in motor vehicles during the last decade make \n     secure installation of child restraints difficult and, in \n     some circumstances, impossible.\n       (4) Results from regional child restraint clinics \n     demonstrated that 70 to 90 percent of child restraints are \n     improperly installed or otherwise misused and the improper \n     installation or other misuse is largely attributable to the \n     complication and wide variations in seat belt and child \n     restraint designs.\n       (5) There is an immediate need to expand the availability \n     of national, State, and local child restraint education \n     programs and supporting resources and materials to assist \n     agencies and associated organizations in carrying out \n     effective public education concerning child restraints.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Child restraint education program.--The term ``child \n     restraint education program'' includes a publication, \n     audiovisual presentation, demonstration, or computerized \n     child restraint education program.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n     Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 139\n\n       Whereas more than 12,000,000 children under age 5, \n     including half of all infants under age 1, in the United \n     States, spend at least part of their day in the care of \n     someone other than their parents;\n       Whereas there are millions of additional children under the \n     age of 12 in the United States who are in some form of child \n     care at the beginning and end of the school day as well as \n     during school holidays and vacations;\n       Whereas for parents who must work, child care services that \n     are dependable and of high quality make it easier to find and \n     keep a job;\n       Whereas good child care helps parents reach and maintain \n     economic self-sufficiency;\n       Whereas a solid partnership between parents and loving, \n     trained child care professionals is essential to ensure the \n     quality of child care, whether that care is provided in the \n     home of the child, in a family child care setting, with \n     relatives, or in a child care center;\n       Whereas the availability of child care that is reliable, \n     convenient, and affordable is essential to maintaining and \n     expanding the workforce of the United States and is vital for \n     a parent making a successful transition from welfare to work;\n       Whereas for the millions of children in the care of someone \n     other than their parents, child care provides the foundation \n     upon which their future education will be built, and such \n     care provides the basis on which the future workforce of the \n     United States will be formed;\n       Whereas poor compensation and limited opportunities for \n     professional training and education contribute to high staff \n     turnover among child care providers, which disrupts the \n     creation of the strong provider-child relationships that are \n     critical to the healthy development of children;\n       Whereas the quality of child care has decisive and long-\n     lasting effects on how children develop socially, \n     emotionally, and academically, and how the children cope with \n     stress;\n       Whereas studies indicate that children who require child \n     care services do better in child care settings with trained, \n     licensed, and accredited child care professionals; and\n       Whereas a national day of recognition for child care \n     professionals will help people in the United States \n     understand and appreciate the role of child care for working \n     families, will highlight the importance of the parent-\n     provider partnership, will provide opportunities to showcase \n     skilled, nurturing providers and quality child care settings, \n     and will energize more capable people to become child care \n     professionals: Now, therefore, be it\n           Resolved, That the Senate designates April 24, 1998, as \n     ``National Child Care Professional's Day''. The Senate \n     requests that the President issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nresolution to designate the fourth Friday in April, April 24, 1998, as \nNational Child Care Professional's Day.\n  For the more than 12 million children under the age of five--\nincluding half of all infants under 1 year of age--who spend at least \npart of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents--\nit is important that we recognize the skills and dedication of the \nchild care providers who take care of them. Child care professionals \ntake care of our Nation's children in homes and centers throughout the \ncountry. They assume this responsibility for little pay, long hours, \nand few, if any benefits beyond the hugs and smiles of the children for \nwhich they care.\n  As the public dialog on child care moves to the forefront, we must \nkeep in mind the people who are caring for our children, while their \nmothers and fathers work. If we want to move child care from \nbabysitting to early childhood education we have to concentrate much of \nour efforts on professional development for child care providers. And \nwe have to support efforts to make child care a valued profession--one \nthat attracts the best and brightest and pays enough to keep them \ncaring for our children.\n  Since 1990, the costs of child care have risen about 6 percent \nannually. This is almost triple the annual increase in the cost of \nliving. At the same time, there are strong indicators that the quality \nof child care has significantly decreased during the same period of \ntime. Parents are paying more bet getting less.\n  The quality of child care in America is very troubling. A recent \nnationwide study found that 40-percent of the child care provided to \ninfants in child care centers was potentially injurious. Fifteen \npercent of center-based child care providers for all pre-schoolers are \nso bad that a child's health and safety are threatened; 70-percent are \nmediocre--not hurting or helping children; and 15-percent actively \npromote a child's development. Center-based child care, the object of \nthis study, is the most heavily regulated and frequently monitored type \nof child care. There are strong indications that care for children in \nless regulated settings, such as family-based child care and in-home \ncare, is far worse.\n  Unless we are willing to provide the support and assistance that is \nneeded to help child care providers improve the services they provide \nto our children, there is little real hope for enhancing the quality of \nchild care.\n  Since the 1970's there has been a decline in child care teacher \nsalaries. In 1990, teachers in child care centers earned an average of \n$11,500 a year. Assistant teachers, the largest growing segment of \nchild care professionals, were paid 10- to 20-percent less than child \ncare teachers. The 1990 annual income of regulated family child care \nproviders was $10,944 which translates to about $4 an hour. \nNonregulated family child care, generally comprised of providers taking \ncare of a smaller number of children, earned an average of $4,275 a \nyear--substantially less than minimum wage.\n  With these wages, it is easy to understand why more child care \nproviders do not participate in professional training or attend college \nclasses to improve their skills. The costs of applying for\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\nand receiving certification as a qualified child care professional are \nminimal, but understandably out of reach for many child care providers.\n  Think about it. At the most important time in the development of a \nchild's brain, more than 12 million children are being cared for by \npeople who are paid less than the person who picks up your garbage each \nweek, are required to have less training than the person who cuts your \nhair, and less skill-based testing than the person delivering packages \nto your house. Child care providers play an important role in a child's \ndevelopment, for they help fine-tune the child's capacity to think and \nprocess information, social skills, emotional health, and acquisition \nof language.\n  That is why this resolution is so important. Good child care enables \nparents to work and maintain economic self-sufficiency--the goal of \nlast year's welfare reform legislation. This resolution is a small step \nto increase the public's awareness of the need to support and recognize \nthe vital work provided by child care professionals.\n  On April 24, 1998, I hope each of us will visit a child care center \nor family-based child care provider in our State. Lead efforts to \ncelebrate the contributions that child care professionals make to our \nsociety, our economy, our families, and most of all--our children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I'd like to join Senator Jeffords in submitting the \nSenate resolution declaring the last Friday in April National Child \nCare Professional's Day.\n  Child care is a vital part of the fabric of the daily lives of \nmillions of America families. The majority of children today have \nworking parents who must find some way of ensuring that their children \nare safe and well-cared for during working hours.\n  Millions of children of all income levels are cared for by someone \nother than their parents. Each day, approximately 13 million children \nspend some or all of their day in some type of child care.\n  Research demonstrates that the quality of these settings makes a \nsignificant difference in children's health, safety and early learning. \nYet far too many children are being cared for in poor quality settings \nthat jeopardize their safety and development.\n  We know how to do it better, and it is long past time to start doing \nit. A sensible action plan includes better staff training, requiring \nbasic health and safety protections, monitoring programs, informing \nparents, and improving staff salaries.\n  Today, Senator Jeffords, Senator Dodd, Senator Roberts, and I are \nsubmitting a bipartisan Senate resolution to designate the last Friday \nin April every year as National Child Care Professional's Day, starting \nnext April--April 24, 1998.\n  Child Care professionals are indispensable to the future of the \nNation's children. Children deserve the best we can provide. Parents \ndeserve the peace of mind that comes with knowledge that their children \nare in safe, healthy surroundings that encourage, not undermine their \ndevelopment.\n  Quality child care is essential for healthy child growth and healthy \nchild development.

GRANT-BACKED TRANSPORTATION FINANCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Grant-\n     Backed Transportation Finance Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The economic vitality of the Nation and the quality of \n     life of its citizens depend on increased investment in \n     transportation infrastructure for the movement of people and \n     goods, including highways, roads, and bridges and transit and \n     airport equipment and facilities.\n       (2) Improving mobility will increase productivity and \n     competitiveness, strengthen the Nation's capacity for \n     noninflationary economic growth, and contribute to \n     environmental quality.\n       (3) The Nation's need to build, maintain, and reconstruct \n     transportation facilities, and to provide additional \n     transportation infrastructure investment in both rural and \n     urban areas, exceeds available resources under traditional \n     funding programs.\n       (4) User fees can finance transportation facilities \n     efficiently and equitably over the useful lives of these \n     capital assets.\n       (5) Recent Federal initiatives are helping States \n     innovatively finance capital investment in transportation \n     facilities.\n       (6) Grant-backed financing is an innovative way to finance \n     transportation infrastructure that uses future Federal \n     transportation payments to pay debt service or to credit \n     enhance State transportation financings, prudently leveraging \n     limited Federal, State, local, and public-private partnership \n     resources to meet critical transportation investment needs.\n       (7) Bonds with grant-backed financing could be issued or \n     credit enhanced by a limited-purpose State entity and secured \n     with the State's assignment of its formula grant payments \n     from the Highway or Mass Transit Accounts of the Highway \n     Trust Fund or the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to the \n     limited-purpose entity which shall first apply such funds to \n     pay principal and interest on grant financed bonds issued by \n     the limited-purpose entity, or to fund credit enhancements \n     for bonds secured with other State, local, or public-private \n     revenues, and, then, transfer the remaining funds to the \n     State.\n       (8) Grant-backed financing enables State and local \n     governments and their transportation agencies, authorities, \n     and infrastructure banks to benefit immediately from the \n     State's future authorized Federal transportation grants.\n       (9) With grant-backed financing State and local governments \n     could--\n       (A) start and complete transportation infrastructure \n     projects years sooner than using traditional programs, \n     putting new and rehabilitated transportation facilities in \n     use more quickly;\n       (B) avoid project inflation costs;\n       (C) reduce the interest and credit enhancement costs of \n     borrowing; and\n       (D) accelerate project-generated economic activity.\n       (c) State Election To Provide Grant-Backed Transportation \n     Financing.--\n       (1) In general.--If a State makes an election described in \n     paragraph (2) with respect to any portion of the amounts \n     payable to the State from the Highway or Mass Transit \n     Accounts of the Highway Trust Fund or the Airport and Airway \n     Trust Fund as authorized by title 23 or 49, United States \n     Code, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit such\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\n     portion in a designated account in the name of the limited-\n     purpose entity designated in such election for the fiscal \n     year with respect to which such election is made and for each \n     succeeding fiscal year until such limited-purpose entity's \n     bonds, together with the interest thereon, or credit \n     enhancements provided by such limited-purpose entity on other \n     State, local, or public-private bonds have been fully met and \n     discharged.\n       (2) Election described.--\n       (A) In general.--An election described in this paragraph is \n     an irrevocable election made by a State (in such form and \n     manner as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) by \n     which the State, in its sole discretion and at its sole \n     liability, designates a portion of amounts described in \n     paragraph (1) for deposit in a designated account to be used \n     by a limited-purpose entity described in subparagraph (B) \n     only for purposes described in subparagraph (C).\n       (B) Limited-purpose entity described.--A limited-purpose \n     entity described in this subparagraph is an entity designated \n     in the election and enabled by the State only--\n       (i) to receive funds from the Highway or Mass Transit \n     Accounts of the Highway Trust Fund or the Airport and Airway \n     Trust Fund;\n       (ii) to issue up to a specified amount of bonds secured by \n     those funds or to fund up to a specified amount of credit \n     enhancements for bonds secured with other State, local, or \n     public-private revenues, or both; and\n       (iii) to enter into agreements with the State governing the \n     disbursement of the proceeds of bonds issued by such limited-\n     purpose entity.\n       (C) Purposes described.--Purposes described in this \n     subparagraph for funds received under an election under this \n     subsection are--\n       (i) to pay any principal and interest due on prior \n     outstanding bonds secured in whole or in part with Federal \n     formula grant payments;\n       (ii) to pay any principal and interest due on such bonds \n     issued by the limited-purpose entity, and to fund any \n     reserves or other credit enhancements established in \n     connection with limited-purpose entity bonds or other State, \n     local, or public-private bonds; and\n       (iii) thereafter to be used by such State as it determines.\n       (d) No Federal Guarantee of Bonds.--Bond issues supported \n     in whole or in part by Federal payments subject to an \n     election described in subsection (c)(2) shall not be \n     considered subject to either a direct or indirect Federal \n     guarantee for the purposes of section 149(b) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986. Nor shall the exercise of State \n     discretion irrevocably designating a specific State account \n     in the name of a limited-purpose entity for receipt of \n     Federal transportation payments under an election described \n     in subsection (c)(2) be considered either a direct or \n     indirect Federal guarantee for the purposes of such section \n     149(b).\n       (e) No Federal Remedy for Bondholders.--No bondholder of a \n     bond described in subsection (d) shall have any right or \n     remedy against the Federal Government.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Extradition Treaties \n     Interpretation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a \n     parent in violation of law, court order, or legally binding \n     agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;\n       (2) until the mid-1970's, parental abduction generally was \n     not considered a criminal offense in the United States;\n       (3) since the mid-1970's, United States criminal law has \n     evolved such that parental abduction is now a criminal \n     offense in each of the 50 States and the District of \n     Columbia;\n       (4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime \n     Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-173; 107 Stat. 1998; 18 U.S.C. \n     1204), Congress recognized the need to combat parental \n     abduction by making the act of international parental \n     kidnapping a Federal criminal offense;\n       (5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United \n     States is a party specifically list the offenses that are \n     extraditable and use the word ``kidnapping'', but it has been \n     the practice of the United States not to consider the term to \n     include parental abduction because these treaties were \n     negotiated by the United States prior to the development in \n     United States criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and \n     (4);\n       (6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the \n     United States is a party contain dual criminality provisions, \n     which provide for extradition where both parties make the \n     offense a felony; and therefore it is the practice of the \n     United States to consider such treaties to include parental \n     abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the \n     act of parental abduction to be a criminal offense; and\n       (7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United \n     States extradition law which should be rectified to better \n     protect the interests of children and their parents.\n\n     SEC. 3. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES.\n\n       For purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United \n     States is a party, Congress authorizes the interpretation of \n     the terms ``kidnapping'' and ``kidnapping'' to include \n     parental kidnapping.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11161-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11161-S11162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                DOMENICI (AND CHAFEE) AMENDMENT NO. 1522\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Chafee) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill S. 1173, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n                     TITLE III--ADDITIONAL FUNDING\n\n     SEC. 3001.

Mr. President, I am not a member of the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, so I wanted to take a moment to \naddress an issue that was a subject of a hearing in that Committee this \nmorning.\n  The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Jeffords, and my good friend \nand colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, have co-sponsored \nan important and much-needed piece of legislation, the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act of 1997. I am an original co-sponsor of that \nbill.\n  Mr. President, when I was first sworn in as a United States Senator \nin 1985, I authored the gay and lesbian civil rights bill. At that \ntime, only five other Senators would join me as co-sponsors of that \nlegislation. In the 103rd Congress, I testified before the Armed \nServices Committee to lift the ban on gay men and lesbians serving in \nthe military.\n  I agree with those who testified today before the Labor Committee, \nincluding Raymond Smith, the chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic, \nand Herbert Valentine of the Presbyterian Church that ENDA is a \nsolution to a serious problem in our society. I have heard from many \nAmericans who have suffered discrimination in the workplace because of \ntheir sexual orientation. It is time for these Americans to have \nrecourse against blatant discrimination, just as Americans who are \nfired on the basis of their religion, national origin or gender. \nMassachusetts has recognized the problems of anti-gay and lesbian \ndiscrimination in the workplace and already has an ENDA-like law.\n  Mr. President, last year, I joined 65 of our colleagues in signing a \npledge that I would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation \nin hiring, promotion and firing. I personally will not tolerate \ndiscrimination in my office. Like the majority of our colleagues, \nsigning this pledge came easy to me. I have always had openly gay and \nlesbian staff and they have served the people of Massachusetts with \neffective and committed distinction.\n  So, now, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to live up to the \npledge they signed and support this important legislation. It is my \nhope that the Committee will report the bill out as soon as possible \nand I call upon the Majority Leader to find time to bring this \nimportant legislation to the floor for debate. It was voted on last \nyear and wound up in a de facto tie. This year, I am confident it will \npass.\n  Mr. President, for years, groups like the Human Rights Campaign, the \nNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Parents, Families and Friends of \nLesbians and Gays, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, as \nwell as members of the religious communities across this country, have \neducated us on the need for this bill. They have worked tirelessly with \nus to improve this legislation, and I applaud their tenacity and \nappreciate their friendship. They are dogged advocates for justice and \nfairness.\n  Voices as eloquent as those of Coretta Scott King and Senator Barry \nGoldwater have spoken up in support of ENDA. The President of the \nUnited States has signaled his approval of the bill. Let us debate it \nand pass it soon, Mr. President. Let us send a strong message that all \nAmericans matter, and that no one should suffer discrimination in the \nwork place. Let us move forward in the fight for civil rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11163-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11163-S11164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BRAIN TUMOR AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, Americans from around \nthe country gathered here at the Capitol to hold a rally in conjunction \nwith Brain Tumor Awareness Week. I want to add my voice to those \ncalling attention to this debilitating disease and to the calls for \ncontinuing to increase our funding for medical research.\n  It sounds wrong to call one debilitating disease more important than \nanother. After all, a life-threatening disease is a life-threatening \ndisease. However, as a society, we often get caught up in the rhetoric \nand publicity surrounding one of these terrible afflictions and forget \nthat, unfortunately, there are a number of other terminal illnesses. \nWhile brain tumors do not receive as much press as other terminal \nillnesses, their impact on the lives of brain tumor patients and their \nfamilies is equally devastating.\n  One of those people is a constituent of mine, Ms. Kathy Delledonne-\nMinutola. She and her husband attended the rally on Tuesday because, \nfour years ago, their son Joseph was diagnosed with a brain stem tumor. \nThe roots of the tumor have wrapped around Joseph's brain stem, a \ncondition which makes removal of the tumor impossible.\n  Mr. President, there are thousands of people across this country who \nhave been diagnosed with brain tumors, just like Joseph. In fact, each \nyear approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed \nwith a brain\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\ntumor. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer death for \nchildren and young adults up to age 34, and they are one of the fastest \ngrowing causes of cancer death in the elderly.\n  Furthermore, each patient is different, and potential for recovery \ndepends on a number of factors. The type of tumor, its location, the \narea of the brain involved, and the forms of therapy the patient will \nreceive all contribute to a patient's prognosis. Currently, there is no \ncure for most malignant brain tumors. Surgery, radiation therapy, and \nchemotherapy are the three most common treatments. However, because \nbrain tumors are located at the control center for human thought, \nemotion, and movement, both the tumor and its treatment can have \ndevastating effects on a person's physical and cognitive abilities.\n  Despite often bleak projections for recovery, however, the community \nof people who have been affected by this disease has refused to give \nup. Their courage and support for one another in the face of tragedy is \ntruly inspirational. They are proof that the power of the human spirit \ncan triumph over adversity in even the darkest of moments.\n  So, Mr. President, in this, Brain Tumor Awareness Week, I rise today \nto applaud the tireless commitment that brain tumor patients and their \nfamilies have made to beating this disease. This is a remarkable group \nof people. However, they cannot take on the burden of finding a cure on \ntheir own. We in Congress need to help, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues, as I have in the past, to support medical research \nfunding. While Brain Tumor Awareness Week may only last seven days, our \ncommitment to finding a cure must be a year-round endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11163-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOSTON'S SUBWAY\n\n   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to call attention today to \nthe centennial of the first subway in the United States. On September \n1, 1897, the first ride took place from Boylston Street to Park Street \nin Boston, MA.\n  Anyone who has ever lived in Boston has experienced the excellent \nservice that this subway system provides. Students in the higher \neducation capital of the United States--if not of the entire world--\nhave long utilized the subways. Just to cite several examples: the \nGreen Line goes to Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern \nUniversity; and the Red Line has stops at or near Harvard University, \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University. In \nfact, the Red Line derives its name from the Crimson of Harvard \nUniversity.\n  Green is not only a color of a line in the Boston subway system, but \nan important symbol of the benefits of public transportation--namely \ncommunity revitalization, economic development, and environmental \nprotection. This historic occasion makes this a propitious moment to \ntake a look at how these benefits have played out over the past \ncentury.\n  Greater Boston faced a choice of continuing to build highway arteries \nthrough the living heart of the city or to improve mass transit systems \nout to what we called the ``subway suburbs.'' We in Massachusetts made \nthe right choice by developing the new Orange Line along the Southwest \ncorridor in the 1980's and reviving the Old Colony commuter rail line \nin this decade. These choices preserved communities, led to new \neconomic growth, and minimized the environmental damage caused by \nautomobiles stuck in rush-hour traffic.\n  These choices have not come, however, without incurring significant \ncosts. For example, fares have increased from a nickel a century ago to \na dime in 1919, a quarter in 1968, and a half-dollar in 1980. Today, a \nsubway ride costs $0.85, although monthly commuters can travel more \ncheaply.\n  Looking at the cost issue in a larger sense, in 1897, the subway \nsystem cost $4.4 million. On September 25 of this year, I announced \nSenate committee approval of a 6-year reauthorization of mass transit \nprograms that will bring more than $300 million in additional ISTEA \ntransit funds to Massachusetts. I am pleased that Massachusetts \nreceived its fair share of transit spending; I look forward to working \nwith all of my colleagues to ensure that my State and others will \nreceive their fair shares of highway funds as well.\n  This is an extraordinarily exciting time for mass transit in \nMassachusetts. While everyone knows about the Central Artery Project \nthat will revolutionize automobile travel in Boston, other cities in \nMassachusetts, like Worcester and Springfield, are rebuilding their \nhistoric train stations, creating true multimodal centers to restore \navailable, efficient, and flexible transportation for working people. \nThe Federal commitment to transit that was announced last month will \nensure improved services are available for years to come not only for \nBoston, but also for cities around the Commonwealth and across our \ncountry.\n  Mass transit systems like Boston's are also important for enhancing \nthe lives of individuals with disabilities. I am pleased with the \nrecent reauthorization of an initiative of mine called Project Action, \nwhich helps disabled people gain access to public transportation by \nworking with transit operators and the disabled community to implement \nthe transportation provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nProject Action has increased accessibility to buses and trains \nnationwide.\n  Excellent mass transit systems like the one that we are fortunate to \nhave in Boston play critical roles in the welfare reform effort. As we \nattempt to create more jobs so that welfare recipients can enter into \nthe working world, we must not lose sight of the fact that these \nemployees will need an affordable and reliable means of transportation \nso that they can get to their jobs. Those who took part in the first \nsubway ride a century ago could not have envisioned the important \neconomic role that the subway system would play; those of us who know \nabout this need today must remain ever vigilant against attacks that \nwould cut Federal support for mass transportation.\n  If Washington did cut transit funding, then how would Charlie ever \nget out of the subway? Almost 40 years ago, passengers who switched \nfrom subway to trolley lines had to pay another nickel to exit the \nsystem. The Kingston Trio popularized the plight of a Boston subway \npassenger in their song ``The MTA.'' Its lyrics include the following \nverse:\n\n     Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square Station,\n     Every day at a quarter past two.\n     And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich,\n     As the train comes rumbling through.\n\n  Mr. President, Scollay Square Station is now Government Center at \nScollay Square, but the Boston subway system continues to thrive. I \nurge all of my colleagues to join me today in hailing all of the women \nand men who, over the last 100 years, have worked and traveled on \nBoston's subway system. Even now, the subway is more than a historical \nlandmark; rather, it is the lifeblood of the historic and vital \nmetropolis that is Boston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11164-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Those opposed will rise and stand \nuntil counted.\n  On a division, two-thirds of the Senators present having voted in the \naffirmative, the resolutions of ratification are agreed to.\n  The resolutions of ratification were agreed to as follows:\n\n        Agreement With Hong Kong for the Surrender of Fugitives\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the \n     ratification of the Agreement Between the Government of the \n     United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong for \n     the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders signed at Hong Kong on \n     December 20, 1996 (Treaty Doc. 105-3), subject to the \n     understandings of subsection (a), the declarations of \n     subsection (b), and the proviso of subsection (c).\n       (a) Understandings.--The Senate's advice and consent is \n     subject to the following two understandings, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification, and shall be \n     binding on the President:\n       (1) Third party transfers.--The United States understands \n     that Article 16(2) permits the transfer of persons \n     surrendered to Hong Kong under this Agreement beyond the \n     jurisdiction of Hong Kong when the United States so consents, \n     but that the United States will not apply Article 16(2) of \n     the Agreement to permit the transfer of persons surrendered \n     to the Government of Hong Kong to any other jurisdiction in \n     the People's Republic of China, unless the person being \n     surrendered consents to the transfer.\n       (2) Hong Kong courts' power of final adjudication.--The \n     United States understands that Hong Kong's courts have the \n     power of final adjudication over all matters within Hong \n     Kong's autonomy as guaranteed in the 1984 Sino-British Joint \n     Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, signed on December \n     19, 1984, and ratified on May 27, 1985. The United States \n     expects that any exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Hong \n     Kong courts for acts of state shall be construed narrowly. \n     The United States understands that the exemption for acts of \n     state does not diminish the responsibilities of the Hong Kong \n     authorities with respect to extradition or the rights of an \n     individual to a fair trial in Hong Kong courts. Any attempt \n     by the Government of Hong Kong or the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China to curtail the jurisdiction and \n     power of final adjudication of the Hong Kong courts may be \n     considered grounds for withdrawal from the Agreement.\n       (b) Declarations.--The Senate's advice and consent is \n     subject to the following two declarations, which shall be \n     binding on the President:\n       (1) Report on the hong kong judicial system.--One year \n     after entry into force, the Secretary of State, in \n     coordination with the Attorney General, shall prepare and \n     submit a report to the Committee on Foreign Relations that \n     addresses the following issues during the period after entry \n     into force of the Agreement:\n       (i) an assessment of the independence of the Hong Kong \n     judicial system from the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China, including a summary of any instances in which the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China has infringed \n     upon the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary;\n       (ii) an assessment of the due process accorded all persons \n     under the jurisdiction of the Government of Hong Kong;\n       (iii) an assessment of the due process accorded persons \n     extradited to Hong Kong by the United States;\n       (iv) an accounting of the citizenship and number of persons \n     extradited to Hong Kong from the United States, and the \n     citizenship and number of persons extradited to the United \n     States from Hong Kong;\n       (v) an accounting of the destination of third party \n     transfer of persons who were originally extradited from the \n     United States, and the citizenship of those persons;\n       (vi) a summary of the types of crimes for which persons \n     have been extradited between the United States and Hong Kong.\n       (2) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty.\n       (c) Proviso.--The resolution of ratification is subject to \n     the following proviso, which shall not be included in the \n     instrument of ratification to be signed by the President:\n       (1) Supremacy of the constitution.--Nothing in the Treaty \n     requires or authorizes legislation or other action by the \n     United States of America that is prohibited by the \n     Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to address the United States-Hong \nKong Extradition Treaty, a treaty which I have followed closely in its \npassage through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  To most Americans, the seemingly nebulous topic of extradition \ntreaties is not particularly important. But let us not be distracted by \nthe complex legal jargon that accompanies this\n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\nagreement with Hong Kong. Our extradition agreements strike at the very \nheart of equality before the law, one of our most cherished freedoms in \nAmerica. Our judicial system seeks to protect the due process right of \nforeigner and native citizen alike, and our extradition treaties with \nother nations are based on the premise that any person we transfer to a \nforeign court system will receive similarly just treatment.\n  The extradition treaty with Hong Kong is thus a very important \nconsideration in assessing the future prospects for freedom in the \nformer colony, now under Chinese rule. We need to consider this \nextradition treaty in light of China's overall behavior toward Hong \nKong in recent months. China's actions to undermine democracy in Hong \nKong cast doubt on the future of civil liberties in the British colony. \nChina has declared the elected Hong Kong legislature invalid and \nappointed a hand-picked provisional legislative body. China's appointed \nchief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, has announced additional \nmeasures to restrict civil liberties in the colony.\n  Public protests will have to receive prior approval and could be \nbanned to protect ``national security.'' Hong Kong political \norganizations will be required to register with the government and will \nbe prohibited from seeking or receiving funds from overseas \norganizations. Under China's definition of a Hong Kong political group, \ninternational organizations that expose China's human rights abuses \nalso will be banned from receiving critical foreign funding. In light \nof these troubling steps taken by Beijing, not to mention China's \nviolation of trade agreements, weapons proliferation commitments, and \nhuman rights standards, there are few doubts in my mind that China will \nbend the rules of this extradition treaty we are considering today.\n  The extradition treaty contains provisions that supposedly preserve \ndue process and the ability of the United States to refuse extradition \nrequests that are politically motivated. As with all international \nagreements, however, effective enforcement is essential to protect \nAmerican interests. The strongest treaty language in the world is \nmeaningless without presidential vigilance, a vigilance I find \nappallingly lacking in the Clinton administration. This administration \nhas failed to confront China consistently on human rights violations, \ntrade barriers, and weapons proliferation. I am concerned that the \nadministration will adopt a similarly lax attitude in the enforcement \nof this treaty.\n\n  The Clinton administration's defense of Hong Kong in other areas has \nbeen weak at best. The White House has been hesitant to meet with \npolitical activists from the colony, and Vice President Gore failed to \ninclude Hong Kong in the itinerary of his last trip to East Asia. The 6 \nmillion people in Hong Kong deserve better treatment from America. The \nfight to preserve liberty in Hong Kong could be the battle that \ndetermines the outcome of the overall campaign to cultivate democracy \nin China. Hong Kong serves as yet another example of liberty to over 1 \nbillion Chinese, and the effective removal of that example would set \nback the march of freedom in China.\n  In considering this extradition treaty, we need to be honest. We are \nnot signing this treaty with Hong Kong alone, but with Beijing. By \ndoing so, we could be placing our stamp of approval on a court system \nthat will, by all appearances, increasingly be an extension of the \nChinese Communist Party.\n  The United States has never before signed a treaty to extradite human \nbeings to a totalitarian Communist regime, and I hope this treaty will \nnot turn into the first example of such policy. The United States has \nbeen given a great trust as the leader of the free world, and the \ninternational commitments we make should reflect our country's \ncommitment to democracy and the rule of law.\n  We in America need to realize that the forces of justice and liberty \nare at work in the Chinese people just as they have been at work with \nsuch stunning effect in other nations around the world. When China \nembraces democracy--just as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have done--\nthe rule of law will follow. Until that day arrives, it will be good to \nsay we stood by the Chinese people in their struggle for justice and \nliberty. Effective enforcement of this extradition treaty will be an \nimportant step in ensuring that the example of freedom in Hong Kong is \npreserved for the benefit of all Chinese.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the reversion of Hong Kong to the People's \nRepublic of China is a historic event, the full impact of which may not \nbe known for years. At midnight on June 30, the world watched as the \nflag of the United Kingdom came down over Hong Kong, the final chapter \nof over a century of the British Empire's presence in the Far East. \nJuly 1 dawned with the flag of China flying over Victoria Harbor, \nproviding a great moment of pride for the people of China as Beijing \nrecovered a territory lost in humiliating fashion to foreign powers.\n  For the cause of freedom, the reversion is a conundrum.\n  Some observers warn that China intends to trample Hong Kong's \nfreedoms. After a decade in which millions have cast off the yoke of \nCommunist rule of the Soviet Empire, the subjugation of the people of \nHong Kong to the control of a dictatorial government in Beijing is \nsurely a sad anomaly.\n  Others predict optimistically that in the end China, not Hong Kong, \nwill be transformed by the new union. They point to the changes already \nunderway in China, and foresee a more prosperous, open, plural, and \ndemocratic system for one-fifth of the world's population.\n  I believe the future of Hong Kong, like that of China, is not yet \nwritten. The actions of the United States will affect the ability of \nthe people of Hong Kong to preserve their democratic freedoms and \noverall quality of life.\n  Visiting Washington recently on his first trip abroad as Hong Kong's \nChief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa rightly took pride in the former \ncolony's smooth transition to Chinese rule. But he also candidly \nacknowledged that preserving Hong Kong's economic vitality and \nexpanding the democratic freedoms enjoyed by its 5\\1/2\\ million \nresidents required not only a steady hand in Hong Kong, but also the \nsustained interest and support of the international community.\n  It is in this context that we must view the U.S.-Hong Kong \nextradition agreement.\n  Approval of the treaty is a risk, for it is predicated on a question \nwhich cannot be answered in the abstract. The question is this: will \nthe Beijing Government adhere to its pledge to permit Hong Kong a high \ndegree of autonomy for at least 50 years? In other words, will China \nabide by its promise to maintain ``one country, two systems?''\n  No one can answer that question definitively today--not the people of \nHong Kong, not the British Government, not the Clinton \nadministration, not even the gerontocracy in Beijing, which struggles \nto chart a course for China's modernization in the post-Deng Xiao Ping \nera.\n\n  Of course, there is always the risk that a treaty partner will prove \nto be unreliable. That risk is particularly acute here, where the \ntreaty partner--the Hong Kong Government--will be overseen by a \ngovernment in Beijing which has often failed to adhere adequately to \ncommitments made to the United States.\n  Standing opposite that risk are the benefits that flow from having an \nextradition relationship with Hong Kong. For most of this decade, the \nrelationship has undeniably been in our interests. Since 1991, more \nthan 60 persons have been returned to the United States from Hong Kong \npursuant to extradition requests, many of them for serious crimes such \nas narcotics trafficking. By contrast, we have extradited just seven \npersons to Hong Kong.\n  Moreover, the extradition treaty is a critical component of our \noverall law enforcement cooperation with Hong Kong authorities--\ncooperation which has proven enormously successful over the years in \ncombating organized crime, drug smuggling, and international terrorism.\n  Finally, this treaty contains extraordinary protections against any \nattempt by Beijing to meddle with or politicize the extradition \nprocess.\n  Indeed, the treaty provides several protections against valid \nconcerns that the PRC may renege on its pledge to permit Hong Kong to \nretain an independent judiciary. The treaty contains several \nsafeguards; these include: First, a provision allowing the United \nStates broad power to refuse to surrender U.S.\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\nnationals in cases relating to ``the defense, foreign affairs, or \nessential public interest or policy of the United States'' (Article 3); \nsecond, a provision permitting the Secretary of State to deny \nextradition if the request was politically motivated, or the person \nsought is likely to be denied a fair trial or punished because of his \nrace, religion, nationality, or political opinions (Article 6); and \nthird, a provision barring the retransfer of any fugitive beyond the \nterritory of Hong Kong without U.S. consent (Article 16).\n  The Committee has added included two provisions in the resolution of \nratification that provide additional protection. First, understanding \nNo. 1 makes it plain that the United States will not permit the \nretransfer to the People's Republic of China of any persons surrendered \nunder this agreement, unless the person being surrendered consents to \nthe transfer. Understanding No. 2 makes a strong statement in support \nof the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary, by stating that any \neffort to curtail the jurisdiction and power of adjudication of the \nHong Kong courts may be considered grounds for withdrawal from the \nAgreement.\n  In exercising its power to advise and consent, the Senate must \nbalance the risks that China will interfere with the autonomy of Hong \nKong against the likely benefits to U.S. law enforcement that will flow \nfrom the agreement. In my view, the benefits clearly outweigh the \nrisks. And the safeguards in the treaty, in addition to the provisions \nin the resolution of ratification, provide strong protection of U.S. \ninterests and of the rights of those persons who may be surrendered \nunder the treaty.\n  By ratifying this treaty, the Senate will send a strong signal to the \npeople of Hong Kong that we have confidence in their ability to make \nthe unique ``one country, two systems'' formula work. We also send a \nstrong message to Beijing that we will not tolerate any efforts to \nundermine the traditional autonomy and impartiality of Hong Kong's \njudiciary. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting ratification \nof the Hong Kong extradition agreement.\n\n  Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication \n                                 Union\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the \n     ratification of the Constitution of the International \n     Telecommunication Union (ITU), with Annexes, signed at Geneva \n     on December 22, 1992, and Amendments to the Constitution and \n     Convention, signed at Kyoto on October 14, 1994, together \n     with Declarations and Reservations by the United States \n     contained in the Final Acts (Treaty Doc. 104-34), subject to \n     declarations and reservations Nos. 68, 73 and 82 of the 1992 \n     Final Acts; declarations and reservations Nos. 84, 92, 97, \n     and 98 of the 994 Final Acts; and the understandings of \n     subsection (a), the declarations of subsection (b), and the \n     proviso of subsection (c).\n       (a) Understandings.--The Senate's advice and consent is \n     subject to the following two understandings, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification, and shall be \n     binding on the President.\n       (1) Broadcasts to cuba.--The United States of America, \n     noting the Statement (No. 40) entered by the delegation of \n     Cuba during the Plenipotentiary Conference of the \n     International Telecommunication Union, in Kyoto Japan, \n     affirms its rights to broadcast to Cuba on appropriate \n     frequencies free of jamming or other wrongful interference \n     and reserves its rights to address existing interference and \n     any future interference, by Cuba with United States \n     broadcasting.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Extradition Treaties \n     Interpretation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a \n     parent in violation of law, court order, or legally binding \n     agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;\n       (2) until the mid-1970's, parental abduction generally was \n     not considered a criminal offense in the United States;\n       (3) since the mid-1970's, United States criminal law has \n     evolved such that parental abduction is now a criminal \n     offense in each of the 50 States and the District of \n     Columbia;\n       (4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime \n     Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-173; 107 Stat. 1998; 18 U.S.C. \n     1204), Congress recognized the need to combat parental \n     abduction by making the act of international parental \n     kidnapping a Federal criminal offense;\n       (5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United \n     States is a party specifically list the offenses that are \n     extraditable and use the word ``kidnapping'', but it has been \n     the practice of the United States not to consider the term to \n     include parental abduction because these treaties were \n     negotiated by the United States prior to the development in \n     United States criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and \n     (4);\n       (6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the \n     United States is a party contain dual criminality provisions, \n     which provide for extradition where both parties make the \n     offense a felony, and therefore it is the practice of the \n     United States to consider such treaties to include parental \n     abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the \n     act of parental abduction to be a criminal offense; and\n       (7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United \n     States extradition law which should be rectified to better \n     protect the interests of children and their parents.\n\n     SEC. 3. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES.\n\n       For purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United \n     States is a party, Congress authorizes the interpretation of \n     the terms ``kidnaping'' and ``kidnapping'' to include \n     parental kidnapping.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nacting on the Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act. I appreciate the \ncooperation of the chairman of the committee, and the cooperation and \nassistance of the executive branch, in moving this bill forward.\n  The bill is very short, and I will not take the Senate's time to \nreview it at length. In brief, the bill is designed to remedy a \ndisparity in U.S. extradition law and practice. The disparity is this: \nunder certain extradition treaties, the crime of parental abduction--\nwhen one parent takes a child in violation of law or a custody order \nand against the wishes of the other parent--is not extraditable. That \nis so for two related reasons.\n  The criminalization of parental abduction is a relatively recent \ndevelopment in U.S. criminal law. Prior to the mid-1970's, parental \nabduction was generally considered a family law matter not covered by \ncriminal law. In the last two decades or so, U.S. criminal law has \nevolved significantly. All 50 states\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\nmake the act a crime, as does the District of Columbia and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  As a consequence of this development in the law, a disparity has been \ncreated in U.S. extradition law. The disparity occurs in a subset of \nextradition treaties referred to as ``list'' treaties--so named because \nthey specifically enumerate, or list, the crimes under the treaty that \nare considered extraditable. Thus, because the act of parental \nabduction was not a crime when these older list treaties were ratified, \nit has been the practice of the executive branch to interpret the \ntreaties as excluding parental abduction. This concern does not arise \nin more modern ``dual criminality'' treaties, which avoid the limiting \nnature of the list treaties by allowing extradition in any case where \nboth countries make a practice a felony.\n  Seeking to remove this disparity, the Clinton administration has \nrequested authority to adopt a new interpretation of the term \n``kidnapping'' in the list treaties so that it encompasses parental \nabduction. The Foreign Relations Committee strongly supports this \nrequest, and voted unanimously last month to report the bill to the \nSenate.\n  The chairman and I have offered a substitute amendment which makes \nseveral changes to the Committee-reported bill which were recommended \nby the Justice Department after it gave closer review to the \nlegislation. The changes are modest, and mostly technical. I would \nhighlight only one: the committee-reported bill provided, in the \noperative section of the bill, section 3, that the Congress authorizes \nthe interpretation of the term kidnapping to include international \nparental kidnapping. The substitute omits the word ``international,'' \nfor an important reason: the crime of international parental abduction, \nwhich includes as an element the taking of a child out of the country, \nis a Federal offense. But the practical reality is that most \nextradition cases will involve crimes prosecuted at the state level, \nwhere the offense does not include the aforementioned element of \nremoving the child from the country. Thus, the substitute ensures that \nthe bill has the broadest possible reach.\n  Mr. President, the abduction of children by their parents is a \nheartwrenching crime. This bill will ensure that there is no disparity \nin U.S. extradition law and practice with regard to this crime, and, I \nhope, will help lead to the extradition of individuals wanted for this \ncrime. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1523) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, as amended; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1266), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11168-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The next cloture \nvote will be tomorrow at 9:45 a.m.\n  We made a serious effort today by all concerned on both sides of the \naisle and both sides of the issue with relation to the campaign finance \nreform matter to find a way to move forward, and I believe that Senator \nDaschle and I had basically reached an agreement, but then other \nSenators indicated that they wanted something more and we couldn't \ncomplete that agreement.\n  I think that is really unfortunate. I thought what we had come up \nwith was very fair, that we would take up campaign finance reform by \nthe first week of March and that amendments would be in order. But we \nwill continue to work on it, hopefully, because I do think this is very \nimportant legislation. I will have to make a decision as majority \nleader after tomorrow's cloture vote as to what to do at that point. If \nwe get cloture, obviously, we will go right on with the amendments with \nregard to ISTEA, the highway transportation bill, and I believe we can \nget it completed next week even though we have a lot of very important \namendments pending.\n  If we don't get cloture, I have to make a call as to whether to spend \nanother half of a week trying to cut off basically the filibuster that \nhas gone on with regard to this legislation and move on to other \nmatters. I think that would be unfortunate. I think this is important \nlegislation that needs to be passed.\n\n  On Monday, if we have not been able to clear from hold the Federal \nReserve nominees, it would be my intention to move to debate those and \nget a vote on them. And we also are going to have to act early next \nweek, in some form, with regard to the threatened Amtrak strike.\n  Beyond that, we will consult with Members on both sides of the aisle \nand let them know what will be the legislative schedule next week.\n  If we cannot get something worked out on ISTEA, we will move on to \nother issues. And, of course, I would like to continue to work on the \nExecutive Calendar, but that takes cooperation on both sides of the \naisle. And if we cannot get cooperation on committee meetings and on \nhow we resolve campaign finance reform, I guess we will not get \ncooperation on nominations either. But we will keep moving forward and \nsee if we can come to some reasonable agreement so we can get this very \nimportant legislation completed.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is still conducting morning \nbusiness until 6:30 this evening.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished majority \nleader would mind if the Senate returned to the consideration of the \nhighway bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would have no objection to that. I would \nlike to make sure that the manager of the bill has no objection at this \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia is going to make some comments and no motions or \nanything are involved. It is strictly some remarks in connection with \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct. I would like to make them while the \nhighway bill is pending before the Senate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So I have no objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11169-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11169-S11170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of the highway bill. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1173) to authorize funds for construction of \n     highways, for highway safety programs, and for mass transit \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Chafee/Warner amendment No. 1312, to provide for a \n     continuing designation of a metropolitan planning \n     organization.\n       Chafee/Warner amendment No. 1313 (to language proposed to \n     be stricken by the committee amendment, as modified), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Chafee/Warner amendment No. 1314 (to Amendment No. 1313), \n     of a perfecting nature.\n       Motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works, with instructions.\n       Lott amendment No. 1317 (to instructions of the motion to \n     recommit), to authorize funds for construction of highways, \n     for highway safety programs, and for mass transit programs.\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\n       Lott amendment No. 1318 (to Amendment No. 1317), to strike \n     the limitation on obligations for administrative expenses.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with reference to the highway bill, on \nyesterday I, on behalf of Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner, \nintroduced an amendment for printing only and also for the purpose of \nhaving that amendment appear in the Congressional Record. And I was not \noffering the amendment in the usual sense that I was calling it up, and \nso consent was granted.\n  At that time I indicated that there were several Senators who wished \nto be added as cosponsors of that proposed amendment. And I wish to add \nthese names today to those that I stated yesterday: Senators Brownback, \nCampbell, Conrad, Craig, Glenn, Helms, Levin, and Kempthorne. And I \nwish to remove the name of Mr. Coats. That name was included in error \nyesterday. And so I ask unanimous consent that the Record show that the \nname of Mr. Coats was removed and also to indicate the additional \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yesterday I indicated that I would present for the Record \nthe history of the Federal gasoline excise taxes since the inception of \nthe highway trust fund. I ask unanimous consent that I may have printed \nfor the Record such history.\n  There being no objection, the history was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  History of Federal Gasoline Excise Taxes Since the Inception of The \n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n       The enactment of the Federal Aid Highway and Highway \n     Revenue Act of 1956 (PL 84-627), called for all Federal \n     gasoline excise taxes to be placed in the newly established \n     Highway Trust Fund. Between 1956 and 1990, the Congress, on \n     numerous occasions, voted to extend these gasoline excise \n     taxes with all of the revenue being devoted to the Highway \n     Trust Fund.\n       The Omnibus Budget Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 (PL \n     101-508) increased the Federal gasoline tax by 5 cents, with \n     2.5 cents being dedicated to deficit reduction and 2.5 cents \n     being dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund. Of the amounts \n     transferred to the Highway Trust Fund, 2 cents of the tax was \n     deposited in the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund \n     and 0.5 cents of the tax was deposited in the Mass Transit \n     Account.\n       The 2.5 cents dedicated to deficit reduction under OBRA \n     1990 was scheduled to expire on September 30, 1995. Instead, \n     the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, (PL 103-66) \n     stipulated that this 2.5 cents gasoline tax be deposited into \n     the Highway Trust Fund, beginning on October 1, 1995, and \n     divided in the same manner as the 2.5 cents placed in the \n     Trust Fund in 1990.\n       OBRA 1993 simultaneously levied a new, permanent gas tax of \n     4.3 cents dedicated solely to deficit reduction.\n       The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (PL 105-34) stipulated that \n     the entire 4.3 cents gas tax would be deposited in the \n     Highway Trust Fund beginning on October 1, 1997, with 3.45 \n     cents of the tax being dedicated to the Highway Account of \n     the Highway Trust Fund and 0.85 cents being dedicated to the \n     Mass Transit Account.\n       Source: CRS Report for Congress: Federal Excise Taxes on \n     Gasoline and the Highway Trust Fund, September 15, 1997.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was my intention to move at this time to \nwaive all points of order pursuant to the budget act affecting the \namendment that I had introduced on yesterday for printing on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner.\n  Mr. President, having the floor, I have a perfect right to move at \nthis time to waive such points of order; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not required to wait until such time as that amendment \nis pending before the Senate, nor am I required under the rules to wait \nuntil such time as the so-called tree, consisting of several \namendments, has been dismantled, nor do I have to wait until such time \nas such a point of order is actually made against the amendment; am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  So I am perfectly within my rights at this point to move to waive \nsuch points of order. Such a motion would be debatable. And it would \nalso be amendable, would it not, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, I had intended to ask unanimous consent \nthat that motion not be amendable. But I thought I should let Mr. \nChafee know that I intended to make such a request. He might want to \nobject to it. I had a right to make the motion. He could not keep me \nfrom doing that. But I wanted to get consent that it not be amendable, \nand I thought he had the right to know about that. And I realize he \ncould object to that, and he will. He has told me he will object to \nthat.\n  Now, my purpose in wanting to get such consent is simply this: 60 \nvotes are required for me to waive the points of order under the Budget \nAct. However, my motion would be amendable, it would be open to \namendment, and such an amendment to my motion would require only a \nmajority of votes, so that if all 100 Senators were present and voting, \nonly 51 votes would be required to amend my motion, which, standing \nalone, would require 60 votes.\n  If the motion to amend my motion to waive were to carry, then a \nsimple majority could add the authors' motion to amend my motion. That \nwould put me at a disadvantage in that it is my understanding that Mr. \nDomenici might make a motion, the purpose of which would be--and I \ndon't know that he is going to do this --he would repeal the gas tax, \nthe 4.3-cent tax. That may or may not be based on rumor. I haven't \nheard Senator Domenici say that, but I anticipate that such a motion or \nsome other motion might be made. If that were the case, if that were to \nbe adopted by a majority vote, I would be put at a great disadvantage \nin trying to get 60 votes for my motion, so I do not intend to make \nthat motion at this time.\n  But it may be that at some future time we can work out something \nwhereby I could get a vote on a motion to waive points of order under \nthe Budget Act against my amendment. That is a motion that is made \nquite frequently here. Sometimes it carries, sometimes it doesn't. So I \nintended to make that motion because I feel that the sponsors of our \namendment have 60 or more votes in support of such motion and in \nsupport of such amendment.\n  Several Senators have indicated to me and have indicated to my three \ncosponsors that while they will not cosponsor the amendment, they will \nsupport it, so that we feel we would have more than 60 votes. But I am \nnot at this time going to make the motion for the reasons I have \nstated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11169-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11170-S11171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SENATOR CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. On another matter, I'm informed that on yesterday the \ndistinguished, the very distinguished, Senator from Rhode Island \nreached his 75th birthday. Oh, to be 75 again! I experienced that happy \noccasion 5 years ago. Today is the 23rd of October. In 27 more days I \nwill reach my 80th birthday. Hopefully the Senate will be out of \nsession because I don't want anything said about it.\n  But I must congratulate this crusty New Englander, whom I admire \nhugely, on his having reached his 75th birthday. He is a great \nAmerican. He is truly a fine Senator. As a man he is a real man. He is \nhonest, and he is one who deals fairly with his colleagues right up on \nthe board, straight across the board, nothing under the board, and he \nsays what he thinks. If he agrees with one, he will agree; if he \ndoesn't, he will say so, but he won't go out of this Chamber in any fit \nof distemper. It is a matter to be stated, and that is it.\n  So I admire John Chafee. The people of his State are fortunate in \nhaving a man like John Chafee here. I think we are all fortunate in \nhaving a Senator like John Chafee. I greatly admire him.\n  Let me just recall a few lines to a little poem titled the \n``Multiplication Table of Happiness.'' I hope I can repeat it, having \nfocused my thoughts on the line-item veto, the highway bill, and on the \nvarious other matters today.\n\n     Count your garden by the flowers,\n     Never by the leaves that fall;\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     Not remembering clouds at all.\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows;\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears;\n     And on this beautiful October afternoon,\n     Count your age by friends, not years.\n\n  Now, after the distinguished Senator makes a response, if he feels \nthat he has to--he doesn't--but if he wants to say anything--I saw him \nstart to rise--\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\nthen I have a question back on the highway bill I wish to ask him.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to say that when one receives \ncomplimentary remarks, the merit and the weight of those remarks depend \na great deal who they come from. When I receive such generous comments \nas I have just received from the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, whom he knows I long have had not only great admiration for \nbut great affection for, and we have been in harness here together on \nmany issues on the same side--on some issues we have been on the other \nside.\n  To the Senator from West Virginia, I just want to say thank you very \nmuch for those very, very kind remarks. As he knows, one of the great \npleasures I have had in this Chamber in serving in the U.S. Senate is \nthe relationship I have had with Robert Byrd. I count myself very, very \nlucky. So I will treasure the kind comments he made.\n  I further will say I think I'll believe them all, and if my children \nhave any doubts about their father, I will tell them, ``Here is what \nRobert Byrd said about him.'' I will make sure they all get copies of \nit.\n  I want to thank him very, very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. I can guarantee the Senator, I will never be in his State \nadvocating that his people not vote for him, and if I'm up in his \nState, I will be glad to say what I have just said today about him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11170-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, back on the highway bill, I understood \nthe distinguished Senator from Rhode Island to indicate yesterday that \nMr. Domenici's amendment, which he, Mr. Chafee, was going to cosponsor, \nwas going to be entered at the desk. I have inquired there now, and I \ndon't believe it has been entered up to this point.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It was filed this morning before 10 a.m. was my clear \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There have been a number of amendments \nsubmitted, any one of which might meet that description.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I'm informed it is amendment No. 1522.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment, the Chair understands, is \nbeing processed and was just recently submitted.\n  Mr. BYRD. So it is now being processed and will be available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is at the desk.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to have the opportunity to study it and perhaps be \nable to comment on it if need be.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think we will certainly get the Senator a copy of it, \nand we can do that this evening.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. I don't have anything \nelse to say at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, I just want to say one other thing to \nthe Senator from West Virginia. He said some kind things about me being \nup front and so forth. I want to thank him very much for being so \ncandid with us. There are no tricks, there are no games here. We are \neach proceeding and doing everything we can, as was mentioned, to keep \neverything aboveboard so there are no unfair surprises. I thank the \nSenator very much for that.

The majority \nleader indicated that he and the Senator from South Dakota had an \nunderstanding with regard to how to bring back the campaign finance \nreform issue.\n  But the fact is that the agreement had not been reduced to writing, \nand that when it was reduced to writing, his understanding, that is, \nthe understanding of the Senator from the State of South Dakota, my \nunderstanding, and the understanding of every member of our caucus was \nthat the vehicle by which this would happen would be that we would \nbring back Senate bill 25, as modified.\n  The agreement did not include that language. And there simply was no \nadditional or new request made by anyone on our behalf. So I would like \nto correct that statement as well. That did not happen. We are hopeful \nthat an agreement can be reached. But I do have to say, for the record, \nthat it simply was not a correct representation of what happened with \nregard to the negotiations today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/23/senate-section/article/S11171-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.
