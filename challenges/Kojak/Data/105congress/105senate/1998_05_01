Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act, S. 1186. This legislation incorporates job \ntraining, vocational education, and adult education--three programs. \nLast year we passed welfare reform, which has no hope of success unless \nindividuals have the appropriate education and training to compete in \nthe workforce.\n  We will never successfully reduce the welfare rolls unless we give \npeople the tools to enter the workforce. Vocational education, adult \neducation, and job training are how we give people those tools. This \nbill creates a system where all three of these key areas work together.\n  Separate funding streams and administration are maintained. I repeat \nthat. Separate funding streams and administration are maintained for \neach of these activities, in recognition that each activity serves a \ndistinct function. At the same time, the important interrelationship \namong these activities has too often been ignored. Policy in each area \nhas generally been considered in a vacuum, leading to disappointment \nand frustration to job seekers and employers alike. For this reason, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, and I have written \nlegislation which will assist States in coordinating policies related \nto job training and training-related education.\n  States that are moving forward in their workforce development efforts \nbelieve that all of the education and training players create an agenda \nwhich reflects an education and training partnership instead of having \nthese two critical areas living individually, in solitary confinement.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have been working on job training legislation \nfor over 2 decades. I count the Job Training Partnership Act, which I \ncoauthored along with Representative Hawkins and Senators Kennedy, \nHatch, and Quayle, as a significant legislative accomplishment.\n  Today, 16 years later, it is clear that the Job Training Partnership \nAct is not sufficient to meet the increasing demands made on our \neducation and training system. This Nation has failed to implement \nstrategies which will enable our workforce to meet the demands made by \nan ever changing international economy.\n  Our international competitors have been leaders in making the \nimportant link between education and work. The United States is \nbeginning to make some progress, although it is clearly not yet \nnationwide.\n  I have seen examples of this progress in a few States, including my \nhome State of Vermont. Vergennes Union High School has an excellent \nbiotech program that was established through a partnership between the \nbusiness community and the local school district. They were talking \nabout things we hadn't even heard of a few years ago in their high \nschool class. In addition, Essex Technical Center offers an array of \nprograms that serve all students, ranging from at-risk youths to \nadults.\n  Another State that is an exemplary leader in workforce development is \nMississippi. Two years ago, I visited Mississippi and was overwhelmed \nby their academic, financial, and overall community commitment to \nrevitalize their vocational education-tech prep system. This program is \nso successful that the Mississippi legislature passed an increase in \ntheir sales tax to expand that initiative. This has been very \nbeneficial to the Mississippi economy. Businesses not only stay in \nMississippi, but major companies are relocating to Mississippi, because \nof the skilled workforce that is in place because of these \nimprovements.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act builds upon an excellent \nworkforce development system that is evolving in Vermont, Mississippi, \nand in other States throughout the Nation. S. 1186 will enable States \nto have greater flexibility to promote coordination between vocational \neducation, adult education, and training. The Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act gives States, local communities, and employers both the \nassistance and the incentives to train individuals--to train \nindividuals for real jobs.\n  The two key points of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act are \nthe establishment of tough accountability measures and a rallying of \nthe private and public sectors to implement an education and training \ndelivery system that enables all members of our society to receive the \neducation and training they need at any point in their lifetime--I \nrepeat that, at any point in their lifetime.\n  As I mentioned, accountability is a key feature of S. 1186. Those \nStates that exceed their performance measures--the accountability \nmechanisms in all three titles--will be eligible for additional funding \nfrom the Department of Education and Labor, which can then be used for \ninnovative activities related to the programs authorized under S. 1186.\n  I believe this bill, which unanimously passed the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee and has the support of the business \ncommunity, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nNational Alliance of Businesses, the Chamber of Commerce, and the \nadministration, is one of the most important initiatives the Senate \nwill consider this year.\n  Year after year, report after report indicates that we do not have an \nadequately trained workforce. The following statistics illustrate this \npoint: A Committee for Economic Development study estimates that each \nyear's class of high school dropouts costs over $200 billion in lost \nincomes and taxes over the lifetimes of those students. I would like to \nnote that my friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, has done an outstanding \njob in this legislation in taking the lead on the youth provisions \nwhich will hopefully improve this very, very terrible statistic.\n  American employers spend over $200 billion a year in remedial \neducation and training for their employees--over $200 billion a year in \nremedial education and training for their employees. I point out that \nEurope spends about the same amount, but they spend it with their \nschools so that they don't have to wait an extra 2 years to be entering \ninto the workforce.\n  This Nation presently has 190,000 positions unfilled in the \ntechnology area because of a lack of skilled workers. Those skills \ncould be taught, almost all of them, in the high schools, but kids have \nto wait until they get out of high school under the present system, \nalthough some schools, as I mentioned earlier, like Vergennes, are \nmoving in that area to provide those skills which are reachable with \nthe talents of our young people in high school rather than waiting to \ngo to further skill training.\n  The business community, Federal, State, and local governments must \nsupport education and training systems which allow all members of \nsociety to enter the training system and receive the education and \ntraining they need at any point in their lifetime, whether it be the \nhigh school student pursuing a biotech career, the adult who is \ndesperate to trade a welfare check for a paycheck, the dislocated \nworker who needs to learn new skills to enhance his or her \nmarketability, the vocational rehabilitation client who needs training \nassistance, or the incumbent worker who requires additional education \nand training to keep pace with the ever-evolving global economy. S. \n1186 lays a foundation for achieving that goal.\n  Before I turn to my colleagues, I would like to express my deep \nappreciation to Senators Kennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone and their \nstaffs and also a special thank you to the Congressional Research \nService and the\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nSenate legislative counsel staff for all of their hard work in this \nbipartisan initiative. I thank each of them for their time and effort \nin getting S. 1186 to this point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Connie \nGarner, who is a legislative fellow, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor for the duration of the workforce bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the outset I want to express \nappreciation on this side, not just for our committee but for all of \nour Democratic Members, to the chairman of our committee, and also to \nSenator DeWine, who is the chairman of the subcommittee. I know I speak \nfor Senator Wellstone, who was very much involved in the development of \nthis legislation, in thanking them for their leadership and for their \nwork with all of us in bringing this legislation to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. It is going to make a \nsignificant difference in the quality of life for millions of \nAmericans. It has been a long, arduous task to bring us to where we are \ntoday. Senator Kassebaum had been very interested in initially seeing \nhow we could consolidate and coordinate 126 different programs in six \ndifferent agencies and try and make some sense with a newer kind of \nworkforce.\n\n  So many of these various workforce programs have been targeted to \nparticular needs--people who lost work as a result of imports; people \nwho lost work because of environmental considerations; young people who \ndropped out of school; older workers who have been dislocated. There \nwas a wide range of programs, and there was a solid effort to try to \ndevelop and fashion various efforts to make some sense out of these \nprograms and ensure that we were going to invest in our fellow \ncitizens, young and old, and to do it in an effective way.\n  It hasn't been easy. We have tried to address this, and I can \nremember the times when we were not effective in doing so. I remember \nthe CETA program and all of its difficulties and challenges in later \nyears, under the leadership of Senator Quayle at that time and the \nmembers of our committee. I welcomed the opportunity of joining with \nSenator Quayle as we developed the Job Training Partnership Act to give \ngreater local control and local input in terms of a shifting economy. \nThis has been an evolving process.\n  We have done a constructive review of all of the various job training \nprograms to find out, with the new challenges we are facing, how can we \ndo better in meeting these various needs: what the role of vocational \ntraining is; what the role of adult education programs is going to be; \nhow we are tying this into evolving changes in our workforce as a \nresult of technology, as a result of a change in our competitiveness, \nand as a result of the downsizing we have seen that has impacted a lot \nof people who have good skills, but in a particular area, that perhaps \nmay not be as necessary today as they were in another period of time.\n  It is only as a result of the hard work of the chairman of our full \ncommittee and the chairman of the subcommittee that we have been able \nto work through the process and make a recommendation that reflects the \nbest judgment of all the members of the committee and the solid \njudgment of many men and women, and local, State, and national \norganizations who have given a great deal of time and attention to this \nissue, and who know the strengths and weaknesses of what is happening \nout in the local communities and at the State level, that we can \npresent this legislation to the Senate. It is one of the most important \npieces of legislation that we will pass.\n  There are various pieces of legislation that are above the radar \nscreen, and there are some that are just below the radar screen. Many \nof those which come just below the radar screen in so many respects \nhave a dramatic impact, a much more important impact on our fellow \ncitizens than some of those that might be highly visible, highly \nvolatile pieces of legislation.\n  We welcome the chance to be here this morning to make these \nrecommendations and, hopefully, to consider some of the amendments that \nhave been recommended by our colleagues and then move towards passage \non Tuesday. We are urging all of our colleagues to support this \nlegislation. We hopefully will then move in a timely way into the \nconference with the House, moving it along, recognizing that we do have \na compressed time period but understanding that on this legislation we \nare not going to fail. I wanted to at least make those brief \nobservations before commenting on the legislation.\n  An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the \nmodern economy. Our Nation's long-term economic vitality depends on the \ncreation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job \ntraining and career development which is open to all of our citizens. \nSchools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults \nand out-of-school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills \nwhich will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated \nworkers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological \nchange deserve the chance to pursue new careers. The way in which we \nrespond to these challenges today will determine how prosperous a \nnation we are in the next century.\n  The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been \ngreater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is \nsteadily widening. I think all of us are very much proud of the fact \nthat we have a strong economy. The figures, even in today's papers, \nindicate that is so. Hopefully, as a nation with a common purpose, we \nwant to make sure that all Americans are going to be participating in \nthe strength of our economy and that it isn't going to be just \nsegmented among those who are already in a more favorable economic \nstance.\n  For that to happen, having good work skills is an absolutely \nessential element and ingredient in terms of giving individual \nAmericans the opportunities to participate in a more meaningful way in \nour economic expansion. For those who enter the workforce with good \nacademic training and well-developed career skills, this new economy \noffers almost unlimited potential. However, for others who lack basic \nproficiency in language, math, and science, and no new skills, the new \neconomy presents an increasingly hostile environment.\n  Over 3 million young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24 in \nthis country did not complete high school and are not enrolled in \nschool. Many more graduate from high school without the level of \nknowledge and skill that a high school diploma should represent. They \nwill require more education and job training in order to obtain stable, \nwell-paying employment. Without it, they are in danger of becoming a \nlost workforce generation.\n  Effective job training is also essential to the success of welfare \nreform. More than 40 percent of those in the JTPA program for \ndisadvantaged adults have come from welfare rolls. Under the welfare \nreform legislation, an additional 1.7 million people will be entering \nthe job market. Most of these individuals have little or no work \nbackground and very limited employment skills. In many cases, they are \nalso the sole support of young children. They are making urgent, new \ndemands on a job training system that is already burdened beyond its \ncapacity. There is an approximately $3 billion program that has been \nrecommended by the administration in terms of employment. We have tried \nto work that out to be complementary to what we are doing here so we \nhave a more consolidated effort in terms of trying to meet those \nparticular needs in the welfare-to-work programs.\n  In addition, the combination of rapidly changing technology and the \nshift of manufacturing jobs overseas is creating an alarming number of \ndislocated workers. These individuals have extensive work experience \nbut their skills are no longer in demand. We must give them the \nopportunity for retraining and for the development of new skills to \nenable them to compete in the 21st century workplace.\n  Even today, we are only, I believe, dealing with about 30 percent of \nthose\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nwho would otherwise be eligible for those programs, so we know that the \nneed is out there. We have a better way of addressing that need with \nthis program.\n  The accelerating pace of technological change has made much of the \nexisting job training system obsolete. Broad reforms are needed to meet \nthe demands of the modern workplace.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act, unanimously approved by the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, will provide the employment \ntraining opportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the \nchallenge of the changing workplace by enabling men and women to \nacquire the skills required to enter the workforce and upgrade their \nskills throughout their careers. It will provide them with access to \nthe educational tools that will enable them not only to keep up but to \nget ahead.\n  Thirty or 40 years ago, in my own State of Massachusetts, if your \ngrandfather worked in the Four Rivers Shipyard, his son worked in the \nFour Rivers Shipyard, and his grandson worked in the Four Rivers \nShipyard. All got paid pretty good wages, all had pretty good lives, \nand all were able to provide for their families and be involved in the \ncommunity.\n  Today, everyone who enters the workforce is going to have seven \ndifferent jobs--seven different jobs. We know that the private sector \nprovides some training, but it is small and it is primarily among the \nwhite collar. Only about 7 or 8 percent of the major companies provide \ntraining programs, and that is divided between white and blue collar. \nSo those that are the great workforce, the engine for most of these \ncompanies, with the exception of some very important and significant \ntraining programs from some excellent companies, do not receive the \nkind of training that is going to continually equip them to participate \nin our economy. Broad reforms are needed to meet the demands of a \nmodern workforce.\n\n  Mr. President, this, as I mentioned, represents the best judgment of \nthe bipartisan efforts in our committee. I want to publicly commend \nSenators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship \nwhich has made this effort possible. Senator Wellstone and I appreciate \nit. The resulting legislation will, I believe, truly expand career \noptions, encourage greater program innovation, and facilitate \ncooperative efforts amongst business, labor, education, and state and \nlocal governments.\n  I also want to recognize the important role that the President has \ngiven in bringing about reform in our current job training system. He \nhas consistently emphasized the need for greater individual choice in \nthe selection of career paths and training providers. The philosophy \nbehind his skill grant proposal is reflected in our legislation.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy \naccess to the state-of-the-art employment training programs which are \ngeared to real job opportunities in the community through a single, \ncustomer-friendly system of One Stop Career Centers. Over 700 such \ncenters are already operating successfully across the country. This \nlegislation will ensure that every individual in need of employment \nservices will have access to such a facility. The cornerstones of the \nnew system are individual choice and quality labor market information. \nIn the past, men and women seeking new careers often did not know what \nskills were most in demand, which training programs had the best \nperformance. All too often they were forced to make one of the most \nimportant decisions of their lives based on anecdotes and late-night \nadvertisements.\n  An individual comes into the One Stop Career Centers and takes the \nvarious kinds of tests. If he wants to look at some new career \npossibilities, find out what his or her aptitude is in the areas of his \nskills, find out in what particular areas there are available jobs, and \ntake a look at the various training programs for those particular jobs, \nthat center will have access to that information: what jobs are there, \nwhether the training programs really lead to jobs, and how those \ngraduates of that particular training program are doing after 2 or 3 or \n4 years.\n  The individual will be able to make a judgment themselves about which \ntraining program is best suited for them, and know that they have the \nexcellent opportunity of moving ahead into a training program. That is \na concept that has been developed in a number of different areas.\n  My own State of Massachusetts has a very innovative program that was \ndeveloped initially through Governor Dukakis and has been strongly \nsupported by Governor Weld and our current Lieutenant Governor \nCellucci. Lieutenant Governor Cellucci actually came down and testified \nfor us. The One Stop Career Center approach is an area where we have \nhad strong bipartisan support and important involvement by management, \nas well as labor.\n  No training system can function effectively without accurate and \ntimely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market \ninformation is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. \nThis legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and \ntimely information about what area industries are growing, what skills \nthose jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive \nbusiness community and organized labor participation are encouraged in \ndeveloping a regional plan based on this information. Once a career \nchoice is made, the individuals must select a training provider. At \npresent, many applicants make that choice with little or no reliable \ninformation. Under this bill, each training provider will have to \npublicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, \nand average earnings of graduates.\n  We have found in my own State of Massachusetts, with these \nconsolidations in what we call the REBs, that we have much greater \ninvolvement of community-to-business and worker participation, because \nthese programs have been united, with a common spirit and a common \nfocus. There has been much greater interest, support, and effectiveness \nbecause of greater consolidation, as opposed to so much of the \nscattered programs that have been out there previously.\n\n  Because of the extensive information that will be available to each \napplicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and \ntraining program will be possible. The legislation establishes \nindividual training accounts for financially eligible participants, \nwhich they can use to access career education and skill training \nprograms. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be \nlimited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job \nopportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets \nestablished performance standards, the individual will be free to \nchoose which option best suits his or her needs.\n  An essential element of the new system we have designed is the \naccountability. The chairman has mentioned this. As we noted earlier, \neach training provider will have to monitor and report the job \nplacement retention achieved by its graduates and average earnings. \nOnly the programs that meet an acceptable performance will be eligible \nfor receipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is \napplied to those agencies administering State and local programs. They \nhave been given wide latitude to innovate under the legislation, but \nthey, too, will be held accountable, if their programs fail to meet the \nchallenging performance targets.\n  The rapid pace of technological training in the workplace has \nproduced an alarming number of workers who have become dislocated in \nmid-career. The dislocation has been compounded by an increasing number \nof labor-intensive production employers relocating their businesses \nabroad. This trend has been particularly acute in the manufacturing \nsector. We have a special obligation to these dislocated workers who \nhave long and dedicated work histories and now are unemployed through \nno fault of their own. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes a \ncommitment to them by maintaining a special dislocated worker program \nsupported by a separate funding stream geared to their retraining \nneeds. The current dislocated program serves approximately 540,000 \ndislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who \ncompleted the program, 71 percent were employed when they left the \nprogram, earning, on average, 93 percent of their previous wages. \nAmerica's dislocated workers have earned the right to assistance in \ndeveloping new skills which\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nwill allow them to be full participants in the 21st century economy.\n  There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher and more \nimportant than providing at-risk, often out-of-school youth with \nmeaningful education and employment. I am particularly pleased with the \ncommitment the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these \nyoung men and women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative \nfocusing on teenagers living in poverty in communities offering them \nfew employment opportunities.\n  Each year, the Secretary of Labor will award grants from a $250 \nmillion fund to innovative programs designed to provide opportunities \nto youth living in these areas. The programs will emphasize mentoring, \nstrong links between academic and work-site learning, and job placement \nand retention. It will encourage broad-based community participation \nfrom local service agencies and area employers. These model programs \nwill, we believe, identify the techniques which are most effective. \nThat is what we want to try to do.\n  Another important program for young people who face the highest \nbarriers to employment is Job Corps. Most of the participants grow up \nin extreme poverty with limited opportunities. Job Corps, at its best, \nmoves them from deprivation to opportunity. But, for many of them, it \nis an extremely difficult transition. Job Corps is a program worth \npreserving and worth expanding too. Our legislation decisively rejects \nthe view that Job Corps should be dismantled. Instead, it strengthens \nthe program in several ways. It establishes closer ties between \nindividual Job Corps Centers and the community they serve. It ensures \nthat training programs correspond with the area's labor market needs. \nIt extends follow-up counseling for participants up to 12 months and \nestablished detailed performance standards to hold programs \naccountable.\n\n  The legislation also provides the continuation of some jobs as an \nessential element of the youth grant. For many youth, summer jobs are \nthe first opportunity to work and their first critical step in learning \nthe work ethic. The summer jobs program also provide many youth with \nquality learning experiences and follow up during the school year. \nStudies by the Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General and \nresearch by Westat, Inc., have reported positive findings regarding the \nprogram, concluding that work sites are well-supervised and \ndisciplined, that jobs provide useful work, that the education \ncomponent teaches students new skills that they apply in school, and \nthat students learn the value of work.\n  What we have seen in Massachusetts, particularly in Boston, where we \nhave anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 jobs a year, is that many of the \nyouth go 1, 2, and some even 3 years. The private-sector involvement in \nthese programs works very closely in the supervision and development of \nprograms and then has a very active stream of bringing these young \npeople who are going through high school at this time, and moving them \nright into jobs at some of our major companies in Boston. It has been \nvery, very successful because they have coordinated the public-private \npartnership in a very effective way.\n  I believe that the summer jobs program needs to continue to be \navailable on a significant scale with sufficient funding. This bill \nrecognizes the critical importance of the summer youth program by \nrequiring that it be a part of each local area's youth program and \nallowing local communities to determine the number of summer jobs be \ncreated.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles \nreauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. \nBoth programs will continue to be separately funded and independently \nadministered. We have incorporated them in the Workforce Act because \nthey must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to \nprepare people to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. \nStudents who participate in vocational education must be provided with \nboth strong academic preparation and advanced employment skills \ntraining. Recognizing this core principle, the legislation supports \nbroad-based career preparation education which meets both high academic \nstandards and teaches state-of-the-art technological skills. Adult \nliteracy programs are essential for the 27 percent of the adult \npopulation who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. \nLearning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to \ncareer advancement. This legislation will increase access to \neducational opportunities for those most in need of assistance and \nenhance the quality of services provided. In vocational education and \nadult literacy, we place the same emphasis on program accountability \nwhich we did in job training.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for \nmillions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global \neconomy. In doing so, we are enabling them to realize their personal \ndreams.\n  An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the \nmodern economy. Our nation's long term economic vitality depends on the \ncreation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job \ntraining and career development which is open to all our citizens. \nSchools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults \nand out of school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills \nwhich will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated \nworkers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological \nchange deserve the chance to pursue new careers. The way in which we \nrespond to these challenges today will determine how prosperous a \nnation we are in the next century.\n  The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been \ngreater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is \nsteadily widening. For those who enter the workforce with good academic \ntraining and well-developed career skills, this new economy offers \nalmost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic \nproficiency in language, math and science and who have no career \nskills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment.\n  Over three million young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24 \nin this country did not complete high school and are not enrolled in \nschool. Many more graduate from high school without the level of \nknowledge and skill that a high school diploma should represent. They \nwill require more education and job training in order to obtain stable, \nwell-paying employment. Without it, they are in danger of becoming a \nlost workforce generation.\n  Effective job training is also essential to the success of welfare \nreform. More than 40% of those in the JTPA program for disadvantaged \nadults have come from the welfare rolls. Under the welfare reform \nlegislation, an additional 1.7 million people will be entering the job \nmarket. Most of these individuals have little or no work background and \nvery limited employment skills. In many cases, they are also the sole \nsupport of young children. They are making urgent new demands on a job \ntraining system that is already burdened beyond its capacity.\n  In addition, the combination of rapidly changing technology and the \nshift of manufacturing jobs overseas is creating an alarming number of \ndislocated workers. These individuals have extensive work experience, \nbut their skills are no longer in demand. We must give them the \nopportunity for retraining, and for the development of new skills to \nenable them to compete in the 21st century workplace.\n  The accelerating pace of technological change has made much of the \nexisting job training system obsolete. Broad reforms are clearly needed \nto meet the demands of the modern workplace.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act, unanimously approved by the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, will provide employment training \nopportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge \nof the changing workplace by enabling men and women to acquire the \nskills required to enter the workforce and to upgrade their skills \nthroughout their careers. It will provide them with access to the \neducational tools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get \nahead.\n  The legislation is the product of a true bipartisan collaboration. I \nwant to\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\npublicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of \nbipartisanship which has made this effort possible. Senator Wellstone \nand I appreciate it. The resulting legislation will, I believe, truly \nexpand career options, encourage greater program innovation, and \nfacilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, education and \nstate and local government.\n  I also want to recognize the important role President Clinton has \nplayed in bringing about this dramatic reform of our current job \ntraining system. He has consistently emphasized the need for greater \nindividual choice in the selection of career paths and training \nproviders. The philosophy behind his skill grant proposal is reflected \nin our legislation.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy \naccess to state of the art employment training programs which are \ngeared to real job opportunities in the community through a single, \ncustomer-friendly system of One Stop Career Centers. Over 700 such \nCenters are already operating successfully across the country. This \nlegislation will ensure that every individual in need of employment \nservices will have access to such a facility. The cornerstones of this \nnew system are individual choice and quality labor market information. \nIn the past, men and women seeking new careers often did not know what \njob skills were most in demand and which training programs had the best \nperformance record. All too often, they were forced to make one of the \nmost important decisions of their lives based on anecdotes and late-\nnight advertisements.\n  No training system can function effectively without accurate and \ntimely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market \ninformation is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. \nThis legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and \ntimely information about what area industries are growing, what skills \nthose jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive \nbusiness community and organized labor participation are encouraged in \ndeveloping a regional plan based on this information. Once a career \nchoice is made, the individual must still select a training provider. \nAt present, many applicants make that choice with a little or no \nreliable information. Under this bill, each training provider will have \nto publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, \nand average earnings of graduates.\n\n  Because of the extensive information which will be available to each \napplicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a \ntraining provider will be possible. The legislation establishes \nindividual training accounts for financially eligible participants, \nwhich they can use to access career education and skill training \nprograms. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be \nlimited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job \nopportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets \nestablished performance standards, the individual will be free to \nchoose which option best suits his or her needs.\n  An essential element of the new system we have designed is \naccountability. As I noted earlier, each training provider will have to \nmonitor and report the job placement and retention achieved by its \ngraduates and their average earnings. Only those training programs that \nmeet an acceptable performance standard will remain eligible for \nreceipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is \napplied to those agencies administering state and local programs. They \nare being given wide latitude to innovate under this legislation. But \nthey too will be held accountable if their programs fail to meet \nchallenging performance targets.\n  The rapid pace of technological change in the workplace has produced \nan alarming number of workers who have become dislocated in mid-career. \nThe dislocation has been compounded by the increasing number of labor \nintensive production employers relocating their businesses abroad.

Of those \nwho completed the program during that year, 71 percent were employed \nwhen they left the program, earning on average 93 percent of their \nprevious wages. America's dislocated workers have earned the right to \nassistance in developing new skills which will allow them to be full \nparticipants in the 21st century economy.\n  There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more \nimportant than providing at-risk, often out-of-school, youth with \nmeaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our \nteenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in \nthe 21st century economy. I am particularly pleased with the commitment \nwhich the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men \nand women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on \nteenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few \nconstructive employment opportunities. Each year, the Secretary of \nLabor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs \ndesigned to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The \nprograms will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and \nworksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage \nbroad based community participation from local service agencies and \narea employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the \ntechniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest \nrisk.\n  Another important program for young people who face the highest \nbarriers to employment is Job Corps. Most of the participants grow up \nin extreme poverty. Their educational opportunities are limited. Job \nCorps, at its best, moves them from deprivation to opportunity. But, \nfor many of them, it is an extremely difficult transition. As a result, \ncritics of the program are always able to point to failures. But for \neach story of failure, there are many stories of success. Job Corps is \na program worth preserving and worth expanding too. Our legislation \ndecisively rejects the view that Job Corps should be dismantled. \nInstead, it strengthens the program in several ways. It establishes \ncloser ties between individual Job Corps Centers and the communities \nthey serve. It ensures that training programs correspond with the \narea's labor market needs.

In doing so, we are also enabling them to realize their \npersonal American dreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement of \nadministrative policy and letters of endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 1998.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\ns. 1186--workforce investment partnership act of 1998 (Sen. DeWine (R) \n                            OH and 3 others)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. \n     1186, as modified by the expected managers' amendment, \n     because it would reform workforce development programs by \n     incorporating key principles articulated in the President's \n     G.I. Bill for America's Workers. The Administration urges \n     Congress to enact this legislation by July 1, 1998 in order \n     to make available appropriations for fiscal year 1999 for the \n     President's proposed Youth Opportunity Areas initiative to \n     increase employment among out-of-school youth in high-poverty \n     areas.\n       The Administration does not agree with every provision in \n     S. 1186. In addition, an amendment may be offered that would \n     prohibit the use of funds available under the Act to carry \n     out activities authorized under the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act. The Administration strongly opposes this \n     amendment and will work in conference to address this and any \n     other remaining concerns.\n       The new workforce development system embodied in S. 1186 \n     would empower individuals to obtain the services and skills \n     they need to enhance their employment opportunities. It would \n     accomplish this through skill grants, consumer report cards \n     on training program performance, and universal access to core \n     services, such as job search assistance. The new system also \n     would: (1) streamline access to job training programs through \n     one-stop career centers; (2) enhance accountability for \n     results through State and local performance standards and \n     certification of training providers; and (3) increase \n     flexibility for States and localities to enhance the \n     effectiveness of programs. The Administration is concerned \n     about certain provisions that limit the summer jobs component \n     of the youth grant, and looks forward to addressing this and \n     other concerns in conference.\n       The Administration is pleased that S. 1186 would target \n     vocational education and adult education funds to educational \n     agencies and institutions with the greatest need and to \n     activities that promote program quality. The Administration \n     looks forward to addressing in conference its remaining \n     concerns about the adequacy of funding for: (1) national \n     activities to ensure accountability and promote program \n     quality, and (2) Tribally Controlled Postsecondary vocational \n     institutions.\n       In addition, the Administration understands that an amended \n     version of S. 1579, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of \n     1998, will be incorporated into S. 1186 during Senate \n     consideration. The Administration supports Senate passage of \n     the Rehabilitation Act amendments, which would, among other \n     things, streamline eligibility determinations for SSA \n     beneficiaries and improve State planning and accountability \n     for results. The Administration also strongly supports \n     ensuring that the Federal Government procures and uses \n     information technology that is accessible to individuals with \n     disabilities, as provided in the revision to section 508 \n     proposed by the Administration. Finally, the Administration \n     supports the intent of S. 1579, as reflected in the Committee \n     report, to provide for greater collaboration between each \n     State vocational rehabilitation (VR) program and the \n     workforce investment system without compromising the \n     fundamental structure and funding of the State's VR program.\n\n\n                         Pay-As-You-Go Scoring\n\n       S. 1186, as amended to include the text of S. 1579, would \n     affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject \n     to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990. Because the reauthorization does \n     not change mandatory spending calculations from current law, \n     OMB estimates that the net pay-as-you-go effect would be \n     zero.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 23, 1998.\n     Hon.

We believe \n     that S. 1186 has many positive features that will assist in \n     the continuous improvement and expansion of vocational-\n     technical education opportunities. Your legislation is very \n     important to our nation's students and we are confident that \n     the remaining issues can be resolved.\n       Again, we sincerely appreciate the work that has gone into \n     developing this very critical piece of legislation.

On \n     NASDVTEc's behalf, I write to share our support for the \n     Senate's efforts to enact legislation that authorizes a \n     federal investment in vocational technical education. S. \n     1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998, holds \n     much potential for creating expanded and improved \n     opportunities for our nation's students by providing access \n     to quality vocational technical education. We urge you to \n     support S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of \n     1998.\n       NASDVTEc is very supportive of many of S. 1186's features \n     including: a commitment to a strong state role; adequate \n     state-level resources to effect change; assurances that funds \n     appropriated for vocational technical education can be used \n     only for vocational technical education activities; and a \n     strong focus on technology, accountability and achieving high \n     levels of academic and vocational proficiency.\n       As we understand it, the manager's amendment will provide \n     the opportunity for greater coordination among programs while \n     assuring that vocational technical education continues to be \n     planned for and administered by education officials, even \n     under a unified plan. While it is our preference that \n     separate legislation be enacted for vocational technical \n     education, we appreciate the additional flexibility provided \n     and the assurance that S. 1186 will build on and strengthen \n     vocational technical education programs and activities that \n     have proven successful.\n       We wish to commend Chairman Jeffords, Senators DeWine, \n     Kennedy and Wellstone for their bipartisan efforts to bring \n     forward this very important piece of legislation. Thank you \n     for your support of vocational technical education and for \n     your consideration of our views. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact me at 202/737-0303 if NASDVTEc can be of assistance \n     during your consideration of S. 1186.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kimberly A.

We also urge that you vote against any amendments \n     which would erode the provisions of the legislation which \n     reauthorize federal support for vocational and adult \n     education or undermine the provisions for educational \n     integrity and governance of these programs.\n       Federal support for linking academic and occupational study \n     through vocational education is important for secondary \n     school reform. It will help eliminate the ``general track'' \n     in high schools, and will ease the secondary-postsecondary \n     transition for students through tech-prep. Federal support \n     for adult education is important to enable a diverse range of \n     adults to gain basic academic skills. These adults include \n     parents and caregivers who desire to enhance their reading \n     competencies, individuals who seek proficiency in English for \n     productive employment, and individuals who strive to leave \n     welfare for work. S. 1186 provides for these vital purposes.\n       The provisions of Titles I and II reauthorizing vocational \n     and adult education as separate programs enable state and \n     local education officials responsible for these programs to \n     continue to direct the federal assistance to statewide \n     educational reform and improvement. The critical connections \n     between these federal funding streams and other federal, \n     state and local education funding are provided in this bill.\n       The Workforce Investment Partnership Act contains \n     provisions for states to voluntarily submit unified plans for \n     two or more of the programs authorized. These provisions \n     would facilitate coordination of vocational and adult \n     education with job-training related programs, without \n     mandating cumbersome processes or duplicative and expensive \n     new bureaucracy at the state level. The Title V provisions \n     for joint planning retain the authorities of education \n     officials for the vocational and adult education programs and \n     thus avoid superseding state responsibility for education.\n       We urge you to support the Chairman's substitute for S. \n     1186 when the bill comes before the full Senate for passage. \n     If there is any additional information we can provide, please \n     call me or our Director of Federal-State Relations, Carnie \n     Hayes, at (202) 336-7009. Thank you for your support of S. \n     1186.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gordon M. Ambach,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Vocational Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the American Vocational \n     Association (AVA) and the 38,000 vocational-technical \n     educators that we represent nationwide, I urge you to vote in \n     favor of S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, \n     which may be considered in the full Senate this week.\n       The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has worked \n     hard to address the concerns raised by vocational-technical \n     educators about this legislation last fall. We believe the \n     managers' amendment that will be offered effectively \n     addresses the core issues we raised. As we understand it, the \n     managers' amendment includes: Assurances that funding \n     appropriated for vocational-technical education programs will \n     be directed to school-based programs and cannot be diverted \n     to other areas. Assurances that education governance \n     authorities at the state and local levels will continue to \n     have jurisdiction over vocational-technical education \n     programs. A strong focus on professional development for \n     vocational-technical education teachers, administrators, and \n     counselors. Increased emphasis on technology. Assurances that \n     unified planning will adhere to the requirements of the \n     vocational-technical education provisions. Effective support \n     for state administration and leadership.\n       In addition to encouraging the Senate to pass this \n     important legislation, we urge the Senate to accept the House \n     structure of a separate bill for vocational-technical \n     education, apart from job training, when S. 1186 goes to \n     conference with the House version. Further, we will provide \n     detailed comments on our conference priorities, including \n     additional changes that we would like to see to some of the \n     Senate language, as the bill moves towards conference.\n       We also wish to commend Chairmen Jeffords and DeWine, \n     Senator Wellstone and you for your leadership and \n     bipartisanship in developing and moving this legislation. If \n     you have any questions about our views on S. 1186 or on any \n     other matter, please do not hesitate to contact Nancy \n     O'Brien, AVA's assistant executive director for government \n     relations, or me at (703) 683-3111.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bret Lovejoy,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                           Community Colleges,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The American Association of Community \n     Colleges (AACC) strongly endorses S. 1186, the Workforce \n     Investment Partnership Act, and urges you to support this \n     legislation when it is considered by the Senate. AACC \n     represents 1,061 regionally accredited, associate degrees \n     granting institutions of higher education.\n       AACC appreciates the refinements made to S. 1186 in \n     response to the concerns of community colleges. We strongly \n     support the following aspects of the legislation: State \n     education authorities will retain primary responsibility for \n     administering vocational and adult education programs. Since \n     educators have the ultimate responsibility for delivering \n     workforce education, they should have primary responsibility \n     over the formulation and execution of the state's vocational \n     and adult education plans.\n       Changes made to Title V of the bill ensure that federal \n     funds appropriated under the bill specifically for vocational \n     education, adult education, and training will be used for \n     those purposes. This structure helps to maintain the \n     integrity of the federal role in these program.\n       Perkins Basic State Grant funds will not be extended to \n     proprietary institutions. At a time when Basic State Grant \n     funding is essentially flat, community colleges could not \n     support extending federal vocational education funds to a \n     whole set of additional institutions.\n       Community colleges are guaranteed a role on the state level \n     collaborative body that will develop the state adult training \n     system. This is appropriate given the key role community \n     colleges play as adult job training providers.\n       The Tech-Prep program is authorized as a discrete program \n     with its own funding stream, separate from that of the \n     Perkins Basic State Grant. This guarantees that Tech-Prep \n     will not have to directly compete with other vocational \n     education programs for financial support.\n       Community colleges remain concerned about the new outcomes \n     reporting measures the bill places on adult job training \n     providers. S. 1186 specifically requires colleges to provide \n     information regarding students' retention in jobs and \n     increases in wages when they are placed in a job, and for six \n     and twelve months after placement. This could be a \n     substantial burden for many community colleges. Community \n     colleges support the establishment of additional \n     accountability measures and look forward to working in \n     conference to help craft reporting requirements that \n     genuinely measure program success without creating an \n     administrative burden for providers.\n       We believe S. 1186 provides the framwork for states to \n     develop high-quality workforce education and training \n     systems. We greatly appreciate the consideration given to the \n     concerns of community colleges throughout the development of \n     the bill, and look forward to working throughout the \n     conference process to ensure that community colleges can \n     continue to provide high quality workforce education and \n     training programs.\n       Again, I urge you to support S. 1186, the Workforce \n     Investment Partnership Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David R. Pierce,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wanted also to discuss the Rehabilitation Act \namendments of 1998. I welcome the opportunity to commend again Senator \nDeWine and Senator Jeffords for their leadership in making this \nreauthorization a priority and including this legislation as a part of \nthe larger workforce development systems in the states.\n  I also commend Senator Wellstone, Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd, and \nthe Clinton Administration for their leadership in developing a \nbipartisan bill. I especially want to commend all of the staff members \nfor their skillful work to make this process successful.\n  For over 20 years, since the Vocational Rehabilitation Act was first \nenacted in 1973, state vocational rehabilitation systems have brought \nnew hope to individuals with disabilities throughout the country, so \nthey can reach their full potential and actively participate in their \ncommunities. Through the vocational rehabilitation, individuals with \ndisabilities have access to training, counseling, support and job \nopportunities they need in order to become independent and productive, \nand live fulfilling lives.\n  The Rehabilitation Act Amendments give us an excellent opportunity to \ndo more to keep the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act--by \nensuing that all working-age individuals with disabilities, even those \nwith the most significant disabilities, have realistic opportunities to \nobtain the support they need to reach their employment goals.\n  With this legislation, we are building on the past gains by \nstrengthening employment possibilities for all individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  The new provisions of this bill streamline the role of government by\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nsimplifying access to vocational rehabilitation services. It widens \nemployment opportunities by establishing linkages with the larger \nstatewide workforce systems. It also makes services available to \nindividuals with disabilities who do not require extensive \nrehabilitation in order to become employed. Those who achieve work \noutcomes through this assistance will receive at least the minimum \nwage. This measure also recognizes that individuals receiving \ndisability benefits through Social Security are significantly disabled \nand should be presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation \nservices.\n  Throughout this process, we have heard from consumers, advocates, and \nprogram administrators. The bill strengthens the role of individuals in \ndeveloping their own employment plans. It makes it easier for agencies \nto work together, so that individuals with disabilities can obtain the \nsupport and services they need.\n  I commend all the consumers, the advocates, the families, and the \nadministrators who have done so much to help us shape the legislation. \nTheir commitment to constructive compromise will improve the lives of \nall people with disabilities.\n  Our larger goal is to see the talents and strengths of individuals \nwith disabilities are recognized, enhanced, and fairly rewarded in \ncommunities and workplaces across the Nation. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in Congress to achieve this great goal. I think this \nis another very important piece of legislation. I commend our leaders \nfor the way this has been fashioned and shaped.\n  Through vocational rehabilitation, individuals with disabilities have \naccess to the training, counseling, support and job opportunities they \nneed in order to become independent and productive, and live fulfilling \nlives. For millions of these Americans, vocational rehabilitation can \nmean the difference between dependence and independence, between lost \npotential and productive careers.\n  The Rehabilitation Act Amendments give us an excellent opportunity to \ndo more to keep the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act--- \nby ensuring that all working-age individuals with disabilities, even \nthose with the most significant disabilities, have realistic \nopportunities to obtain the support they need to reach their employment \ngoals.\n  With this legislation, we are building on past gains by strengthening \nthe employment possibilities for all individuals with disabilities.\n  The new provisions of this bill streamline the role of government by \nsimplifying access to vocational rehabilitation services. It widens \nemployment opportunities by establishing linkages with the larger \nstatewide workforce systems. It also makes services available to \nindividuals with disabilities who do not require extensive \nrehabilitation in order to become employed. Those who achieve work \noutcomes through this assistance will receive at least the minimum \nwage.\n  This measure also recognizes that individuals receiving disability \nbenefits through Social Security are significantly disabled and should \nbe presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services.\n  Throughout this process, we have heard from consumers, advocates and \nprogram administrators. The bill strengthens the role of individuals in \ndeveloping their own employment plans. It makes it easier for agencies \nto work together, so that individuals with disabilities can obtain the \nsupport and services they need.\n  I commend all the consumers, advocates, families, and administrators \nwho have done so much to help us shape this legislation. Their \ncommitment to constructive compromise will improve the lives of all \npeople with disabilities.\n  Our larger goal is to see that the talents and strengths of \nindividuals with disabilities are recognized, enhanced, and fairly \nrewarded in communities and workplaces across the nation. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in Congress to achieve this great \ngoal.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First, let me commend my ranking member, Senator \nKennedy, whom I have worked with for many, many years, for giving the \ndetail and the emphasis on the importance of this legislation, \nespecially with respect to combining with the other training programs, \nvocational rehabilitation, which is an important step that this bill \ncreates to make sure that we bring the disability community more \nclosely aligned into the workplace and to give them the rights to \nfurther their employment opportunities that they well deserve.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2329\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2329.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute and it is the work of the committee. So we have already \nreally defined in our statement, Senator Kennedy and myself, the \ncontents of that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize that this was a committee piece of work, \nand what happened is amazing in a sense, if you understand my \ncommittee, which has probably the largest divergence and philosophical \npersuasion. We were able to sit down and work together and come up with \na piece of legislation which passed the committee unanimously, and as I \nthink things will develop, will show that we probably will get a \nsimilar consideration on the floor.\n  I yield to Senator DeWine, after first commending him and also his \ncohort, Senator Wellstone, for the incredible amount of work they put \nin. Senator Kennedy and I are the leaders of the committee, but it is \nthe subcommittee that really did the majority of the work here. I want \nto commend them for the tremendous capacity to work together. As I \nsaid, there is some divergence in the philosophical opinion between the \ntwo men. But it proved to be of great advantage to the whole body here \nby coming out with an excellent piece of work. I now yield the floor to \nSenator DeWine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we begin debate this morning on an \nimportant piece of legislation, which we have all been working on for \nthe last few years--legislation that I believe is vitally important to \nthe economic future of our country. As Senator Jeffords and Senator \nKennedy have so eloquently pointed out, this is a bipartisan bill. It \nis a bipartisan bill that will truly make a difference.\n  Let me thank the full committee chairman, Senator Jeffords, the \nranking minority member of the committee, Senator Kennedy, and Senator \nWellstone, who is the ranking member of our subcommittee. I also thank \nall the members of the Labor Committee who unanimously approved and \nvoted in favor of this legislation--Senators Coats, Gregg, Frist, Enzi, \nHutchinson, Collins, Warner, McConnell, Dodd, Harkin, Mikulski, \nBingaman, Murray, and Reed of Rhode Island--a truly bipartisan bill, in \na committee that, as my chairman has pointed out so very well, has a \ngreat divergence of philosophical backgrounds and beliefs. We all came \ntogether because we new this bill would make a difference. We knew the \nstatus quo was simply not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, \nwhich we are considering this morning, will bring much-needed and \noverdue reform to our job training system. Mr. President, as chairman \nof the employment and training subcommittee, I have come to this Senate \nfloor on numerous occasions to stress the immediate need to reform the \nFederal job training system. This need increases each day that Congress \ndoes not act. The status quo is simply not acceptable.\n  In writing this bill, our subcommittee held a number of important \noversight hearings on this issue over the last 3 years. Let me just \npause for a\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nmoment to say how much I have enjoyed working with the ranking minority \nmember of that committee, Senator Wellstone, as we have held these \nhearings and worked on this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, at 2 hearings in Washington, DC, we heard from \nofficials from Los Angeles, from the State of Oregon, from Hennepin \nCounty, Minnesota. We heard from business groups, such as the Cleveland \nGrowth Association.\n  At a hearing in Cleveland, Ohio, we heard from concerned groups like \nthe Akron Regional Development Board, the Lorain County Workforce \nInstitute, the Lake County Employment and Training Administration, \nCuyahoga County Community College, and Cleveland State University.\n  What we heard, Mr. President, is that today's system is a fragmented \nand duplicative maze of narrowly focused job training and job training-\nrelated programs, administered by numerous Federal agencies that lack \ncoordination, lack a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, \nand lack the confidence of the two key consumers who utilize these \nservices--namely, those seeking the training, and those businesses \nseeking to hire these individuals.\n  Mr. President, probably one of the most historic accomplishments of \nthe 104th Congress was our legislation that transformed the American \nwelfare system. In passing a bill to end welfare as we knew it, we were \nempowering the States, empowering the local communities, and private \nbusinesses to seek a better way--to replace welfare with opportunity.\n\n  Mr. President, what the Senate is considering this morning is a \nbipartisan bill that would provide States and localities with another \ntool--a very important tool--to make work, not welfare, the way of life \nfor millions of our fellow citizens. People on welfare need to know \nthey have a real future, a bright future, a future based on opportunity \nand economic advancement for themselves and their families. They need \nto know that when they leave the welfare rolls, there is a job out \nthere--a job for them.\n  Mr. President, this is one major reason that our bipartisan job \ntraining legislation is so important. This really was the unfinished \nbusiness of the last Congress. This really is the unfinished business \nof welfare reform. This bill--the Workforce Investment Partnership \nAct--that we are considering this morning, which again I point out \npassed unanimously out of the Labor Committee--would help States and \nlocal communities succeed in this crucial task of making welfare reform \ntruly work. It would help make work, not welfare, a reality in the \nlives of America's disadvantaged workers.\n  Mr. President, to achieve this goal, individuals need to be provided \nthe opportunity to receive the education and skills and training \nnecessary to obtain meaningful, long-term employment. However, \ntragically, the current job training programs have been unable to \nprovide quality service on a consistent enough basis.\n  Employers at every level are finding it increasingly difficult to \nlocate and attract qualified employees for high-skilled, high paying, \ngood jobs, as well as finding it difficult to attract qualified \nemployees for level-entry positions.\n  Let me provide my colleagues with a couple of examples. In northern \nVirginia, not far from here, 19,000 high-tech, high-paying jobs remain \nunfilled because individuals lack the basic skills to fill them.\n  My home State of Ohio faces a similar predicament, as I am sure the \nChair's home State of Georgia does as well. A Cleveland Growth \nAssociation survey recently showed that employers are becoming \nincreasingly concerned about the quality and availability of the \nskilled labor which may ultimately impede their future growth plans.\n  Nationwide, the number of unfilled high-tech jobs is estimated to be \nat about 350,000. The increasing labor shortage threatens our Nation's \neconomic growth and our productivity and our ability to compete in the \nworld. This, in turn, also threatens our historic welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that we must act immediately. S. 1186, the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act, must pass the U.S. Senate and \nbecome law so that individuals may have the opportunity to increase \ntheir skills and to obtain meaningful, long-term employment.\n  As a Member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, as the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I have spent \nthe last few years examining our Federal job training programs. What we \nall have found is alarming. During our examination of these programs, \nit has become clear to all of us that these programs are in dire need \nof reform. As a result, Mr. President, the business community is \nfrustrated because the current programs fail to meet their employment \nneeds.\n  States, localities and community activists are frustrated because the \nprograms are many times confusing and duplicative. Individuals seeking \nassistance are frustrated because the system is so confusing they often \ndon't even know where to begin, where to start.\n  We need to reform the current job training programs. We need to \nprovide States with the tools necessary to develop their own \ncomprehensive system that works for workers and works for the States.\n  Our bill, S. 1186, provides States and localities with the tools and \nthe flexibility to implement real reform. It is the only way they will \nbe able to provide comprehensive services to those individuals who are \nseeking training and education assistance.\n  Our bill provides States and localities with the framework to \nestablish a truly comprehensive workforce development system.\n  The bill brings together nearly 70 categorical programs--including \nadult education, vocational education, training, welfare to work, the \nWagner-Peyser Act, the Older Americans Act, the Rehabilitation Act, \nTrade Adjustment Assistance, and other job training programs. All in \nall Mr. President, nearly 70 categorical programs.\n\n  Further, this bill that the Senate is considering this morning offers \na reborn Federal Job Corps program--the oldest program of over 30 \nyears, and the most expensive in the Federal system. We make this \nsystem anew, and we link it to local communities really for the first \ntime in its over 30-year history.\n  Further, our bill provides States with the option to submit a \n``Unified Plan'' or a single State plan for the numerous education and \ntraining programs incorporated into the bill.\n  And it establishes a ``no wrong door'' approach to training and \neducation assistance. Under today's system, people have difficulty \nknowing where to begin to look for training assistance--because there \nare no clear points of entry and no clear paths from one program to \nanother. Our bill makes sure that whatever ``door'' people go through--\nwhatever agency they approach--they will receive comprehensive \ninformation about all the programs available to them. They will learn \nabout the availability, eligibility, and quality of the programs \nthrough a ``one-stop customer service system.''\n  The bill also gives States and localities the flexibility they need \nto design their own workforce development systems.\n  It authorizes and expands a modified ``Work-Flex'' program for all \nStates, flexibility that is currently limited to only six demonstration \nStates.\n  Under ``Work-Flex,'' in our bill, the States have the authority to \napprove requests for waivers of statutory and regulatory provisions \nsubmitted by their local workforce areas.\n  The bill allows States to consolidate the 15 percent ``State \nReserve'' funds from each funding stream--adults, dislocated workers, \nand youth--in order to target their own State's priorities.\n  Our bill provides Governors and local elected officials with the \nability to designate local service areas, increasing the population \nthreshold to 500,000.\n  It increases the States' authority over the development of State \nperformance measures--giving Governors the authority to set additional \ncore measures of performance, and negotiate the expected levels of \nperformance--more accountability.\n  And finally, Mr. President, our bill eliminates numerous Federal \nrequirements and mandatory set-asides. This is a very important measure \ngiving States the flexibility, authority, and funding to design their \nsystems.\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\n                             STATE REFORMS\n\n  The bill recognizes--and keeps--some of the great progress already \nbeing made at the State level.\n  It grandfathers State statutes enacted prior to December 31, 1997, \nrelating to State councils, local boards, designation of service areas, \nand sanctioning of local areas for poor performance.\n  It allows States to continue their existing reform efforts--and \nprovides Governors broad waiver authority from the new requirements \nunder the bill, in order to implement additional State reforms.\n\n\n                       REDUCING FEDERAL RED TAPE\n\n  This bill is about reform. Our bill reduces Federal requirements and \nbureaucracy.\n  In addition to allowing States to consolidate the administration \nfunds from the various funding streams, the bill removes income \neligibility requirements and enables States to provide all the adults \nwho voluntarily seek assistance the comprehensive services that are \navailable through the one-stop customer service system.\n  It establishes an effective and accountable system--ensuring that \ntraining leads to meaningful, long-term employment.\n  It streamlines and simplifies the core accountability measures, \nreducing the number of accountability measures by more than 80%.\n  The goal of these provisions is to increase accountability while \ndecreasing red tape.\n  Furthermore, the bill eliminates government bureaucracy and promotes \npersonal responsibility by providing ``Individual Training Accounts'' \nor vouchers to individuals voluntarily seeking assistance so they can \nchoose their training and education provider.\n\n\n                     WHY BUSINESS SUPPORTS OUR BILL\n\n  Mr. President, all of these reforms are calculated to fundamentally \nstreamline and rationalize our job training system--and make it work \nfor real people. Moreover, the reforms are based on free market \ncompetition. That's why the business community is strongly behind this \nlegislation.\n\n  Our bill provides the business community a strong leadership \nrole, which is one thing that we have learned as we held hearings day \nafter day and month after month. We heard from the business community. \nThey have to be involved in the planning of these programs.\n\n  Under this bill, the membership of the Statewide and local \npartnerships will be composed of a majority of business \nrepresentatives--and the partnerships will be chaired by business \nrepresentatives.\n  Statewide and local partnerships will be responsible for overseeing \nthe workforce investment system, including the establishment of \ncriteria and standards for the job training programs and the \ncertification of local job training providers.\n  And business organizations may be designated as one-stop customer \nservice center operators.\n  Mr. President, the reforms contained in this bill will make it easier \nfor our workers to get the training they need and the jobs they want. \nIt will make it easier for our businesses to fill their jobs, so many \nof which stand empty today for want of skilled workers.\n  Put these reforms together, and you get a recipe for an America that \nworks--and the realization of the hopes for our country that were \nembodied in the 1996 welfare reform bill.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letters of support for S. 1186 be made part of the Record--\nletters from the National Alliance of Business, the City of New York, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers, the Society for Human Resource Management, the National \nConference of State Legislatures, and the Cleveland Growth Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                National Alliance of Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Employment and Training, Committee \n         on Labor and Human Resources, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: The business community supports the \n     Workforce Investment Partnership Act (S. 1186). The bill \n     reflects changes that the business community recommended in \n     principles submitted prior to committee action last fall. The \n     bill transforms the current patchwork of federally-funded \n     worker training programs into a comprehensive system with \n     business-led partnerships at the state and local level to \n     ensure accountability and results based on high standards.\n       We want to ensure strong provisions in a final compromise \n     with the House. We will work to have a final bill that would \n     increase state options for consolidation, strengthen measures \n     of performance and accountability, and guarantee that \n     programs are responsive to skill needs in the local labor \n     market. The urgency we have for this reform bill is dictated \n     by the rapid changes in the marketplace that render many \n     older programs obsolete.\n       Early action is necessary to allow enough time to secure a \n     final compromise with the House. We urge your support for \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert T. Jones,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             The City of New York,\n\n\n                                     Department of Employment,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 12, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I write in support of the ``Workforce \n     Investment Partnership Act'', S. 1186, which is expected to \n     come to the Senate floor for a vote early next week. As the \n     largest and most diverse Service Delivery Area under the Job \n     Training Partnership Act, I believe that this bipartisan \n     legislation addresses most of the New York City's concerns \n     for achieving reform and consolidation of job training and \n     employment programs.\n       This legislation includes important reforms and has broad \n     support from those involved with workforce development. This \n     bill is important to New York City because it: 1) insures a \n     significant role of the chief local elected official; 2) \n     formally establishes One Stop Career Centers as part of the \n     workforce development system; 3) supports $250 million \n     annually for at risk youth; and 4) demonstrates a renewed \n     commitment to workforce development.\n       Thank you again for considering the City's views in the \n     development of this legislation. We look forward to swift \n     passage of this bill in the Senate and resolution of the \n     Senate and House Bills to conference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Antonio Pagan,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, we strongly \n     urge your support for S. 1186, the Workforce Investment \n     Partnership Act when it comes before a vote on the Senate \n     floor.\n       The Chamber supports the Workforce Investment Partnership \n     Act because it proposes a streamlined, business-oriented \n     approach to job training which will empower states with the \n     ability to transform the current patchwork of programs into a \n     comprehensive, effective system. S. 1186 will also require \n     the active participation of the business community through \n     statewide partnerships and local workforce investment \n     partnerships. Furthermore, the Chamber supports the autonomy \n     S. 1186 grants the states by allowing them to submit waivers \n     to reengineer federally funded programs or systems to improve \n     their effectiveness. Finally, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is \n     pleased with the bill's designation of state and local \n     chambers of commerce as potential ``One-Stop Customer Service \n     Delivery Systems'' because it will better integrate the needs \n     of both the workforce and the business community.\n       Accordingly, we strongly urge your support for S. 1186, the \n     Workforce Investment Partnership Act. Workforce education is \n     a top priority of the U.S. Chamber and we may consider using \n     this vote in our annual ``How They Voted'' vote ratings.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce commends the Senate on its \n     efforts concerning this issue, and pledges to continue \n     working with both Houses of Congress to enact job training \n     legislation that will better prepare the workforce to meet \n     today's--and tomorrow's--challenges.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: We are writing to express our support \n     for passage of S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership \n     Act of 1998. As President of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures and Chair of NCSL's Education, Labor and Job \n     Training Committee respectively, we believe that this \n     legislation represents a significant improvement over current \n     law which will consolidate job training services into a more \n     rational and coherent state and local system.\n       For the first time in the history of federal involvement in \n     workforce programs, S. 1186\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\n     recognizes the primacy of state legislatures in coordinating \n     federal and state human resource development policy. \n     Specifically, this legislation requires legislative \n     appropriation of federal funds. This will allow state \n     policymakers the opportunity to exercise open and public \n     hearings on the flow of federal dollars to the state. The \n     legislation also grandfathers existing state workforce reform \n     efforts passed by legislatures and already enacted by a \n     majority of the states. In addition, the accountability \n     provisions should serve as an incentive for continuous \n     improvement of workforce development systems.\n       We appreciate the leadership, hard work and commitment you \n     have shown in moving this legislation thus far. We believe \n     that now is the time to pass S. 1186, so that the \n     disadvantaged and the employers who are searching for trained \n     employees are linked in a comprehensive and coherent \n     workforce development system.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Richard Finan,\n       President, Ohio Senate; President, NCSL.\n     Senator Linda Furney,\n       Assistant Minority Leader, Ohio Senate; Chair, Education, \n     Labor and Job Training, NCSL Assembly on Federal Issues.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Council of Chief\n\n\n                                        State School Officers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC March 19, 1998.\n     Re vote ``yes'' for S. 1186 workforce investment partnership.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate:\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the state commissioners \n     and superintendents of education to urge that you vote for \n     the Chairman's substitute amendment to the Workforce \n     Investment Partnership Act (S. 1186) and for its passage by \n     the Senate. We also urge that you vote against any amendments \n     which would erode the provisions of the legislation which \n     reauthorize federal support for vocational and adult \n     education or undermine the provisions for educational \n     integrity and governance of these programs.\n       Federal support for linking academic and occupational study \n     through vocational education is important for secondary \n     school reform. It will help to eliminate the ``general \n     track'' in high schools, and will ease the secondary-\n     postsecondary transition for students through tech-prep. \n     Federal support for adult education is important to enable a \n     diverse range of adults to gain basic academic skills. These \n     adults include parents and caregivers who desire to enhance \n     their reading competencies, individuals who seek proficiency \n     in English for productive employment, and individuals who \n     strive to leave welfare for work. S. 1186 provides for these \n     vital purposes.\n       The provisions of Titles I and II reauthorizing vocational \n     and adult education as separate programs enable state and \n     local education officials responsible for these programs to \n     continue to direct the federal assistance to statewide \n     educational reform and improvement. The critical connections \n     between these federal funding streams and other federal, \n     state and local education funding are provided in this bill.\n       The Workforce Investment Partnership Act contains \n     provisions for states to voluntarily submit unified plans for \n     two or more of the programs authorized. These provisions \n     would facilitate coordination of vocational and adult \n     education with job-training related programs, without \n     mandating cumbersome processes or duplicative and expensive \n     new bureaucracy at the state level. The Title V provisions \n     for joint planning retain the authorities of education \n     officials for the vocational and adult education programs and \n     thus avoid superseding state responsibility for education.\n       We urge you to support the Chairman's substitute for S. \n     1186 when the bill comes before the full Senate for passage. \n     If there is any additional information we can provide, please \n     call me or our Director of Federal-State Relations, Carnie \n     Hayes, at (202) 336-7009. Thank you for your support of S. \n     1186.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gordon M. Ambach.\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Society for Human\n\n\n                                          Resource Management,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 19, 1998.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Society for Human Resource Management \n     (SHRM) is the leading voice of the human resource profession. \n     SHRM, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 1998, provides \n     education and information services, conferences and seminars, \n     government and media representation, online services and \n     publications to more than 93,000 professional and student \n     members from around the world. The Society, the world's \n     largest human resource management association, is a founding \n     member of the North American Human Resource Management \n     Association and a founding member and Secretariat of the \n     World Federation of Personnel Management Associations.\n       On behalf of SHRM, I am writing to ask you to support S. \n     1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, which would \n     consolidate approximately 100 federal job training programs \n     into a single system. As you know, the House passed similar \n     legislation, H.R. 1385, in May of 1997. We are especially \n     pleased that S. 1186 would require the state wide and local \n     partnerships to be comprised of a majority of private sector \n     representatives and that the state programs are instructed to \n     coordinate with ongoing welfare to work efforts.\n       SHRM has had a longstanding commitment to the consolidation \n     of training programs, and has repeatedly urged Congress to \n     consolidate training programs to the maximum extent possible, \n     in order to provide for an efficient, effective system. SHRM \n     has also historically opposed nontargeted and uncoordinated \n     training efforts that could result in a costly redundancy or \n     misallocation of training. SHRM believes it is critical that \n     the U.S. maintain and improve the skills of its workforce. \n     SHRM also believes that effective, well coordinated, \n     discretionary use of employee training dollars can achieve \n     both measurable and substantial results for employers and \n     employees. SHRM applauds the many employers who have already \n     understood the importance of investing in the skills of the \n     workforce and have established a variety of effective and \n     innovative training programs for their employees.\n       SHRM was disappointed that House and Senate passed \n     legislation failed to be reconciled and signed into law \n     during 1996 and is hopeful that legislation will be enacted \n     during 1998 before Congress adjourns. We commend the Senate \n     for bringing S. 1186 to a vote. We urge you to support S. \n     1186 and look forward to working closely with you to speed \n     its enactment. Feel free to contact Deanna Gelak, SPHR, \n     Director of Governmental Affairs at (703) 535-6027 with any \n     questions which you may have during floor consideration of \n     this important measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Susan R. Meisinger,\n     SPHR, Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Growth Association of Cleveland--Years of Creating \n           Growth,\n                                 Cleveland, OH, February 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Greater Cleveland Growth \n     Association, the largest urban chamber of commerce in the \n     country, strongly supports S. 1186--the Workforce Investment \n     Partnership Act. We urge passage of this bill on the Senate \n     floor as soon as possible.\n       As an employer, and as chairman of a business community \n     initiative on workforce development, I know the importance of \n     the public policies changes contained in the bill. We support \n     the legislation because it reflects the policy that the job \n     training system must be employer-driven to effectively match \n     worker skills with jobs that employers have or will have in \n     the future.\n       Like many communities, the Northeast Ohio region is \n     experiencing its lowest unemployment rate in decades. This \n     has resulted in labor shortages at both the entry levels and \n     in specific occupations. While this is a positive indicator \n     of a strong economy, our companies' inability to find \n     qualified workers threatens that progress. It amplifies the \n     need for reforming fragmented and narrowly focused job \n     training programs into a comprehensive system that will \n     anticipate and respond to labor market demands.\n       We believe that S. 1186 contains provisions that will \n     bridge the gaps between employers and workers by effectively \n     delivering job training services at the state and local \n     levels.\n       With the creation of statewide partnerships and Local \n     Workforce Investment Partnerships, the active participation \n     of business in planning and oversight capacities is greatly \n     strengthened.\n       We are encouraged by the consolidation and simplification \n     of federal programs into more flexible block grants that can \n     be tailored by states to meet local labor market needs.\n       The new one-stop, customer-centered service system will \n     improve access for job seekers and employers alike.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important business \n     and community issue. We hope S. 1186 will soon pass in the \n     U.S. Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Curtis E. Moll,\n       Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, MTD Products, Inc.; \n     Chairman, Jobs and Workforce Initiative.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2330\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to extend the \n             authorizations of appropriations for that Act)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2330.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise at this point today to discuss the \npending amendment, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998.\n  This is bipartisan legislation, which I am presenting as an \namendment, has the strong support for the work that has been done by \nour chairman, Senator Jeffords. It has the support of the work that has \nbeen done by the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and also the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Employment and Training \nSubcommittee, Senator Wellstone. The work product also has the support \nof our distinguished colleagues, Senators Harkin, Frist, Collins, Reed, \nChafee, and Bingaman.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is the result of open and extensive \nnegotiations that have earned it widespread and deep support both here \nin Washington, but more importantly at the State and local community \nlevel.\n  The rehabilitation act I have submitted as an amendment is the \ncountry's only Federally funded program that provides job training and \njob placement services to individuals with disabilities. I believe the \nreauthorization of this Act gives us a perfect opportunity to build on \nand develop the positive changes that were made when it was last \nreauthorized, in 1992.\n  The Subcommittee on Employment and Training began the reauthorization \nprocess last year by holding two hearings: the first in Washington, and \nthe second in Columbus, OH. the Subcommittee listened carefully to the \nsuggestions of vocational rehabilitation clients and their counselors, \nto administrators, and to service providers.\n  We found many opportunities to build on the positive changes Congress \nmade in 1992. I would like now to discuss some of the most important \nimprovements we believe we have made to the 1992 Act.\n  First of all, the amendment would link the Rehabilitation Act to the \nunderlying job training reform bill that is before the Senate this \nmorning. One of the problems we heard over and over again in our \nhearings was one we have already tried to address in the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act. The fact is, there is a large disconnect \nbetween the vocational rehabilitation system and the rest of the \ncountry's job training systems. Too many disabled individuals are not \nreceiving the basic job training information they need because they \nfall through the gap between the two job training systems. For example, \na disabled individual may not meet the current legal definition of \n``disabled'' and thus not qualify for services from their State's \nvocational rehabilitation system, yet that same individual could be \nturned away from his or her State's generic job training system because \nthat person is seen as being disabled. They literally fall between the \ntwo systems, not technically qualifying for either one. We need to \nchange that, and this amendment does that.\n  Therefore, the most important change we undertake is to link the \nvocational rehabilitation system to the states' new workforce systems \nunder the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. No one should \nunderestimate the importance of cooperation and mutual awareness \nbetween the two systems, and the strong statutory links that are \nnecessary to ensure such cooperation. However, let me make it very \nclear, as Senators Kennedy and Jeffords have point out: Under no \ncircumstances will the vocational rehabilitation system's integrity be \ncompromised. That is the last thing we intend to do. Its funding will \nnot be redirected to other populations.\n  Our goal is clear. It is to improve vocational rehabilitation, not \ndeplete its resources.\n  Once these programs are joined, state vocational rehabilitation \nagencies will provide more people with either the basic information \nthey need to begin their road to employment, or a referral to the \nstate's new job training system. What makes this referral so much \nbetter than the current system is that employees in the state's new job \ntraining program will now be trained specifically to address the unique \nemployment needs of disabled individuals.\n\n  This simple solution will be achieved by the cooperative agreements \nand contracts required by this bill--between state workforce systems \nand state vocational rehabilitation systems. It will result in \nproviding more disabled individuals with better jobs.\n  These agreements or contracts may include the following: Arrangements \nfor interagency staff training; arrangements for electronic sharing of \nlabor market information and information on job vacancies; arrangements \nto use common intake procedures, forms, and referral procedures; and \nagreements to share client databases.\n  However, let me be clear again. Vocational rehabilitation agencies \nwill not be required to spend any of their federal allotment on \nactivities other than those that help provide jobs for disabled \nindividuals.\n  This legislation also streamlines the vocational rehabilitation \nsystem, and allows state vocational rehabilitation agencies to save \nmillions of dollars. They will now be able to use these dollars for job \ntraining and referral services instead of administration.\n  For example, current law's so-called ``strategic plan,'' which really \nwas duplicative, is eliminated. In Ohio, this means a savings of close \nto $3 million--and other states can expect the same kind of savings.\n  Our bill also simplifies eligibility procedures--a common complaint \nwe heard as we held hearings. For example, a person who qualifies for \nbenefits or assistance under another program, such as Social Security \nDisability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, or the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, under our bill may use that \nqualification instead of having to go through a whole new process to \nreceive vocational rehabilitation services. State agencies no longer \nwill have to redo lengthy administrative procedures to determine a \nperson's eligibility when they know that person clearly qualifies. \nThis, too, will save valuable resources.\n  Based on the information we gathered at our hearings and the \nsuggestions we heard from the people who deal with vocational \nrehabilitation programs on a daily basis, we will reauthorize the \nRehabilitation Act for 7 years. A longer period will allow states the \nopportunity to properly and effectively implement these positive \nchanges and needed improvements.\n\n  The witnesses who testified at our Washington hearing described their \nserious concerns about vocational rehabilitation clients' \n``independence,'' their lack of opportunity for ``self-assertion,'' and \nthey strongly emphasized that clients should have meaningful roles in \ndeveloping their own ``Individualized Rehabilitation Employment \nPlans.''\n  We believe we have in this legislation taken care of these concerns.\n  Empowered clients, who will always have the opportunity of working as \na team with a VR counselor, may now exercise more consumer choice as to \nwhat employment goals they want to reach and how they want to reach \nthem.\n  Finally, one of the most positive changes our bill makes is to \nemphasize the value of self-employment. If a vocational rehabilitation \nclient wants to be self-employed, there is no reason why he or she \nshould not receive the training and assistance they need to reach their \nemployment goal.\n  At our Columbus hearing, I was surprised to learn that under current \nlaw, self employment is hardly, if ever, promoted. It is discouraged \nmany times. Now, clients, together with their vocational rehabilitation \ncounselors, have more flexibility and can develop plans to achieve \nself-employment.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude my comments about this amendment by \nthanking once again the Chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator \nJeffords; the Ranking Member of the Committee, Senator Kennedy; the \nRanking Member of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator \nWellstone, Senator Collins, Senator Chafee, Senator Bingaman, and my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for all the work they and their \nstaffs put into this process. I would also like to thank my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Frist, and his staff for their contribution not \nonly in the 105th Congress, but also for his contributions to \ndeveloping links to our previous workforce bill in the 104th Congress.\n  This bill streamlines the vocational rehabilitation system's \nadministration allowing millions of dollars to go to job\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\ntraining services. This bill improves the lives of individuals with \ndisabilities and provides opportunities for more jobs and better jobs. \nIt creates a more user-friendly, consumer-driven program--and promotes \nthe creation of a seamless job training program that will be able to \nserve more people more efficiently.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this \namendment. At this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator DeWine in offering S. 1579, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments \nof 1998, as reported out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, as \nan amendment to S. 1186 as amended by the Committee substitute.\n  By attaching S. 1579 to the workforce legislation we will facilitate \nits consideration. However, I want to make clear that the \nRehabilitation Act, when these amendments become law, will remain a \nfreestanding statute.\n  S. 1579 will open up more employment opportunities to individuals \nwith disabilities. It will also provide State vocational rehabilitation \nagencies and others who provide employment-related assistance to \nindividuals with disabilities with the tools they need to provide \nappropriate, timely help to individuals with disabilities who want to \nwork. Provisions in this bill and in S. 1186 bring us closer to a \nseamless system for job training and employment assistance.\n  Without compromising the integrity of a State's vocational \nrehabilitation program, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 link \nvocational rehabilitation services to those services that are available \nunder current State workforce systems and those that will be available \nunder the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998.\n  Linkage provisions are found in sections pertaining to the findings \nand purposes of the legislation, definitions, program administration, \nreports, information dissemination, and State plan requirements, \nincluding those concerning data reporting. Complementary and parallel \nprovisions promoting linkage between vocational rehabilitation agencies \nand State workforce systems also are included in the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act of 1998. As the result of these linkage \nprovisions individual with disabilities who want to work will not be \nturned away or denied assistance by a State's workforce system, of \nwhich the vocational rehabilitation program will be an integral \ncomponent. There will be no wrong door to the system, no revolving \ndoor. Instead, there will be appropriate assistance.\n  The amendments simplify access to vocational rehabilitation services. \nThe State plan requirements have been rewritten to simplify \nadministration of the vocational rehabilitation program. The amendments \nreduce the 36 State plan requirements in current law to 24 and require \nthe submission of one State plan, with amendments thereafter under \ncertain circumstances. The bill allows, when a State is operating under \nan order of selection, for the State to offer core services to \nindividuals with disabilities who do not meet a State's criteria for \nfull services from the vocational rehabilitation agency. The \nlegislation gives vocational rehabilitation agencies the ability to \nsecure financial support from other entities who could or should pay \nfor certain services needed by an individual with a disability, who is \nbeing assisted by the vocational rehabilitation agency to prepare for \nor secure a job. The bill requires State vocational rehabilitation \nagencies and State Rehabilitation Councils to jointly--develop and \nconduct a comprehensive needs assessment every three years, and \nannually, to set and report on employment goals for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  They streamline the administration and access to the vocational \nrehabilitation program. The bill simplifies procedures for eligibility \nby allowing consideration of existing evaluation information in \ndetermining an individuals's eligibility for vocational rehabilitation \nservices. The bill strengthens eligible individuals's roles in \ndeveloping their individualized rehabilitation employment plans.\n  The bill also amends other titles in the Rehabilitation Act. Title \nII, which authorizes the National Institute on Disability and \nRehabilitation Research, is amended to require that all funding \npriorities of the Institute be derived from a five-year plan that will \nbe subjected to public comment and then submitted to Congress. The bill \nexpands the authority of the Institute to allow funding of initiatives \nrelated to the quality assurance of assistive technology and the \neffectiveness of alternative medicine when used to treat individuals \nwith disabilities. The legislation streamlines and updates title III of \nthe Act, which authorizes training and demonstration activities, by \nclearly delineating funding priorities, simplifying the notification of \ninterested parties about upcoming grant opportunities, and permitting \nfunding for training of personnel in one-stop centers so that they will \nbe more able to appropriately and effectively assist individuals with \ndisabilities seeking employment-related assistance through such \ncenters.\n  S. 1579 strengthens section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act pertaining \nto the accessibility of electronic and information technology for \nindividuals with disabilities employed or served by Federal agencies. \nS. 1579 amends title VI of the Act by adding a new initiative, Projects \nin Telecommuting and Self-Employment for Individuals with Disabilities, \nand by permitting Projects with Industry to assist eligible individuals \nwithout waiting for referrals or eligibility status determinations from \nvocational rehabilitation agencies and to provide training and/or \nplacement services.\n  Vermonters with disabilities benefited from the 1992 amendments to \nthe Rehabilitation Act. Vermonters with disabilities will benefit from \nthese 1998 amendments. In Vermont, one out of every eight residents is \ndisabled. The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation has enabled many \nVermonters with disabilities to exercise the choices in setting \nemployment goals and selecting service providers to help them achieve \nthose goals. In 1996, Vermont's vocational rehabilitation program \nprovided an array of services to almost 5,000 Vermonters, while \ndirectly assisting 850 individuals with disabilities to become \nsuccessfully employed.\n  In 1996 Vermont consumers of vocational rehabilitation services who \nsecured employment enjoy an average increase in income exceeding $8,000 \nper year. Seventy-three percent of these individuals entered the \nworkforce earning more than minimum wage. Seventy-eight percent of \nthese Vermonters who were assisted by the Vermont Division of \nRehabilitation in 1996 remain employed today. In addition, the Vermont \nConsumer Choice Project has allowed my State to create organizational \nstructures, policies and practices that have resulted in a greater \ndegree of informed choice for individuals seeking and receiving \nvocational rehabilitation services.\n  Throughout S. 1579 there are references to traditionally underserved \npopulations. I want to bring special attention to one such population \nthat I am particularly aware of in my home state of Vermont: farmers \nwith disabilities.\n  In America an estimated 11 million people with disabilities live in \nrural areas. In the agricultural arena, an estimated 500,000 farmers \nand ranchers nationwide have physical disabilities that limit their \nability to perform one or more work-related tasks. Each year, over \n200,000 persons employed in agriculture are injured on the job, with \nmany incurring a permanent disability as a result. Thousands more in \nthe agricultural community experience disability as a result of non-\nfarm injuries, illnesses, and chronic health conditions. These \nindividuals consistently encounter barriers to receiving appropriate \nvocational rehabilitation services.\n  Providing vocational rehabilitation services in rural environments \ncan be challenging, but we clearly need to do more to serve these \nindividuals who contribute so much to American society. State \nvocational rehabilitation agencies have large caseloads. Given these \nlarge case loads, it is often challenging to adequately serve \nindividuals with disabilities in rural areas. Moreover, there are few \nrehabilitation professionals who are knowledgeable about various \noccupations in rural America or about how to successfully adapt or \nmodify those work environments.\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\n  Since 1991, the AgrAbility Program of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has helped thousands of farmers, ranchers, and farm workers \nto accommodate their disabilities in order to work safely and \nefficiently in agricultural production. A program that has existed in \nmy home state of Vermont for nearly 30 years was one of the models on \nwhich the AgrAbility program was based. This program is a jointly \noperated by the Vermont Rehabilitation Service and the Cooperative \nExtension Service. It has helped hundreds of farmers accommodate their \ndisabilities and remain productive. The lessons that we have learned in \nVermont and through the AgrAbility program nationally need to be \ninfused into the vocational rehabilitation system.\n  Currently, nineteen States are served by AgrAbility projects, and at \nleast a dozen additional States are pursuing funding. AgrAbility \nprojects are conducted as partnerships between university-based State \nextension service agencies and nonprofit disability organizations, \nincluding Easter Seal societies, United Cerebral Palsy Associations, \nGoodwill societies and Independent Living Centers. These AgrAbility \nprojects can provide State vocational rehabilitation agencies with a \nwide range of training and technical assistance to improve and expand \nvocational rehabilitation services to people with disabilities seeking \nto maintain their work in agriculture.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge that we would not have been \nable to offer our colleagues this bipartisan, consensus-based \nlegislation without Senator Frist's efforts in 1995 with regard to S. \n143 and the efforts of many hard working staff including, Aaron Grau \nwith Senator DeWine, Elizabeth Aldridge with the Senate Legislative \nCounsel, Connie Gardner with Senator Kennedy, Roger Wolfson with \nSenator Wellstone, Sharon Masling with Senator Harkin, Jim Fenton with \nSenator Dodd, Pat Morrissey, Sherry Kaiman, and Heidi Mohlman of my \nstaff. In addition, I wish to recognize the cooperation and technical \nassistance that we received from Assistant Secretary for Special \nEducation and Rehabilitative Services, Judith Heumann, and Fredric \nSchroeder, Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration \nof the U.S. Department of Education and their staff. I also wish to \nthank the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, Task Force on \nEmployment and Training, for its timely input on legislative proposals \nand its assistance on disseminating discussion drafts. Finally, I wish \nto extend a special thanks to Bob Rabe, Director of the Ohio \nRehabilitation Commission and Chair of the Reauthorization Task Force \nof the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation \n(CSAVR) and Diane Dalmasse, the Director of the Division of Vocational \nRehabilitation in Vermont for helping us to understand how the \namendments will affect the delivery of vocational rehabilitation \nservices.\n  As I said on January 28, 1998 when my colleagues and I introduced \nthis legislation, having a job and liking it are the bottom line. I \nurge my colleagues to join us in supporting S. 1579 as an amendment to \nthe Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998. Passing it will mean \nmore jobs and better jobs for individuals with disabilities.\n  Mr. President, I also want to commend a staff member who has been \nwith the Congress in one body or the other for many years who \ncontributed very greatly to bringing about a consensus on this piece of \nlegislation, Pat Morrissey.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I believe the amendment on both sides is \nacceptable and we could have a vote on it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2330) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I now yield, in accordance with the \norder, to Senator Ashcroft to offer his amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nproviding me with this opportunity. I commend both the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Ohio for their outstanding work, along \nwith other members of the committee. I know they worked hard in this \nparticular endeavor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kevin Ring \nof my staff be permitted to be on the Senate floor today until \nadjournment, for the purposes of these discussions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2331 to Amendment No. 2329\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out activities \n     authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2331 to Amendment No. 2329.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In title V, strike the section heading for section 505 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 505. LIMITATION.\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be used \n     to carry out activities authorized under the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 506. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to make \ncertain that this legislation, the Workforce Investment Partnership \nAct, and the 1994 School-to-Work law are and remain separate programs. \nThe amendment simply states that none of the funds made available under \nthis Act may be used to carry out activities authorized under the \nSchool-to-Work Opportunities Act. The Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee has emphasized that School-to-Work is a completely separate \nprogram that is no way part of or linked to S. 1186. Section 316(d)(2) \nof the bill states:\n\n       Funds shall not be used to carry out activities that \n     duplicate federally funded activities available to youth.\n\n  The committee has cited this section as prohibiting any localities \nfrom using S. 1168 funding to expand School-to-Work. Although Section \n316 may be clear to legislative counsel and to those of us inside the \nbeltway, there are still concerns about the misuse of adult job \ntraining funds for School-to-Work activities. My amendment clarifies in \nan unambiguous manner that the funds in this bill cannot be used to \ncarry out School-to-Work activities.\n  Many concerned citizens are troubled by the possibility that adult \njob training programs and even vocational education programs will be \nlinked to elementary and secondary education and the School-to-Work \nProgram. The concern is that this bill and the system it sets up would \nbe linked to the School-to-Work system. I share these concerns. This \namendment makes it clear to all involved, including those at the State \nlevel who will implement this law, that School-to-Work and adult job \ntraining are two distinct programs.\n  The population that this legislation is aimed to help is different \nfrom the population served by the School-to-Work Act. They have \ndifferent needs and different focuses, and this bill should make clear \nthat they are to remain separate.\n  My hope in offering this amendment is to ensure the two programs \nremain separate and the funds made available under this bill are not \nused to supplement the School-to-Work Act or to link School-to-Work \nactivities with the Workforce Investment Partnership Act activities.\n  No matter how one feels about School-to-Work, and there are some who \noppose it and some who support it, you should support this amendment. \nThis amendment does not affect the School-to-Work law in any way, other \nthan to reaffirm the separate nature of the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act from the School-to-Work Program.\n  The Labor and Human Resources Committee is supportive of this \namendment because it further clarifies what they understand the bill to \ndo. In fact, the committee has repeatedly responded to the concerns \nabout this issue by stating:\n\n       School-to-Work is a completely separate program that is no \n     way part of or linked to S. 1186. This amendment seeks to \n     reassure those who are troubled by the possible linking of \n     adult job training system to the\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\n     School-to-Work Program. But more than that, the purpose of \n     this amendment is to keep these two programs separate, not \n     just rhetorically but in reality and in actuality.\n\n  I thank the chairman for his support of this important amendment. It \nis my understanding the amendment is acceptable to both sides and is \nconsistent with the understanding of the committee generally. I offer \nit and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Jeffords addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We have checked with the minority. It is acceptable to \nboth sides.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will be brief but I would like to rise \nat this point to speak in strong support of the amendment of Senator \nAshcroft to S. 1186. This amendment prohibits the use of funds to carry \nout activities authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of \n1994.\n  Let me state it was never--I repeat never--my intention to include \nfunds for School-to-Work activities in S. 1186. The bill we are \ncurrently debating, I believe, reflects this intent. In fact, section \n316(d)(2) of the bill clearly states:\n\n       Funds . . . shall not be used to carry out activities that \n     duplicate federally funded activities available to youth.\n\n  This provision prohibits States and localities from using S. 1186 \nfunding in any way to expand School-to-Work. The Ashcroft amendment--\nlet me state I thank my friend and colleague from Missouri for this \ncontribution to the bill--will simply clarify this language. It will \nclarify it by adding, quoting from Senator Ashcroft's amendment:\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be used \n     to carry out activities authorized under the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act of 1994.\n\n  This amendment is simple and it is straightforward. The Ashcroft \namendment emphasizes, I believe, what the bill already clearly states. \nThere has been opposition to S. 1186, driven by, I believe, a lack of \nunderstanding of this piece of legislation and a fear that our schools \nare going to be turned into training facilities that force children \ninto career tracks. This is simply not true. This is the last thing--\nlet me repeat, as I have stated on the floor before--this is the last \nthing this U.S. Senator would seek to do. This is the last thing this \nMember of the Senate would ever propose, would ever push, would ever \nwrite or, frankly, would ever even vote for.\n  S. 1186 does not expand the School-to-Work Act. School-to-Work is a \ncompletely separate program that is in no way part of or linked to S. \n1186. I repeat, School-to-Work is in no way part of or linked to S. \n1186. I would never support an expansion of School-to-Work. We do not \nneed a Federal program directing students how to make the transition \nfrom School-to-Work. It is not an appropriate Federal role. \nFurthermore, School-to-Work's prescription will not solve the problem \nthat too many kids are graduating today without the basic academics \nneeded to succeed on the job, to succeed in postsecondary education, or \nto succeed in life.\n  I support inclusion of the Ashcroft amendment in S. 1186. I thank my \ncolleague from Missouri for proposing it. I believe it simply clarifies \nwhat is already in the bill, which is that funds in this legislation \ncannot be used to carry out activities authorized under the School-to-\nWork Opportunities Act of 1994.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly disagree with the adverse \ncomments of the Senator from Missouri regarding the School-to-Work \nOpportunities Act. That Act has provided countless young men and women \nacross America with educational and career development opportunities \nwhich they would never have otherwise had. It has given those teenagers \na greater range of choice in preparing for their future careers. It has \nopened the doors of prospective employers to these students and \nafforded them invaluable work opportunities. The evidence is there. I \ncould speak for hours reciting success stories resulting from the \nSchool-to-Work program.\n  However, this is not the appropriate time to debate the merits of \nSchool-to-Work. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act does not even \nmention the School-to-Work Opportunities Act once in its 444 pages of \ntext. It does not amend or alter the School-to-Work Act in any way.\n  The concern of all Senators today should be focused on the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act which we are now considering. I have been \nassured by those advocating the Ashcroft amendment that it does not in \nany way limit the use of funds made available under the Workforce Act \nfor any activity authorized by the Workforce Act. That is the issue \nwhich is most important today. Notwithstanding the Ashcroft amendment, \nfunds available under each title of the Workforce Act will be able to \nbe used to support any activity which that title authorizes. Based on \nthat representation regarding the intent of the amendment, I do not \nrequest a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for a vote at this time.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2331) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                amendment no. 2332 to amendment no. 2329\n\n (Purpose: To establish a requirement that individuals submit to drug \n  tests, to ensure that applicants and participants make full use of \n              benefits extended through training services)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2332 to amendment No. 2329.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 371, add the following:\n       (f) Drug Testing Limitations on Participants in Training \n     Services.--\n       (1) Finding.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the possession, distribution, and use of drugs by \n     participants in training services should not be tolerated, \n     and that such use prevents participants from making full use \n     of the benefits extended through training services at the \n     expense of taxpayers; and\n       (B) applicants and participants should be tested for \n     illegal drug use, in order to maximize the training services \n     and assistance provided under this title.\n       (2) Drug tests.--Each eligible provider of training \n     services shall administer a drug test--\n       (A) on a random basis, to individuals who apply to \n     participate in training services; and\n       (B) to a participant in training services, on reasonable \n     suspicion of drug use by the participant.\n       (3) Eligibility of applicants.--In order for such an \n     applicant to be eligible to participate in training services, \n     the applicant shall agree to submit to a drug test \n     administered as described in paragraph (2)(A) and, if the \n     test is administered to the applicant, shall pass the test.\n       (4) Eligibility of participants.--In order for such a \n     participant to remain eligible to participate in training \n     services, the participant shall agree to submit to a drug \n     test administered as described in paragraph (2)(B) and, if \n     the test is administered to the participant, shall pass the \n     test. If a participant refuses to submit to the drug test, or \n     fails the drug test, the eligible provider shall dismiss the \n     participant from participation in training services.\n       (5) Reapplication.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an \n     individual who is an applicant and is disqualified from \n     eligibility under paragraph (3), or who is a participant and \n     is dismissed under paragraph (4), may reapply, not earlier \n     than 6 months after the date of the disqualification or \n     dismissal, to participate in training services. If the \n     individual demonstrates that the individual has completed a \n     drug treatment program and passed a drug test within the 30-\n     day period prior to the date of the reapplication, the \n     individual may participate in training services, under the \n     same terms and conditions as apply to other applicants and \n     participants, including submission to drug tests administered \n     as described in paragraph (2).\n       (B) Second disqualification or dismissal.--If the \n     individual reapplies to participate in training services and \n     fails a drug test administered under paragraph (2) by the \n     eligible provider, while the individual is an applicant or a \n     participant, the eligible provider\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\n     shall disqualify the individual from eligibility for, or \n     dismiss the individual from participation in, training \n     services. The individual shall not be eligible to reapply for \n     participation in training services for 2 years after such \n     disqualification or dismissal.\n       (6) Appeal.--A decision by an eligible provider to \n     disqualify an individual from eligibility for participation \n     in training services under paragraph (3) or (5), or to \n     dismiss a participant as described in paragraph (4) or (5), \n     shall be subject to expeditious appeal in accordance with \n     procedures established by the State in which the eligible \n     provider is located.\n       (7) National uniform guidelines.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Labor shall develop \n     voluntary guidelines to assist eligible providers concerning \n     the drug testing required under this subsection.\n       (B) Privacy.--The guidelines shall promote, to the maximum \n     extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of \n     specimen samples for such drug testing.\n       (C) Laboratories and procedures.--With respect to standards \n     concerning laboratories and procedures for such drug testing, \n     the guidelines shall incorporate the Mandatory Guidelines for \n     Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, 53 Fed. Reg. 11970 \n     (1988) (or a successor to such guidelines), including the \n     portion of the mandatory guidelines that--\n       (i) establishes comprehensive standards for all aspects of \n     laboratory drug testing and laboratory procedures, including \n     standards that require the use of the best available \n     technology for ensuring the full reliability and accuracy of \n     drug tests and strict procedures governing the chain of \n     custody of specimen samples;\n       (ii) establishes the minimum list of drugs for which \n     individuals may be tested; and\n       (iii) establishes appropriate standards and procedures for \n     periodic review of laboratories and criteria for \n     certification and revocation of certification of laboratories \n     to perform such drug testing.\n       (D) Screening and confirmation.--The guidelines described \n     in subparagraph (A) shall provide that, for drug testing \n     conducted under this subsection--\n       (i) each laboratory involved in the drug testing of any \n     individual shall have the capability and facility, at such \n     laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;\n       (ii) all tests that indicate the use, in violation of law \n     (including Federal regulation) of a drug by the individual \n     shall be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of \n     testing capable of providing quantitative data regarding the \n     drug;\n       (iii) each specimen sample shall be subdivided, secured, \n     and labeled in the presence of the individual; and\n       (iv) a portion of each specimen sample shall be retained in \n     a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so \n     that if the confirmation test results are positive the \n     individual has an opportunity to have the retained portion \n     assayed by a confirmation test done independently at a second \n     certified laboratory, if the individual requests the \n     independent test not later than 3 days after being advised of \n     the results of the first confirmation test.\n       (E) Confidentiality.--The guidelines shall provide for the \n     confidentiality of the test results and medical information \n     (other than information relating to a drug) of the \n     individuals tested under this subsection, except that the \n     provisions of this subparagraph shall not preclude the use of \n     test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate \n     sanctions under this subsection.\n       (F) Selection for random tests.--The guidelines shall \n     ensure that individuals who apply to participate in training \n     services are selected for drug testing on a random basis, \n     using nondiscriminatory and impartial methods.\n       (8) Nonliability of local partnerships.--A local \n     partnership, and the individual members of a local \n     partnership, shall be immune from civil liability with \n     respect to any claim based in whole or part on activities \n     carried out to implement this subsection.\n       (9) Reporting requirements.--An eligible provider shall \n     make records of drug testing conducted under this subsection \n     available for inspection by other eligible providers, \n     including eligible providers in other local areas, for the \n     sole purpose of enabling the providers to determine the \n     eligibility status of an applicant pursuant to this \n     subsection.\n       (10) Use of drug tests.--No Federal, State, or local \n     prosecutor may use drug test results obtained under this \n     subsection in a criminal action.\n       (11) Definitions.--As used in this subsection:\n       (A) Drug.--The term ``drug'' means a controlled substance, \n     as defined in section 102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 802(6)).\n       (B) Drug test.--The term ``drug test'' means a biochemical \n     drug test carried out by a facility that is approved by the \n     eligible provider administering the test.\n       (C) Random basis.--For purposes of the application of this \n     subsection in a State, the term ``random basis'' has the \n     meaning determined by the Governor of the State, in the sole \n     discretion of the Governor.\n       (D) Training services.--The term ``training services'' \n     means services described in section 315(c)(3).\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, my amendment requires random drug \ntesting for all job training applicants and drug testing of program \nparticipants based on a standard of reasonable suspicion. If an \napplicant or participant tested positive, they could reapply after 6 \nmonths from the date of disqualification, but at reapplication they \nmust show that they passed a drug test within the last 30 days. A \nsecond failure of a drug test would require a two year wait before one \ncould reapply. This provision allows individuals who have failed a drug \ntest to get treatment and assistance and reapply for program funds.\n  I think it is important to say that I believe it does not pay us to \ntry to train people who are high on drugs. Nor does it pay us to train \npeople who are involved so substantially with drugs that when they go \nto take a drug test to get a job, they will be turned down because they \nare positive for drugs. I believe it is important, then, for us to be \nsensitive to these facts and to include in the legislation the fact \nthat we will prefer people who are drug free for employment training, \nbecause we might as well give them the training because they will \nactually be able to get and hold a job. This is something that is very \nimportant.\n  During the last Congress, the Senate passed an identical amendment to \nthe job training legislation. The amendment was agreed to by a vote of \n54 to 43 with broad, bipartisan support. The conferees retained the \ndrug testing provision in their conference report in the last \nCongress. So this is an item which is acceptable.\n\n  Since most of the private sector conducts drug testing on job \napplicants and employees, then a government-funded job training program \nshould be able to do the same. According to the 1996 American \nManagement Association Survey: Workplace Drug Testing and Drug Abuse \nPolicies, we know that the share of major U.S. firms that test for \ndrugs rose to 81 percent in 1996, and that was from 78 percent in 1995. \nThe survey also found that 89% of all manufacturers drug-test, and 100% \nof all transportation firms test, due to Department of Transportation \nregulations.\n  Additionally, 79% of wholesalers and retailers drug-test. These are \nall areas where participants are most likely to find jobs. More people \nare being asked to take drug tests when they show up for a job. Let's \nmake part of their training the fact that they would take such tests \nand that they would be able to pass those tests.\n  Additionally, our federal Job Corps program requires drug testing. \nWhy shouldn't we have the same standards in this government job \ntraining program?\n  When you have a finite amount of government resources, you should \nspend them in the most efficient and effective way.\n  Since the American taxpayers are funding this job training program, \nthere should be accountability. Taxpayer money is wasted if the person \ntrained with government money cannot get a job because they cannot pass \na drug test, which the majority of the private sector will conduct on \nemployees. Since our resources are scarce, we should focus them on \npeople who are likely to succeed.\n  Why train someone who will end up never being able to get a job, \nbecause they can't pass a drug test? On the other hand, we should train \nthose people who are responsible enough to be drug free and who want to \nwork. These are the people who can benefit from the training.\n  In fairness to the program participants, and in fairness to the \ntaxpayers, applicants for the job training programs that will be \nauthorized under this bill should be tested for the use of illegal \ndrugs.\n  Finally, Government is in the business of teaching lessons. Requiring \ndrug-testing for a government job training program teaches \nresponsibility to participants. If people know that there will be drug \ntesting in government job training programs, they will have an \nincentive to stay off of drugs.\n  Not testing participants is unfair to them because it falsely leads \nthem to believe that they can be drug users and get jobs, and it is \nunfair to the American taxpayers who have to pay for those false hopes.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides with the understanding, of course, partly in respect to the fact \nthat the Congress previously voted in this respect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nfrom Missouri would require applicants and participants in job training \nprograms to submit to drug testing. I am opposed to the amendment \nbecause it represents an unwarranted and unprecedented intrusion into \nthe privacy of the thousands of ordinary Americans who use job training \nservices.\n  In addition, the amendment is a costly and unfunded Federal mandate. \nOne of the innovations of this job training bill is the degree of \nflexibility it gives States and localities. The Ashcroft amendment is \ncompletely out of step with that goal.\n  Drug testing has an important role in certain job training settings, \njust as it has in certain workplace settings. But the proposal by the \nSenator from Missouri is overbroad, excessively expensive, and an \nexample of the intrusive Federal policy role that this bill is designed \nto combat.\n  The vast majority of the people who will use the job training \nservices authorized in this bill are upstanding citizens, not \ncriminals. They are displaced defense workers. They are blue collar \nworkers who have been laid off as a result of a factory closing. They \nare professionals seeking to improve their skills in specialized \nfields. They are victims of natural disasters and runaway plants moving \noverseas.\n  The Ashcroft amendment says to these people: If you want this \nassistance to try to improve your skills and obtain employment, you \nhave to agree to submit to a Government test for possible drug abuse. I \ndo not believe that the privacy of ordinary citizens hoping to improve \ntheir job skills should be routinely invaded in this intrusive manner.\n  The Government uses drug testing today for airline pilots, train \nconductors, and other employees involved in sensitive public safety \ntasks. If programs funded by this bill train people in sensitive jobs, \nthere is nothing that would prohibit drug testing.\n  But routinely testing of everyone is too extreme. We do not do it in \nother programs, and we should not do it in this one.\n  We do not drug-test people seeking Government assistance in financing \na mortgage; we do not drug-test flood or earthquake victims applying \nfor disaster relief; we do not drug-test crime victims seeking \nassistance from the Federal Office of Victim Services; we do not drug-\ntest farmers seeking crop subsidies. We do not drug-test corporate \nexecutive seeking overseas marketing assistance from the Commerce \nDepartment.\n  Why are job training recipients singled out for this stigma? No case \nhas been made that this population is more susceptible to drug abuse \nthan the population at large.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri requires drug \ntesting in two situations. First, every applicant to  a job training \nprogram is subject to testing on a random basis. Second, participants \nin training programs are subject to testing based on reasonable \nsuspicion of drug use. Both random basis and reasonable suspicion are \nundefined concepts. They raise the specter that excessive distinctions \nwill be made based on stereotypes and prejudices.\n\n  As we have often been told, Washington does not have all the answers. \nWe should not replace one set of Federal mandates with another set of \nFederal mandates. This bill is designed to maximize local flexibility, \nbut the Ashcroft amendment goes in the opposite direction.\n  Indeed, the Ashcroft amendment would actually preempt some State \nlaws. A number of State legislatures have addressed the circumstances \nunder which drug testing can be utilized, but the Ashcroft amendment \nwould actually override the considered judgments of those legislative \nbodies and put in place a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate.\n  Drug testing on the scale contemplated by this amendment would be \nenormously expensive. By some estimates, 1 million Americans use the \njob training services included in this bill. The Department of Health \nand Human Services estimates that the average cost of a drug test is \nabout $35.\n  That means it would cost $35 million each year to administer an \naverage of one test to each person. Either this amendment saddles local \ngovernments with a huge unfunded mandate, or it eats up a large portion \nof the Federal funds made available under this bill.\n  It is also important to note that drug testing technology is not \ninfallible. Depending upon the type of testing technology that is used, \nas many as 4 percent of all drug tests result in false positives. That \nmeans that if a million drug tests are administered, some 40,000 \nAmericans might be inaccurately labeled as drug users.\n  Of course there are often opportunities for appeals and confirmation \ntests and retests. But we should think long and hard before we adopt \nthis amendment and subject tens of thousands of ordinary, law-abiding \nAmericans to the Kafka-esque nightmare of being falsely accused of drug \nuse.\n  The amendment requires those who test positive for drugs to obtain \ndrug treatment. But who will pay for treatment? Right now, only a third \nof the Americans who need substance abuse treatment receive it because \ninsurance coverage and public funding are inadequate. In light of that \nfiscal reality, it makes no sense to institute a massive new Government \ndrug testing program.\n  Finally, the amendment is objectionable because it may deter people \nwho need job training services from seeking them. The threat of an \nintrusive drug test may put off drug users and non-drug users alike. We \nwant to encourage people to improve their skills. We want to encourage \nthe unemployed to become employed. We should not erect barriers to the \nservices authorized in this bill.\n  Job training programs do not need the Federal Government to tell them \nhow to deal with drug abuse. They have the tools they need. Where drug \ntesting is appropriate, it will occur. But a sweeping Federal mandate \nis completely unnecessary and excessively expensive.\n  I have concerns about the privacy issue, concerns about the cost \nissue, concerns about preempting State laws, concerns about issues \nrelating to standards and to quality control for random tests. They are \nall sound reasons to oppose this imprudent amendments.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask that the measure be voted on at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2332) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Missouri \nfor his amendments which he so forthrightly and quickly disposed of so \nthat we can move forward on this very important piece of legislation.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2333 to Amendment No. 2329\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for a right for certain large units of general \n  local government to submit appeals concerning designation as local \n                                 areas)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the immediate consideration of \nan amendment by Senator Lautenberg, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Mr. \n     Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 2333 to amendment \n     No. 2329.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 307(a)(2), strike subparagraph (C) and insert \n     the following:\n       (C) Large political subdivisions.--A single unit of general \n     local government with a population of 200,000 or more that is \n     a service delivery area under the Job Training Partnership \n     Act on the date of enactment of this Act, and that is not \n     designated as local area by the Governor under paragraph (1), \n     shall have an automatic right to submit an appeal regarding \n     designation to the Secretary. In conducting the appeal, the \n     Secretary may determine that the unit of general local \n     government shall be designated as a local area under \n     paragraph (1), on determining that the programs of the \n     service delivery area have demonstrated effectiveness, if the \n     designation of the unit meets the State plan requirements \n     described in section 304(b)(5).\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nto S. 1186, the ``Workforce Investment Partnership Act.'' My amendment \nwill provide a mechanism for 59 U.S. cities currently administering \nlocally-tailored workforce development services\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nunder the Job Training Partnership Act to retain their designation as \nService Delivery Areas (SDAs). This amendment allows those 59 cities \nthat are existing SDAs, with successful job training programs, to \nappeal to the Secretary of Labor if the Governor of their State denies \ntheir request to retain SDA status.\n  Without my amendment, 59 cities, with 200,000 people or more, that \nhad previously been SDAs but whose populations are under the new \n500,000 threshold, would have to specially request SDA designation from \ntheir State. Among others, these cities include Denver, Colorado; Fort \nWorth, Texas; Long Beach, California; Akron, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; and \ntwo cities in my state of New Jersey, Jersey City and Newark. If \nGovernors have sole discretion to terminate SDA designations, \nsuccessful and long standing community job training programs would be \nterminated. This could be disruptive to cities that are taking \nleadership roles in implementing welfare-to-work job training programs \nto meet welfare reform goals.\n  I support the goal of S.1186 to consolidate job training and \nemployment programs into a more efficient workforce development system. \nI believe that creating an appeal mechanism for existing SDA designated \ncities with productive programs, like Newark and Jersey City, will \nenhance this legislation's objective to meet that goal.\n  I want to thank the bill's managers, Senators DeWine and Wellstone, \nas well as the Ranking Democratic Member on the Labor Committee, \nSenator Kennedy, for working with me on this issue. They should be \ncongratulated on creating a strong, bipartisan bill. I am grateful that \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy and Secretary Herman have committed \ntheir support to this provision when S.1186 goes to conference.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss and explain that portion of the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act that deals with States' ``Service Delivery Areas.''\n  As I have stated before, the current system of Federal job training \nprograms is no system at all. Consumers, individuals seeking \nassistance, and businesses seeking to hire them face a fragmented and \nduplicative maze of narrowly focused programs that lack coordination, a \ncoherent strategy to provide training assistance, and the confidence of \nthe consumers who need to use the services.\n  These problems are the result of numerous shortcomings that have \ndeveloped over time and become part of a dated and neglected job \ntraining system that no longer considers the needs or resources of the \nStates and localities it serves.\n  One of the current system's largest shortcomings is its ineffective \ndesignation of over 600 Service Delivery Areas. These 600 plus regions \nare a tremendous burden on the country's job training system and one of \nthe greatest contributors to ``a complex patchwork of overlapping \nbureaucratic responsibilities.''\n  Over the past 15 years, it has been the Federal government deciding \nwhere these Service Delivery Areas would be.\n  Over the past 15 years, the Federal government used a general federal \nmandate and chose the number ``200,000'' to represent what it thought \nthe appropriate population of Service Delivery Areas should be.\n  Over the past 15 years, the Federal government's Service Delivery \nArea criteria remained stagnant while States continued to grow and \nchange.\n  The number 200,000 no longer adequately reflects the needs or \nresources of each and every State. It does not allow States to take \ntheir economic development or empowerment zones into account. It does \nnot flex to reflect the ever-changing populations of cities and \ncounties. In many urban areas it fragments a much larger labor market \nmaking coordination among State and local employment agencies difficult \nif not impossible.\n  The ``Washington-knows-best'' ``one-size-fits-all'' approach no \nlonger works and we have the past 15 years to prove it.\n  To fix this problem--to clear out this bureaucracy--and to create a \ncleaner more accountable and more efficient job training system, we \nmust do away with the paternalistic Washington mentality, return the \nService Delivery Area designation decisions to the States and \nlocalities, and ultimately lower the number of Service Delivery Areas.\n  To do this, the bill outlines four criteria to be followed in \nselecting the State's Service Delivery Areas:\n  The States and their localities must ensure that there is a link \nbetween participants in workforce investment activities and local \nemployment opportunities;\n  The States and their localities must ensure that a significant number \nof people who live in the proposed area also work in the area;\n  The States and their localities must ensure that neighboring Service \nDelivery Areas cooperate with each other and coordinate their \nactivities; and finally\n  The States and their localities must ensure that the State economic \ndevelopment areas are taken into consideration.\n  Currently, it is the Federal Government that decides what regions \nwill become Service Delivery Areas and what regions will not.\n  Under this new law, this cleaner, more accountable, and more \neffective system, it is the States and local communities that will make \nthese decisions; it is the States and local communities that will have \na true understanding of how to best apply these four new criteria; and \nit will be the States and local communities that determine how their \njob training dollars will best be used.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer afford the ``Washington knows best'' \nmentality. That is the thinking that created the current maze and \nbureaucratic patchwork of job training programs. That is the thinking \nthat brings us here today--needing to change the system and fix its \nproblems. We must put the decisions, such as Service Delivery Area \ndesignation, in the hands of those who are closest to their needs and \nresources.\n  This bill, and the positive changes it makes to the way Service \nDelivery Areas are currently designated, will help eliminate the \n``Washington one-size-fits-all mentality'' and allow States, their \nGovernors, their cities, and their municipalities--through a consensus \nprocess--to change the status quo and develop a more effective and \nlocally controlled job training system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be adopted. It \nis accepted on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2333) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2334 to Amendment No. 2329\n\n (Purpose: To establish a demonstration program that locates secondary \n     schools on the sites of community colleges for the purpose of \n                     conducting tech-prep programs)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2334 to amendment No. 2329.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After section 157, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 158. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Demonstration Program Authorized.--From funds \n     appropriated under subsection (e) for a fiscal year, the \n     Secretary shall award grants to consortia described in \n     section 154(a) to enable the consortia to carry out tech-prep \n     education programs.\n       (b) Program Contents.--Each tech-prep program referred to \n     in subsection (a)--\n       (1) shall--\n       (A) involve the location of a secondary school on the site \n     of a community college;\n       (B) involve a business as a member of the consortium; and\n       (C) require the voluntary participation of secondary school \n     students in the tech-prep education program; and\n       (2) may provide summer internships at a business for \n     students or teachers.\n       (c) Application.--Each consortium desiring a grant under \n     this section shall submit an application to the Secretary at \n     such time, in such manner and accompanied by such information \n     as the Secretary may require.\n       (d) Applicability.--The provisions of sections 154, 155, \n     156, and 157 shall not apply to this section, except that--\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\n       (1) the provisions of section 154(a) shall apply for \n     purposes of describing consortia eligible to receive \n     assistance under this section;\n       (2) each tech-prep education program assisted under this \n     section shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), \n     (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), (3)(D), (4), (5), (6), and (7) of \n     section 155(b), except that such paragraph (3)(B) shall be \n     applied by striking ``, and where possible and practicable, \n     4-year institutions of higher education through \n     nonduplicative sequence of courses in career fields''; and\n       (3) in awarding grants under this section, the Secretary \n     shall give special consideration to consortia submitting \n     applications under subsection (c) that meet the requirements \n     of paragraphs (1), (3), (4), and (5) of section 156(d), \n     except that such paragraph (1) shall be applied by striking \n     ``or the transfer of students to 4-year institutions of \n     higher education''.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $25,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 and each of the 5 succeeding fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment will establish a tech-\nprep demonstration program that locates secondary schools on the sites \nof community colleges. Tech-prep is an outstanding program. I believe \nthis amendment will enhance tech-prep activities. I ask my colleagues \nto support it. I know of no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2334) was agreed to.\n\n\n                              section 367\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employment \nand Training, Senator Wellstone, concerning the initiatives covered by \nsection 367 of the bill. Mr. President, I strongly feel that clarifying \nthe intent of this section will be helpful in my efforts to ensure that \na very worthwhile initiative in Northeastern, Ohio receives favorable \nconsideration by the Department of Labor.\n  As I understand it, section 367 authorizes the Secretary of Labor to \ncarry out demonstration projects to develop new techniques, different \napproaches, and specialized methods to address communities; employment \nand training needs. This section also requires the community or entity \nto substantially contribute to their project's funding, have expertise \nin undertaking national demonstration projects, or have expertise in \noverseeing employment and training programs.\n  The Ohio initiative I referred to establishes an Engineering and \nTraining Center which will provide employers, employees, students, and \nthe underemployed access to job training services and course work \ngermane the region's existing manufacturing base as well as its \nfledgling information technology industries. For example, the Center \nwould provide welders, who recently lost their jobs when Ford Motor \nCompany closed its Thunderbird and Econoline plants, computer software \ninstruction for new computer controlled welding equipment. The \nEngineering and Training Center would also contain working laboratories \nwhere employees would receive custom training on the latest technology \nequipment.\n  Would the Senator agree that the establishment of such an Engineering \nand Training Center, whose principal focus is to provide job training \nto workers in a community suffering from the closure of auto and steel \nplants, is the type of activity section 367 encourages? And would the \nwillingness of local foundations to provide half the cost of such an \ninitiative satisfy the bill's substantial funding equipment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I agree with my friend's reading of section 367. Its \ndemonstration and pilot project section clearly is meant to encourage \nprojects to help develop and implement techniques, approaches and \nmethods such as those the Senator informs us are contained in the \nproposal from his state for an engineering and training center. I would \nalso certainly think that local private funding of 50 percent would \nqualify as ``a substantial portion.''\n  Mr. DeWINE. Would the Senator agree that a County Community College, \nwhich functions as an integral part of the county's welfare-to-work \ninitiative, and whose President who has won national awards and is the \ndriving force in virtually every job training initiative in the region, \naddresses the bill's ``expertise in employment and training programs?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would fully expect the Department to give all due \nconsideration to a proposal from an institution and chairman with such \nimpressive credentials and expertise.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                    Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure working with my \ncolleague from OHIO on this bill. I appreciate his extremely hard work. \nI would like to confirm my understanding of a provision of the bill and \nensure it is the same as the understanding of my colleague. For \npurposes of programs authorized under Title III of the bill, that is, \nthe Workforce Investment Activities title, housing is considered to be \nan eligible supportive service. That is specified in the bill's \ndefinition section. In Section 362 of Title III, the section dealing \nwith migrant and seasonal farmworker programs, a range of workforce \ninvestment activities are authorized, including employment and training \nassistance. The section then also authorizes further related assistance \nfor eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers, including supportive \nservices.\n  For a number of years, the Labor Department has provided funding to a \nsmall number of single purpose grantees which provide an essential \nsupportive service to farmworkers: improving their housing conditions. \nAs S. 1186 defines supportive services to include housing and includes \nsupportive services as eligible workforce investment related assistance \nfor farmworkers, it seems clear to me that the bill would allow the \nSecretary to continue to make grants for farmworker housing.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator is correct. Under the bill, the Secretary \nwould have the discretion to continue grants to improve farmworker \nhousing.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would not object to the Senator from \nMissouri speaking in morning business for a period, I believe, of up to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have an \nopportunity to speak as in morning business for up to 6 minutes, until \n11 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Ashcroft pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2023 and S. 2028 located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from \nOhio, and the Senator from Georgia in allowing me to make these \nstatements and introduce these matters. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed as in \nmorning business for a period not exceeding 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S3963-6", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4021-S4022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TOBACCO LEGISLATION AND TEEN SMOKING\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I had hoped to be in Burlington, VT, \nthis morning meeting with a group of high school students. They have \nbeen studying tobacco use among adults and teens and talking about the \nproposed tobacco settlement in their health and civics classes. I \nregret that I am not able to be in Vermont to talk with them.\n  But I do want to take this opportunity to express my support for \nprompt consideration of tobacco legislation. When I look around the \nclassrooms here in D.C. with students here in D.C.--when I read in the \nBrent School, or when I meet students at home, as I had planned to \ntoday--I see dozens of faces alive with potential. I see those kids as \nthe soccer and track stars. I wonder which ones enjoy science and which \nones are the budding\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nartists. To me, each of these kids represents an unknown but a \npromising future.\n  To the tobacco industry, every single one of these kids represents \nnothing more than a replacement smoker. The tobacco industry's goal is \nto turn each of these young athletes and budding scientists into a \nsmoker. We know now that the tobacco industry has plotted to capture \nthe cub scout and the kindergarten market.\n  We have documentation that the tobacco industry has studied the \nbehavior of children as young as 5 to determine how susceptible they \nare. And their scheming has worked. Every day, every week of every \nyear, 3,000 children become addicted to cigarettes. A third of them \nwill die early from smoking, and those who go on to raise families will \nendanger their children through low birthweight complications and \nsecondhand smoke.\n  Vermont and other States have done much to combat teen smoking. I \napplaud the parents, teachers, and State health officials who have led \nthe battle against big tobacco at the local level. It is time now for \nCongress to do something too.\n  Ever since the Attorneys General announced their proposed settlement \nlast June, Congress has been talking to experts and debating the best \napproach to reduce teen smoking. But the time for talking is behind us. \nAnd time is running out. It is critical that the Senate act on tobacco \nlegislation in the coming weeks. We cannot allow politics to stand in \nthe way of this rare opportunity. This issue is too important and too \ncomplicated to leave to the last minute.\n  As chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have \nheld seven hearings on the question of what tobacco policy would be \nbest for this country. We heard from the experts that there is no \nsilver bullet that will solve the problem of teen smoking. But that is \nno excuse for inactivity. Smoking kills 400,000 people a year, and it \nis the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Nine \nout of ten smokers became addicted as teenagers.\n  My home State of Vermont, unfortunately, is not immune from the \nproblem. Our teen smoking rate is higher--higher--than the national \naverage. More than one in every three Vermont high school students are \nregular smokers. More than 12,000 Vermont teens currently under age 18 \nwill die prematurely from tobacco-related disease. That is like wiping \nthe towns of Underhill, Jericho, Richmond, and Huntington right off the \nmap--wiping them right off the map.\n  Despite the best efforts of parents, educators, and health \nprofessionals around the State over the past few years, more and more \nteenagers are deciding to smoke. Unless we act now to help them quit, \nmost of these kids will continue to smoke into adulthood.\n  I pledge to Vermonters that I will do everything I can to enact \ncomprehensive tobacco legislation this year. In February, I introduced \nthe Prevent Addiction To Smoking Among Teens Act, the PAST Act, to \nenact and improve upon the public health provisions of the tobacco \nsettlement. Last month, the Senate Commerce Committee passed \ncomprehensive legislation which incorporated many of the public health \nprovisions originally proposed in the PAST Act.\n  As tobacco legislation moves through the Senate, I will continue my \nfight to ensure that we keep our eyes on the goal of improving the \npublic health and preventing kids from smoking. Congress needs to pass \nlegislation which will prevent kids from smoking. Even though there is \nno silver bullet, we do know of many approaches which have proven \neffective, particularly when used in combination.\n  A national tobacco policy must give the Food and Drug Administration \nfull authority to regulate tobacco, the Centers for Disease Control, \nthe National Institutes of Health, and the State health departments, \nand others in the fight to convince high school students not to smoke, \nand to treat those who have decided to do so, as well as we can, to get \nthem to stop.\n  We need to make teen smoking a thing of the past. I cannot think of a \nbetter graduation present for high school seniors in Vermont and around \nthe country than to stop teenage smoking.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my \ntime. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4021-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4022-S4027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WORKFORCE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, \nKennedy, Wellstone and DeWine for their tireless efforts to bring this \nbipartisan bill to the Senate floor. I hope that any remaining \ndisagreements can be worked out in Conference.\n  Few issues that we have a chance to debate and vote on are as \ncritically important to the future of this country as the one before us \ntoday. The strength of our workforce is directly linked to a lifetime \nof quality education and training. And never have the challenges been \ngreater. We must remain steadfast in our efforts to continue educating \nand training our workforce so that more of our companies can \nsuccessfully adapt to the rapid developments of modern technology.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is the culmination of many \nyears of hard work. The current maze of more than 160 separate programs \nwhich are administered by 15 separate federal agencies has become \nunnecessarily cumbersome for both those in need of training assistance \nand those employers seeking to hire skilled workers. This bill \nstreamlines these programs by giving more authority to state and local \ngovernments, but retaining crucial federal requirements in order to \nensure that the most vulnerable and deserving members of our \npopulation, including disadvantaged youth and displaced workers, \nreceive the support and training assistance they need. This focus will \nensure that these individuals have a chance to share in our nation's \ncontinued economic prosperity and growth. In addition, by emphasizing \nresults and accountability from job training programs, our workers will \nbe better equipped with the skills they need to land high-wage and \nhigh-skilled jobs.\n  I know firsthand the struggle many hard-working individuals face as \ntheir company downsizes or scales back production. For many years, the \nConnecticut economy was dependent on defense-oriented industries. In \nthe past few years, many qualified, highly skilled workers in \nConnecticut have lost their jobs as a result of military downsizing. In \nthe last 12 months, more than 1,500 defense related jobs were lost in \nmy state.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act ensures that defense \nemployees who are adversely affected by base closings and military \ndownsizing will have access to job training and supportive services \nthrough the National Reserve Account in title III of the Job Training \nPartnership Act. If these workers receive access to training, they can \nacquire the skills needed for employment in the technology driven \neconomy of the 21st century.\n  The Connecticut economy is changing. In February, a group of 120 \nbusiness leaders stated that a highly educated and trained work force \nis the only way that Connecticut can capitalize on the promises of the \nnew technology driven sectors such as software development, information \ntechnology and photonics. For too long, we were focused on job loss. It \nis now time to focus on the rebuilding of our economy and ensure that \nall potential employees, including former welfare recipients and \ndisplaced workers, receive the training and skills they need.\n  I am especially pleased that a cornerstone of the job training bill \nwill be streamlined service delivery. The bill accomplishes this \nintegration by building on the One-Stop system to unify the patchwork \nof fragmented job training and employment programs into a single, \ncustomer-friendly environment. The proposed legislation would expand \nthe concept of universal access to services for job seekers and \nbusinesses without eligibility criteria.\n  Connecticut is nearing completion of implementation of its One-Stop \nCareer\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\nCenter System, Connecticut Works, which is being financed through a \ngrant from the U.S. Department of Labor. This network has reformed the \ndelivery of job training services in Connecticut. To date, a total of \n16 centers have been created across the state and I have had the \nprivilege of visiting many of them. Gone are the dreary unemployment \ncenters of the past.\n  Each of the centers in Connecticut offers a broad array of services \nincluding a variety of job search workshops and self-service research \nrooms with computer and Internet access. A wide range of written \nmaterial is provided in the research rooms, and customers have access \nto fax machines and telephones to assist them in their job search. \nEnhanced and coordinated services to businesses are provided through \nthe use of an Employer Contact Management System. Customer surveys and \nperformance measurements ensure that customer needs are addressed. The \npartnership with the State library has brought access to electronic \nlabor market and job search services through local libraries to over \none hundred sites throughout Connecticut, bringing services to more \ncustomers with expanded days and hours of operation.\n  Mr. President, vocational educational activities are also provided \nfor within the Workforce legislation. Significantly, WIPA will put into \nplace challenging performance measures to gauge the efficiency of the \neducational programs it oversees. These measures will require \nproficient training in the areas of job readiness skills, vocational \nskills, and placement, retention, and completion of educational \nopportunities. The Carl D. Perkins vocational educational title, which \nwill separately appropriate and administer all vocational educational \nprograms, will teach participants computer skills and new technologies \nto prepare them for the burgeoning high-tech labor market.\n  WIPA further provides for the coordination of adult education and job \ntraining systems, allowing adult education to play a crucial role in a \nparticipant's job training program. In the area of adult education and \nliteracy, WIPA specifically targets those communities demonstrating \nsignificant illiteracy rates to receive adult education programs on a \npriority basis. I am pleased that the Workforce legislation also \nincludes a provision that will direct funds designated to support \nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL) programs to those ESL programs in \ncommunities with designated need. This means that ESL programs with \nwaiting lists--those in communities with the greatest need for the \nvaluable services these programs provide--will receive funds on a \nprioritized basis.\n  Mr. President, in order to better assist non-native English speakers \nand fully assimilate them into our society, we must help them become \nmore fluent in English. I can think of few more important factors in \ndetermining whether or not someone new to this society will \nsuccessfully make this difficult transition than their ability to speak \nEnglish.\n  A clear and effective grasp of the English language is still the best \nindicator of success for non-native English speakers. The ability to \nspeak English for anyone in today's marketplace represents an ``open \ndoor,'' Mr. President. This ``open door'' can lead to greater \nemployment and advancement opportunities for those whose first language \nis not English.\n  The reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act, offered as an \namendment to the Workforce legislation, is critically important \nlegislation that I am proud to cosponsor. The Rehabilitation Act \nprovides comprehensive vocational rehabilitation services designed to \nhelp individuals with disabilities become more employable and achieve \ngreater independence and integration into society.\n  Under the Rehabilitation Act, States, with assistance provided by the \nfederal government in the manner of formula-derived grants, provide a \nbroad array of services to individuals with disabilities that includes \nassessment, counseling, vocational and other educational services, work \nrelated placement services, and rehabilitation technology services. In \n1995 alone, Mr. President, more than 1.25 million Americans with \ndisabilities were served by vocational rehabilitation programs.\n  I am particularly pleased that a provision dealing with assistive \ntechnology was included in the reauthorization legislation. This \nprovision, Section 508, will require the federal government to provide \nassistive technology to Federal employees with disabilities. This \nprovision will put into place for the first time regulations requiring \nthe federal government to provide its employees with disabilities with \naccess to appropriate technology suited to their individual needs.\n  This legislation would allow the federal government to take the lead \nin providing critical access to information technology to all federal \nemployees with disabilities in this country. It strengthens the federal \nrequirement that electronic and information technology purchased by \nfederal agencies be accessible to their employees with disabilities.\n  Electronic and information technology accessibility is essential for \nfederal employees to maintain a meaningful employment experience, as \nwell as to meet their full potential. We live in a world where \ninformation and technology are synonymous with professional \nadvancement. Increasingly, essential job functions have come to involve \nthe use of technology, and where it is inaccessible, job opportunities \nthat others take for granted are foreclosed to people with \ndisabilities.\n  Presently, there are approximately 145,000 individuals with \ndisabilities in the federal workforce. Roughly 61 percent of these \nemployees hold permanent positions in professional, administrative, or \ntechnical occupations. Nationally, there are 49 million Americans who \nhave disabilities, nearly half of them have a severe disability. Yet \nmost mass market information technology is designed without \nconsideration for their needs.\n  It is critical, Mr. President, given the rapid introduction into the \nworkforce of novel technologically-advanced products, that persons with \ndisabilities not be allowed to fall behind. The federal government must \ntruly be an equal opportunity employer, and this equal opportunity must \napply fully to individuals with special needs.\n  I view Section 508 as a hopeful first step in an effort to ensure \nthat all individuals with disabilities have access to the assistive \ntechnology providing them the ability to reach their full ability. \nThough Section 508 will presently only affect federal employees, it is \nmy hope that one day all individuals with disabilities will have the \nsame access to assistive technology now afforded federal employees \nbecause of Section 508.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to commend Senators Jeffords, \nDeWine, Kennedy and Wellstone for the important role they each played \nin making the Workforce legislation and the reauthorization of the \nRehabilitation Act a reality. They worked closely with myself and my \nstaff to address numerous concerns and for that I wish to thank them.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act restates the \nSenate's long commitment to vocational education, adult education, job \ntraining, and vocational rehabilitation. Yet it does more than just \ncontinue this tradition; it builds upon our experiences and moves us \nforward--improving our education and training programs. S. 1186 will \nprovide better opportunities for America's citizens to get the skills \nthey, as individuals, need to obtain work and that America's businesses \nneed to retain their competitive edge in the global economy.\n  S. 1186 is a commitment to meeting the challenges faced by America to \nproduce the workforce that we need for the 21st century. It \nincorporates almost seventy categorical programs and builds an \nintegrated workforce system as a replacement for the current group of \nfragmented or duplicative programs.\n  The vocational education section is particularly significant in its \nemphasis on the inclusion of a strong academic component in vocational \neducation assuring that students in vocational programs receive the \nstrongest possible education and the broadest possible base on which to \nbuild careers. It requires the states to explain how duplication will \nbe avoided, and how the activities of related programs will be \ncoordinated. Finally it requires the establishment of rigorous \nperformance measures of both state and local progress toward concrete \ngoals.\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\n  The job training components will lead to more comprehensive and \nefficient state systems for workforce development with linkages to \nstrengthen welfare to work activities. It gives greater authority and \nflexibility to the states in the way each responds to the education and \ntraining needs of its citizens and its business community. For example, \nunder S. 1186, a governor in a state with a ``Work-Flex'' program can \nwaive requirements that prevent a local workforce area from responding \nefficiently to local needs. It allows governors to consolidate \nadministrative funds and state reserve funds from different funding \nstreams to coordinate and manage the use of these funds for a state's \npriorities.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will also encourage efforts \nby the states to improve the integration of previously separate \nprograms, a change that is especially welcome in Maine where extensive \nefforts are already underway to coordinate the efforts of the \nvocational high schools, the technical colleges, adult education and \njob training programs and vocational rehabilitation. This streamlining \nand integration of federal programs will support Maine's priorities in \nthis area.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill includes incentive grants that \nwill reward states that exceed their goals and will support states in \nthe development of innovative programs tailored to their own needs. \nThis will result in new models and methods for vocational education and \njob training. The incentive grants should encourage the states to move \ntoward the important goal of improved integration of vocational \neducation, adult education and job training.\n  This bill also incorporates the Rehabilitation Act, which I \ncosponsored. In doing so it provides important links between vocational \nrehabilitation and a state's workforce system. It simplifies the access \nof persons with disabilities to vocational rehabilitation services and \nstreamlines the administration of these services.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act challenges each state to \nimprove the vocational education and vocational rehabilitation that it \nprovides to its citizens, to be sure that its vocational and job \ntraining programs respond to and anticipate the changing demands of the \neconomy, and that it fosters programs helping those on welfare move to \nwork. This bill will help the states turn these challenges into \nopportunities.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased we are about to pass \nwhat may be one of the most significant and positive pieces of \nlegislation to be enacted into law this Congress--S. 1186, the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act. It is the outcome of an open, \ncooperative and bipartisan process beginning with a number of hearings \non the subject last year in our Labor Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining. As soon as possible, following passage here, I hope we can \nproceed to a conference with members of the House and reconcile the \ndifferences between this bill and the one which that body passed last \nyear. Some of those differences are substantial, but most are not \nfundamental.\n  This major re-write of job training and workforce development law is \nvitally needed. If we can keep a conference bill close in most respects \nto this Senate bill, it will, upon enactment, represent an important \nstep forward for the country's economy, workers and businesses. I agree \nwith President Clinton's statement regarding this Senate bill, \ncontained in a letter he wrote recently to the Majority Leader. The \nPresident correctly observed that the bill is ``essential to widening \nthe circle of opportunity for more Americans and keeping our economy \ngrowing steady and strong.''\n  I would like to commend the Chairman of the full Committee, Senator \nJeffords, as well as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining, Senator DeWine, for their leadership on the bill. Senator \nDeWine in particular has been tireless in pushing the process forward \nto make this bill happen. I commend my colleague for his work, as well \nas that of his staff. Likewise, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nRanking Member of the full Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy, as well as \nhis staff, for their work on this bill. It has been a formidable amount \nof labor. Department of Labor officials and staff also have provided an \nenormous amount of technical assistance. We appreciate their \ndedication.\n  Arriving at this point has required compromise. As is usually the \ncase with a bill of this magnitude, no senator or group with an \ninterest in this key area of federal policy is likely to call our bill \nperfect. But the wide array of organizations and associations who \nsupport it are testimony to the fact that we have engaged in a very \ndemocratic process. We have endorsements of the bill from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, The National Association of Manufacturers, the \nNational Association of Private Industry Councils, the Society for \nHuman Resource Management, the National Alliance of Business, the \nBusiness Round Table, the National League of Cities, the National \nConference of State Legislators, the National Association of Counties, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Job Corps Coalition, the \nAmerican Vocational Association, the American Association of Community \nColleges, and the National Association of State Directors of Vocational \nTechnical Education, to name a few. It is a good bill, with widespread \nsupport.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will fundamentally improve \nour federal system of job training. It incorporates adult and \nvocational education without threatening those programs' separate \nfunding streams. With the inclusion of Senator DeWine's amendment, it \nwill also include reauthorization and improvement of vocational \nrehabilitation programs, again without threatening separate funding for \nvocational rehabilitation programs.\n  The bill will help coordinate, streamline and decentralize our \nfederal job training system. At the same time, it will make that system \nmore accountable to real performance measures. It gives private sector \nemployers--the people who have jobs to offer and who need workers with \nthe right skills--a greater role in directing policy at the state and \nlocal level, which is where most decision-making power resides in this \nbill.\n  S. 1186 will move the whole country to where Minnesota and a number \nof other states have already moved decisively: to a system of One-Stop \nservice centers where people can get all the information they need in \none location. It will replace currently over-bureaucratized systems in \nmany states and localities with systems driven more by the needs of \nthose who utilize them. Adults seeking training will receive Individual \nTraining Accounts to give them direct control over their own careers. \nHigh quality labor market information will be accessible through the \nOne-Stops, and training providers will be required to report publicly \non their performance. Men and women will have the ability to make their \nown choices based on the best information about which profession they \nshould pursue, about the skills and training they'll need, and about \nthe best place to get those skills and that training.\n  I have visited Minnesota One-Stops. They work. I would like to \ncommend the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, by the way, \nwhich is the agency responsible for job training in my state. \nCommissioner R. Jane Brown and her staff do excellent and important \nwork. I appreciate the cooperation we have received from them \nthroughout the legislative process on this bill.\n  The bill targets resources from the federal level to those who need \nthem. It assures separate funding to adults, to youth, and to \ndislocated workers according to state formulae, and also according to \nformulae within states. There was no attempt this time to do away with \nNAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance or to threaten other important \ndislocated worker assistance.There was no effort to drastically reduce \nfunding for job training systems based on hoped-for savings from \nconsolidation of programs. That is crucial. This bill does not \noverreach. It does not block-grant job training, adult education and \nvocational education progams. It retains crucial federal priorities, \nthen allows state and local authorities to decide how best to address \ntheir needs.\n  For example, even when our economy is performing generally well, as \nit currently is, many workers will lose their jobs due to forces beyond \ntheir control,\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\ndue to economic change. We cannot abandon Americans who can and want to \nbe productive. We need to respond quickly to plant closings and mass \nlayoffs with job search assistance and retraining for new jobs. The \ncurrent dislocated worker program serves about half a million \ndislocated American workers a year. It usually succeeds in training \ndisplaced workers for new jobs--jobs which provide over 90 percent of \ntheir previous wages.\n  It is even more true that many youth, especially in poor urban and \nrural areas, are being left behind by our prosperity. Many have dropped \nout or are at risk of dropping out of school. This harms us all. We \nlose productivity. We lose revenue. Most importantly, we lose the \npotential of our young people. The bill's Out-of-School Youth \ninitiative is extremely important. It targets funds directly to youth \nin high-poverty urban and rural areas. It concentrates its resources to \nhelp bring fundamental change to the neighborhoods it will serve. It \nemphasizes work and private sector employment. And it is already paid \nfor. Congress provided a $250 million advance appropriation for the \ninitiative last year, contingent upon enactment of this bill.\n\n  One of the principles we had in mind as we drafted the bill is the \nfollowing: we wanted the money and the decision-making power to go down \nto the local level. We wanted this to be a decentralized system. The \nbill achieves that. The governors have a strong role in this system, as \nthey should. Governors write their state plans. They name the statewide \nworkforce partnership. They receive the money on a formula basis. They \nadminister the programs statewide. They have a good deal of \nflexibility.\n  But the local level is just as important. This bill represents a \ncrucial step forward in that respect. Money and decision-making power \nflow down to the local level. The bill includes an in-state formula \nfunding mechanism. Local workforce boards selected by local government \nleaders will make policy at the local level. Local business people, \nlocal elected officials and local citizens are in the best position to \nknow local workforce needs.\n  We received important assistance in drafting the bill from national \norganizations representing different levels of government--the \ngovernors, mayors, state and local elected officials, as well as \ncounties. Our job training system requires coordination and cooperation \namong all levels of goverment. The ``governance coalition'' that \nprovided key advice for us played a vitally helpful role.\n  The Federal Government is providing a lot of money for this system. \nWhat we ask is that it be spent according to certain priorities. We \nbelieve we are correct to establish priorities--a stream of money for \nadults, a stream for dislocated workers, a stream for youth. And we ask \nthat reasonable performance objectives are met. That is another key \nfeature of the bill. We require measurable results. For too many years \nappropriators have correctly asked us, ``how do we know whether the \nprograms are delivering any benefits?'' It is appropriate to require \nmeasurable results. The bill requires states and local workforce boards \nto establish and meet measurable standards for success in placement of \ntrainees in jobs related to the training they received, in wages that \ntrainees receive over 6-month and 12-month periods, and other relevant \nmeasures.\n  In addition to programs for adults, youth and dislocated workers, the \njob training title of the bill also contains renewal of four important \n``national'' job training programs. These are programs currently \nauthorized by the Job Training Partnership Act and operated on a \nnational basis by the Department of Labor, rather than through the job \ntraining infrastructures of the 50 states. One of these is the Job \nCorps program. The Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center in St. Paul is \none of the best-performing Job Corps centers in the nation. Last year \nwe had Ralph DiBattista, former director of that center, as well as \nDave McKenzie, the current director, at our Subcommittee hearing on \nyouth training. They were joined that day by Susan Lees, a very \nimpressive young trainee at the Humphrey Center, at that time on her \nway to becoming an auto technician at a Ford dealership.\n  The Job Corps and other federal employment training programs for the \nnation's youth represent a crucial and cost-effective investment. \nProviding opportunities to youth, especially at-risk youth, is \nabsolutely necessary. Training allows youth to gain the skills they \nneed to be productive, to make the most of their abilities, and \nultimately to support themselves and become fully contributing citizens \nin our economy and society.\n  The bill also renews current national Native American programs, \nMigrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs, and Veterans programs. These \nare key elements of the country's system of helping to ensure that \nthose Americans who need and qualify for training in order to be the \nmost productive workers they can be get the best and most cost-\neffective services that the federal government can provide.\n  I am pleased we were able to make some improvements in the job \ntraining programs in the bill with respect to veterans. As a member of \nthe Veterans Affairs Committee, I wanted to be sure that veterans job \ntraining programs would serve today's veterans. Therefore we updated \nthe program's eligibility provision to ensure that Gulf War veterans \nand other veterans with significant barriers to employment, including \nhomeless veterans, will be served. The managers' amendment also makes \nan improvement for veterans in the bill's state plan section. It will \nrequire that Governors, as they write and implement their state plans, \nprovide reasonable assurances that veterans will receive services on a \nfair basis in state-administered programs.\n  I also am pleased we were able to include in the bill provisions to \ncontinue the authorization and operation of four rural Concentrated \nEmployment Programs (CEPs). These CEPs currently operate in Minnesota, \nKentucky, Montana and Wisconsin. Congress established CEPs in 1964 as \npart of the War on Poverty's Economic Opportunity Act. With the \ncreation of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) \nprogram, Senator Humphrey and Congressman Perkins acted to continue an \nauthorization for the four CEPS I mentioned. When the Job Training \nPartnership Act was passed in 1983, they were continued again. The CEPs \ndo an excellent job serving difficult, high-unemployment rural areas. I \nintend to work hard if necessary to retain this provision in \nconference, although I anticipate no opposition.\n  There are five amendments to the bill which we have agreed to accept. \nThe first of these is by Mr. DeWine. It is the vocational \nrehabilitation bill. The Rehabilitation Act assists well over a million \nAmericans with disabilities annually through comprehensive vocational \nrehabilitation services. It is a crucial and successful set of \nprograms. It embodies the commitment of the federal government and the \nAmerican public to those among us with physical and mental \ndisabilities. I am very satisfied with this set of improvements to that \nAct. Jay Johnson of East Grand Forks, Minnesota testified on behalf of \nthe National Council on Independent Living at a Subcommittee hearing \nlast year. Mr. Johnson is executive director of ``Options,'' a center \nfor independent living in East Grand Forks. I am very proud of the \ndisability community in Minnesota for their advocacy and for their \ndetermination. I think this bill does right by them.\n  The amendment by Mr. Lautenberg gives units of local government which \nare currently service delivery areas under the Job Training Partnership \nAct and which have population of 200,000 or more an automatic right to \nappeal to the Secretary of Labor a decision by a Governor not to \ncontinue that area as an SDA. Without the amendment the bill would give \nunits of local government with a population of 500,000 or more \nautomatic certification to continue as SDAs, whereas those with 200,000 \nor more would be entitled only to an automatic right to request \ncontinuance as SDAs. I consider the amendment by the senator from New \nJersey to be an improvement to the bill, and I intend to support it in \nconference, as well.\n  I do not support either of the amendments offered by my friend from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft. We are accepting them for now, but I hope they \ncan be modified or removed in conference. The first would require that \njob training service recipients be drug tested. It is bad policy. It is \nan unwarranted invasion of privacy. It is wrong because it\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nsends a distasteful message about a presumption regarding Americans who \nbenefit from improving their skills through job training--a presumption \nwhich I hope none of us really holds. And it would drain large amounts \nof money from the program, money which should go to training.\n  The second Ashcroft amendment also is objectionable. It prohibits \nfunds authorized in the bill from funding activities authorized in the \nSchool to Work Act. Our bill does not authorize making grants under the \nSchool to Work Act. But we encourage states and localities to integrate \nand coordinate their vocational education and job training systems. Of \ncourse we want to facilitate lifelong learning and the continual \ndevelopment of productive skills.\n  School to Work Programs have been a great success. They take a new \napproach to learning. They are programs which operate on the idea that \na young person learns best when he or she can apply school-learning to \nlife situations. In March of 1996, I invited a School to Work student \nto Washington to tell his story. Cameron Dick was a student at the \nAmerican Indian Opportunity Industrial Center, one of nine schools in \nthe Phillips area of Minneapolis. Phillips is predominantly poor and \nhas one of the highest concentrations of Native Americans among urban \ncenters in the United States. The American Indian OIC is in its fourth \nyear of a 5-year Urban Opportunity Grant for its School to Work \nprogram. It works with high school dropouts who have decided to give \nhigh school another shot by both educating and training them for jobs. \nThe idea is to ``Get a diploma and get a paycheck.'' Cameron was a high \nschool dropout, but through the OIC program became an A student, \nparticipated in afternoon employment programs and tutored other young \npeople. The programs work.\n  Mr. President, I believe this Congress will succeed where we did not \nduring the last Congress. I am very hopeful that following passage of \nthis bill we can reach an acceptable conference agreement with the \nHouse and that we can then send major, important legislation to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this morning I rise in support of the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act. This bill was unanimously passed \nout of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. It is good and sensible \nlegislation, crafted in a bipartisan fashion. I commend Subcommittee \nChairman DeWine and Senator Wellstone as well as Chairman Jeffords and \nRanking Member Kennedy for their excellent leadership. There is one \nsection in this legislation of particular importance to me; one that I \nbelieve merits special attention. If this body is successful in passing \nS. 1886, this program will benefit greatly. The section I am referring \nto is Job Corps.\n  Job Corps is America's only national residential education and \ntraining program for at risk youths. I emphasize only, Mr. President, \nbecause my colleagues need to be aware that there is no other program \nthat annually assists more than 65,000 of this country's most \ndisadvantaged young men and women to become meaningful and productive \nmembers of society. Job Corps is the largest and most comprehensive \nprogram that offers a second chance to those who would otherwise be \nleft behind. The young men and women who make a commitment to \nthemselves and the Job Corps program deserve our support. This program \nensures them access to educational and vocational training, fully \npreparing them to meet the needs of this country's employers. Indeed, a \nrecent survey of small businesses indicated that a lack of trained \nemployees is the largest current impediment to business growth. As a \nresult, the Job Corps program provides invaluable assistance not only \nto disadvantaged youth, but also to employers and the host communities \nof Job Corps centers, which benefit from community service projects \ncompleted by students.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive Congressional effort to enhance \nall components of the Job Corps program. Great pains have been taken to \ncreate a continuum from the day a Job Corps student is recruited into \nthe program to the day that student starts his or her job, and beyond.\n  Mr. President, let me take a minute to expand on these improvements. \nJob Corps has been and continues to be a model for other education and \ntraining programs. The placement rate of the program is phenomenal: \nthis year over 80% of Job Corps graduates will be placed in good paying \njobs, enter the military, or go onto post-secondary education. The \nperformance measurement standards of Job Corps have long been praised \nfor being thorough and rigorous. These demanding standards have \nstimulated the program's ongoing self-assessment and improvement over \nthe years. Thanks to this legislation, Job Corps' performance standards \ncan serve as a model for other programs. With enactment of this bill, \nall programs under WIPA will be challenged to increase their \nperformance and accountability to achieve the results Job Corps does.\n  Mr. President, support for this legislation will help Job Corps \nbecome even better. First, with this legislation, Job Corps will become \na core partner with one-stop training centers, making sure that every \nyoung, disadvantaged person walking into a neighborhood one-stop site \nwill learn about this program and know it is an option. If the young \nperson is ready to commit to his or her future, pledging not to drink \nor take drugs, the program is ready to offer an intensive, self-paced, \nstate of the art education and training. Second, every Job Corps campus \nwill form partnerships with the private sector in order to develop \ntraining programs suitable for available, local employment; identify \njob opportunities for students; and help integrate the Job Corps campus \nand facilities into the fabric of a community. Third, a stringent \nprocess will be put in place to ensure that poor performing centers are \nquickly identified and offered help to improve their performance. \nFinally, every year, Congress will receive a report on the program's \nperformance that will include how many students graduated from each \ncenter and from which trade, how many were employed, their wages when \nhired, and what these students are making a year later. This kind of \ninformation will be instrumental to make sure we improve upon the \nsuccess that has been Job Corps' for more than 30 years.\n  Mr. President, in the Administration's current budget President \nClinton has followed the initiative taken by Congress last year to \nmoderately expand the program. Support for such expansion was \ndemonstrated overwhelmingly when forty-one of my colleagues joined me \nin a letter to Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Specter and Ranking \nMember Harkin in support of this budget increase. Job Corps gains this \nbreadth of support in Congress because Members are aware of the \npositive impact it has on literally millions of lives. This legislation \nimproves upon a program with a demonstrated record of success. \nTherefore, Members can be confident that the program will continue to \nserve more disadvantaged young people with as high a rate of success. \nIt is my hope, Mr. President, that soon the Job Corps program will \nbecome truly national, with a center in every state of our nation. My \nhome state of Rhode Island is currently involved in the application \nprocess for a center. Our Governor, local elected officials, employers, \neducational institutions, and civic organizations have all committed to \ndeveloping a high-performance center in our state. I have been actively \nworking on the federal level to assist them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy \nlegislation.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 2329, as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the hearings that the Senate Finance \nCommittee has been conducting on the Internal Revenue Service--the \nadjectives that have been used to describe it are ``startling,'' \n``stunning,'' ``unbelievable.'' I do believe most of the American \npublic who have seen this unfold before their eyes are aghast at some \nof the assertions and allegations that have been made.\n  Recently, I became very concerned that the IRS was still conducting \nrandom audits. They indicated to me that they were not. So I asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to verify to me that random audits were not a \ntool of the Internal Revenue Service. A report was issued dated \nFebruary 1998: ``Report to the Honorable Paul Coverdell, U.S. Senate, \nTax Administration, IRS Use of Random Selection in Choosing Tax Returns \nfor Audits.''\n  On page 2, at the very top, it says, ``IRS officials did identify 6 \nprojects involving subpopulations of taxpayers with indications of \nnoncompliance from which taxpayers were randomly selected for audit.'' \nLet me repeat that--``from which taxpayers were randomly selected for \naudit.''\n  I made a public statement of deep concern about the fact I had been \nadvised they were not and the General Accounting Office said they were. \nOn the same occasion, on or about early March, the Internal Revenue \nService issued an interim memorandum to its employees, and they quote \nme saying the disclosures ``are a result of General Accounting Office \nreview requested by myself to examine random audits.''\n  Then they told their employees that during fiscal years 1994 through \n1996, ``the IRS did not randomly select returns for audit from either \nthe population of all taxpayers or all returns. IRS has about 40 audit \nsources which are programs and techniques used to select potentially \nnoncompliant returns for audit. IRS audit sources do not rely on random \nselection from the population of all returns but IRS selects returns \nhaving characteristics indicative of potential noncompliance.''\n  Here is the key point, right here in the publication from the IRS. \nThere are three little dots, and then it says, ``No taxpayers outside \nof these six subpopulations were selected at random for audit.'' Dot \ndot dot.\n  Mr. President, the ``dot dot dot'' is this sentence: ``IRS officials \ndid identify six projects involving subpopulations of taxpayers with \nindications of noncompliance from which taxpayers were randomly \naudited,'' Dot dot dot.\n  Now, the tax system is complicated beyond belief. Everybody knows the \nstory where they gave a similar family to 50 accountants. It was an \nexercise that some major publication went through. They all turned them \nin. Not one of the 50 turned it in the same way, and not one of them \nwas correct.\n  So it is easy to make administrative errors. I have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, ``dot dot dot'' is not an administrative oversight. ``Dot \ndot dot'' left out this sentence intentionally. It quoted everything \nelse in the paragraph but left that sentence out.\n  If the American taxpayers did that, they would be in deep trouble. \nThis is why there is no credibility anymore. They just don't have any \ncredibility. There are a lot of good folks over there. I have met them; \nI know of them. A lot of them have been very cooperative with our \noffice trying to solve problems. But there is just no credibility. It \nis this kind of behavior--in fact, this is sort of tame.\n  It is this kind of occasion that has caused an outraged population to \ncall on a Congress to do something bold, to bring this kind of behavior \nunder control.\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what is going to happen in this \nCongress. The IRS is not going to be the same institution by the end of \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senator from Ohio will be here momentarily \nand we will hear from him regarding his hearings on the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have now been joined by my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, who was talking to me moments ago \nabout hearings he held in his own home State. I yield up to 15 minutes \nto the Senator from Ohio for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for \nholding this session where we have a chance to talk about the problems \nconnected with the IRS. He has been a true leader in this issue.\n  This is a matter of great importance and interest to the taxpayers \nacross this country. Mr. President, it is becoming clearer every day \nthat we simply have to reform the IRS. The facts of IRS abuse are, by \nnow, well known. As the hearings continue, we get more information \nevery single day. The essential facts are very disturbing.\n  In 1996, the IRS answered only 20 percent of its phone calls.\n  An IRS report released in January of this year showed that one out of \nevery four IRS revenue officers and supervisors felt pressured to \nachieve enforcement goals. Tax collection statistics were used to \nevaluate the performance of employees--and the district offices were \nranked on how much taxes they collected--collected from us.\n  In 1993, the IRS gave incorrect information to taxpayers a stunning \n8.5 million times. In 1987, the GAO said that 47% of the calls to the \nIRS resulted in incorrect information.\n  A recent survey actually found that one out of two Americans would \nrather be mugged than audited.\n\n\n                           maureen schaeffer\n\n  I recently held a hearing in Toledo on the issue of IRS reform and \ntax reform. One of the witnesses was Maureen Schaeffer, from Lakewood, \nOhio.\n  Maureen told us she was married for twenty years to an abusive, \nalcoholic husband. He was the sole wage earner and handled all of their \ntax matters, and she signed all of their joint tax returns. She worked \nin the home, raising their seven children and caring for his invalid \nmother. After twenty years of marriage, Maureen realized the negative \nimpact that he was having on their children--so she filed for divorce. \nAt the time of the divorce, Maureen knew that her ex-husband was being \naudited by the IRS, and in the settlement agreement reached between \nthem the ex-husband assumed responsibility for all back taxes.\n  In the summer of 1996, the ex-husband filed for bankruptcy. His only \ncreditors were his ex-wife--Maureen--and the IRS. Shortly after the \nfiling of the bankruptcy, Maureen was notified by the IRS that she owed \n$150,000 to the IRS. One week later, the IRS gave her\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\nanother notice--this time to inform her that she owed an additional \n$100,000. She contacted the IRS's taxpayer advocate's office in the \nNorthern District of Ohio. She was told that they would contact her \nafter they looked into her case. When she did not hear back from them, \nshe called back, only to be told that they were not allowed to work on \nher case.\n  In February 1997, the IRS seized the funds in Maureen's Individual \nRetirement Account. Seizing this money would settle the back taxes and \npenalties owed--but it would also create an additional tax liability \nfor Maureen--because she will now owe taxes on the early, although \nforced, withdrawal of her IRA funds.\n  Last year, Maureen attended the Problem Resolution day in Cleveland, \nsponsored by the IRS.\n  Problem Resolution Day was an effort on the part of the IRS to be \nmore taxpayer-friendly--an opportunity for taxpayers to discuss their \nproblems with IRS employees who had the power to take care of the \nproblems.\n  But when she asked the IRS, ``Why did you let my ex-husband get away \nwith this for all of these years?'' the IRS representative responded \nthat ``you are easier to get money from.''\n  Mr. President, that response by the IRS reflects an attitude we need \nto change. We need an IRS that shares the values held by hard-working \ntax-paying Americans. And that's what the bill developed by the \nChairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth, would accomplish.\n  If Congress passes Chairman Roth's bill, future spouses would not \nhave to face the kind of nightmare experience Maureen Schaeffer had to \ndeal with. The bill provides for proportionate liability for spouses. \nInnocent spouses could choose to avoid joint and several liability--and \nbe liable only for tax attributable to their own income. The bill also \nincludes a provision to waive the 10% addition to tax for early \nwithdrawal from an IRA or other qualified plan when it is used to \naddress tax liability.\n\n\n                             james sulewski\n\n  At our hearing in Toledo, we also heard the testimony of James \nSulewski. Mr. Sulewski is a former IRS criminal investigator who is now \na tax attorney in private practice--and he is a man with tremendous \ninsight into the workings of the IRS.\n  He was particularly concerned with some of the criteria on which IRS \nemployees are evaluated. One of the criteria is how long a particular \ncase is in their hands. In his opinion, this causes many employees to \ndevelop what he called a ``hot potato response.'' In this case, the \nemployee gathers the minimal amount of information necessary to move \nthe case off of his or her desk. As a result, cases are often passed on \nthree to five times before they are resolved, when--in many cases--they \ncould have been resolved by the first employee to see the file. This is \na major problem, because when these cases are not resolved at an early \nstage, they end up going to Tax Court.\n  In Mr. Sulewski's practice, he has had approximately 100 cases that \nhave gone to Tax Court, yet only one case has gone to trial. Clearly, \nthese are--very often--matters that do not need to go to Tax Court.\n  Fifty percent of the cases going to Tax Court could have been settled \nbeforehand--if employees did not have this pressure to move the file \noff of their desk.\n\n\n                             Joseph welton\n\n  Now let me describe the testimony of Joseph Welton. He and his wife \nfiled their taxes on time for tax year 1995. Two months aftr filing, \nthe Weltons received a refund check in the amount of $1,943.00 and a \nletter from the IRS stating that they had overpaid their taxes. Mr. \nWelton was surprised to receive the refund so he called the IRS to \ncheck on it. The IRS employee told him that they were in fact, due a \nrefund, so the Weltons cashed the check and spent the money. Several \nmonths later they received a letter from the IRS stating that the \nrefund was erroneous and that they needed to repay the money within 30 \ndays. The Weltons entered an installment agreement with the IRS and \nthey are now repaying the IRS at a rate of $55\n  As of July 1997 they have paid the IRS $330.00. Of that amount, \n$79.33 was applied for penalty, $124.17 was applied to interest and \n$126.50 was applied to principal. Mr. Welton, understandably, objects \nto the penalty that he is charged every month.\n  Let me note, Mr. President, that his complaint has been addressed in \nChairman Roth's legislation. Specifically, there is a provision in the \nbill that would eliminate the failure to pay penalty while the taxpayer \nis in an installment agreement.\n\n\n                               tax reform\n\n  Mr. President, my hearing in Toledo focused not just on reforming the \nway the IRS does business, but on fundamental reform of the tax code \nitself.\n  Let me say that as I travel my home State of Ohio--I am sure my \ncolleague from Georgia has the same experience in Georgia--there is a \ntremendous amount of interest in meaningful and true and legitimate, \nfundamental Tax Code reform.\n  I was pleased to hear from a number of Ohioans who offered their \nviews on how to make the tax code simpler, and less burdensome on \nfamilies.\n  We heard from Terry McClure, a thirty-five year old farmer from \nPaulding County, Ohio. With his father, he operates a 2,500 acre farm \nraising soybeans, corn and wheat. The farm has been in his family for \nfive generations. Terry and his family are understandably concerned \nwith the difficulty of passing the farm on to future generations \nwithout losing large parts of it to the estate tax. They, like so many \nfamily farmers, would like to pass the farmland on to their children \nand their grandchildren. However, because the farm acreage is their \nlargest asset, the effect of the estate tax will be devastating.\n  We also heard the testimony of Robert Koerner, the former president \nand general manager of Koerner Farms--a 300-cow dairy farm in Williams \nCounty. Robert Koerner and his brother owned the farming operations \njointly, until his brother's family wanted to sell their half of the \nbusiness. Most of the land had been held for a long time, so there were \nappreciable capital gains on the property. As a result of the tax \nconsequences of the sale, Mr. Koerner was unable to purchase the half \nof the business being sold by his brother.\n  Mr. Koerner testified that his family would still be in the farming \nbusiness if not for the tax code. This is nothing less than a tragic \nsituation--one that will only be repeated unless we in Congress take \nfurther steps to reform inheritance taxes.\n  Edd Auld is the Vice President and General Manager of ROCO Courier & \nDelivery, Inc. in Toledo. He testified that the tax code is so \ncomplicated and time-consuming that he finds he is unable to comply \nwith it on his own. As a result, he is required to hire an outside \naccountant each year so that the business can be in compliance. The \namount that he has spent on accounting firms over the years would have \npaid for an additional two delivery trucks that would generate an \nadditional $75,000 to $100,000 in income each year--which would have \ncreated new jobs and additional tax revenue for the government, new \njobs for Ohio and for our country would have been created.\n\n\n                            The Reform Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I found our Toledo hearing both valuable and \ninformative. The witnesses told us what it's like for hard-working, \ntax-paying families to live with the IRS and under today's tax code. \nThey want change, and we owe it to them to get the process of change \nunder way. The first installment of this process of change is \nrepresented by the important legislation sponsored by Chairman Roth.\n  But let me stress that it's just the beginning. There are a number of \nvery interesting ideas on how to reform the tax code. We should \ncontinue to explore these ideas, and discuss them with the American \npeople. The taxpayers of this country know that the tax code is too \ncomplex and too costly--and they want to replace it with a tax code \nthat is fair, simple, and honest.\n  Perhaps the simplest way to overhaul the IRS would be to overhaul the \ntax code itself. Taxpayers spend nearly $157 billion a year to comply \nwith the tax code. The tax code also costs the taxpayer a great deal of \ntime not to mention a great deal of anguish, and a great deal of \nworry--it costs Americans an estimated 5.4 billion hours just to comply \nwith the code.\n  The 1040 EZ form--the least complicated of all tax forms--requires 31\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\npages of instructions! The Internal Revenue Code has over 5.5 million \nwords of law and regulations--and the IRS sends out 8 billion pages of \nforms and instructions each year. And the tax code keeps getting more \ncomplicated.\n  The bottom line is we have a tax code that Americans rightly believe \nis complex, unfair, confusing and perhaps even dishonest. These are \nsome of the reasons I am a cosponsor of the Tax Code Termination Act--\nwhich would sunset the tax code at the end of 2001, permitting the \nCongress to write a tax code that is simple--fair--and honest.\n  I look forward to working on this issue throughout this session, and \nin the years ahead, in the hope that the result will be a tax system \nthat truly represents the values of the American people.\n  Let me again thank my colleague from Georgia for putting this block \nof time together so that we can come to the floor today in the U.S. \nSenate to talk about an issue that genuinely concerns all Americans, \nconcerns the people of the State of Ohio, and the people of Georgia. It \nis something, Mr. President, that I think Congress should heed the \nwords of the American people on --``It is time for change.''\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks by the Senator \nfrom Ohio. He has had a busy morning. I want to take just a second to \ncompliment him on his work in terms of the workplace that he described \nhere this morning. This is a piece of legislation about very \ncomplicated Federal programs which passed out of the committee \nunanimously by every Republican and every Democrat. It is a real credit \nto the tenacity of the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes, again, on this question of \nthe overhaul of the IRS to my good colleague, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President,\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for arranging for \ntime to talk about something that, of course, is probably as important \nto Americans as any issue, and it is probably good to talk about it \nshortly after the 15th of April. It is on our minds, and should be.\n  So I am delighted that we are aimed towards doing something next \nweek, doing something that almost everyone agrees needs to be done; \nthat is, to make some adjustment in the system of collection of taxes; \nsome adjustments with the IRS. Everyone knows that it is needed. But it \nhas been needed for a good long time, yet we have not done anything. We \nhave not done anything about it. We now have had, of course, hearings \nthat have gone on for some time both in the House and in the Senate, \nwhich have brought to the attention of every one of the American people \nand to Members of Congress the need to make change. And, hopefully, \nthat will happen. Up until now it seems to me, this agency, as is the \ncase with many agencies, has sort of insulated themselves from public \nopinion and has sort of set themselves aside from the mainstream of \nAmerica. Frankly, that is relatively easy to do in a bureaucracy. It \nseems to me that is one of the reasons that we need somehow to get more \nnonbureaucratic input into this system.\n  Do we need to collect taxes? Of course, we do. Are our tax collectors \never popular? Of course not. But nevertheless there is a way to do this \njob that is more accountable to taxpayers. That is what we seek.\n  I have been working very hard at a number of agencies. One of the \nthings that strikes me in terms of what goes on in government as \nopposed to the private sector is there is really no built-in \ndiscipline. In the private sector you are competing with somebody. If \nyou do not do the job, somebody else does it. So you are required to be \nrelatively efficient, or else someone takes the work. You are required \nto please the people you serve, or they go somewhere else. Of course, \nthat is not the case in government, and particularly in the case of the \nIRS.\n  I think it is important that we do this. I have been involved in \ntrying to take activities that could better be done by contract and by \nindividuals in the private sector in all parts of government. But I \nhave to tell you that this is one that has insulated itself a great \ndeal. We need to do something about it.\n  We find the same kind of threatening, the same kind of criminal \nintimidation going on in HCFA, in health care at the moment; trying to \ndo something about fraud and abuse, which everyone supports. But the \nidea of challenging people, to threaten people, to intimidate people \ninto doing it is not the best resolution. But that is not the best \nanswer. So we need to find a way to do that.\n\n  In my opinion, the underlying issue, of course, is the Tax Code. One \nof the problems that IRS has is to enforce a very complicated, \nconvoluted, excessively voluminous and detailed Tax Code, and we need \nto change that. I think almost everyone, again, is for that change, but \ninterestingly enough, as you talk about how specifically do you change \nit, then you find less unanimity. But changing the Tax Code is one \nthing that we must do which will help in the tax collection but it \nisn't the only thing. We also need to make changes in IRS, and that is \nwhat this is about.\n  So there will be lots of ideas. The committee has a bill ready to go. \nThe House has passed a bill. I think we will find there will be \ndifferent views as to how best to do it. But I hope that we are driven, \nand I think we will be, by a vision of what we want the results to be, \nand then implement what it takes to cause those results to be \ndifferent. Again, in the case of government, as opposed to often in the \nprivate sector, we are not result driven. We do not measure it by what \nit is we want to accomplish. We simply measure the process. And that \nends up not doing what we would like to do.\n  I think it is fair to say the IRS is out of control. The hearings we \nhave had certainly would substantiate that. I do not think many people \nwould argue with it. We have to do something that will cause the IRS to \nbe more accountable to taxpayers. And this goal is too important to be \npartisan. Hopefully, it will not be. I hope we do not find ourselves \nsmothered with extraneous amendments with other kinds of ideas. I think \nwe ought to focus on how we make this IRS collection business work \nbetter and not be diverted by using this bill for lots of other things.\n  I think we also need to recognize that IRS reform is a part of a \nchanging tax culture that is maturing, I believe, in this country, \ncertainly is maturing here. And this is one of the components of \nchanging this whole tax scene in which we live, making it simpler, \nfrankly, reducing taxes and making the collection a system that is \nconsumer friendly and at the same time enforces the law. I think we \nhave to recognize that that is what is done.\n  So our agenda is simple and should, indeed, be simple. We have to \nensure that the IRS serves the American people and not the other way \naround. That is our task. We need to consider this legislation of \nrestructuring. Again, it is sort of interesting that as you seek to \nmake some changes to produce different results in government, it is \nvery difficult; the reaction you get almost generally is: Oh, things \nare OK. We don't need to change anything.\n  There is no incentive to change in the bureaucracy. And that is what \nmakes it difficult. I am hopeful that we can move to do some of these \nthings. We need to give people outside the bureaucracy some oversight \nof the enforcement so that when you bring in the view of citizens, you \nbring in the view of people with expertise, so that, in fact, it can be \nmade a part of the bureaucracy which doesn't automatically exist.\n  We need to require the termination of employees who have been \ninvolved in offenses, just like you do in every other business, like \nyou do in every other activity. We need to hold managers responsible \nand accountable. We should do that. It doesn't seem like a strange \nthing, but it is difficult. The people who are supervisors, who are in \nfact responsible to see that the job is done and done in the proper \nfashion, need to be held accountable to do that and, of course, have \nthe authority to do it as well.\n\n  We need to change the burden of proof in Tax Courts, putting it on \nthe IRS, not on the taxpayer. We need to protect innocent spouses who \nare\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\ncaught up in some kind of marital dilemma in which the spouse is \nentirely outside of that income but becomes involved. We need to \nextend, I suspect, the executive privilege beyond the same type that \napplies to lawyers to accountants and to other tax practitioners so \nthat we have a way for people to be able to communicate among those who \nare helping them without causing that to be part of the problem.\n  I hope this next week is productive, as we think it will be; that we \ncan come up with some real management principles that will convert this \ntask, this necessary task of tax collection into one that is more \ncustomer friendly, that is more accountable, indeed, is more effective \nand has the impact of getting this job done without the kind of \noffensive activities we have seen happen.\n  I appreciate the time. I appreciate Senator Coverdell setting it up, \nand I would like to yield to my good friend and associate from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. I thank my senior Senator. It is kind of \nWyoming day, talking about the need for IRS reform.\n  I do rise this morning in support of H.R. 2676, which is the Internal \nRevenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 that was passed by \nthe House.\n  That document, of course, has been taken by the Senate and improved \nbased on the hearings that were held last year and are currently going \non here.\n  By passing legislation to reform the IRS, Congress will take an \nimportant step in reforming what many Americans believe to be the most \nfeared agency in the United States. This bill will overhaul the IRS \norganizational structure. It will provide necessary protections for \nAmerican taxpayers, and it will require greater accountability for our \nemployees, the IRS employees. There has been tremendous support in this \nbody for making a change. We talked about it at the end of last year \nwhen we were appalled at the hearings that were going on at that time. \nI hope people are tuning into the hearings that are going on now to see \nthe real-life examples of what can happen with a bureaucracy out of \ncontrol.\n  For any who are interested in the details of the hearings, I have a \nweb site, as do many of the Senators. That web site the day after the \nhearings posts the testimony from those hearings. We are keeping \ncareful track of it. There are a number of documents that people would \nbe interested in reading that have some summaries of it. I have one in \nmy hand called ``The Lowlights of Today's IRS Testimony,'' that even \ntalks about a manager being pulled at gunpoint from a shower by the \nIRS. I know that the American public is keeping up on this. I know my \ncolleagues are keeping up on this. I am convinced that there will be \nsomething significant done to get the IRS under control.\n  The IRS Reform Act will overhaul the organizational structure of the \nIRS. In order for any organization to perform its function well, it is \nnecessary for it to know its mission. When I was in the Wyoming State \nLegislature, we passed an act that forced strategic planning by all of \nthe agencies, one of the most valuable things we have done. We forced \nthem to say what it was they were trying to do. And then we asked them \nhow can we tell if you get it done?\n  That process was so valuable that in a 3-week period we changed our \nbudgeting process to a balanced budget, a new record for the State of \nWyoming. I was so excited about what happened there that I talked about \nhaving that happen in Washington. I have to tell you that I was \ndelighted when I got here when I found out that Congress had already \npassed a Government Performance and Results Act. That is an act which \nsays to all of the agencies tell us what you do and tell us how we can \ntell if you got it done--measurable goals, prioritized goals, goals \nthat are reflected in a budget for the agency so that what they say \nthey are doing is really what they are spending their money on. I \ndidn't feel there was a lot of emphasis on this new program, and a lot \nof dissension by the agencies, so I did some field trips just after the \nfirst of the year. I went to a number of the agencies that had these \nGovernment performance and results plans, and asked some more questions \njust to emphasize a little bit whether they really understood what it \nwas we were trying to get at, the question of how do we know if you got \nit done?\n\n  One of the agencies that I went to was the Internal Revenue Service. \nI don't think there is even the beginning of the numbers to be able to \ntell what they have done so they can tell if they are getting better. \nQuite frankly, from the testimony that we have heard, we don't want \nthem getting better.\n  We talked a little bit about the telephone conversations that they \nhave. This is not as drastic stuff as was covered in the hearings. This \nis some normal stuff that people run into when they are trying to get \nanswers from the IRS. You call them up. A guy answers the phone on the \nother end and he tells you the answer to your question. You use that \ninformation and you have no backup for it, so if somebody later says \nthat it is wrong, you are hung out to dry. It is your problem.\n  I suggested maybe there ought to be written confirmations sent when \nthey give us an opinion, something that we can attach to our tax \ndocument and save until that horrible day of an audit. And then we can \nsay, ``No, no, the IRS agent told me this. This is the data I relied on \nto file my taxes.''\n  We talked about error notices. I don't know how many people have \ngotten error notices, but if you do, you get this computer-generated \nform that says: You have the following problem. And then a series of \ncodes. And you can take another document that is multiple pages and \nlook at it and figure out, perhaps, from that code, what you may or may \nnot have done wrong.\n  What a way to run a business. We have computers. This thing is \ncomputer generated. The computer could look up the actual reason if it \nwas keyed in there and list explicitly what they thought you had done \nwrong so you would have ample notice of what the potential problem was, \ninstead of that fear of being a criminal, for the days that you wait \nuntil you meet the IRS person, who then asks you a series of irrelevant \nquestions that you could have had exact answers for, could have maybe \neven submitted them by mail.\n  Then there is the problem of dollar thresholds. I had one client who \nhad a 58-cent difference on $2 million worth of reporting and it took 3 \nmonths and 10 letters to clear up that discrepancy. I don't know how \nmuch the IRS expected to make off of a 58-cent error, but I can tell \nyou that their postage on the first letter almost cost them more than \nwhat they were trying to correct. Not very good management.\n  We talked about random audits that the Senator from Georgia addressed \nearlier. They also assured me they were not doing random audits but had \nthis terrible conflict because they cannot tell without random audits \nhow much money they are not collecting. They want to be able to go into \npeople's documents, who they have absolutely no reason to suspect of \nany errors at all, and review absolutely every detail of their \ndocuments and force them to get detailed documents to back up things \nthat we never require detailed documents for when you are filing your \ntax return. They wanted to look through absolutely everything of your \npersonal life to see if maybe you didn't file something so they can see \nwhat the estimated error is of taxes not collected. That is an \nabomination. Why do we want to know exactly how much, within a few \npennies, people did not pay? Their job is to collect the money that was \nnot paid, finding the biggest offenders first. That is a very specific \ntask that auditors do regularly. Auditors figure out who the potential \nworst people are, and that is from a very prescribed set of criteria \nthat give them indications that somebody may have made errors on their \ntaxes. Most of the time those would prove to not be true, because \nsometimes people really do have unusual expenditures. They really do \nhave unusual business expenses. But when they do, they have to answer \nto the IRS. That is a legitimate audit. But not a random one, going \nthrough documents and details that nobody ever anticipated needing to \ndredge up or being required to get in advance.\n\n  I have to say I think the new Commissioner brings a management \nperspective instead of a tax perspective,\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\ninstead of an ``audit the people'' aspect, and I look forward to \nchanges that will be made on that basis.\n  I also asked the IRS if they were doing anything to suggest \nsimplification of the Tax Code. This was a huge revelation to me. We \nhave a Paperwork Reduction Act in the United States. It says that every \nGovernment agency is supposed to be figuring out how to reduce the \npaperwork that you have to do--reduce the paperwork. I even checked to \nsee who generates the most paperwork. It was no surprise. Seventy-five \npercent of all paperwork for Government agencies is taxes. You know \nthat if you fill out your forms. There are huge numbers of taxes.\n  We had a couple of suggestions for ways that we thought there might \nbe just an additional little explanation right on the tax form, so \npeople would understand what they were filling out. Better there, \ninstead of going through pages of documents. The EZ-1040 form has a 33-\npage instruction manual, and you still have to be an accountant to \nunderstand that instruction manual.\n  I thought maybe just a couple of little additions right there on the \npage would help people to get the answer and to get it right and to get \nit easier. That is where the big revelation comes in. The Paperwork \nReduction Act is based solely on numbers of lines that are removed from \ndocuments. That is what you get your credit for and that is all you get \ncredit for. So there is no incentive whatsoever to make a form more \nunderstandable if it increases the number of lines by even one, not a \nbit of incentive. In fact, there is a disincentive to do that. That is \nwhy you find the huge documents explaining the taxes that accompany \nwhat are considered to be relatively simple forms. There is a lot of \nroom for improvement there yet.\n  I am not putting all the blame on the IRS on this. There is a \ndifficulty with the tax structure and it is up to Congress to get that \ntax structure changed. It needs to be easier. It needs to be fairer.\n  Our taxes right now are based on kind of a policy. It is a policy \nthat gets put together as another person explains a policy to us. We \nhave to decide whether we are going to go with policy or just \ncollecting money. Just collecting money is a lot easier. I suggest, if \nwe are going to have a tax policy, we ought to really have a tax policy \nand sit down and have that debate and talk about whether we are trying \nto promote the American dream and have strong families and have home \nownership and encourage investment and savings and encourage small \nbusiness. And we can do that through a Tax Code. And I really think we \ncan do that through a Tax Code and make the Tax Code simple. And we \nhave to do that.\n  Right now we talk about stronger families and then we penalize \nmarriages; we discourage parents from raising their own children; and \nwe only give big business a health care tax break. We put the American \npeople in a tax trap. You have to work longer and harder to pay your \ntaxes, and if you work longer and harder, you have more taxes you have \nto pay. We do have to find a way to make filing easier, and that means \nfewer forms, that means fewer instructions, that means less chance for \nmaking a mistake, and that has to mean less chance for an audit. If you \nare audited, we have to have the IRS under control so that the taxpayer \nis the person who is in control, not the one who feels like they are \ngoing to jail.\n\n  The IRS reform bill makes some important structural changes, which, I \nbelieve, will help to focus the agency's mission. This legislation \ncreates a separate board to oversee the management and operations of \nthe IRS.\n  This board will include six ``private life'' experts who will bring \ntheir collective private-sector experience to such tasks as reviewing \nand approving the agency's strategic plans and budget requests to make \nsure everything matches up. The board will also have ``big picture'' \nauthority over IRS enforcement and collection activities. Board members \nwould not, however, be permitted to intervene in particular tax \ndisputes. Moreover, in order to ensure the agency's autonomy from \nimproper influence, these board members would be governed by conflict \nof interest restrictions. I believe this new board, which will be \ncomprised largely of people with experience in the private sector, will \nhelp the agency meet better the needs and the concerns of the agency's \ncustomers--America's taxpayers.\n  The IRS reform legislation provides important safeguards for American \ntaxpayers. For too long, the IRS has filled the roles of judge, jury \nand executioner in collection actions against taxpayers. This Reform \nAct would shift the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in \nmost court proceedings as long as the taxpayer introduces credible \nevidence relevant to determining his or her income tax liability.\n  It would also place the burden of proof on the IRS in determining \nwhether penalties should be imposed. The bill expands the taxpayer's \nability to collect attorney's fees when the IRS brings unwarranted \nactions against them and allows taxpayers to recover civil damages from \nan IRS employee if he is negligent in the collection actions.\n  Taxpayers may also recover attorney's fees in civil actions against \nthe IRS when the IRS engages in unauthorized browsing or disclosure of \ntaxpayer information. It would also provide substantial relief for \ninnocent spouses in collection actions based on past joint returns by \nallowing the spouses to be liable only for tax attributable to their \nincome. No one should be liable for taxes they couldn't possibly know \nabout.\n  Many of the taxpayer protection provisions in the Reform Act are a \ndirect result of the abuses uncovered last year by the Senate Finance \nCommittee hearings. Many people were shocked to learn that a number of \nthe due-process protections Americans take for granted in other legal \nproceedings do not apply to actions involving the IRS. This bill \ncorrects many of those injustices.\n  Once this bill becomes law, the IRS will be required to provide \nnotice to taxpayers 30 days before the Service files a notice of \nFederal tax lien. A taxpayer would then have 30 days to request a \nhearing from the IRS appeals. No collection activity would be allowed \nuntil after the hearing. The taxpayer would likewise be able to \npetition the Tax Court to contest the appeals decision.\n  Finally, the communications privilege now granted only to attorneys \nwould be extended to accountants. That means you could ask your \naccountant a question about your taxes, and when he gave that answer, \nyou could rely on it not being passed directly on to the IRS. He would \nbe in your corner for sure. It needs to be that way. We have to change \nsome other agencies, too. People are afraid to ask the EPA about \npotential pollution problems because they don't want to be fined. They \njust want to stop the problem and correct it if there really is one. \nBut we have this Government fear of asking a question for fear that it \nwill come down on us with penalties and unusual actions by a Government \nagency. The same thing happens with OSHA. If there is a safety problem, \nyou don't want to ask OSHA for sure, because it might just result in \npenalties, not even an answer. That is the problem we have with \nGovernment.\n\n  This would make the questions that you ask your accountant your \nquestions and your information, and you could feel secure that it would \nnot be the subject of the penalties by the IRS. This change would \nprovide taxpayers with the necessary confidentiality and communications \nwith their tax preparers whether or not they are licensed attorneys. I \nbelieve these changes will help rein in many of the intimidation \ntactics used to target unsuspecting taxpayers.\n  Lastly, the IRS reform bill will demand greater accountability from \nthe 100,000 employees who work for IRS. It requires all IRS notices and \ncorrespondence to include the name, the phone number, and address of \nthe IRS employee whom the taxpayer should contact regarding the notice. \nMoreover, this bill requires the IRS to maintain complaints of any \nemployee misconduct on an individual employee basis. Individuals will \nbe responsible for their own actions. It won't just be passed off as an \nIRS problem. It will prohibit the IRS from labeling individual \ntaxpayers as ``illegal tax protesters'' and maintaining lists of these \nindividuals.\n  The IRS will also have to disclose to taxpayers in simple terms the \ncriteria\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\nand procedures for selecting the taxpayer for audit. I believe this \nwill decrease the ability of the IRS to target innocent taxpayers and \nsmall businesses for audits.\n  Mr. President, the IRS Reform Act will go a long way in reforming our \nGovernment's tax collection practices. By returning customer service \nand accountability to the IRS, this legislation helps ensure that the \nAmerican taxpayers will be treated with the decency and respect they \ndeserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the IRS \nRestructuring Reform Act. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, \nwhose professional experience on these matters is evident in his \npresentation. He makes an eloquent case for the reforms that are \nencompassed in the legislation to be offered by Chairman Bill Roth, \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  Both the Senator from Wyoming and I have talked about random audits \nand our dismay about them being conducted by the IRS. A random audit is \nlike Russian roulette. A random audit means the IRS, even though your \nreturn reflects no discrepancy, can reach in, pick it out with no cause \nand suddenly be banging on your door. This ought not to happen in \nAmerica. The IRS should not be conducting random audits.\n  I introduced legislation last week that will prohibit the use of \nrandom audits. We are told they are not being conducted, but they are. \nSo we are going to legislate so they do not. I am very hopeful that at \nthe end of the day, the work of the Senator from Wyoming, myself, and \nothers will address the issue of random audits in the final \nlegislation.\n  This report that I received from the General Accounting Office shows \nthat 47 percent of these random audits were occurring in 11 Southern \nStates--47 percent in 11 Southern States. That only represents 29 \npercent of our population, and that 85 percent of the random audits \nwere directed at people who make $25,000 or less--$25,000 or less.\n  The first suspicion one has is, ``Well, there's a person who can't \ndefend himself.''\n  I have come to know over the years a gentleman at Georgia State \nUniversity who is a pioneer in tax clinics. There are very few of them \nin the country, but he got a Federal grant several years ago and got \none started. They use university students to help low-income people who \nhave had trouble with the IRS. They have 300 clients. He is a wonderful \ngentleman. We just rewarded and honored him recently. His name is Ron \nBlasi.\n  He appeared at a hearing we had, Mr. President. This is what he said:\n\n       Among those low-income taxpayers represented before the IRS \n     by tax clinic volunteers--\n\n  Those are his volunteers; they do this for nothing--\n\n     80 percent at the end paid less than the IRS claim called \n     for.\n\n  Eighty percent.\n  That is not a very good record. And 8 out of 10--wham--who get hit \nwith this audit hammer do not owe the taxes. So you have taken that \ntaxpayer who has the least ability to complete the form--no \naccountants, no lawyers, trying to do it themselves--and you make them \nthe target of random audits.\n  He goes on to say--this was a story in the Marietta Daily Journal--\n\n       Auditing ``pits one of the most powerful agencies in the \n     federal government against people who don't have the \n     resources to defend themselves,'' said Blasi, who added that \n     each year nearly 20,000 low-income taxpayers in metro Atlanta \n     receive audit notices.\n\n  I asked him in the hearing--I said, ``What is the effect of that \naudit notice on these people?'' He said, ``Chilling and frightening, \nbecause they really don't know where to go. And often because they have \nno resources, they only get in deeper and deeper trouble because they \nreally don't know how to deal with this agency.'' He said, ``Most of \nthese people end up paying more taxes than they really owe if they \ndon't have legal representation.''\n  This is very discomforting. First of all, we said, ``Do you conduct \nrandom audits?'' And they said, ``No, we don't.'' And the General \nAccounting Office said, ``Yes, you do.'' Then in a memorandum to their \nown employees, they misquote the General Accounting Office and leave \nout the statement that says they do random audits. And then the General \nAccounting Office says, ``And the target is low-income people. They're \nthe principal target of the random audits.''\n  And you have three chances more of being audited in the State of \nGeorgia than many of the other States. Well, we have very rural and \npoor areas in our part of the country.\n  At the end of the day, by the end of the 105th Congress, Mr. \nPresident, you will not recognize the IRS. This Congress is going to \nchange this behavior. We want fair taxes. We want taxpayers to be held \naccountable. But this kind of targeting, this kind of \nmisrepresentation, the kinds of stories we have heard--everybody in \nthis Congress has heard this from constituents--bully tactics, \narrogance, confusion, information that is incorrect, the chilling \neffect.\n  We just heard the Senator from Ohio talk about a person who was sent \na check from IRS. The fellow said, ``Well, I don't think I am due \nthat.'' He calls them. They say, ``Oh, yes, you are.'' Then IRS finds \nout they made a mistake, and they charge the man a penalty. That is \nincredible.\n  I met a fellow sitting on a plane--Mr. President, I think I have run \nover my time. I do not know if the other side is here, so I might talk \nfor a minute or 2 until they get here.\n  I will close with this. This is one of these fellows who is going to \nhave a conversation with you whether you want to or not. And he got to \ntalking about an incident with IRS. He paid his taxes. They contacted \nhim 3 months later and said, ``You didn't pay your taxes.'' So he went \ndown to the office, and he said, ``Well, here is my check.'' They said, \n``We didn't get it.'' He said, ``Well, here is the cancellation notice \nwith the Government certifying it got the check.'' ``Hmm.'' Well, they \ncame to find out that they applied the check to his previous year's \ntaxes. So that would have triggered a refund, which they never sent \nhim. And then they said--and this is the key one--``Well, we're going \nto charge you a penalty anyway.'' So they said he would have to pay \npenalty and interest rates because they applied the tax to the wrong \nyear. He said, ``That's it. We're going to court.'' And they finally \nbacked off.\n\n  But that kind of activity has to stop.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. \nMy hour has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. OK.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for the next 15 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first again just congratulate my \ncolleague from Georgia on a great statement and echo what he has been \nsaying this morning. He is the true leader in drawing the Senate's \nattention and public attention to the need for true reform in the IRS.\n  The stories that he referenced, that I was talking about earlier \ntoday, that we have heard about in Toledo, superficially, may sound \nfunny, but as he pointed out when he and I were talking about it, they \nare not funny, they are tragedies. They are real human tragedies.\n  It is just hard to believe that the IRS has gone on for so long in \nthis country unchecked. And I say to Senator Coverdell, if these are \nany demonstration of the need for congressional oversight, if there \never was an example of what hearings will really accomplish, it is the \nhearings that Chairman Roth held several months ago starting off with, \nwhen we saw the acting head of the IRS come in to that hearing and in 5 \nminutes, the first 5 minutes of testimony, he changed more IRS policy \nthan has been changed in the last decade. That was a result of \noversight hearings.\n  Frankly, this Congress needs to do more of that, not just in regard \nto the IRS but in regard to all Federal agencies. It is part of our \ncharge. It is part of our responsibility. It is what we ought to do. So \nI just again commend my friend and colleague from Georgia for taking \nthe time this morning to talk about an issue that really affects\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\nthe American people and that the American people are really interested \nin. We spend a lot of time on this floor talking about things that are \nimportant, but I am not sure the average American really thinks it \naffects their lives. Let me tell you, the IRS affects people's lives, \nvirtually everybody in this country.\n  So I salute and congratulate my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to conclude this discussion of the \nSenate Finance Committee's work in exposing problems with the IRS \nby commending the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nRoth, for holding the series of hearings to expose problems in the \nInternal Revenue Service's dealings with taxpayers. I also want to \nthank the taxpayers and IRS employees who had the courage to come \nforward and tell their stories publicly. Although we all knew that \nthere were serious problems with the way the IRS does business, it is \nsafe to say that all of us were truly shocked at what we learned from \nthe hearings.\n\n  As Senator Roth put it, we found that the IRS far too often targets \nvulnerable taxpayers, treats them with hostility and arrogance, uses \nunethical and even illegal tactics to collect money that sometimes is \nnot even owed, and uses quotas to evaluate employees.\n  Its effort, obviously, is to try to bring in more money. But I think \nall of us would agree that it is not an acceptable behavior, and, \ntherefore, clearly that kind of behavior will be dealt with in the \nlegislation which we will be preparing.\n  I think it is also important to make the point that most IRS \nemployees, like most other Government employees, are not only law \nabiding and very hard working but are very professional in what they \ndo. They have, especially at the IRS, the very difficult and even \nthankless task of administering the code that, frankly, the Congress \nand the President made extremely complex and difficult to administer. \nIt is filled with contradictory provisions. It is often open to \ndiffering interpretations. Frankly, we have given the IRS tremendous \npower in administering the code, but it is power that can bankrupt \nfamilies, can put people out of their homes, and, as we heard, even \nruin some lives. Any abuse of that power is intolerable.\n  Let me recount some of the things that have been uncovered as a \nresult of these hearings. We heard that a taxpayer was hounded by the \nIRS for overpaying his taxes. The IRS put one constituent through the \nwringer of audits annually for 20 years and never found anything wrong.\n  Another person received a tax refund in error from the IRS. Knowing \nthat it was an error, the constituent never cashed the check, yet when \nthe IRS discovered its own error later, it demanded the refund back \nwith interest.\n  One family that had a lien placed on its house worked out a payment \nplan with one IRS agent, only to have another IRS agent institute \nforeclosure proceedings. What is most galling to taxpayers is not that \nthey have to pay taxes, but that there is virtually no recourse when \nthe IRS makes an error. The cost of setting things right--hiring \nattorneys and CPAs--can be so high that people agree to pay taxes and \npenalties that they do not really owe.\n  Another thing we found was the abuse that innocent spouses can suffer \nat the hands of the IRS and current law. By resisting calls from the \nother side to rush the IRS reform bill to vote, we have been able to \ncraft far stronger provisions to protect innocent spouses. The \nlegislation that will come before the Senate next week would ensure \nthat innocent spouses are responsible only for their own tax liability.\n  It was two and a half months ago that I came before the Senate to \ndiscuss the plight of a constituent of mine, a woman who divorced in \nlate 1995. She paid her taxes in full and on time during the last two \nyears of her marriage, but her husband apparently did not. The IRS \nultimately came after her for the taxes that her former spouse did not \npay. It did not aggressively pursue the tax bill with him.\n  About two weeks after hearing from my constituent, I sent Chairman \nRoth a letter identifying ways of improving the IRS reform bill, and on \nthat short list was a recommendation to make innocent-spouse relief \neasier to obtain, and to make it available retroactively, or at least \nto all cases pending on the date of enactment of the bill.\n  So obviously, I am delighted that the Finance Committee has focused \non the issue of innocent-spouse protection and has included provisions \nthat better protect my constituent and women across the country in \nsimilar situations.\n  The IRS reform bill is a good bill, and it deserves an ``aye'' vote. \nBut let us be under no illusion that even a good reform bill will solve \nthe myriad problems that exist. Our nation's Tax Code, as currently \nwritten, amounts to thousands of pages of confusing, seemingly \ncontradictory tax-law provisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless \nthat reform is followed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the \nInternal Revenue Code, problems with collections and enforcement are \nlikely to persist. If the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it does not \nmatter what kind of personnel or process changes we make at the agency. \nComplexity invites different interpretations of the tax laws from \ndifferent people, and that is where most of the problems at the IRS \narise.\n  Replacing the existing code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would \nfacilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive \nIRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to \nlobby for complicated tax loopholes.\n  The IRS reform bill, Finance Committee hearings about taxpayer abuse \nby the IRS, the Kemp Commission's recommendations in favor of \nfundamental tax reform, new proposals to sunset the IRS Code, and the \ndebate that sponsors of the flat tax and sales tax have taken on the \nroad in recent months, will all help to move the tax-reform discussion \nforward.\n  In conclusion, we can pass an IRS reform bill to try to rein in the \nIRS and make sure that it treats taxpayers fairly, reasonably, and \nrespectfully. But let us not fool ourselves.

Mr. President, I would like to take this personal privilege \nof explaining why I was not able to vote last night on an \nextraordinarily important issue before the Senate; namely, the \nexpansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n  The vote, fortunately, was 80 to 19, meaning that the United States \nhas gone on record as supporting the inclusion of the Czech Republic, \nHungary, and Poland as members of this important alliance.\n  When the debate started, I provided remarks which expressed my strong \nsentiments in support of that expansion. Throughout the debate, as \namendments were offered, I spoke to several of them, attempting to \ndefeat amendments that I thought would be detrimental to the expansion \nof NATO and to our mission in NATO.\n  Fortunately, one of the first amendments adopted was an amendment \nwhich I offered, which helped us to present a strategic vision in the \ndiscussions that would be ongoing with respect to the development of a \nnew strategic vision for NATO that reflects the beliefs of the U.S. \nSenate and reflects our belief that the original purposes of NATO and \nthe original strategic vision should play a large role in animating our \nassistance, with our fellow NATO members, in devising a new strategic \nmission.\n  I say all of that as a predicate to state in the most emphatic terms \nthat\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nhad I been able to be here, I would have voted ``aye'' to support the \nexpansion of NATO. Ironically, my absence last night was due to the \nfact that I was supposed to be on my way to a conference in Europe, \nwhich is the New Atlantic Initiative Conference to discuss and support \nNATO and NATO expansion. The New Atlantic Initiative is a relatively \nnew organization, founded among, other things, to promote the continued \ndevelopment of, and enhancement of, the strong relationship between the \nUnited States and our NATO allies.\n  Unfortunately, because a lot of my colleagues had a lot to say and \nhad amendments to offer, many of which were ultimately withdrawn, the \nleader and the distinguished minority leader were not able to close the \ndebate in time for me to make that vote. Unfortunately, also, I delayed \nmy departure until the very last aircraft to Europe. That aircraft was \ntaken out of service. That is why, about midnight last night, I learned \nnot only that I would not be able to go to that NATO conference but \nthat I had also missed the vote on NATO expansion. I regret that very \nmuch, because I would have liked to have been here to cast my vote in \nsupport of that.\n  I note that a letter from the distinguished majority leader, which I \nwas to deliver to the representatives of the Turkish Government, has \nbeen delivered, and, therefore, the Senate is also represented at that \nconference as it is going on here today. I certainly appreciate the \nmajority leader's support for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4033-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERROL SEWELL\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, if one wants to find an excellent \nexample of a private organization making a significant difference in \nthe lives of young people, one need look no further than the Boys & \nGirls Clubs of America. This organization has dedicated itself to \nproviding invaluable services and activities for our Nation's youngest \ncitizens, and their efforts have not only helped to provide a diversion \nfrom the many destructive temptations that face our children in this \nday and age, but have also made neighborhoods throughout the United \nStates better places to live.\n  For the past forty-two years, Errol Sewell has dedicated his life to \npromoting the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and helping to make this \norganization the success it is today. Mr. Sewell's association with the \nBoys & Girls Clubs began in Valdosta, Georgia where he was a member of \nthe clubhouse in what was then a small, sleepy southern town near the \nFlorida border. In 1956, Mr. Sewell made what was a natural transition, \nfrom that of ``club member'' to ``club staffer'', and he began what \nbecame a lifelong association with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n  Mr. Sewell's abilities and talents as a manager and a leader did not \ngo unnoticed, and he was brought to the national staff in 1969 in the \ncapacity of field representative for the Southeast region. Over the \npast almost twenty years, he has worked tirelessly to promote the \nClubs, and has steadily moved up the organization ladder to the \nposition of senior vice president. In that capacity, Mr. Sewell \nestablished what will be his most lasting legacy of service and \naccomplishment in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization, he is \ncredited with being one of the key people in almost doubling the number \nof members of this organization.\n  In the late 1980's when Mr. Sewell became Senior Vice President for \nField Services, there were approximately one million boys and girls who \nbelonged to about 1,000 clubs across the nation. It became the vision \nand the goal of senior officers of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to \ndouble the size of its membership in five years, and largely through \nthe determination and hard work of Errol Sewell, that goal was reached. \nToday, there are almost three million children who are members of the \nBoys & Girls Clubs of America, and clubhouses are added to this \norganization at a rate of about four a week. This is truly an \nimpressive accomplishment, and it is one that is worthy of \ncommendation. Errol Sewell and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America are \ndeserving of credit and our gratitude.\n  Mr. President, Errol Sewell is retiring from the organization that \nhas been a part of his life since his childhood. As this dedicated man \nsteps down from his duties, he can take great pride in all he has \naccomplished, not the least of which is securing the most lucrative \nendowment the organization has ever received, $10 million to establish \nthe ``Joseph B. Whitehead Leadership Development Fund''. \nUnquestionably, Mr. Sewell leaves the Boys & Girls Clubs of America a \nbigger, better, and stronger organization thanks to his efforts, and I \nknow that he will be missed by all those who have had the pleasure of \nworking with him. I am certain that all my colleagues would join me in \ncongratulating him on his successes and wishing him continued health \nand happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4034-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4034-S4035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHIEF HAROLD BRUNELLE OF THE HYANNIS FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Hyannis Fire Department recently \nhonored Harold S. Brunelle of Hyannis by appointing him as Fire Chief. \nThis honor is a well-deserved tribute to Chief Brunelle, his 26-year \ncareer with the Department, and his commitment to the community of \nHyannis.\n  Chief Brunelle was chosen after nation-wide competition for the \nposition of Fire Chief, and he was selected unanimously for the \nposition in a field of 34 applicants.\n  Chief Brunelle joined the Hyannis Department in 1972 as a Junior \nFirefighter and rose through the ranks because of his great ability and \ndedication. His selection as Fire Chief demonstrates the town's \nconfidence in Mr. Brunelle and their faith in his able service and \nleadership to the residents of the community.\n  Hyannis and Massachusetts are proud of Harold Brunelle's appointment \nas Fire Chief. I congratulate him on this distinction, and I look \nforward to working closely with him in the years ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Barnstable Register \non Chief Brunelle's selection be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Barnstable Register, Mar. 19, 1998]\n\n                 New Fire Chief a Familiar Hyannis Face\n\n                            (By John Basile)\n\n       Hyannis.--A 26-year commitment to the Hyannis Fire \n     Department has led Harold Brunelle to its top job.\n       Mr. Brunelle was named fire chief late last week in a \n     unanimous vote of the Board of Fire Commissioners after a \n     nationwide search to replace Chief Paul Chisholm, who retired \n     after seven years on the job. He was selected from a field of \n     34 applicants.\n       ``Just to be a firefighter is a privilege and an honor. To \n     be able to rise through the ranks and become chief is the \n     proudest thing I could experience,'' Chief Brunelle said \n     during an interview in his office at the Hyannis fire \n     station.\n       Chief Brunelle has been serving as acting chief since last \n     November when Chief Chisholm stepped down. He started with \n     the Hyannis Fire Department in 1972 as a junior firefighter \n     and was appointed a permanent firefighter in 1974. He rose \n     through the ranks of senior firefighter, lieutenant and \n     captain before becoming deputy chief in 1990.\n       Born and raised in Hyannis, Chief Brunelle still lives \n     there with his wife and three children, and said his \n     appointment sets an important precedent for the Hyannis Fire \n     Department.\n       ``One of the real positive things that came out of the \n     appointment is that people from within the department \n     received the message that there is career advancement here,'' \n     Chief Brunelle said. Promotions within the department to fill \n     Chief Brunelle's former role as deputy chief and other \n     command positions are expected in the next few months and \n     will depend on the results of competitive exams.\n       The appointment of the new fire chief followed a grueling \n     selection process involving a mathematical ranking formula, \n     scrutiny by a professional assessment panel and one-on-one \n     interviews with fire commissioners.\n       ``Nobody can say he wasn't tested,'' said Richard \n     Gallagher, chairman of the Board of Fire Commissioners. ``I'm \n     delighted for him because he's earned it, just as he earned \n     every rank in the department.'' Mr. Gallagher praised the new \n     chief's style.\n       ``He will be a chief that can be approached by people,'' he \n     said. ``You'll get an honest answer out of Harold.''\n       The new chief said he was supported through the application \n     process by former fire Chief Glen Clough, ``who basically \n     built the Hyannis Fire Department in his 30-plus years as \n     chief.'' He also thanked former Chief Richard Farrenkopf \n     ``for all of his time and expertise devoted to training.''\n       Chief Brunelle, who has logged countless hours over the \n     years in schools and at fire safety events, said residential \n     fire prevention will continue to be a high priority for him.\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\n       He hopes to reinvigorate a successful program of a few \n     years ago in which senior citizens were able to get low cost \n     smoke detectors through the fire department.\n       Chief Brunelle has not yet negotiated a final contact with \n     the Board of Fire Commissioners, but is expected to earn \n     about $76,000 a year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4034-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty, a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4035-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following report of committees was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 1415: A bill to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to increase the penalties for trafficking in \nmethamphetamine in order to equalize those penalties with the penalties \nfor trafficking in crack cocaine; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    the methamphetamine trafficking penalty enhancement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I am introducing three bills: No. \n1, The Protect Our Children Act. This legislation substantially \nincreases the penalties on adults who distribute drugs to minors, who \nsell drugs in or near schools, and who use minors to distribute drugs.\n  Each of these crimes currently carries a 1-year mandatory minimum \nsentence. My legislation would raise the mandatory term for each of \nthese crimes to 3 years.\n  The legislation also makes it a crime for an adult to use a minor to \ncommit a violent crime. Adults found guilty of using a minor would be \nsubject to two times the maximum imprisonment and two times the maximum \nfine for the violent crime itself. We need to make it especially costly \nfor adults who decide to use minors to commit crimes, because they \nthink they can avoid the penalty themselves and because they believe \nthat the minor might not have a substantial liability for punishment.\n  The second bill which I am introducing is the Methamphetamine \nTrafficking Penalty Enhancement Act. Meth production and trafficking \nare enormous problems across America, particularly in my home State of \nMissouri. The Methamphetamine Trafficking Penalty Enhancement Act \nequalizes penalties for crack cocaine and meth trafficking by setting a \n5-year mandatory term for 5 grams of methamphetamine and a 10-year \nmandatory sentence for 50 grams.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the texts of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2023\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the safety of food, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n      the food research, education, safety, and health act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe that protecting our nation's \nfood supply should be a high priority for Congress and this \nAdministration. Today, America produces the safest food in the world, \nhowever, more needs to be done in order to make it even safer. We are \nincreasingly becoming a global economy. Agricultural trade is on the \nrise. Due to these circumstances, there are new and emerging food borne \nthreats which need to be addressed. That is why I am introducing a \ncomprehensive food safety proposal, The Food Research, Education, \nSafety, and Health Act of 1998, also known as the F.R.E.S.H. Act, which \nwill provide the additional tools and resources necessary to make our \nfood even safer. I am pleased to have the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan (Mr. Abraham), join me as an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover food safety issues, I believe this proposal could not come at a \nmore critical time. The public is becoming increasingly concerned with \nthe safety of their food. Over the past year, there have been increased \nreports of people becoming sick due to food borne related illnesses. \nChildren and some adults became ill with Hepatitis A from contaminated \nstrawberries distributed to schools through USDA's school lunch \nprogram. In addition, there have been reports, even as late as \nyesterday, of ground beef contaminated with the E.coli 0157:H7 bacteria \nhaving to be recalled from grocery store shelves.\n  In drafting this legislation, my staff and I have had numerous \ndiscussions with the University of Georgia. Dr. Mike Doyle, Director of \nthe Center for Food Safety and Quality Enhancement and Department Head \nof Food Science and Technology at the University of Georgia, is a \nleading food safety authority and expert on the E.coli 0157:H7 \nbacteria. We talked with others, including farmers, health experts, \nprocessors, and government officials, in crafting this comprehensive, \nresponsible food safety approach.\n  Several months ago, I traveled to Guatemala to investigate reports of \nunsanitary conditions existing within that country. This was prompted \nby reports of Guatemalan raspberries being contaminated with \nCyclospora. While I was heartened and impressed by the investments and \ncontinuing efforts the Guatemalan producers have made in food safety \ninfrastructure, there are still legitimate safety concerns we have for \nAmerican consumers which need to be addressed.\n  I believe we need to place a greater emphasis on food safety consumer \neducation, research, and prevention efforts in order to continue to \nmaintain our safe food supply. My legislation is intended to do just \nthat. The F.R.E.S.H. Act provides for the following:\n  Consumer education food safety block grants to the States.\n  Directs the Department of Agriculture to carry out consumer education \ninitiatives on the irradiation of foods.\n  Establishes a Food Safety Council for the purpose of evaluating and \nestablishing priorities for food safety research and education, and \nfood-related prevention activities. The Council would be required to \nsubmit an annual report to Congress on actions taken by the Council, \nincluding any recommendations for improvement in food safety.\n  Competitive research grants to study food borne pathogens and finding \nthe best methods to reduce or eliminate them as a threat to humans.\n  Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a number of \ndemonstration projects to determine the epidemiology and ecology of \npotential food borne pathogens and develop interventions. The Secretary \nwould be required to submit report to Congress on these projects by no \nlater than December 1, 2001.\n  Authorizes $5 million for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) to pay for expense associated with the detection of \nfood borne pathogens. This funding will be used for the employment of \nnew scientists and the acquisition of new scientific equipment.\n  Authorizes $5 million to enable the National Institutes of Health \n(NIH) to conduct research concerning medical treatments for individuals \ninfected with food borne pathogens.\n  Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Food Safety \nResearch Information Office in the National Agricultural Library. This \noffice will provide the scientific community and other interested \npersons with information on public and private research activities on \nfood safety.\n  Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct risk assessments for \neach species of animal that is used to produce food in the U.S., at \neach step in the food chain in order to determine the risk of pathogens \nposed by the species. Risk assessments would also be conducted for each \ntype of fruit and vegetable.\n  Authorizes $10.4 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nto hire new microbiologists and inspectors in order to decrease the \nrisk of importing unsafe food products.\n  Mr. President, food safety is a matter of utmost importance to me, \nand the American people. I urge my colleagues and the Administration to \nsupport this important legislative initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 2026. A bill to require the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to \nconduct assessments and take other actions relating to the transition \nfrom use of chloroflurocarbons in metered-dose inhalers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   the asthma inhaler protection act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nintroduce, along with my good friend Senator Tim Hutchinson of \nArkansas, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act.\n  This bill is designed to protect the millions of Americans who use \nmedical inhalers for diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. This \nAsthma Inhaler Protection Act is needed to make sure that the Food and \nDrug Administration is extremely--extremely--careful in how it phases \nout the use of asthma inhalers that contain chlorofluorocarbons, or \nCFCs.\n  This bill that Senator Hutchinson and I are introducing today makes \nsure that as FDA phases out the use of inhalers with CFCs, adequate \nreplacements are available that meet all patients' needs. That is the \nkey.\n  Mr. President, there are 15 million Americans who have asthma, almost \nall of whom regularly use asthma inhalers such as this one, 15 million \nAmericans who have asthma, many of whom use inhalers just like the one \nI took out of my pocket. They use these inhalers to help them control \ntheir disease. Without having access to a drug that meets his or her \nspecific needs, each of these Americans would be adding much greater \nrisk of having an asthma attack or, if they have an asthma attack, not \nbeing able to control it short of going to the emergency room in a \nhospital, which is where many people had to go before they had access \nto these inhalers.\n\n  I had the personal experience with our daughter Becky a number of \nyears ago when she was small and she had asthma. The doctor finally, \nafter we had been to the emergency room time after time, said I think \nshe needs to use these new inhalers that are on the market, even though \nthey had not been prescribed for children at that time. He said go \nahead and use it. So Becky started using these and it made her life a \nlot easier, certainly the life of her parents, as well.\n  Without access to a drug that meets these specific needs, each of \nthese asthma sufferers would be in greater danger. Without an \nappropriate medication, they also would have a much worse chance of \nstopping an asthma attack once it has begun.\n  What is the problem? The problem is almost all asthma inhalers \ncurrently on the market contain CFCs. Almost every single one of them \nchanges this.\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\n Under international agreement, this country has agreed to the goal of \neventually eliminating all uses--all uses--of CFCs.\n  What this means for asthma patients is that over a period of many \nyears new inhalers that don't use CFCs will be brought to the market, \nand use of the old inhalers that contain CFCs will be phased out. But \nas we do this, as we comply with this international agreement--and \nthis, of course, is something that was agreed to because of the concern \nfor the environment, and I understand that--I think as we do this we \nmust make sure this transition process is done very, very carefully and \nthat we do it with the utmost attention to those individuals whose \nquality of life may depend on the use of these inhalers.\n  We must be absolutely sure that if and when we take an inhaler that \ncontains CFCs off the market there are adequate replacements that meet \nthe needs of each and every person that currently uses the old-time \ninhaler. My one and only goal when it comes to this transition is to \nmake sure that all people, all people who rely on these drugs, continue \nto have access to inhalers that have been proven, already proven to \nmeet their needs. All other issues are secondary to making sure that \nthese patients are, in fact, protected.\n  In March of 1997 the FDA released its first proposal on how to go \nabout this transition. Now, simply put, the FDA's initial response does \nnot meet the goal of fully protecting asthma patients. The medical and \npatient communities have been unanimous in expressing concern that the \nFDA's proposal, when it goes into effect, could take existing \nmedications away from patients without adequate replacements being at \nthat time available. The bottom line is that the FDA's proposal could \nand will put patients at risk.\n  What do we do about it? Where do we go from here? I understand that \nmany people believe the FDA has seen the light. Some people tell me \nthey plan to correct the problems in their initial proposal during the \nnext step of the process, the next step of the process being the \nproposed rule. Now, I would like to believe that this will happen, but \nI am not sure it will.\n  It is now over a year since the FDA released its earlier proposal, \nbut despite all the public criticism which has ensued there has never \nbeen a single public statement by that agency that it intends to change \nthe policy to address these very legitimate medical concerns. That is \nwhy I feel congressional action is necessary.\n  That is why Senator Hutchinson and I are introducing this bill today. \nWe need to be sure that the FDA, as it pursues this transition, writes \nits policy so that all patients are protected. Because of this, I am \npleased to cosponsor this legislation, S. 1299, a bill that Senator \nHutchinson introduced last year. Let me say that Senator Hutchinson has \nbeen someone who has taken the lead in this crusade.\n\n  That bill lets the FDA know in the clearest of terms that its initial \nproposal was unacceptable and that bill further gives the FDA guidance \non how it should proceed with the rules for this transition.\n  Let me again congratulate my colleague from Arkansas for his \nleadership on this issue and for the introduction of his work on that \nbill. Since last year, Mr. President, I have continued to work on this \nissue. I have had my staff explore various options and various \nproposals. We have identified several additional ideas I believe are \nimportant to make sure that patients are protected and that should be \nincluded in any legislation on the phaseout of CFC inhalers.\n  Recently, I have worked with Senator Hutchinson to develop these \nthoughts into this piece of legislation that we are introducing today, \nthe Asthma Inhaler Protection Act. Our bill does these things: First, \nit makes sure that the FDA, before it takes the next step of publishing \na proposed rule, has looked at several issues that are necessary for \nthe agency to make informed choices in this area. Second, our bill \ngives the FDA the broad outline of what the transition policy should \nlook like so that all patients' needs are protected. Finally, our bill \nwill help save FDA resources by telling the agency to not review any \nnew drug applications for products that contain CFCs unless the new \nproduct represents a significant new medical advance.\n  I want to make clear that this bill is not necessarily a finished \nproduct. We are open to additional ideas and suggestions. We will \nconsider any additional thoughts and ideas on how to improve the bill \nto make sure that people who use asthma inhalers are truly protected.\n  I hope my colleagues and anyone interested in the safety of Americans \nwith asthma could look at this bill and consider supporting it. I \nbelieve this bill is crucial to get FDA back on the right course. It is \nabsolutely necessary so that no asthma patients are ever put in a \nsituation where they can't get the best inhalers that fit their very \nspecific medical needs.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, which I believe \nis a matter of good common sense, and a bill that will help protect the \nasthma sufferers of this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BRYAN (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2027. A bill to clarify the fair tax treatment of meals provided \nhotel and restaurant employees in non-discriminatory employee \ncafeterias; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the working meals fairness act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Working Meals \nFairness Act for myself and Senator Bryan, which provides for the \nexemption of meals from consideration as taxable income when provided \nas a benefit to employees of the service sector.\n  Mr. President, during the past few days the Finance Committee has \nconducted hearings in which victims of IRS injustice have provided \npoignant testimony of their experiences at the hands of overzealous IRS \nagents. Their testimony has made us all aware that the time has come to \noverhaul the manner in which the IRS deals with the honest law-abiding \ncitizens of this country. This overhaul will require a fundamental \nrestructuring of the IRS customer service organization and a fresh look \nat what constitutes fairness.\n  Mr. President, as part of this fresh look, I am joining Senator Bryan \ntoday in introducing legislation to remedy an unquestionably unfair tax \npolicy resulting from a recent tax court decision. It was a decision in \nsupport of the IRS' position which is going to have widespread effect \non the working men and women who are employed by our hotels, \nrestaurants and resorts. In short, this decision eliminated the \ndeduction for meals provided to service industry employees by their \nemployer. Our legislation would reform the manner in which gratuitous \nmeals are treated as taxable income under current IRS code.\n  Mr. President, all across this country, workers are going to be asked \nto pay taxes to the IRS for the meal they receive while on duty in the \nservice industry. These workers often work more than one job, while \nraising a family, and for all intents and purposes play by the rules. \nIt isn't enough that these same workers pay transportation costs and \nchild care costs to hold these jobs. Now we must tax the hand that \nfeeds them. These meals are often provided for the convenience of both \nthe employer and employee in order to provide the enhanced customer \nservice which has become the hallmark of the service sector in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, our legislation, simply put, would exempt any meal, \nprovided as a benefit of employment to an employee during their shift \nof duty, from being treated as taxable income.\n  Mr. President, this nation depends heavily on the vital contributions \nof the service industry. It is an industry characterized by high \nemployee turnover, low wages and in many cases, poor benefits. In order \nto recruit and retain the quality worker that the industry depends \nupon, and we as consumers have come to expect, the provision of a meal \nis the least we can offer. To tax this meal is going a bit too far in \nmy judgement. Isn't it ironic that we maintain a policy which costs the \naverage service worker $300 a year in additional taxes? Isn't it ironic \n. . . we often tax those who can least afford to pay?\n  Mr. President, my job in this body is to stand up for the workers of \nNevada. I ask my colleagues to stand with me on this matter on behalf \nof workers in their state. Because of policies like\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nthis, the average American is justified in their perception that the \nrich get richer and the poor stay poor. I therefore ask my colleagues \nin this body to join with me in taking another step on behalf of the \nAmerican worker who sent us here to represent their interests.\n  Mr. President, it is time we all ask the IRS to leave the service \nworkers of America alone. They are already paying their fair share.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the Working Meals \nFairness Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2027\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Section 119 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended \n     by adding the following new subsection:\n       (e) In the case of an employee of a hotel or restaurant, \n     gross income shall not include the value of meals furnished \n     to such employee by an employer in a non-discriminatory \n     employee cafeteria located on the business premises of the \n     employer immediately before, immediately after, or during \n     work shifts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2028. A bill to amend the National Narcotics Leadership Act of \n1988 to extend the authorization for the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy until September 30, 2000, to expand the responsibilities \nand powers of the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      the drug czar responsibility and accountability act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Drug Czar \nResponsibility and Accountability Act. It adds to the responsibilities \nof the drug czar's office the establishment of Federal policies, goals \nand performance measures, including specific reduction targets.\n  Why is such a measure needed? Consider this: Overall illicit drug use \namong children age 12 to 17 was 5.3 percent when the President took \noffice. In 1996, it was 9 percent. That is an increase of 70 percent \nsince 1993. Now, the President proposes to cut drug use by 20 percent \nby the year 2002. In other words, 2 years after the President wants to \nleave office, he hopes to get teen drug use to only 128 percent of \nwhere it was when he took office.\n  I happen to have been a Boy Scout. I think most of us in the Chamber \nhave had some association with scouting. We either hauled kids to the \ncampfires, to the Brownies, or to the Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts. The \nfundamental principle of scouting is you always leave the campground a \nlittle better than you found it.\n  Here we have a President who, in terms of teen drug use, wants to set \nas a goal that there will be 128 percent of the drug use that there was \nwhen he came into office, and that goal isn't even supposed to be \nattained until 2 years after he leaves office.\n  I don't think we will ever achieve greatness in our culture if we \ndon't at least aspire to good things. Our opportunity is to leave the \ncampground better than we found it, not worse than we found it, and \ncertainly not 128 percent worse than we found it. We cannot defer \nmaintenance of the campground until after we are gone.\n  The tradition of America is to provide to the next generation a \nbroader set of opportunities, a brighter set of horizons than we have \never known before. That should not be forgotten when we talk about \ncurtailing the scourge of drugs on our young people.\n  Here we have a President who wants to instruct a drug czar to ratchet \nthe drug problem all the way back to 128 percent of what it was when he \nstarted and not to get that done until 2 years after he leaves office. \nI think it is disgraceful.\n  Mr. President, because of my concern for combating underage drug use, \nI will also offer an amendment to the tobacco bill when it comes to the \nSenate floor to make certain the epidemic of underage illegal drug use \nis addressed in that respect. My amendment will allow States to use \ntobacco settlement funds for anti-illegal drug and law enforcement \npurposes, not just teen smoking programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--With respect to the programs authorized in \n     titles II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) Racial profile.--The racial profile of America is \n     rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white \n     Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and \n     ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, \n     14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for \n     Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, \n     the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three \n     of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-\n     American.\n       ``(2) Rate of disability.--Ethnic and racial minorities \n     tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately \n     high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American \n     Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general \n     population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times \n     more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to \n     be significantly disabled.\n       ``(3) Inequitable treatment.--Patterns of inequitable \n     treatment of minorities have been documented in all major \n     junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As \n     compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-\n     American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system \n     is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a \n     larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without \n     being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training \n     than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is \n     spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.\n       ``(4) Recruitment.--Recruitment efforts within vocational \n     rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, \n     continuing education, and in-service training must focus on \n     bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in \n     order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role \n     models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly \n     changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.\n       ``(b) Outreach to Minorities.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For each fiscal year, the Commissioner \n     and the Director of the National Institute on Disability and \n     Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as \n     the `Director') shall reserve 1 percent of the funds \n     appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized \n     under titles II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this \n     subsection.

If the \n     individual demonstrates that the individual has completed a \n     drug treatment program and passed a drug test within the 30-\n     day period prior to the date of the reapplication, the \n     individual may participate in training services, under the \n     same terms and conditions as apply to other applicants and \n     participants, including submission to drug tests administered \n     as described in paragraph (2).\n       (B) Second disqualification or dismissal.--If the \n     individual reapplies to participate in training services and \n     fails a drug test administered under paragraph (2) by the \n     eligible provider, while the individual is an applicant or a \n     participant, the eligible provider shall disqualify the \n     individual from eligibility for, or dismiss the individual \n     from participation in, training services.

Mr. President, the amendment I added to the \nconference version of the 1998 Supplemental Spending Bill deals with \nhow oil is valued for the purpose of collecting royalties. This is not \nabout royalty rates, but rather how that value is established.\n  Under the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Act and the Minerals \nLeasing Act, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) is required to value \nthe oil where it is removed from the ground. The MMS wants, instead, to \nvalue the oil after the industry has added significantly to its value \n(through marketing and transportation costs). Such a change would have \nthe effect of increasing the tax collected on any set amount of oil at \na time when the oil prices are at an all time low. The economy and jobs \nwill be affected by such an arbitrary increase in costs. And finally, \nthe MMS wants to make this change in the law through regulation. Mr. \nPresident, changing the law is the job of Congress, not the MMS.\n  My amendment prohibits the MMS from implementing this proposed change \nnext month and prohibits the agency from acting before the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year. This will give Congress time to weigh in on this \nmatter, instead of letting the MMS arbitrarily change the law through \nthe exercise of its rule-making authority.\n  Last year, this Congress, in the FY 1998 Interior Appropriations Bill \nspecifically directed MMS to report back to the committees prior to \nfinalizing the new regulations after numerous members expressed \nconcern. MMS has ignored this direction, and neither the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee nor the Appropriations Committee was \nnotified that MMS proposed to finalize the new rule this June.\n  I support a valuation program that ensures the state and national \ngovernments receive all royalties due to them while maintaining \nfundamental principles of equity. I support the MMS in its efforts to \nsimplify the valuation system and collect the government's fair share. \nHowever, it cannot be done at in a manner that changes federal \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4131-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WE THE PEOPLE . . . THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on May 2-4, 1998, more than 1200 \nstudents from across the nation will be in Washington, D.C. to compete \nin the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution program. I am proud to announce that a class from \nLahainaluna High School from Lahaina, Maui will represent the State of \nHawaii. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the \nnational finals by winning competitions in their home state.\n  The distinguished students representing Hawaii are: Iao Eisenberg, \nTiffany Fujiwara, Jasmine Hentz, Erin Lockhart, William Myers, Leah \nNakamura, Ryan Ott, Michael Prieto, Julie Reed, Sal Saribay, Justin \nSerrano, Jeffrey Shelton, Yee Ning Tay, Kerry Tsubaki.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Ms. Ruth Hill, who \ndeserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The district \ncoordinator, Ms. Jane Kinoshita, also contributed a significant amount \nof time and effort to help these students reach the national finals.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional \nissues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral \npresentations by the students before panels of adult judges.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People . . \n. program, has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 \nmillion students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff \nenhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with \nstudents and teachers.\n  The We the People . . . program is designed to help students achieve \na reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principals that \nbind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic \ndispositions or traits of public and private character conducive to \neffective and responsible participation in politics and government.\n  I wish to extend my best wishes to these constitutional scholars in \nthe upcoming We the People . . . national finals and commend them for \ntheir great achievement of reaching this level of competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4131-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4131-S4132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nwomen, men, and their families who are fighting the scourge of breast \ncancer. As many of my colleagues may remember, last Spring, I submitted \nS. Res. 85, with my fellow Senator from New Hampshire, recognizing the \nfamily and friends of breast cancer patients in the struggle to cope \nwith this disease. The Senate passed my Resolution by unanimous consent \nand expressed their overwhelming support for individuals who provide \nstrength and support for loved ones fighting breast cancer. I come to \nthe floor today to again note the importance of this expression and to \nrecognize a very important organization in my home state of New \nHampshire that is spreading this message to breast cancer patients \nacross the country.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that in 1998, 178,700 new cases \nof invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United \nStates and 1,600 cases will be diagnosed among men. These numbers more \nthan triple in size when you consider the family and friends who are \nalso impacted by the disease. With each and every one of these cases \ncomes family and friends who are looked upon to provide the caring and \nloving needed to overcome such a terrifying disease.\n  The Northeast Health Care Quality Foundation, in Dover, New \nHampshire, has done an excellent job of expressing this notion to the \npeople of New Hampshire and beyond. With their campaign titled, ``It's \nMy Fight, Too,'' the Foundation has let individuals afflicted with \nbreast cancer know that they are not alone in their struggle. It is \nimportant for the family to understand that their feelings are shared \nby others in their same situation and that they should find strength in \nnumbers.\n  Awareness campaigns like ``It's My Fight Too,'' are extremely \nimportant to foster an environment where support for both the \nindividual with breast cancer and their family and friends is \nencouraged. Awareness is the key to allowing people to understand and \nidentify with those suffering around them. We can all, as community \nmembers, provide support and strength to those in need.\n  As Mother's Day approaches, the Northeast Health Care Quality \nFoundation will be holding their annual event to recognize the \nimportant women in our lives who may or may not be suffering from this \ndisease but who never the less, need to know that breast cancer is not \njust a women's disease but a struggle that can be fought by all of us \ntogether. Their event, ``Family and Friends Against Breast Cancer, It's \nMy Fight Too, A Night of Hope, Song and Love'' will bring people from \nacross the Northeast together to express the same support the Senate \nexpressed with the passage of S. Res. 85. I commend the efforts of the \nNortheast Health Care Quality Foundation and encourage organizations \nacross the country follow their leadership and example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4132-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4132-S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and to pay tribute to \nthe commendable service its members offered our nation. Created by \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt on March 31, 1933, the Civilian \nConservation Corps had a profound impact on this nation, helping to \nsustain the United States through the depths of the Depression, and \nsetting a precedent for other federal agencies to carry on the diverse \nmissions of the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n  Within days after his presidential inauguration, Franklin Roosevelt \ninitiated plans for the Civilian Conservation Corps, citing the need \nfor an organization that would provide jobs for hundreds of thousands \nunemployed young men ages 18 to 25. President Roosevelt declared that \nthe Civilian Conservation Corps would ``conserve our precious natural \nresources and pay dividends to the present and future generations. More \nimportant, we can take a vast army of the unemployed out into healthful \nsurroundings.'' The Civilian Conservation Corps' intention was not only \nto provide services to the United States but also to give the \nunemployed an opportunity to live in healthful surroundings with a \nsteady pay, room, board, and clothing.\n  By July 1, 1933, a quarter of a million enrollees had enlisted in the \nCivilian Conservation Corps, making it the fastest large-scale \nmobilization of men in U.S. history. The enrollees enlisted for six \nmonths with the option to re-enroll for another six months or a maximum \nof two years. They worked forty-hour weeks and received thirty dollars \na month. Each month, they required the men to send twenty-five dollars \nto their families to help them through the difficulties of the \nDepression. The Civilian Conservation Corps provided members with the \nopportunity to learn a new skill and allowed them to attend classes to \nfurther their education. More than 100,000 men were taught to read and \nwrite with the aid of the Civilian Conservation Corps's education \nclasses.\n  The accomplishments the Civilian Conservation Corps achieved in its \nnine year existence are impressive. Historical areas in Jamestown, \nWilliamsburg, Yorktown, Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania were restored \nand developed by the Corps members. At the program's peak, there were \nover 500 Civilian Conservation Corps camps in national, state, and \nlocal parks. Civilian Conservation Corps workers cleared trails, built \nbuildings and shelters, fought forest fires, planted trees, and made \nother improvements to parks in all the states, territories, and \npossessions. The three million men planted a total of 2.3 billion \ntrees, spent 6.4 million days fighting forest fires and eradicated \ndiseases and pests. These accomplishments contributed to the Civilian \nConservation Corps' lasting environmental legacy. Today, agencies such \nas President Clinton's Americorps, the Park Service, the Bureau of \nReclamation, the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation \nService are continuing the tradition of the Civilian Conservation Corps \nby instilling a sense of value for our natural environment as well as \nfor national service.\n  Communities across the country benefitted from the hard toil of the \nCivilian Conservation Corps. The camps helped local economies, bringing \nlarge numbers of consumers to the towns' stores and industries. More \nimportantly, they aided the communities in times of crisis, searching \nfor missing persons, fighting fires, and offering assistance to \nresidents during snow and ice storms. The state of Connecticut received \nsuch services from the twenty forest camps located within the state \nduring the peak of the Corps program.\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n  Besides offering the members an opportunity to work, the Civilian \nConservation Corps provided long-lasting friendships and ties that have \nendured over the sixty-five years since the Corps' inception. This \nsense of loyalty and pride extended to an unquestionable sense of pride \nfor our country that is almost unparalleled. The work of the Civilian \nConservation Corps remains as a monument to the young men who dedicated \ntheir lives to mending and preserving our natural resources. These men \nhave earned the respect and honor of our nation. I offer my heartfelt \nthanks to the members of the Civilian Conservation Corps and \ncongratulations on their sixty-fifth anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4132-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WEST LAFAYETTE GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, following the business of the Senate \ntoday, there was an hour of morning business and a number of Members of \nthe Senate came to the floor to comment on the hearings that were held \nyesterday and, I think today, before the Senate Finance Committee. \nThese are hearings about the Internal Revenue Service. I am going to \ntalk about that in a bit because the hearings are dealing with, at \nleast from what I have read, some abuses in the Internal Revenue \nService. Some of the instances that have been disclosed in these \nhearings represent abusive behavior on the part of some employees of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. I will comment on that in a moment, but \nfirst I want to talk about some other abuses first that relate to \nanother agenda that many of us want brought to the floor of this \nChamber to be debated as soon as is possible. I am referring to abuses \nin the area of health care, particularly with regard to managed care \norganizations in our country.\n  We know that some in this Chamber and in the Congress do not want to \naddress the issue of managed care because the largest insurance \ncompanies in the country do not want it addressed. It would be \ndifficult and inconvenient for some insurance plans if the Congress \naddressed these issues, so there is some stalling going on. However, we \nintend to, every day that we are in session and have the opportunity, \ncome to the floor of the Senate and talk about some specific instances \nof abuse that the American people have suffered at the hands of their \nhealth care plans. In many respects, we have a wonderful system of \nhealth care in this country--new medicines and procedures, breathtaking \nmedical advances--but this is only true for the people who have the \nquality care available to them.\n  Let me talk about one American named Buddy Kuhl from Missouri who is \ndead now. Buddy had a heart attack on his 25th wedding anniversary. He \nwas told by his doctor that he required specialized heart surgery, but \nbecause the hospital in his hometown did not have the necessary \nequipment for that surgery, the doctor arranged for the\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nsurgery to be performed in St. Louis. When the hospital requested \nprecertification for the surgery, the utilization review coordinator--\nthat is quite a title, utilization review coordinator--at Mr. Kuhl's \nHMO refused because the St. Louis hospital was outside the HMO's \nservice area. So the surgery was canceled. The HMO, instead, sent Mr. \nKuhl to another doctor to determine whether the surgery could be \nperformed locally. The second doctor agreed with the first one that the \nsurgery had to be performed in St. Louis.\n  So 2 weeks later, finally the HMO and the accountant who makes these \njudgments decided they would pay for the surgery in St. Louis, but by \nthat time, the surgery could not be scheduled for another 60 days. By \nthe time the doctors in St. Louis examined Mr. Kuhl, his heart had \ndeteriorated so much that surgery was no longer a possibility. Instead, \nthey concluded he needed a heart transplant. Although the HMO refused \nto pay for the evaluation for a heart transplant, Mr. Kuhl managed to \nbe placed on the transplant waiting list in St. Louis. Tragically, he \ndied waiting for that heart transplant. Mr. Kuhl was only 45 years old, \nand he left behind a wife and two children. And the Kuhl family \nattorney said this: ``He did what his HMO told him. Unfortunately, he's \ndead because he did.''\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Kuhl's case is not an isolated one. There is case \nafter case all across this country. Do you think this family has any \nrecourse against their managed care organization? No, because that \norganization cannot be sued. They can make a decision that will lead to \na patient's death but a law called ERISA, an acronym unfamiliar to the \nwidow of Mr. Kuhl, prevents certain types of health plans from being \nsued.\n  Some of us in this Chamber believe that health care ought to be a \nfunction of doctors providing the health care, rather than some \ninsurance company executive prescribing what is necessary for the \nmedical care of a patient 500 miles away. Yet that is the way health \ncare has evolved. Ask any doctor and you will discover the truth of \nthat statement.\n  Some of us believe there ought to be a patients' bill of rights that \nwould provide some very basic protections to consumers in their \ndealings with their health plan. For instance, every patient in this \ncountry should have the right to know all of their medical options, not \njust the cheapest, all of the medical options to treat their disease or \ntheir problem, not just the least expensive. And patients and their \nfamilies ought to have the right to address the wrongs that are done \nthem when a managed care organization's bad decision leads to long-term \ndisability or death.\n  When you hear the stories of the abuses in managed care, and, yes, \nthey are abuses, it is perfectly understandable, I suppose, why many \norganizations resist every step of the way any effort to bring to the \nfloor of this Senate a patients' bill of rights. But if we are talking \nabout abuses in this Congress and it is perfectly appropriate to talk \nabout the abuses in the IRS, let us also talk about abuses we can stop \nin the area of managed care. Just as we ought to stop the shameful \nabuses that are occurring at the IRS, let us also make sure that \nAmericans who walk through a doctor's office door or through a hospital \nentrance understand that their care is not going to be a function of a \nprofit and loss statement but rather a function of a health care \nprovider responding in a caring way to their health care problem.\n  Regrettably, that is not happening in this country today. We can \nremedy this if we understand exactly what is happening. We will come \nevery day to the floor of the Senate to talk about the abuses in \nmanaged care until those who schedule the business of the Senate decide \nthat this is an important enough issue for the American people that it \nought to be high on the agenda of the issues to be considered here in \nthe Congress.\n  Let me finish by telling a story I read about not too long ago about \na woman who had just been the victim of an accident and had suffered a \nbrain injury. As her brain was swelling and she was laying in the back \nof the ambulance, she informed the driver of the ambulance that she \nwanted to go to a hospital that was farther away. After she recovered, \nshe was asked why she told the ambulance driver she wanted to go to the \nhospital that was farther away even though it was the closer hospital \nthat was affiliated with her health care plan. And she explained that \nshe knew by having read and heard about what had happened with her \nneighbors and others, that the hospital would evaluate her care in the \ncontext of profit and loss, and she wanted everything that was humanly \npossible to be done by doctors and nurses to save her life. That is the \nconcern of people about managed care. I am not suggesting that all \nmanaged care in this country has disserved the needs of the patients in \nthis country. That is not the case. In some cases it has reduced the \ncost of health care and still provides decent service.\n\n  But you know and I know that all across this country there are \nexamples of managed care organizations that are forcing doctors to sign \ncontracts that say to a doctor, ``Don't let one of your patients show \nup at an emergency room. If you do, if one of your patients comes into \nan emergency room, guess what, we are taking it out of your pocket.'' \nYou talk about a disincentive. That represents a conflict of interest, \nyet that is what is going on in these managed care organizations, \nbecause it is becoming for them not so much a delivery of health care, \nit is a function of profit and loss.\n  We ought to begin to separate that discussion just a bit by passing a \npatients' bill of rights. To those who say they don't want to bring \nthat to the floor, I say you are going to be annoyed then, because \nevery day we will come to the floor to talk about this, and one day, \none way, sooner or later, we are going to debate this on the floor with \na piece of legislation we call the Patients' Bill of Rights. You may \nnot think that now, but before the end of the year it will be here and \nyou will vote on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4136-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4137-S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me go to a couple of other issues.\n  About the Internal Revenue Service hearings that are being held in \nthe Senate Finance Committee this week, let me say first that I think \nthose hearings are appropriate. I think anywhere you find abuses of a \ntaxing agency, they are repulsive and disgusting. Those who commit \nthose abuses ought to be summarily fired and penalized in any other way \nthe agency can do so.\n  It is clear to me from the hearings that have been held that there \nhas been mismanagement at the Internal Revenue Service and that some of \nthe circumstances of abuses they should have known about, they didn't. \nOn some of misconduct that they did know about, they didn't take \nappropriate action. And if these hearings accomplish anything, I hope \nit is that this agency simply cannot ever treat lightly the abuse of \nthe American taxpayer. It is ugly and disgusting and must never happen. \nAll tax agencies have a special responsibility to make sure it doesn't \nhappen.\n  I ran a State tax agency for some long while in a State capital, and \nI understand about it. We were the repository of hundreds of thousands \nof income tax returns having sensitive financial information of all the \nfolks of our State. I understand the responsibility of taxing \nauthorities to make certain that the agency behaves appropriately with \ntaxpayers. And I am appalled by some of the stories that have come from \nthese hearings.\n  We ought to stop in its tracks any abuse that exists anywhere, \nanytime in the IRS, and we ought to do it now. And I will support the \nlegislation that comes to the floor of the Senate dealing with changing \nsome of the procedures down at the Internal Revenue Service.\n  But I want to tell you something else we should stop, and we should \ndo it now. We should stop the fundraising that goes on surrounding \nthese issues. I hold in my hand a fundraising letter by a Member of the \nSenate. It was sent to people across this country, coordinated, I \nassume, to be timed with the IRS hearings in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. It is, I understand, the second such fundraising letter that \nhas gone out, possibly the third. The letters have been timed, I \nthink--at least I am told--to coordinate somehow with the hearings on \nthe IRS.\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\n  This fundraising letter for a political party, signed by a Member of \nthe Senate, talks about ending the IRS reign of terror. It goes on and \non and so on. It says: We are on the right side. If you will just send \nus $25, $50, $100, $250, $500--if you will just send us some money, we \nwill be your pen pal for life. We will keep sending you these letters. \nWe will work hard in Congress on all the right things. I think it is \nthe right thing to do to hold hearings in the Finance Committee about \nIRS abuse. It is not the right thing for the party that schedules those \nhearings to use the opportunity to send fundraising letters all across \nthis country. In some cases, they have even boasted about the money \nthey have raised in the first round of fundraising letters with respect \nto the hearings they held. What that suggests is, this is a lot more \nthan public policy. It is a very heavy dose of money politics.\n\n  There is no question that this country's Tax Code is in desperate \nneed of change and repair, and we have more ideas to change it than \nthere are Members of Congress. We have people who say, let's have a VAT \ntax, let's have a flat tax, let's have a national sales tax. There are \ndozens of variations on each. It is interesting that those who complain \nthe loudest in this Chamber about the complexity of the Tax Code are \nthose who have hauled the heaviest loads of legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate to complicate the Tax Code.\n  I believe the first tax form and return and instructions were a total \nof something like seven pages, with everything. Now it is like a huge \nmail order catalog, with all of the forms and all the instructions. I \nunderstand that people can't deal with that complexity and should not \nhave to. This Tax Code is Byzantine. It is way out of whack. We ought \nto change it. We ought to simplify it. It is interesting that those who \nhave made it complex have done so because they've wanted special deals \nfor themselves, carving out special tax breaks for a few while others \nare asked to pay more.\n  It wasn't too long ago that we would read stories about a corporation \nin this country that made $4 billion of income in a year. Do you know \nhow much they paid in income tax? Zero, nothing, no tax. They were tax \nexempt. So we made some changes in the Tax Code to see if we couldn't \nget them to pay taxes like other Americans. All of those changes in the \nTax Code changed the circumstances of the code to add lines to the code \nand make it more complicated. I understand all that.\n  I am going through a list of things I think we can do to dramatically \nsimplify the Tax Code. I have proposed some legislation that I think \nwould allow up to 70 million Americans to never have to file a federal \nincome tax return again. I will go through that and explain how I think \nthat can occur.\n  But I must say, I find it interesting that in this climate, what we \nhave is fundraising letters coordinated with hearings designed, I \nthink, to pave the way for a tax system to say to the American people, \n``What we would like to do is change your tax system so there is one \nrate for everybody.'' Steve Forbes says that. I spoke at a banquet once \nwhen he was sitting in the audience. I said, ``You know, only in \nWashington, DC, would a billionaire proposing a significant tax cut for \nhimself be considered having a bold public policy statement.'' Only in \nWashington, DC, could that happen. A single rate, so the richest \nAmerican pays the same tax rate as the lowest person on the income \nscale when they file their tax returns? I don't think so. It doesn't \nmake sense to me.\n  It seems to me the person who is making $20 million a year can afford \nto pay a couple of percent more than somebody who is making $22,000 a \nyear and trying to raise a couple of kids. So, should we have a one-\nsize-fits-all, one-rate-fits-all tax system? I don't think so.\n  How about a national sales tax? We have people over there on the \nother side who are offering national sales taxes. In fact, I was down \nat the Brookings Institution a while back and spoke. I saw a study they \nhave just done that says if you have a national sales tax in this \ncountry, you are going to have to tax almost everything with this sales \ntax and you are going to have a rate that is in excess of 30 percent--\n30 percent, to raise the same money the current system uses. Wouldn't \nit be interesting to see how people would react if they said, ``Oh, you \nare going to buy a home? Yes, that's the price, but there is one more \nlittle thing: You have to pay a 30 percent sales tax on the home.'' How \nlong do you think the American people would stand for that? It might \nsound kind of simple. The fact is, a 30 percent sales tax, or 35 \npercent sales tax, added on top of the local sales tax of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 \npercent in some parts of the country--I wonder if people are going to \nthink that is a pretty healthy tax program. I don't think so.\n  There is, it seems to me, an opportunity to do a couple of things.\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we can pass some legislation that will be \nbrought to the floor of this Congress that deals directly with some of \nthe abuse that has been disclosed at these hearings.\n  I agree with one of the other Senators this morning who said there \nare a lot of folks at the Internal Revenue Service who do good work and \ngood public service. I received a letter the other day from a fellow in \nNorth Dakota, a conservative Republican businessman who is very \nsuccessful and has done very well for many years. He said, ``I don't \nwant you to tell anybody that I told you this, but I am watching all \nthis IRS stuff, and I have been in business for 35 years and have had a \nlot of dealings with the Internal Revenue Service. And I have never \ndealt with any one of them who weren't good, honest people and easy to \ndeal with.'' He had nothing but good to say. I jotted a note back and \nsaid, ``Good for you.''\n  That is probably the case for a lot of people. I think most people \nfind their experience with the Internal Revenue Service is fair, but \nwhen they find it is not, when they find abuse, we have a \nresponsibility to stop it, even if it is just the exception.\n  We intend to pass a piece of legislation--and I intend to vote for \nit--that responds to that. Last November, the House of Representatives, \nincidentally, passed similar legislation by a vote of 426 to 4. We \ncould have passed this legislation last November, or at the very latest \nin January when the Congress returned, but we did not. Delay, delay, \ndelay and more delay, until now. We are probably ready to have the \nlegislation brought to the floor next week. As I said, I will be \nsupportive of it, but we could have passed this legislation long, long \nago. I worry--and I hope I am not right--that it had a lot to do with \nthese fund-raising letters that have gone out in some concert with \nthese hearings.\n  Let me describe just for a moment what we could do to the tax system. \nWe could do something positive for tens of millions of Americans. I \nwant to describe it. It is called the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan \nor ``FASST.'' I have worked with some of my colleagues on it in both \nthe Senate and House.\n  The proposition is this: Many Americans have as their only income the \nwages they earn at their workplace. They ought not have to file an \nannual federal tax return. Some 30 countries in the world have some \nkind of income tax in which you don't have to file an annual return.\n  For someone who gets most of their money from their wage or salary at \nwork, we can say to those folks, ``Your tax withholding at work can be \nmodified slightly so that it becomes your actual tax liability when it \nis sent to the IRS by your employer. You don't have to worry about \nfiling any tax return.'' No April 15 deadline. No waiting in line at \nthe post office. No getting your records together. You don't have to \nfile an annual tax return. Up to seventy million people, I estimate, \ncould be taken off the tax rolls in this country with the returns that \nare now filed if we used a plan like this. Let me describe the plan to \nyou.\n  The plan would say that if you are a family earning up to $100,000 a \nyear in wages, or a single taxpayer earning up to $50,000 in wages \nannually, and if your other income, that is non-wage income such as \ncapital gains, interest and dividends is less than $5,000 for a couple, \nand $2,500 or less for a single person--then you simply fill out a W-4 \nform, as you now do at your place of employment. On your W-4 form, we \nwill make a couple of other check marks. You change it very little. \nThere\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nwill be a couple of additional check marks--one for child credit and \nthe second for home ownership.\n  When you complete that W-4 form at work, if you choose the option of \nusing the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan, then you don't have to \nfile a federal income tax return. Your employer, working from a table \nprepared by the IRS, will determine what your withholding is. When your \nemployer sends in that withholding to the IRS that is your exact tax \nliability, no tax return is needed.\n  Up to 70 million Americans would be able to do that easily, quickly, \nwith no tax return filed and no records to be gathered. In addition, up \nto $5,000 in other income would be exempt from taxation because you are \nnot trying to trace every nickel and track down every dime of some \nother income stream in order to have withholding from it.\n\n  It is a wonderful incentive at that point because there is an \nincentive for interest and capital gains at the bottom that is \nnontaxable. The incentive for the rest of your wage income is to say \nthat you are going to pay taxes at a 15% after claiming several \nimportant deductions. And you are not going to have to file a tax \nreturn. The W-4 is modified slightly so that you are still able to get \ncredit for home ownership and a deduction for interest payments on a \nhome mortgage.\n  All of that can be done today. It can be done in Congress now. It is \nnot complicated. Some 30 countries have some modified approach to this \nno-return filing system.\n  Is it as aggressive as some saying, ``Let's just get rid of the \nentire Code?'' No, it is not. In fact, my plan would say every taxpayer \nhas the choice. The choice is do you want to use the Fair and Simple \nShortcut Tax plan and not file a return or they can say, ``I really \ndon't want to do this. I fit the income requirements, but I don't want \nto do it. I prefer to file a return every year. I prefer to go \nsearching for my records. I prefer to wait at the post office because I \nenjoy that. I just prefer to do it the hard way. I prefer the current \nsystem.''\n  I don't think many would do that, but my point is this would be a \nchoice for most taxpayers. However, those who do not fit in this system \nwould file, as they do now, under the current system. I would make some \nchanges to help simplify things for them too.\n  I would eliminate, for a fairly sizable part of the population, the \nalternative minimum tax calculations which have become very complicated \nand were never intended to harness a bunch of taxpayers who are making \n$80,000 or $150,000. The alternative minimum tax calculations were \ndesigned to try to get the largest enterprises in the country that were \nmaking tens of millions of dollars and paying nothing, to start \nbecoming taxpayers once again.\n  I also propose for those who want to use the old system that they get \na tax credit to help offset the cost of tax preparation. Businesses \nwould get a tax credit to offset the cost of preparing the W-4 forms. \nThere would be almost no added cost here for businesses, but I would \nprovide some incentive for them.\n  Again, this is an approach that can be done, and it can be done \nquickly and easily. This Congress could embrace it. It is the only plan \nthat I am aware of that really relates to honest simplification of the \nTax Code. Taking 70 million people out of the loop of having to file an \nannual income tax return is a huge step forward toward simplification.\n  I hope, Mr. President, as we begin talking about what we do about \nthis frightful complexity in the Tax Code, that we will decide as a \nSenate and a Congress that this is a plan that we can embrace.\n  William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute says:\n\n       Roughly half of the U.S. taxpayers could be placed on a no-\n     return system with relatively minor changes in the tax \n     laws.''\n\n  A no-income-tax-return system.\n  The GAO says:\n\n       No-return systems are proven. More than 30 countries, \n     including Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom use some \n     form of the no-return system.\n\n  I hope that some of my colleagues will join me as I begin to discuss \nsome of these issues in the context of tax reform in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I have a couple of other items that I wish to discuss \ntoday briefly. There was a substantial amount of discussion this \nmorning about a range of issues, most of them dealing with taxation. I \njust wanted to cover a couple of other items--one, that I have spent a \nlot of time talking about on the floor of the Senate, but then I want \nto talk about the larger agenda issues those of us on this side of the \npolitical aisle in the Senate want to see brought to the Senate for \ndebate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4137-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OUR TRADE POLICY WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I noticed that China decided recently that it is going to \nban direct marketing in China. That means that Amway, Avon, Mary Kay \nCorporation and similar companies are told they cannot any longer \ndirect market. Apparently, some scams were going on in China--not by \nthese companies, mind you--that was causing some problems, so China \njust said no more direct marketing in this country.\n  Our trade ambassador, Charlene Barshefsky, immediately went into \naction and met with China's Minister, Wu Yi, on Friday to discuss the \nissue. And that is fine. I do not know much about Mary Kay, Avon or \nAmway, but they are aggrieved. They are legitimate businesses, but \nChina has banned them. They ought to be able to do business in China. I \nthink it is fine for the trade ambassador to jump in and say, ``Why \ndon't you own up to our trade agreements here and let these people \nmarket?''\n  But I just ask this: Could we be as aggressive on behalf of wheat and \nmeat as we are on behalf of cosmetics? Could we be as aggressive on \nbehalf of farmers who cannot get enough wheat into China?\n  We have been dealing with China for a decade on this thing called TCK \nsmut. China, for example, has displaced America as the major wheat \nsupplier to China, even as they send us all their shirts and shoes and \ntrousers and trinkets. And they have ratcheted up this huge trade \nsurplus with us, but we cannot get enough wheat into China. We cannot \nget enough meat into China. We can't get hardly any pork into China. We \ncan't get enough beef or chicken into China.\n  I say to our trade representatives, that is fine. You be aggressive \nabout cosmetics and you be aggressive about direct selling, but why \ndon't you also start being as aggressive for wheat and meat? Why don't \nyou be aggressive on behalf of individual American farmers who all \nacross this country discover they cannot get their products into a \ncountry, China, that is ratcheting up a huge trade surplus with us?\n  We have become an unbelievable cash cow for China's hard currency \nneeds. Shame on us for a trade policy that allows that. I just ask the \ntrade ambassador, get busy. Get aggressive. It is fine that you care \nabout Amway, Mary Kay, Avon, and other direct sellers. But get busy on \nbehalf of those who get up at sunrise and do chores, who plow fields, \nwho produce wheat and meat and want to get that into China as well.\n  Mr. President, that was therapeutic to say on a Friday anyway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4139-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4139-S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me talk about one last point, and that is the agenda \nof the Senate. The fact is, I come from a side of the political aisle \nin the Senate that does not control the agenda. The reason why is \nbecause we lost the election. The other side has more people, they \nelect the majority leader, and the majority leader decides the agenda \nof the Senate. I am not complaining about that. That is the way the \nSenate works and that is what the rules are.\n\n  But we being a minority still have an agenda, and we still have \ncertain rules in this Senate to work with to try to make certain our \nagenda is also considered. I want to mention just for a moment a couple \nof points in that agenda. I started out by discussing the Patients' \nBill of Rights and the issue of health care quality in this country. We \nintend to see that there is a vote on managed care reform, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, in this Congress.\n  We also fully intend to see that a tobacco bill is brought up, and I \nthink the majority leader now is going to a tobacco bill for \nconsideration. We must as a country decide that this country will no \nlonger countenance tobacco\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\ncompanies targeting kids. You cannot addict 30-year-olds. Who reaches \nage 30 and says, ``What can I do to improve my life?'' and comes up \nwith the answer of smoking? The tobacco companies addict kids. They get \nkids when they are 14, 15, 16 years old and addict them to nicotine. \nThose are the new customers for tobacco. By age 30, you know tobacco \ncauses cancer and heart disease and a whole range of enormous health \nproblems that threaten the American people. So almost nobody who is not \naddicted to nicotine by age 30 discovers that they could improve their \nlife by starting to smoke.\n  We must decide that we will not any longer in this country allow \ntobacco to target kids. The tobacco industry does not have that right. \nWe have written a piece of tobacco legislation in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee under the leadership of Senator McCain. It is a good piece of \nlegislation. It is not perfect. I voted for it. I proposed some changes \nto it during the Committee's consideration, and I will propose some \nchanges on the floor of the Senate as well. But overall it is a good \npiece of legislation.\n  Senator McCain should be commended for his leadership. And the \nproduct of his leadership will be brought to the floor of the Senate. \nWe need a wide open debate on that. This Congress must pass a tobacco \nbill. And we ought to do it soon.\n  We did just discuss education on the floor of the Senate and, \nfrankly, many of us are dissatisfied. Obviously, we did not get what we \nwanted from that debate. The way that debate was structured, we had 30 \nminutes on this side of the aisle--30 minutes--to discuss an issue of \nsubstantial national importance, and that is the decay of America's \nschool infrastructure.\n  We proposed that the Federal Government just provide some help with \nrespect to the interest costs on bonds that are used to build or \nmodernize new schools. That is a significant priority, in my judgment. \nYet the Senate said no, the priority should be to give tax subsidies, \nthe bulk of which will go to kids who go to private schools.\n  Last Sunday, I was in Fort Yates, ND, on the Standing Rock Indian \nReservation, at the Bureau of Indian Affairs school there. The \nelementary school has roughly 150 students, but it is closed now. If \nyou go into the school building, you will see there is no carpeting, \nand the ceiling tiles have been removed. The lights were leaking PCBs, \nwhich is a carcinogen. And all the kids had to be removed from the \nschool. That was February 13. The kids--these are mostly Indian \nchildren--are going to school in a gymnasium. The air is stale in this \ngymnasium, and there is no air-conditioning or ventilation that moves \nthe air around.\n  They have created classrooms by putting in big, make-shift plywood \ndividers that are not anchored to the floor. You just touch the \ndividers and they go back and forth. In some cases, the children are \nsitting on the bleachers and trying to do their classwork. And the \nnoise from the 100-some kids in this gymnasium creates just a din. And \nthat has been the quality of their education since February 13.\n  And so one can talk about whether the condition of our schools \nmatters. The school I just spoke of happens to be a BIA school. It is \nthe responsibility of this Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \nIt is not the responsibility of some local school district. It is our \nresponsibility.\n  Up the road 45 miles, I was in a school that I have mentioned a \ncouple of times, the Cannon Ball Elementary School. This is a public \nschool, although it happens to be on an Indian reservation as well. \nNobody here in this Chamber would want to send their children to that \nschool. There are 140 kids, plus teachers and staff, and only two \nbathrooms and one water fountain in the school. Part of the school is \n90 years old and has been condemned. The choir room, which is a former \njanitor's closet, has to be abandoned once or twice a week because \nsewer gas seeps in and they cannot continue to have kids in that room. \nNobody here would say that would be a good place to have their children \nattend school. It is a public school, but it does not have any money \nbecause its tax base is so poor.\n  So what do school officials do when large parts of the school has \nbeen condemned, kids are crammed into a classroom 12 foot by 8 foot, \nwith not 1 inch between their desks because it is so crowded, and with \ntwice as many kids scheduled to go into that classroom the next year? \nWhat they will do is split that class up, and they will put them in a \nbig, open room. One teacher will teach two classes at the same time, \ngoing back and forth between the two groups of kids.\n  And you can say, well, school construction is not important or it is \nsomebody else's job. That school district does not have the capability \never to build a new school on its own because it simply does not have \nthe tax base to support a bonding initiative. The cost of building a \nnew school of the size that is needed is about $2.5 million. Yet the \nmaximum bonding capacity of that school district, because it is on \nIndian land and its tax base is so small, is only $750,000.\n  So 140 children--mostly Indian children--will continue to go to a \nschool that none of us would want our kids to attend unless we do \nsomething to help them. The teachers at the school there are wonderful. \nThe administrator is a wonderful man. They do a terrific job under \ntough circumstances. But those kids deserve better than that. When \nthose kids walk through that schoolroom door, they deserve better than \nthat.\n\n  A little second grader named Rosie Two Bears asked me when I was in \nthe classroom, she said, ``Mr. Senator, will you buy me a new school?'' \nWell, I can't buy her a new school, but part of the debate about the \neducation agenda ought to be is school construction important and is \nthis a national problem and is there something we can do, at least at \nthe margin, to say this is a priority? Is it a higher priority than \ngiving a tax credit to somebody who wants to send their child to a \nprivate school? I think so. At least it ought to be, but we only had 30 \nminutes to make that case. And we didn't have the votes, unfortunately, \nto prevail on that amendment.\n  Our point is that we have an agenda that relates to the center of \nwhat most people are concerned about and we want that agenda considered \nby the Senate. Most people are in their homes in the evening and \ntalking at the dinner table. They are asking themselves pretty routine \nquestions about life. How did the job go today, how is your job, do you \nhave a job that pays well, has decent security? Do you have benefits? \nSo how is the job? Or how about health care? Do grandpa and grandma \nhave access to health care? How about the kids; do they have access to \nhealth care? What about the neighborhood; is it safe? Are the streets \nsafe to walk in?\n  Jobs and health care and education. What about our kids? Are they \ngoing to good schools? Are we proud in the morning when we send them \noff to schools? Those are the central issues--schools, health care, \njobs, safety and security, crime. Those are the central issues that we \nmust debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  We have developed an agenda under the leadership of Senator Daschle \nand many others in our caucus. We don't believe we have the exclusive \nideas that represent all the best ideas or the only ideas. We \nunderstand there are plenty of other people in this Chamber that have \nideas of their own, some of which might fit better than the ideas we \nhave, but we believe that the topics I just discussed are the central \ntopics that relate to how most people live every day, and most of the \nconditions they have every day, and we very much want to see all of \nthese topics --the agenda that the Republicans have and the agenda that \nthe Democrats have--brought to the floor of the Senate for a full \ndebate and have the American people weigh in on that discussion and \ntell us what they think is important.\n  As we continue holding hearings and developing the agenda here in the \nCongress, I hope that agenda brought to the floor of the Senate will \nreflect the agenda we think is important. I say again, we fully intend \nto pursue this agenda with great vigor. For those who now suggest that \nthey will keep it off the floor of the Senate--managed care reform, for \nexample--I say to them we will be awfully annoying for a long time \nbecause we insist it come to the floor.\n  Let me make another point that I think will represent a significant \narea of priority debate in this Congress, and that is there are these \nfolks who stand\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nup at the desks in the Senate and the House of Representatives and talk \nabout the surplus, what we should do with the surplus. In fact, some \nare talking about how large a tax cut they can give this year to deal \nwith the budget surplus. There is no budget surplus. There isn't a \nbudget surplus. We have made wonderful progress in wrestling the budget \ndeficit to the ground, but there is not a budget surplus unless you \nsave the Social Security revenues for the purpose they were intended to \nbe saved for.\n  I say to all of those who are rushing to embrace their favorite tax \ncut plan, President Clinton said it in the State of the Union Address, \nand we still believe it, save Social Security first. When people, from \ntheir paychecks, make a payment to the Social Security trust fund in \nthe form of a tax that is dedicated to be used only for one purpose, do \nnot misuse it. Don't use it as other revenue. Don't count it as part of \nyour budget calculation. Save it in the trust fund and save Social \nSecurity first. That is the responsibility of this Congress.\n  All of those folks who have ideas either to provide tax breaks or to \nspend the money that doesn't exist, I say to them you have and we have \na responsibility to save Social Security first. When we get to a budget \ndebate on a budget conference report, we will once again, I assume, \nhave that kind of contest about what ought to be done with respect to \nthis budget.\n  I say as emphatically as I can, you do not have a budget surplus \nuntil you have made whole the Social Security funds and kept the \npromise to the American people to save Social Security first.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/01/senate-section/article/S4139-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
